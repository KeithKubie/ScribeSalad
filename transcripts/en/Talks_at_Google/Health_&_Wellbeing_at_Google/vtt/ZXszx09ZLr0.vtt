00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.020
DIANE SHADER SMITH:
It was 1995 when

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.070
the call came from the
genetic counselor telling me

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.500
that our daughter, Mallory,
had cystic fibrosis.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.440
It would take a few
minutes before I

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.170
came to understand that the
wailing noises that I was

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.630
hearing were coming from me.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.140
At the time, Mallory was three.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.440
Soon after, we sat
with a CF specialist

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.689
who described what life
would be like for Mallory

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.010
moving forward--

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.340
the machines she would need,
the medicines she would take,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.620
the limitations she would face.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.400
He calmly told us that the
lifespan for kids with CF

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.050
had changed from five to 25,
and he expected that trajectory

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.200
to get even longer.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.850
With that one sentence, he
introduced our new normal--

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.740
a childhood with
an expiration date.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.950
As I sat there bawling my
eyes out, I turned to him

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.349
and asked, how do you deal with
hysterical parents and very,

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.460
very sick children?

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.620
His answer provided a lot
of perspective for me.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.000
He said that during
his career he

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.183
often treated kids who had been
beaten, burned, or abandoned,

00:01:17.183 --> 00:01:18.600
and that he looked
around the room

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.140
and saw Mallory filled with
love and happiness, surrounded

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.180
by her parents and
her grandparents,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.840
and he reassured me that
she would live a happy life.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.470
Before Mallory's diagnosis,
she had a lot of symptoms--

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.770
a persistent cough,
a chronic runny nose,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.280
a massive bowel movements,
the first indication

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.130
that gastrointestinal
problems would plague her

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.490
for the rest of her life.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.030
Once Mallory started
the CF protocol,

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.620
it was hard to get
her to do treatments.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.810
But the treatments
actually helped

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.030
and the symptoms were abated.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.230
Specifically what she had to
do was inhale a bronchodilator,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.370
use mucus thinners, and have
chest percussion therapy,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.317
like this, to dislodge the
mucus from her chest wall.

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:11.150
Every night, when it
was time for treatment,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.420
Mallory would hide.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.550
She hated it.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.250
In the closet, under
the bed, anywhere she

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.470
thought we wouldn't find her.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.250
So Mark made up a game
called Astronaut and Pat Pat,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.760
Astronaut for the machine
and the swirling medicines,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.760
and Pat Pat for the
chest percussion therapy.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.590
At the time, I was
desperate for a way

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.520
to explain the disease to
Mallory, to her brother, Micah,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.380
and to all of our community.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.770
There was no book for
kids with CF back then,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.600
and I wanted everyone
to understand

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.810
why she had to do treatment,
why she had to take pills,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.630
and wine she was often
absent from school.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.150
It was terrifying
to me, so I assumed

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.440
it would be terrifying to her.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.840
What I did was write
a children's book

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.220
called "Mallory's 65 Roses."

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.190
65 roses is what kids hear when
adults say cystic fibrosis.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.320
We read it to her
class every September,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.270
I gave it out to
all her friends,

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.760
and I sent it with her
when she went to camp.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.840
And it worked.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.353
Mallory led a pretty
normal childhood.

00:03:15.353 --> 00:03:16.770
Through the years,
I would give it

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.510
to the boys she
would date because it

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.240
was a really simple
explanation for what it was

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.130
that Mallory had to deal with.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.670
Mallory's classmates and
her friends read the book

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.040
and treated her,
throughout her childhood,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.570
as if she were a regular kid.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.970
And she got to play
sports, go to school,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.640
and have a very happy childhood.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.370
During the years,
Mallory's medical teams

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.780
became a huge part of our lives.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.270
We were lucky to have the best
of the best at Cedars, UCLA,

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.270
Stanford, and UPMC.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.090
The most perceptive
doctors recognized

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.200
Mallory's uncanny ability
to understand and articulate

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.830
what she was dealing with
and what she had to do.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.980
And then what they did
was they used her insights

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.230
to provide her with better care.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.910
Because she was so compliant,
so sweet, and so thoroughly

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.100
understanding, the
doctors often asked

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.870
if medical students
and residents

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.029
could come to her room
for bedside training.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.010
Mallory always said yes.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.900
She was always engaged.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.840
They called her the poster
child for compliance,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.680
and they always loved her.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.160
They did not always love me.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.100
I was the bad cop to
Mallory's good cop.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.070
My job was to protect her even
when it made me unpopular.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.430
I was known to do a number of
different things, one of them,

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.090
block the door to any person
trying to enter before 6 AM

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.890
that wasn't an urgent matter.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.950
For example, somebody coming
to take out the trash,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.380
or a nursing assistant
wanting to write daily goals

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.490
on the whiteboard, or
sometimes a phlebotomist

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.680
wanted to come draw
routine labs, that

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.650
had already been drawn
the night before, at 5 AM.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.590
Sometimes it was
a medical student,

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.690
very eager to please
the attending,

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.030
and really just wanted to
interview Mallory, which

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.130
we always said yes
to after 10:00 AM

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.220
but I said no to at 5:00 AM.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.110
It's different
when someone comes

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.150
into the hospital for
a one-off procedure

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.550
or they're sick with something
that's just a happenstance.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.100
But when you have
a chronic illness

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.290
and you have repeated
hospitalizations,

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.860
sleep is a very critical
form of medicine,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.760
and sometimes people
seem to forget.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.770
I also would sneak Mallory
out of the hospital

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.560
for long walks, and one
time, arranged for somebody

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.620
to pick her up and take her
to a football game for three

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.500
hours between her treatments,
and then I sat by the door

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.320
and pretended that she was
taking a nap and blocking it.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.030
You can imagine how they felt
about me when they found out.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.130
I also insisted that
Mallory keep enzymes

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.280
by the bedside, which the
pharmacy wanted to control,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.950
because it's a medicine she
takes every single day at home

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.370
on her own.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.790
And if you don't have your
enzymes, you can't eat.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.107
Friends would drop by with
ice cream that would melt.

00:06:07.107 --> 00:06:09.440
A nurse might be in the next
room with a coding patient,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.930
and it would not be appropriate
for me to be demanding

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.220
that she get her pills.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.110
And yet I wanted to
make sure that she

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.040
was able to live a normal
life and be with her friends.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.080
I pushed for faster
response times

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.870
when delays put me at risk.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.870
Now through all this, I was
supported by my husband, Mark,

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.140
who was normally a very
kind and patient man.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.180
His job was to fight
the insurance companies

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.480
to get approvals, to research
better treatment options,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.220
and to sleep
bedside in a blow up

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.460
bed to make sure Mallory
was never alone at night.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.190
Usually kind and
patient, as I mentioned,

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.090
Mark refused to tolerate errors
or mistakes, which sometimes

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.460
made him unpopular too.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.100
Now all of this leads to the
first of Mallory's insights

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.150
I'm going to share today, and
there will be six in total.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.780
Parents play an important
role in treating a child

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.890
with chronic illness.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.650
Now, that seems like
an obvious, right?

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.240
Duh.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.450
But what you'll find out, if you
haven't already experienced it,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.180
is that sometimes,
when parents advocate

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.250
on behalf of their
child, it puts them

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.820
at odds with both the
system or with the doctors,

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.380
and it leads to conflict.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.270
Anybody who lives in
this world will tell you

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.890
that the best
collaborations come

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.660
when doctors, parents, and
patients collaborate together.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.690
When Mallory was 12,
life changed again.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.760
We got the call saying
that her lungs had

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.910
been colonized by the
normally harmless bacteria

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.500
called B. cepacia.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.740
When patients with CF get
cepacia, one of three things

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.520
happens.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.120
The first is it turns into
a very serious illness

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.290
and the patient dies right away.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.620
The second, there's a
peaceful coexistence

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.740
and somehow it doesn't seem
to bother the patient with CF.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.580
In the third case, it can
be a long, slow progression

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.340
of disease that results
in death about 10 years

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.560
after the initial colonization.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.840
We tried to explain to
Mallory and to Micah

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.060
that things would become
a lot more difficult.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.000
This is Mallory's
brother, Micah,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.940
who always was there for
her, gave her a big hug,

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.635
and said not to worry, that
he would always have her back.

00:08:17.635 --> 00:08:19.760
Mallory, on the other hand,
understood the severity

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.130
and turned to Mark and
said, am I going to die?

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.700
Mark and I chose to be
honest but optimistic,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.490
pragmatic but hopeful.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.440
I adopted a mantra,
"No pity party."

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.830
The goal was to find
the joy in every day.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.807
Mallory adopted her own mantra,
which was, "Live happy."

00:08:40.807 --> 00:08:42.890
Now I want to tell you a
little bit about Mallory.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.940
She was always loving,
determined, and focused.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.230
She was tall, beautiful, and had
the longest, most perfect legs

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.300
you could ever imagine.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.160
After she turned
13, there was really

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.590
never a time that some
boy was not after her.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.550
She was valedictorian of her
high school, a three sport

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.440
varsity athlete, and prom queen.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.740
She went on to Stanford and
graduated Phi Theta Kappa,

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.870
while playing club
volleyball and participating

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.780
in a lot of other
extracurricular activities.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.270
She always had friends
because she was fun-loving,

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.340
compassionate, and kind.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.460
After college, Mallory
returned to Los Angeles

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.590
and moved to Manhattan
Beach with friends,

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.780
where she was
surfing, socializing,

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.100
and working as a writer.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.790
She threw herself into research
and wrote "The Gottlieb Native

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.640
Garden, a California
Love Story."

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.190
The book was covered by AP and
got tremendous press coverage.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.290
It was the publication
of that book

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.640
that enabled Mallory to envision
life as a writer, a career that

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.830
would be both flexible
and fulfilling,

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.070
which was important because
her deep passion was

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.580
environmental education,
and everybody told her

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.300
that if she worked in the field,
it would expose her and put her

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.930
at additional risk.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.810
But sadly, a few months
after living there,

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.910
cepacia reared its
ugly head again

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.070
and Mallory took a
turn for the worse,

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:14.090
ending up in the hospital
for long stretches of time.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.160
While Mallory's
friends were grappling

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.340
with normal,
post-college questions,

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.070
Mallory had to deal with things
like IVs and indignities.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:23.570
Two

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.480
Examples-- having
to use a bedside

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.410
commode to go to the bathroom
in a glass-walled ICU room

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.715
when nurses were sometimes
too busy to draw the curtain.

00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:36.840
Sometimes they would come
in and they would ask her

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.360
about her bowel habits in front
of some new boy she had just

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.490
started dating.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.760
It was horrifying to her.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.790
During this period, she
was also in a lot of pain.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.270
The opioid epidemic has thrown
traditional pain protocols

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.670
into question and has left
many patients suffering.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.820
This was Mallory's
experience, and she

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.250
writes about being victimized.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.410
During one
hospitalization, Mallory

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.510
told the pain
management team that she

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.780
was suffering severe pleurisy,
which is when the infection is

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.488
pressed up against the lung wall
and causes excruciating pain.

00:11:11.488 --> 00:11:13.530
The dose they had given
her wasn't even beginning

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.660
to address it, and when she
asked her more, they refused,

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.040
saying they didn't want her
to turn into an opioid addict

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.920
and become ineligible
for transplant.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.370
At the time, Mallory wasn't
even listed for transplant,

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.700
and because of the cepacia,
which is considered a superbug,

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.030
we weren't sure she
would ever be listed.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.610
Mallory felt their
unresponsiveness to her pain

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.400
was equivalent to torture.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.830
They also cited the fact
that another CF patient

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.900
down the hall had
become addicted

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.870
and was now not able
to get a transplant.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.390
Mallory asked her CF
team to intervene.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.280
She explained that she did
not have an addiction issue,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.240
and she really just needed
better pain management.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.220
They intervened,
and she was finally

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.350
able to get some relief.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.290
The same scenario played
out again after transplant

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.320
when they had cut her chest
open, taken out her old lungs,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.290
sewed in new lungs, and
expected her to survive

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.540
on a minimal pain dose.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.970
It would take days and
days of horrible pain

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.920
and suffering and
screaming before they

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.170
came to understand
that they had woefully

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.500
under-treated her pain.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.500
Now the interesting thing is
that, at a different point

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.470
in her journal, Mallory
writes about her own fears

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.520
of getting addicted.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.810
This is a quote.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.400
"I never thought
I would say this,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.980
but I have come to love the
feeling of being on opioids.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.870
It was never part
of my treatment,

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.140
but as my chest pain
became unbearable,

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.090
I needed it to breathe.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.370
It also helped with my mood.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.220
With morphine and with
oxy, there is no pain

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.350
and there is no sadness."

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.580
These anecdotes lead to insight
number two, fear of addiction

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.650
must be better
balanced with need when

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.940
it comes to pain management.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.450
Mallory wanted to be part of an
industry-wide conversation that

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.560
would address both the
opioid epidemic and the very

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.220
well-documented overreaction
of well-meaning doctors

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.760
and nurses who, in their attempt
to save patients from becoming

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.420
addicts, under-treat pain.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.470
In this era of
personalized medicine,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.850
there is no room for one
size fits all solutions.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.310
Advocating for better
pain management

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.750
is part of Malory's
unfinished work

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.090
and part of her unfinished life.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.030
As Mallory's health
continued to decline,

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.250
her Stanford doctors
asked her to move back

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.490
up north so they could get
a better handle on her care.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.310
They felt that the team at
UCLA, while stellar transplant

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.830
doctors and having
a great CF clinic,

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.640
didn't really
understand cepacia.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.450
For a few magical months Mallory
stayed out of the hospital.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.290
She went to yoga, hung out with
friends, and took long walks.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.720
It was this amazing
phenomenon and it

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.050
seemed as though there had
been a dramatic quick flip

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.510
of the switch.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:03.080
Now during this time,
Mallory looked so healthy

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.140
that people didn't realize what
it was she was dealing with--

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.290
67 hospitalizations
up to that point

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:15.140
that had ranged from weeks to
months, losing friends with CF,

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.390
her struggle to
prioritize her health

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.310
while still trying to
keep up with her friends,

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:21.890
the many hours
every day that she

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.070
had to do treatment,
the anxiety of burdening

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.200
the people that
she loved the most,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.060
and her forced
contemplation of death.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.480
It wasn't until Mallory
left for college

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.690
that she actually ever had to
think about how to tell people

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.030
about her invisible illness.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.160
But dorm living has
a way of establishing

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.830
immediate intimacy, and
word spread quickly,

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.220
which relieved her of the
burden of having to disclose.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.560
But after college,
the issue came up

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.340
with Jack, her real
life Prince Charming.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.070
Mallory met Jack
on New Year's Eve.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.920
She had just gotten out of
the hospital and was on IVs.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.680
She thought Jack was
super cute and very nice,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.530
but he lived in Palo
Alto and she lived in LA,

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.690
and she knew that with
her health condition

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.160
she could not manage a
long distance relationship.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.520
So she never really gave
him a second thought.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.710
But months later, when Malory
did move back up north,

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.800
they re-met at a party.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.600
They were playing
a game together

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.500
when she felt a bout of
hemoptysis coming on.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.910
Hemopytsis is when
you cough up blood,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:29.020
and it can be a 911
deadly emergency.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.300
When she came out
of the bathroom,

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.530
Jack expressed concern, which
leads to insight number three.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.260
It's sometimes difficult
to know when to disclose

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.240
an invisible illness.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.990
Mallory often said that
the issue of disclosure

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.270
was one of the hardest
things about having

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.680
an invisible illness.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.900
She worried about
burdening new friends,

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.840
and worried about scaring
off potential employers.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.060
And in one very
specific example,

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.100
Mallory applied
for a writing job,

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.650
spent two weeks
perfecting her samples,

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:03.100
turned them in, was told
they were fantastic,

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.710
was offered a job,
and when she told me

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.360
she was going to
start the next week,

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.610
I told her that
she needed to let

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.930
them know that she had a
disease that might render her

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.700
unable to come into the office.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.320
When she told them, suddenly
it wasn't a good fit

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.800
and the offer was reneged.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.710
Mallory also feared that no
man would love her enough

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.850
to accept the complications
of her disease,

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.860
so she often wrestled
with the decision

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.860
about whether or not to tell
the people that she was dating.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.680
But with Jack, she felt that
there was something special

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.190
and she wanted him
to know right away.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.830
She did come to the
conclusion that, in terms

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.800
of right and wrong, there
isn't really a correct answer.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.640
But with Jack, because
she felt something,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.040
she wanted him to know
right from the start what

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.890
he was getting into,
and she asked herself,

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.170
is this man who's
there for me when

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.000
I'm laughing and partying
going to be there for me when

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.875
I'm sick and sedated?

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.319
It was a good thing that
Mallory told Jack right away,

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.420
because very soon after, she
ended up back in the hospital,

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.390
and it the first of many
more admissions to come.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.280
Over the next few
months, the antibiotics

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.680
seemed to stop
working and Mallory

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.569
was inching closer
to the time when

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:21.560
she would need a transplant.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.040
The only center in the
country that would accept her,

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.230
because of the
cepacia, was University

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.620
of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, UPMC.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.770
They asked us to come in
for a week-long evaluation,

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.840
and when we said,
great, anytime,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.750
tell us when, they explained
that the difficulty would

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.285
be getting our insurance
company to say yes.

00:17:42.285 --> 00:17:44.160
And I said, that's not
going to be a problem.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.040
Mark went to Harvard.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:45.870
He's a lawyer.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:46.710
I'm a publicist.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.360
I'll go on the Today Show
if they try to deny it.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.130
But guess what?

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.810
They said no.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.990
Getting insurance approval for
an out-of-state, out-of-network

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:59.710
hospital was the single
hardest and most excruciating

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:03.360
non-medical challenge
that we faced.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.460
The battle raged on for weeks.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.950
They employed multiple stall
tactics that Mallory felt

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.980
were intended to run the
clock out on her life.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.150
It would absolutely take a
miracle to turn no into yes.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.130
But in Mallory's
case, the miracle

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.760
came in the form of a very
close friend with connections

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.900
to the highest level of
insurance company's management.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.660
Mallory knew she was
incredibly lucky,

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.170
but she understood that
not everybody would be.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.740
She documents this journey
in "Salt in my Soul"

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.710
because she wants others to
see exactly what happened

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.370
and how she attempted
to resolve it.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.740
Insurance companies
often inflict

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.530
needless additional suffering
on patients who are already

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.990
in pain and already at stress.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.380
It's outrageous and
incomprehensible,

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.880
which leads to insight number
four, that doctors, not

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.340
insurance company or
insurance company doctors,

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.850
should decide who gets
care and where they get it,

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.150
and what coverage is allowed.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.452
Mallory and I spent a
grueling week in Pittsburgh,

00:19:08.452 --> 00:19:10.410
and the reason I say
grueling is that, in order

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.142
to be accepted for
transplant, you

00:19:12.142 --> 00:19:14.100
have to meet with a number
of different teams--

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.700
surgeons, case managers,
financial advisors,

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.960
pharmacists.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.100
The list goes on and on.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.740
They want to make sure you
are physically strong enough,

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.240
emotionally strong
enough, that you

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.860
have the financial
resources to be

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.742
able to cover the expenses
that will inevitably come up,

00:19:28.742 --> 00:19:31.200
and they want to make sure that
you have two support-givers

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.180
with you at all times.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.700
We left Pittsburgh after that
week on pins and needles,

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.670
but hopeful, because they
seem pretty optimistic,

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:44.470
and on Mallory's 24th
birthday, October 12th of 2016,

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.410
the call came in saying
that UPMC was accepting her

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.610
for transplant.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.190
But at that point, they said
she was too healthy to come,

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.750
which was quite
amazing considering

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.190
how sick she'd been.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.950
But of course, shortly after
that, as it always happened,

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.920
she got mono and the flu
and ended up very sick,

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.350
back at UCLA Hospital-- we
brought her home to make sure

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.120
we could provide full support--

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.140
while we were waiting for them
to tell us it was time to come.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.110
During that period, she got
so sick that at one point,

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.000
UPMC said it might
not make sense

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.820
to come if you're just
going to come here to die.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.727
So we had to wait until
she was physically stable,

00:20:18.727 --> 00:20:20.560
and then we could get
her across the country

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.150
for this grueling move.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.700
Eventually, in February,
the call came on a Monday

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.490
with instructions to
be in clinic on Friday,

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.930
and to fly on Thursday.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.780
So we had two days
to pack everything up

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.180
and say goodbye to the
people that she knew

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.010
she might not come back to.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.040
She was most sad about
leaving her dog, Kona,

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.450
who was too big to
make the trip with us.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.810
After a lot of upheaval, we
hunkered down in Pittsburgh

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.490
waiting for the call.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.520
To a patient with end-stage
lung disease that's

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.790
listed for transplant, the
single most important thing

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.340
to do is wait for that call.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.920
You can't go to the
movies, take a shower,

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.277
sleep through the night,
do anything without having

00:21:02.277 --> 00:21:04.360
your phone tethered to you
because you cannot miss

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.440
a single call.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.610
But what happens is, the
heightened vigilance starts

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.520
to give way to hopelessness
as days and weeks pass

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.830
and you start to think
the call will never come,

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.830
or if it comes, it
will come too late.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.980
During that period, every single
day, I would sing to Mallory,

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.920
"Somewhere over the
rainbow, there are lungs."

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.900
Just the first
line, over and over.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.130
But then in March, we got the
call on a Friday afternoon,

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.680
and we raced to
get to the hospital

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.470
and hunkered down
for a 24-hour wait.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.900
During that time, she
actually made it into preop,

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.840
had a lot of tests done, and
we were cautiously optimistic

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.850
that it was going to work.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.370
But the next
morning, they came in

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.290
to tell us that, while
the lungs were viable,

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.690
they had actually gone
to another candidate.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.180
We didn't know that Mallory
was a backup candidate,

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.680
and at the time,
we didn't even know

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.080
that that was actually
a thing, which

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.970
leads to insight number five.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.300
Doctors should err in favor of
giving more information rather

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:08.630
than less, as it helps patients
manage their expectations.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:10.820
In a crazy twist of
fate, the second call

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.650
came 48 hours later.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.510
And again we rushed
to the hospital,

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:18.440
waited about another 24 hours,
but again, it was a no go.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.600
This time there was
no backup candidate,

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.910
but the lungs weren't viable.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.710
This was the second
dry run, and there

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.250
was to be a third,
which came months later

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.340
after Mallory agreed to
accept high risk lungs.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:36.530
High risk lungs are labeled that
when a person has identified

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.770
with one of three behaviors-- a
homosexual, an intravenous drug

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:43.297
user, or someone who has
spent time in prison.

00:22:43.297 --> 00:22:45.380
The interesting thing about
the high risk category

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.140
is that somebody could be
any one of those things

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.350
and not disclose, so you kind
of wonder, should you accept

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.520
or should you not?

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.820
We asked the surgeon and his
answer was actually perfect.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:00.080
Dr. [INAUDIBLE] said, I would
not put any lungs in you

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.730
that I didn't feel comfortable.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:05.850
Your survival is as important
to me as it is to you.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.000
The fourth call was the
one that ended up working.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.460
On September 11 of 2017--

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.920
sort of an inauspicious
date for transplant--

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.210
Mallory finally made it into
the OR, and after nine hours,

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.290
Dr. [INAUDIBLE]
came out and told us

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.060
he was thrilled
with the outcome.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.255
She had done quite well.

00:23:23.255 --> 00:23:24.630
But of course
during this period,

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.900
she had vocal paralysis,
unbearable pain,

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.980
a swallowing disorder,
a list of medications

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.647
that would make your
head spin, and this

00:23:30.647 --> 00:23:32.820
is when we experienced that
second round of the pain

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.410
management problem.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.500
But yet, despite all of
that, to see your daughter

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.780
take her first
breath with new lungs

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.900
and no supplemental oxygen is
a sight that's indescribable.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.360
The rehab for her was
grueling, but a month later,

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.410
on October 12th of
2017, Mallory was home

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.820
celebrating her birthday.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.590
Well, actually her
home in Pittsburgh,

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.540
because we were still there.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.150
During those days,
I would sing to her,

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.760
"Somewhere over the
rainbow, there were lungs,"

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.010
and you'll note the
rainbow on her cake.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.440
It was the very
happiest time as we

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.990
dared to dream about
a new life, one

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.530
that Mallory would spend back
in California, living with Jack,

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.830
surfing, and doing
additional writing.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.320
But a very short
few weeks later,

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.270
Mallory was readmitted
with pneumonia,

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.220
and almost immediately,
the doctors

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.630
started preparing
me for the worst.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.130
Now I'm going to
switch and tell you

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.130
a little bit about
Mallory's journals, which

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.290
end up in "Salt in my
Soul, an Unfinished Life."

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.660
Mallory started writing
when she was 15.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.320
She wrote anywhere she was.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.278
She wrote at tournament's--
sports tournaments.

00:24:40.278 --> 00:24:41.778
She wrote in the
middle of the night

00:24:41.778 --> 00:24:44.450
when she had insomnia, on
trips, at friends' houses,

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.320
when she was doing
treatment in Hawaii.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.850
Writing, for her, was
extremely cathartic.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:55.100
Now during these years, Mallory
and I were joined at the hip.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.780
She confided in me
about everything,

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.610
and I felt lucky to have
those years with her.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:04.248
What I did to help
her also helped me.

00:25:04.248 --> 00:25:06.040
I cooked for her,
cleaned her [INAUDIBLE],,

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.873
picked up her meds,
anything that would give

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:09.290
her more time with her friends.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.990
But in the process,
it gave me a window

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.820
into what her life
was like, something

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.490
most parents of
teenagers don't get.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.372
Her friends were so used to
me being in the background

00:25:18.372 --> 00:25:20.080
that they treated me
like I was furniture

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.510
and I really learned a
lot about my daughter.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.940
I wouldn't trade
that for anything.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.910
But one day, after a very
typical mother-daughter fight,

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.790
Mallory stormed off into
her room, slammed the door,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.190
and started pounding
on her laptop.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.190
From then on, I assumed her
journal was a repository

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.410
for all of her anger at me.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.110
I imagined her detailing
every single thing I had ever

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.070
done wrong as a mother, and
it was a terrifying thought.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.040
I didn't actually read her
journal until she passed away.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.720
She had kept it
password protected,

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.180
and despite my repeated
attempts to break into it,

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.320
was never able to find it.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.270
But the day of her memorial, I
opened it for the first time,

00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.890
hoping to find
something that I could

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.510
use when speaking about her.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.170
What I found was 2,500 pages,
organized chronologically,

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.800
with each entry date stamped,
in electronic journals,

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.990
with zero expression
of anger at me.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.350
It was the most precious
and unexpected gift

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.350
a grieving mother
could expect, and I

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.870
believe that she left
it that way because she

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.540
knew that I would read it.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.170
Mallory was incredibly
articulate and astute,

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.960
and in her journal she
describes so many things

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.090
that are helpful both to
the medical community,

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.360
to other patients, to
health care providers,

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.000
and to those who love
people with chronic illness.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
She highlights big picture
issues that are important,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.300
but she also talks about
how the daily decisions

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:49.460
that each caretaker makes
can impact the day to day

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.830
quality of life for a patient.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.220
That includes doctors, nurses,
respiratory therapists, OT,

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.790
case managers, janitors--
the list goes on and on.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.800
Which leads to my
final insight that I

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.720
will share of hers today.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.670
A life-threatening
illness puts you

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:07.850
at the intersection of so
many public health issues,

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.160
and turns you into
an accidental expert

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.700
about what can and should
be improved in patient care.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.090
I still struggle every day to
accept that Mallory is gone.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:21.760
When she first passed
away, I spent months

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.770
reading and rereading
her journals,

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:27.220
laughing and crying
at every page.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:32.730
The big surprise was that her
journals revealed a darker

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.860
truth about her
experiences and emotions

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.220
that she had not wanted
to share during her life.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.710
Her facade of perfection
was just that.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:43.880
Malory did live happy.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.120
But in her writing
she does express anger

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.690
at her disease, shame about
her body and its failings,

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:53.140
the difficulty of straddling
the sick and the well world,

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.770
her fear of dying.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.830
But along with that,
the importance to her

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.460
of friendship, her
deep desire for love,

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.980
and most heartbreaking
to me, the fact that she

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.380
wanted a child.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.020
It's impossible to capture
Mallory's life in one talk

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.660
or share all of the
insights that she offers.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.700
She was awe-inspiring,
and her memory

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.700
will be forever etched in
the hearts and minds of those

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.210
who loved her, but will now be
also in the hearts and minds

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:22.080
of those who read her work.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.800
Losing Mallory was catastrophic.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.240
There's no other
way to describe it.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.120
But what we've
come to understand

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.460
is that sometimes, a
heartbreaking ending can

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.890
be the beginning of a triumph.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:37.730
Mallory's legacy is in her
wit, her words, and her wisdom,

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.000
the salt in her soul.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.500
Thank you.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.790
So I think now we're going to
invite Jack, the boyfriend, who

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.030
actually writes in the book, and
Mark, the dad and husband, who

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.220
also contributes in
the book, to come up.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.940
And if anybody
has any questions,

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.548
we'd be happy to answer them.

00:28:58.548 --> 00:29:01.090
AUDIENCE: Mallory comes from a
family with a lot of resources

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:03.298
and the ability to do some
pretty incredible things--

00:29:03.298 --> 00:29:05.413
moving around the country,
all the time you were

00:29:05.413 --> 00:29:06.580
able to dedicate, et cetera.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.350
How applicable is
this experience

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.850
to other kinds of
families who don't

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.100
have those kinds of resources?

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.892
DIANE SHADER SMITH:
Well, it's interesting.

00:29:12.892 --> 00:29:15.010
One of the palliative
care social workers

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.530
at Children's Hospital,
whose name is Danielle Jonas,

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.270
told me very early on.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.610
She had come to the hospital
and spent time with Mallory

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.050
and she knew about the writing.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.180
And she said to
me, you absolutely

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.420
must make the story
public because I

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.990
work with under-served families
at Children's Hospital in LA,

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:33.910
and when their child
dies, they actually

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.490
think that their child
died because they

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.080
couldn't provide better
care or better resources.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.080
And the message here is
that you can have money.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.913
You can have access.

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:42.940
You can have privilege.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.880
You can still suffer and
your child can still die.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.350
Mallory suffered.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:50.200
Having access to health care
and the transplant, of course,

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.070
extended her life a little bit.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.410
But at the end of the day,
it didn't change the outcome.

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:57.100
And so hopefully people
will learn from the message,

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.030
don't feel guilty.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:58.750
Don't feel bad.

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.040
Do what you can.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.900
But disease runs its
own course sometimes

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.737
and there's nothing you can do.

00:30:04.737 --> 00:30:06.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for your courage

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:08.040
to share this
story, and I'm just

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.930
amazed how you, as
a mother, held it

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.142
all together in sharing this.

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:13.350
DIANE SHADER SMITH: I have
to fight crying each time.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:14.225
AUDIENCE: Oh my gosh.

00:30:14.225 --> 00:30:19.380
You're amazingly articulate
and your words were beautiful.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.510
I wanted to find
out how you've been

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.750
able to translate all of
this incredible knowledge

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.770
and perspective to
the medical community.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.830
I can imagine you feel
it's your life's desire

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.830
to see change in the system
to better help people

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.870
of the future who
will have to be

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.280
under these horrible
circumstances.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.950
What's happening in
that path for you,

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.590
and have you found any
headway or response

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.143
to this amazing work and
the work that you're doing?

00:30:46.143 --> 00:30:48.810
DIANE SHADER SMITH: So it hasn't
even been three weeks, I think,

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.310
that the book came
out on March 12.

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.890
So I'm sort of at the
beginning of the journey.

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:56.880
I am doing 70 talks, and
more offers are coming in.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:01.465
And so far, I've spoken to
one medical school and a group

00:31:01.465 --> 00:31:03.840
of residents-- a resident's
council on the medical school

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.920
at University of Pennsylvania.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.250
And what I'm hearing
is that the message

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.410
is very important
for them because they

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.512
will learn from an
actual case study,

00:31:13.512 --> 00:31:15.720
in addition to what they're
studying in the textbook.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.660
But I've had offers
from some other

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.400
of the medical
professionals that I'm

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.023
speaking at their institutions
to do some more extensive work,

00:31:24.023 --> 00:31:25.440
and it was suggested,
for example,

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.950
that I work on curriculum.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.850
And I will do that, because
now that Mallory is not

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:33.240
here, all of the energy
and passion and commitment

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.190
that I had to
taking care of her,

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:38.190
I want to translate that
into taking her messages on.

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:40.620
People who've read the
book write to me every day.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.312
It's unbelievable that
it's helping empower them.

00:31:43.312 --> 00:31:44.520
It's helping them understand.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.320
And fortunately, the
press has been amazing,

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.380
so I don't have to
be as braggy as I

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.680
might have to be otherwise.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.340
But it is important, first,
to get the word out there,

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.230
and then to take it
to the next level,

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.810
to try to figure out
which particular area I

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.100
think I'll spend most time on.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:04.770
I know for me, I think that the
surprising thing is that, when

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.915
I first worked on the
journal and thought

00:32:07.915 --> 00:32:09.540
I was going to bring
it to publication,

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.695
that it was going
to be most relevant

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:13.020
and important for the CF
community and the transplant

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:13.530
community.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.450
But what I've sort of
come to understand is,

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.630
people like it in that community
because it sort of gives them

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.430
that feeling of familiarity
and shared experience.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.430
But there are a lot
of other communities

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.070
that I hadn't thought would
be benefited by, for example,

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.630
the mental illness community.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.610
I've done a talk for
the National Alliance

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:31.650
on Mental Illness
in Los Angeles,

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.307
and they explained that all
of the issues about fear,

00:32:34.307 --> 00:32:36.390
depression, and anxiety
that Mallory writes about,

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.970
and the issue of disclosure
and invisible illness

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.270
are so important.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.200
And so I recognize I'm
at sort of the beginning

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.817
of this journey,
and I would love

00:32:44.817 --> 00:32:46.650
you to ask me the
question in the year, when

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.690
I finish most of
the talks, and then

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:50.090
I will be sure to report back.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:51.690
But I will definitely
do something.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.450
I can't imagine
anything more important.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.200
AUDIENCE: What are
some of the things that

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.780
are happening today to help
with this type of outcome?

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.740
What are some of the things that
you're looking at research-wise

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.740
to help patients such as this?

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:10.280
MARK SMITH: Well, some
friends of Mallory

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.050
who collaborated with her
to organize a charity called

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.790
Lunges with Lungs--

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:18.270
and there's a link to
that on the website--

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.630
it raises money for
rejection research, which

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:26.100
is a big problem, obviously,
in transplant cases, not just

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.140
lung transplants but
across the board.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:34.200
And then we're also
working to promote

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.420
an experimental treatment
that Mallory got.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.990
This story is in the book and
in the postscript, especially.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:44.672
It's called phage therapy and
it was kind of a Hail Mary pass

00:33:44.672 --> 00:33:46.380
that we made at the
end of Mallory's life

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:50.370
to see if we could eradicate
the B. cepacia infection

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.140
and save her life.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.780
We did end up getting
phage therapy for Mallory,

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.800
but it was about
a week too late.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.340
And she had a few doses.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.730
The autopsy indicated that
the medicine was working,

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.670
but it was too late
to save her life.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.310
Since she died, interest
in phage therapy

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:17.100
has been reignited, and
a cystic fibrosis patient

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.000
in San Diego with a
nasty pulmonary infection

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.915
was rejected for
transplant, and then

00:34:24.915 --> 00:34:26.790
treated with phage
therapy, and then put back

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.444
on the transplant list.

00:34:29.444 --> 00:34:32.460
And there's other cases
at Yale and in the UK

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:36.270
and one more in Pittsburgh
where they have successfully

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:39.929
used the therapy that we
tried to get for Mallory

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:42.989
and cleared an infection in
a cystic fibrosis patient,

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.290
and we're hopeful that that
will become a standard part

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:47.195
of the treatment.

00:34:47.195 --> 00:34:48.570
DIANE SHADER SMITH:
And we should

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:50.790
mention that we're donating
all profits from the book.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:52.710
We don't want to make
any money from the book.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:55.060
Both Mark and I are full
time working professionals

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.120
and we don't need the
money, and so we're

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.510
using this tour to raise
money and awareness

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:04.950
for phage therapy
because by the year 2050,

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.350
10 million people per year
will die from superbugs,

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.110
and phage therapy will be
relevant and applicable,

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:12.960
not just for patients with CF
or those immunocompromised,

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.980
but everybody who gets
a superbug infection.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.010
And if you don't know
about phage therapy,

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.630
you can read about
the journey that we

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.120
had with it in the book.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.370
You can also Google it online.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.670
It's [INAUDIBLE] use the Google.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.300
You can Google it and you'll
find a lot of information

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:26.800
about it.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.650
It's very important.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.400
That was not an intended
plug, by the way.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.970
I just--

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.380
MARK SMITH: There's also a
link on the web page, which

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:38.760
is SaltInMySoulBook.com, a
link to donate to phage therapy

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.380
or to the rejection research.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.360
DIANE SHADER SMITH:
She has a question.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.110
AUDIENCE: Yes, me.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:44.790
DIANE SHADER SMITH: Microphone.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:48.540
AUDIENCE: So this question
is a life question.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.170
We each know that we don't
know tomorrow is guaranteed

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:55.270
for any one of us or
anyone in our family,

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:58.500
but it seems like there's
always that special gift

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:03.960
of knowing that you have
only a certain amount of time

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.680
with someone.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.130
And I would like to
know, for each of you,

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:12.930
how you dealt with today,
knowing that tomorrow

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.850
was going to come.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:17.652
DIANE SHADER SMITH:
Who wants to start?

00:36:17.652 --> 00:36:18.360
MARK SMITH: Jack.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.460
JACK: Right.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:30.020
So Mallory, because of her
illness, her sense of mortality

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.760
was at the forefront of her
decisions from a young age

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.998
and it affected a lot of
her decisions she made.

00:36:35.998 --> 00:36:37.790
DIANE SHADER SMITH:
Talk slower and louder.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:38.297
JACK: Sure.

00:36:38.297 --> 00:36:39.380
DIANE SHADER SMITH: Sorry.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.370
JACK: So she loved her friends.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:42.620
She loved the environment.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.610
She loved the ocean,
which had a lot of salt

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.000
and it helped her breathe more.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.520
She knew that she
would plant seeds

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.240
that would grow into trees that
would create shade that she

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.830
would never be able to sit in.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:57.800
So that was very clear for her.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.690
Your question is how
did it affect us.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:04.430
I thought that some of the
more challenging moments--

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.290
seeing her through
transplant, seeing

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.290
her go to the brink of
death and come back,

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.590
holding her in our hands when
she passed away together--

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.990
I thought those would
be the harder moments.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.970
But the harder moments
have actually been now.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.530
How do you honor a legacy
that is so extraordinary?

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.280
That's the question I
ask myself routinely

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.310
and it's one that we all
have different answers to,

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:27.500
but it's one we're
still figuring out.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:33.830
She wanted a future that her
desired child, the kid she

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:36.650
hoped for, would be
able to be happy in,

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:41.423
so she was very cognizant of
the world that she left behind.

00:37:41.423 --> 00:37:43.090
DIANE SHADER SMITH:
I would answer that,

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:48.080
and I would say very simply,
Mallory chose to live happy,

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.080
and Mark and I, from the
time she was very young,

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.080
made the decision that we were
not going to live a pity party,

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.110
and that, however short her time
was, it would be a lot of fun.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:00.920
And we had a magnificent and
amazing 25 years with her.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.900
I would not trade
it for anything.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.510
And I do believe that
Mallory accomplished

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:09.350
and did as much in 25 years as
many people do in a lifetime.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:10.520
It just was condensed.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.860
And now the loss for
us is catastrophic,

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:17.270
but when you read the
material that she left,

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:19.860
you won't believe it.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.400
It's just staggering how
she's able to articulate.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.880
She dealt with the highest
highs and the lowest lows,

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:30.470
and her resilience, her
strength, her determination,

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:31.820
her desire to live--

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.900
she left instructions
before transplant.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.650
She wanted ECMO, she
wanted ventilator,

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:39.260
she wanted any heroics
necessary to stay alive.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.673
She wanted to
live, and it's hard

00:38:40.673 --> 00:38:43.340
not to be happy when you're with
somebody who, despite the worst

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:46.040
and most overwhelming
obstacles, gets up

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.590
every day with a smile on
her face and pushes forward.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.404
That sets the tone.

00:38:51.404 --> 00:38:54.170
JACK: I have a phrase
that encapsulates that.

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:55.790
Mallory had a knack
that she was very

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:58.040
good at of turning some
of her darkest moments

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.960
into some of her finest hours.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.575
She was a champion all the
time and had so much resolve

00:39:02.575 --> 00:39:06.420
that I'm still inspired by.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.020
MARK SMITH: Mallory lived
happy, but Diane and I also

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.450
strove to be happy.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:14.960
My feeling was, if
we allowed ourselves

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.930
to become despondent
because of her illness,

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:22.070
then the message she would get
is, she had ruined our lives.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.920
And the truth is she
did not ruin our lives.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.330
She enriched them greatly.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.770
And we always tried to
find the joy in every day

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:37.160
and to squeeze every
last drop of life out.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.160
And I'm confident that we did.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.250
I would not say that
Mallory had an unhappy life.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:48.690
I think that, overall, she
had a blessed and happy life.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys
all for coming so much.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:51.960
I really appreciate it.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:56.060
Diane, I just wanted to
compliment you and comment

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.415
on your vigorous attitude with
this whole entire process.

00:39:59.415 --> 00:40:01.290
We know it's not an easy
thing to go through.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.832
I was raised by a single mother
myself and she was definitely

00:40:03.832 --> 00:40:06.260
momma bear my whole
life, still is, in fact.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.060
So to you two, I
wanted to know, how

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.820
can we, as men and
boyfriends, support

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.820
throughout this journey?

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.442
How can we offer our support?

00:40:13.442 --> 00:40:14.900
DIANE SHADER SMITH:
Make your joke.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.660
Tell your joke.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:16.400
MARK SMITH: What's my joke?

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.692
DIANE SHADER SMITH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:17.692 --> 00:40:20.300
MARK SMITH: Oh yeah.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:28.347
When Diane started setting up
all the talks on her book tour

00:40:28.347 --> 00:40:29.930
and she started
working on her speech,

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:32.000
and I helped her with
the speech and it

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
went through multiple drafts.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000
She asked if I wanted to speak
too, and at a couple of events

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.540
I've spoken about phage
therapy, but the audience

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.330
that she has for the book talks
isn't really the right audience

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.750
for the phage therapy talk.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.450
But Diane did say that she
wanted me to come and travel

00:40:53.450 --> 00:41:00.863
with her and attend as many
of the speeches as I could.

00:41:00.863 --> 00:41:02.280
And so I told her
that I was going

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.300
to get myself one of
those little red vests

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.770
that says "Emotional
support animal."

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.520
DIANE SHADER SMITH: I
keep waiting for him

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.330
to show up in it one day.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.705
MARK SMITH: Yeah, I haven't
figured out how to do it yet.

00:41:13.705 --> 00:41:16.550
The dog kind don't
really fit a human body,

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.720
so I may have to
commission it to be made.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:27.410
But in response to your
question, how can you help,

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.930
one of the things that
is really poignant when

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.870
you read Mallory's book,
especially if you knew her

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:36.680
and then you read the book,
is how much suffering she

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.820
went through.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.910
And she chose not to
share a lot of it with me.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:43.100
I think she shared
more with her mother.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.830
Some of her friends say
they actually felt guilty

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:49.910
when they read the book for not
knowing how much suffering she

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.650
went through.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.710
But she concealed that from
us because she loved us.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:58.880
And I think it's important
for everybody, men and women,

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.990
to understand that you see
only a very tiny little bit

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:06.350
of what's going on in
another person's life,

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:09.300
and there's often
a whole iceberg

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.920
there below the surface.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.190
So keep that in mind, I think,
when you deal with people,

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.370
whether they're sick or not.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.418
Sometimes you don't
know that they're sick.

00:42:17.418 --> 00:42:19.710
DIANE SHADER SMITH: I want
to answer that question too.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:23.720
So I would say two words--

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.620
show up.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:28.040
And I can give an example
and an anecdote with Jack.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:32.900
So there was really catastrophic
news in the summer of August--

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.330
I think it was August of 2016--

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:39.282
when Stanford came in
and said, the antibiotics

00:42:39.282 --> 00:42:41.240
aren't working anymore
and we're out of options

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.850
and I don't know that any
center is going to accept you.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.590
And so we said--

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.540
I said-- no pity party.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.500
No negativity.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.450
Nothing in the room that's bad.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:53.340
And Jack, who had been
ever-present, always there, day

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.340
in and day out, just
disappeared for three days,

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.770
and Mallory was devastated.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.510
And then he finally
came and explained--

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.468
and you can ask him if
you want what happened--

00:43:01.468 --> 00:43:03.267
but what he
explained to me was--

00:43:03.267 --> 00:43:04.850
or he explained to
Mallory and Mallory

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:07.940
told me-- was that he heard
me with my no negativity

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.310
and he was too sad and
crying and couldn't be there.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:13.190
And Mallory said very clearly,
I don't care if you cry.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.560
I don't care if you're sad.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.270
But I want you in
the room with me.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.100
And I think that the most
important thing-- it's sort of

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:19.730
like with Mark.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:21.647
If he doesn't speak, if
he doesn't do anything

00:43:21.647 --> 00:43:24.855
more than just show up,
it's an amazing support

00:43:24.855 --> 00:43:26.480
to know that somebody
is there, to have

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.220
a rock when you're alone and
struggling with whatever it is.

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:29.960
MARK SMITH: I
don't just show up.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.002
I also lead the applause.

00:43:34.755 --> 00:43:36.630
AUDIENCE: So Jack, I'll
shift it over to you.

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:37.550
JACK: Sure.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:37.820
Yeah, obviously--

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:38.760
DIANE SHADER SMITH: Do
you remember that episode?

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:39.343
Remember that?

00:43:39.343 --> 00:43:40.580
JACK: Of course, yeah.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.500
There's this perception
now that I'd always

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.060
been a good partner,
a good boyfriend.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.180
But it obviously
wasn't always the case.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.370
Mallory was a great
teacher as well as partner,

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:55.340
so I learned a lot from dating
her that I hope to share now.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.840
One of the struggles
that I face now

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:01.400
is, there is no word for
what position I hold now.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.930
I'm not a widow.

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.140
Mallory and I talked about
marriage and children,

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.618
but decided to put off
engagement and things like that

00:44:08.618 --> 00:44:10.160
so that she could
fight for her life.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.380
That's a pretty important goal.

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:15.110
But now I think of
myself as a quasi-widow,

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.750
the former boyfriend to
this incredible woman.

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.850
And so to answer
your question, how

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:24.260
do we as men, or former
boyfriends in my case,

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.720
honor her legacy and show
that in their restraint?

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.180
And it's one I'm
still working on.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:30.805
One of the most
rewarding parts of this

00:44:30.805 --> 00:44:35.630
has been the inspiration people
have shared with me of Mallory

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.340
and I as a couple.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.580
It's not like she became sick
after I started dating her.

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.395
I knew all of that
upfront, going into it.

00:44:42.395 --> 00:44:44.180
But she was such an
extraordinary woman

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:48.750
that it was so clear to
stay with her for me.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.960
I have no regrets of dating her.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.868
She was incredible.

00:44:51.868 --> 00:44:52.910
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys.

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.298
AUDIENCE: So Tim and I have
a 22-year-old son with CF.

00:44:59.298 --> 00:45:00.590
DIANE SHADER SMITH: Oh, you do?

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:01.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:05.780
So thank you, all three of you,
for sharing your experiences.

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.650
And I could ask you
a lot of questions,

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:13.040
but I really wanted to focus on
your two issues of disclosure

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.600
because there were
two perspectives.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.510
One was, would you
still advise a patient

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:24.460
with CF or other chronic
illness, to disclose that to--

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.510
DIANE SHADER SMITH: 100%,
and I can explain why,

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:28.350
or if you want to ask
your second question.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.900
AUDIENCE: And the
second question

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:35.420
is, the lack of disclosure on
the part of the medical team,

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.420
with respect to, you were the
second in line for the lung

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:39.890
transplant, things like that.

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:44.530
Are there ways that we can help
them to be more open with us?

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:47.030
DIANE SHADER SMITH: Well OK,
I'll answer the second question

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:48.500
first.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:51.260
By speaking out, we're
raising awareness.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.840
And I have already
given 15 talks

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.158
and I've already done a
lot of press interviews

00:45:56.158 --> 00:45:58.200
and I've already heard
back from a lot of people.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.585
And so it sparks conversation
and it triggers conversation,

00:46:01.585 --> 00:46:03.710
which, back to your question,
what I'm going to do,

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:05.127
I'm going to poke
the bear is what

00:46:05.127 --> 00:46:06.419
I'm going to do in the process.

00:46:06.419 --> 00:46:08.044
I don't know what
I'm going to land on,

00:46:08.044 --> 00:46:10.010
but for right now I'm
going to raise the issue.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.385
And it's funny, because a lot
of the medical institutions

00:46:12.385 --> 00:46:13.920
wanted to see the
talk, and I was

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.170
like, I'm not sending my talk.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:16.253
You don't have to take me.

00:46:16.253 --> 00:46:18.770
But it took me a
long time to land

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:22.080
on what I felt was most
important to share.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.938
But I think if you just
express to your caretakers--

00:46:25.938 --> 00:46:27.980
your CF team, I'm not sure
where you're treated--

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.450
that you want full information.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:30.860
And part of Mallory's--

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.990
and I mentioned this
early in the talk.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.060
Part of why she
got such good care

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.520
is because she was able to
articulate exactly what she

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.903
was feeling and thinking.

00:46:38.903 --> 00:46:40.070
She understood her symptoms.

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:41.630
She knew what her
treatments were.

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:43.860
She understood what was
happening in her body.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.550
And I think that her
being so open and honest

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:49.927
and communicative helped
them be that way with her.

00:46:49.927 --> 00:46:52.010
But back to your question
about whether disclosure

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:53.930
is important.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:56.930
I overwhelmingly
feel that when you

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:59.450
tell people what
is going on, 90%

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:02.000
of the people, 99% of the
people, whatever the number is,

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.100
are supportive and
caring and kind.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.190
If an employer
withdraws an offer,

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:10.635
it's good that your son
is not starting that job,

00:47:10.635 --> 00:47:12.260
because you don't
want your son to work

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.135
in a place that doesn't
want somebody to have

00:47:14.135 --> 00:47:15.650
that as a chronic illness.

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:18.440
And I didn't want
Mallory to take that job.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.180
She was really sick at the time.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.067
She had a great
freelance writing career.

00:47:22.067 --> 00:47:23.400
She had plenty of opportunities.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.090
What she was longing for
was that office feeling.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:29.160
She was so jealous
of all of her friends

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.990
who got to go to Uber
or Lyft or Google

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:33.300
or Facebook or Airbnb
and all the places.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.000
They were all working in
these cool startups and fun

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.360
companies, and she
was at home and felt

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.930
very lonely and very isolated.

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.740
I said to her, you are going
to compromise your health

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:44.328
by doing it.

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:45.870
And as it turned
out, she was already

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:49.350
compromised to the point where,
a week after that incident

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:51.760
happened, she ended up
back in the hospital.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.100
And it was very clear to me
she shouldn't take the job.

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:56.220
But that said, I
raised the anecdote

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.860
because I think it's important
for people to remember,

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.810
and I think that--

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:02.700
my advice to you
as a mom to mom is

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.800
to help your son
figure out a career

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.220
that he can do with his
limitations that will embrace

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.180
and accept him for who he is.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.100
And now, with the friggin'
portable vests, I mean--

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.850
Mallory would be a lot
healthier, I think,

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:17.872
if she had been able to take
that vest everywhere with her

00:48:17.872 --> 00:48:19.830
and not have had to skip
some of the treatments

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.320
for whatever reasons that
she chose to skip them,

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.030
and she was pretty compliant.

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:29.580
MARK SMITH: On that
issue of the medical team

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.380
disclosing more to
you, I think just

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:36.750
by talking about the issue, we
encourage medical professionals

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.660
to consider the disclosure
issue from the standpoint

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.910
of the patient and the family.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:44.730
And I think they
mostly consider it

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:49.648
from the standpoint
of HIPAA regulations.

00:48:49.648 --> 00:48:51.440
DIANE SHADER SMITH:
And I have to tell you,

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.750
there are so many more
issues that have come up.

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:57.650
I'll give you a three
sentence example.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:01.910
They kick parents out of the
ICU at shift change because

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:04.340
of HIPAA, and they
want to make sure

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.440
that, when they're doing
their bedside reporting,

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.950
that patient confidentiality
is not being--

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:12.540
so Mallory had her transplant.

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.485
She had made us
promise and swear,

00:49:14.485 --> 00:49:16.610
up and down in every
direction, that we would never

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:17.515
ever leave her alone.

00:49:17.515 --> 00:49:19.640
And Mark and Jack and I
rotated, because he flew in

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.360
and Mark was there
at that point.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.360
And I was at home sleeping,
and Jack was at home

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.400
sleeping in the apartment,
and Mark was on duty,

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.572
and the nurses refused
to do the report bedside.

00:49:29.572 --> 00:49:31.280
And Mallory was
ventilated at that point,

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.150
and sedated and drugged out,
and they refused to do report.

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:36.450
They wanted to kick him out.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:37.722
It became a big brouhaha.

00:49:37.722 --> 00:49:39.680
And Mallory scribbled on
a thing, Dad, it's OK.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.263
You can leave.

00:49:40.263 --> 00:49:42.320
I want them to do the
reporting bedside.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.870
I want to hear it and then
they'll get you and come back.

00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:47.265
I was home asleep and
about, apparently,

00:49:47.265 --> 00:49:49.640
15 minutes after this incident
happened, the phone rings.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.530
I will never forget this moment.

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:53.870
And I'm in my half
exhausted sleep

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:55.050
and I say, oh, it's Mallory.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:56.120
Why is Mallory calling me?

00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:56.450
Uh-oh.

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:57.120
What's wrong?

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.190
And I answer the phone
and I hear this--

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:00.600
[BANGING ON LECTERN]----
at the top of my lungs.

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.940
And I knew instantly there
was a problem and I knew--

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.207
I don't know how I knew--

00:50:04.207 --> 00:50:05.290
she was hitting the phone.

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:06.350
It was just so obvious to me.

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:07.260
I screamed for Jack.

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.050
I handed him the phone.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:08.842
I say, talk to her.

00:50:08.842 --> 00:50:10.050
Don't stop talking.

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:10.620
Keep talking.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:11.460
Let her hear your voice.

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:11.960
Soothe her.

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:12.630
Comfort her.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:16.680
I call Mark, screaming like
a crazy, raging lunatic.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.720
He goes back in and
we go racing over,

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.000
and the bottom line
is, this is the policy.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.140
If you Google ICU shift
change, you will see,

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.210
it comes up in big
letters that it's

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:30.330
customary protocol to ask
the families and loved

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:30.990
ones to leave.

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:32.592
Now the stupidest thing of all.

00:50:32.592 --> 00:50:34.800
When is the time that the
patient is paying the least

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.802
attention to you?

00:50:35.802 --> 00:50:36.510
I mean the nurse.

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:38.670
The nurse is paying the
least attention to you

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:41.490
supposedly when they're
engaged in passing the notes

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:42.858
from the night to the day.

00:50:42.858 --> 00:50:44.400
And so what that
means is at the time

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.025
they're actually
talking to each other,

00:50:46.025 --> 00:50:48.390
how could they be paying
attention to their patient?

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:51.893
So this is one issue
that is not in my speech,

00:50:51.893 --> 00:50:54.060
but it's something that I
feel really strongly about

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.530
and it's something I
want to work hard for.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:57.610
But if I were you and I had
a kid that ever ended up

00:50:57.610 --> 00:50:59.060
in the hospital,
I would make sure

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.810
that you dealt with
that issue right away.

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:01.470
HIPAA waiver.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:02.550
Obvious duh.

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:04.345
You've signed the HIPAA waiver.

00:51:04.345 --> 00:51:06.220
You're allowed to speak
in front of your son.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.250
But we had one,
Mallory had signed it,

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:10.992
and still they kicked Mark out.

00:51:10.992 --> 00:51:11.820
KEVIN: Great.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.880
Thank you, Diane, Jack,
and Mark for this talk,

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.088
and thank you all for coming.
