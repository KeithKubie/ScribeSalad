00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.006
- Let's deal with some
algebraic expressions

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.673
that involve multiplying fractions.

00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:09.673
So let's say that I had a over b,

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:14.746
a over b times c over d.

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:18.443
What is this going to be?

00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:19.701
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:22.534
and try to figure it out on your own.

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:24.216
Well, when you multiply fractions,

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:25.582
you just multiply the numerators

00:00:25.582 --> 00:00:27.352
and multiply the denominators.

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:29.201
So the numerators here, a, c,

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:30.698
you're just going to multiply those out.

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:32.373
It's going to a times c,

00:00:32.373 --> 00:00:35.902
which we can just write as ac,

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:38.890
that just a times c, all of that over

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.381
the denominator, b times d,

00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:47.339
b times d.

00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:50.150
Instead of multiplying,
what would of happened

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.463
if we were dividing?

00:00:51.463 --> 00:00:56.265
So if we had a over b,

00:00:56.265 --> 00:01:00.400
a over b divided by,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.573
divided by c over d,

00:01:04.573 --> 00:01:05.475
what would this be?

00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:07.719
And once again, encourage you,

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.328
encourage you to pause the video

00:01:09.328 --> 00:01:11.800
and figure it out on your own.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.868
Well, when you divide by a fraction,

00:01:13.868 --> 00:01:15.695
it is equivalent to multiplying

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:18.081
by it's, by it's reciprocal.

00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:20.345
So this is going to be the same thing

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:25.328
as a over b, a over b times,

00:01:27.617 --> 00:01:30.517
times the reciprocal of this.

00:01:30.517 --> 00:01:34.477
So times d over, I'm going to use

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:36.806
the same color just so
I don't confuse you,

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:41.481
that d was purple, times d over c,

00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:44.644
times d over c and then it
reduces to a problem like this.

00:01:44.644 --> 00:01:45.827
You know, and I shouldn't even use

00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:49.114
this multiplication symbol
now that we're in algebra

00:01:49.114 --> 00:01:50.660
because you might confuse that with an x,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.347
so let me write that as times, times d,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.500
d over c, times d over c,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.634
and what are you left with?

00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:05.475
Well the numerator you're
going to have a times d,

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:10.285
so it's ad, a, d, over,

00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:17.393
over bc, over b times c.

00:02:19.946 --> 00:02:24.114
Now let's do one that's maybe
a little bit more involved

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:25.574
and see if you can pull it off.

00:02:25.574 --> 00:02:29.270
So let's say that I had,
let's say that I had,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.012
I don't know, let me write it as 1 over a,

00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:39.012
minus 1 over b, all of that over,

00:02:40.397 --> 00:02:44.441
all of that over c, and let's say,

00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:49.029
let's also divide that by 1 over d.

00:02:50.122 --> 00:02:52.161
So this is a more involved expression

00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:53.839
then what we've seen so
far but I think we have

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.331
all the tools to tackle
it so I encourage you

00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:58.194
to pause the video and see
if you can simplify this,

00:02:58.194 --> 00:02:59.916
if you can actually carry
out these operations

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:04.011
and come up with a one
fraction that represents this.

00:03:04.011 --> 00:03:05.813
All right so let's work
through it step by step,

00:03:05.813 --> 00:03:07.493
so 1 over a minus 1 over b,

00:03:07.493 --> 00:03:10.108
let me work through just
that part by itself.

00:03:10.108 --> 00:03:14.005
So 1 over a minus 1 over b,

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:15.301
we know how to tackle that,

00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:16.716
we can find a common denominator,

00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:17.884
let me write it up here.

00:03:17.884 --> 00:03:22.283
So 1 over a minus 1 over b,

00:03:22.283 --> 00:03:23.536
is going to be equal to,

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.447
we can multiply 1 over a times b over b,

00:03:26.447 --> 00:03:28.807
so it's going to be b over ba,

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:30.190
notice I haven't changed it's value,

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.697
I just multiplied it times 1, b over b,

00:03:32.697 --> 00:03:34.352
minus, well I'm going to multiply

00:03:34.352 --> 00:03:36.599
the numerator and denominator here by a,

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.428
- a over ab, or I could write that as ba.

00:03:41.428 --> 00:03:42.487
And the whole reason why I did that

00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:44.794
is to have the same denominator.

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:48.055
So this is going to be equal to b-a,

00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:52.781
over, I could write is a ba or ab.

00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:54.998
So this is going to be equal to,

00:03:54.998 --> 00:03:59.666
this is going to be equal to
this numerator right over here,

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:03.877
b-a, over ab,

00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:07.505
and then, if I'm dividing it by c,

00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:09.096
that's the same thing as multiplying

00:04:09.096 --> 00:04:11.130
by the reciprocal of c.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.923
So if I'm dividing it by c,

00:04:12.923 --> 00:04:14.823
that's the same thing as multiplying,

00:04:14.823 --> 00:04:19.476
that's the same thing as
multiplying times 1 over c.

00:04:19.476 --> 00:04:22.794
And if I am, and I'll
just keep going here,

00:04:22.794 --> 00:04:25.690
if I'm dividing by 1 over d,

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.428
if I'm dividing, notice
this is the same thing

00:04:27.428 --> 00:04:29.060
as division right over here.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.988
If I'm dividing by c,
that's the same thing

00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:33.429
as multiplying by the reciprocal of c.

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:35.708
And then finally, I'm
dividing by 1 over d,

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:36.908
that's the same thing as multiplying

00:04:36.908 --> 00:04:39.140
by the reciprocal of 1 over d.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.613
So the reciprocal of 1 over d

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:44.236
is d over, d over 1.

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:46.020
And so what does this result with?

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.687
Well in the numerator I
have b-a times 1 times d.

00:04:49.687 --> 00:04:54.687
So we can write this as d times (b-a),

00:04:54.717 --> 00:04:58.821
times (b-a) and then in the denominator

00:04:58.821 --> 00:05:03.821
I have abc, ab and c.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.671
And then finally, we can use
the distributive property here,

00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:11.953
we can distribute this d,

00:05:11.953 --> 00:05:14.358
and we're going to be left with,

00:05:14.358 --> 00:05:17.151
we deserve a minor drum
roll at this point,

00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:21.473
we can write this as d times b,

00:05:21.473 --> 00:05:26.317
d times b minus d,
woops, I want to do that

00:05:26.317 --> 00:05:27.838
in the same green color so you really see

00:05:27.838 --> 00:05:32.090
how it got distributed, minus d times a,

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.090
all of that over ab, abc.

00:05:40.308 --> 00:05:43.586
And we are done.
