00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We're about to begin another programming practice gem.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is optional material for students who would like to gain a little more practice

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
programming and debugging.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And what happens here will not influence your grade in any way.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Today's problem: Given a list--could be empty, could be arbitrarily long--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
print all sublists of that list.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'll give an example of what this means in just a second.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If you prefer a more math-y explanation,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
for us this is the same problem as given a set, print all the subsets.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
For example, suppose the input is the 3-element list containing the strings LM,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
ECS, and SBA.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Then we want the output to include the empty list--we don't have any of them--

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
all of the lists containing just 1 of them,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
all of the lists containing any pair of them, and then all of them.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And one way to think about this is that you are throwing a party

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or perhaps hosting a dinner and you've invited your 3 friends: LM, ECS, and SBA.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Who could show up?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
One possibility is that no one shows up and you eat alone. That would be super sad.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Another possibility is that only your first friend shows up or only the second

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
or only the third, and then you have a dinner for 2.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It could be that any pair of them show up, you have a great time,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
or it could be that everyone shows up and everything works out just as you'd hoped.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So you can think of this as a guest list for a party

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and you want to know what are all of the possible combinations

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
of people who could actually attend.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
In this particular example, we started with 3 friends

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and ended up with 8 possibilities--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Totally optional quiz that does not count for your grade:

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
If the input list had 5 entries, if you invited 5 friends to your dinner party,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
how many possible subsets or arrangements,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
ranging from no one shows up to everyone shows up, would there be?

00:01:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Fill in the blank.
