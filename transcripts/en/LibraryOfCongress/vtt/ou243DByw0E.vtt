And a special thank you to our
main speaker Professor Newman.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.680
Professor Newman received her BA in
philosophy from Brooklyn College,

her MA and PhD in linguistics
from the University of Michigan,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.130
her specialty -- well
she's a linguist,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.920
but her specialty is
Yiddish language and culture.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.280
But she's involved in a
variety of other activities.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.330
She's lived in Israel for 30 years
where she helped found Maslan,

and is a former head of Judaic
studies at Lehman College of SUNY.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.630
And she has an upcoming biography

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.020

writer Kadya Molodowsky,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.980
she's now retired and
living in Beersheba.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.460
So, I'm going to introduce
Professor Newman, thank you.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.260
&gt;&gt; Zelda Kahan Newman: Thank you.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.270
[ Applause ]

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.490
I'd also like to thank the
Hebraic section of the African

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.600
and Middle East Studies Division,
the Hebrew Language Table

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.900
and the Library of Congress.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.840
Apparently, the Embassy of
Israel is connected with this,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.880
so thank you to everybody.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.540 position:56%
As a lover of Yiddish and a bookworm
I'm delighted to be here presenting

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.300
to you a dual language Yiddish
English book, this one over here.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.950
The Yiddish poems of
Rivka Basman Ben-Hayim

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.660
and alongside them my
English translations.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.040
Nothing could be more fitting
English is my native language,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.490
Yiddish is my [foreign language],
the language I heard around me.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.620
The Library of Congress is
an extraordinary institution

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.790
and Rivka Basman Ben-Hayim is
an extraordinary individual.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.750
All good literature
illuminates the universal

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.320
by examining the particular

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.750
and poetry is the most
particular of all literary forms.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.260
As I take you through a tour

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.780
of the poet's work the universal
elements will leap out at you.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.060
The particular ones are
ones that I will point out

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.410 position:56%
and I'll fill you in on the details.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.860
Rivka Basman was born in
1925 in the town of Vilkomir

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.590
and what the Jews called
[inaudible] or Lithuania.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.890
When she looked back

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.180
on her childhood there was
one teacher who stood out.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.840
Here is her poem about that teacher
it's called [foreign language],

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.150
My Teacher Riva.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.530
This is how it goes, I'm going
to read it first in Yiddish

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.510 position:56%
and then its translation in English.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:05:35.420
[ Speaking Foreign Language ]

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.230
Okay, here's the English
translation.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.080
My Teacher Riva.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.670
Like sun in a rain caught in
leaves your image shines forever

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.480
in me my teacher Riva.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.780
Unique and eternal your vision,
a truly rooted vigil excuse me,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.200
a truly rooted vigil your love
the strongest my teacher Riva.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.600
So, I absorb the sunset which
has lit before me a corner

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.040
of memory through dark pains.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:12.140 position:56%
With years wait patiently where time
has no dominion over them and there

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.500
in a shtetl in Lithuania, at the
first sung alphabet-letters dripped

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.610
with honey and tears I swallowed
your smile loomed in sadness.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.330
Hours will probably overlap
the latter reach the former

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.380 position:56%
and meet somewhere together by seas.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.880
And there in a blue remembrance
your name will gleam pristine,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.160
my teacher Riva.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.760
This poem speaks of the first
alphabet letters gripping

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.520
with honey.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.300
It was traditional in Eastern
Europe to introduce young children

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.010
to the Hebrew letters with
which Yiddish is written

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.560
by dipping a letter baked in
honey and then giving the letter

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.410
to the child in the
shape of a letter.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.320
Let's say an olive, the
child would say olive

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.260
and then swallow the letter.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.730
This accomplished two things, it
made the Hebrew letters literally

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:15.300 position:56%
and symbolically a part of the child
and it is associated Jewish learning

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.760
with a very pleasant experience.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.550
Rivka new loss at a very
young age, her mother died

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.080
when she was still a child,
her grandma stepped in.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.480
When the Nazis emptied Rivka's
town of Jews Rivka was 14.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.260
She held onto her brother
Arele and some

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.330
of her poems are dedicated
her brother Arele.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.820
But he was torn out of her hands
and she never saw him again.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.390
Rivka spent two years
in the Vilna ghetto

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.840
where she met the great
Yiddish poet Abraham Sutzkever.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.340
Ten years older than Rivka
Sutzkever was already a recognized

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.190
Yiddish poet.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.150
When Rivka told Sutzkever that she
herself composed poems Sutzkever

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:09.210
said, keep it up that's what
will keep you alive and it did.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.510
When Rivka was sent

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.640
to the Kaiserwald Concentration
Camps she continued

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.350
to compose poems.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:21.640
It's been said that at the
Warsaw uprising the cry went

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.450
out [foreign language],
Jews don't be despaired.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:31.150
And in that same spirit of the
Nazis can control our bodies,

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.300
but they can't control
our spirit the women

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:40.530
of this concentration camp decided
to entertain the inmates every day.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:45.300
So at the end of every grueling
workday there were three women

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.480
who entertained the
inmates, one sang, one danced

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.200
and one composed a poem
and recited it that day.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:00.040
It was Rivka who composed a
poem and recited it every day.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.250
This is Rivka's description
of that experience.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.550
It's called the Dermonung.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.840
Remembrance first in Yiddish.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:41.040
[ Speaking Foreign Language ]

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.830
Okay, here's the translation
Remembrance.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.960
They remember how I used to
write poems, crying poems,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.960
silence poems on the
red cobblestones.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.800
Remember me at the barbed fence,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.040
my young skin tattooed
from barbed points.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:07.050
To see a tiny threat of sunset of
my own setting in that last sun.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:13.400
I sang then and my poem
was itself our sun.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.510
Okay, that's her poem about them.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.330
It's worth pointing out
that nowhere in this poem

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.060
or in any poem ever written
by Rivka are the Nazis

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.180
or the Germans ever
mentioned outright never.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.580
It's as though the Germans were
not allowed to control the spirits

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.890
of the women and they are not
allowed into Rivka's closed world

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.490
of Yiddish poetry,
they're closed off.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.880
But that of course, does not
mean that the inmates were able

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.500
to forget what had happened.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.270
The trauma was with them for life.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.400
Here is Rivka's honest
description of that

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.310
and it's called [foreign language].

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:36.070
[ Speaking Foreign Language ]

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.670
And this is the translation
We Are Restless.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.980
We are restless from wandering.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.470
We are restless from
seeking a cave in the night

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.480
so a star shouldn't spot us.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.720
We are restless for
longing for those

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.330
who never did die and are dead.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:02.400
We are restless from being unable
to tell ourselves of our unrest.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.900
So Rivka did exactly as Sutzkever
had predicted Rivka found solace

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:14.830
in poetry, in her ability to
find words for complex emotions

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.960
and in the satisfaction that
comes with the artistic creation.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.900
Of course, a poet needs inspiration
and the news may be fickle,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.460
it may not come when it's cold.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.170
This is Rivka's poem describing
the gratification that comes

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.080
with finding the precise
word [foreign language],

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.080
that's the way the French call it.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.380 position:56%
Okay it's called [foreign language].

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:45.610
Just a minute, I thought
I had it here.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:56.510
Just a second, [foreign language]
okay, [foreign language].

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:19.200
[ Speaking Foreign Language ]

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.120
If you can and you will
it becomes calm and still.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:30.070
When it becomes so good, so easy
it sings by itself, of itself.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.980 position:56%
The sounds listen to their own calm.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.290
Rare when there's such
a becalmed calm.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:42.900
I'd go there more often if
I knew how and to where.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.320
So that's her poem on
poetic inspiration.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.830
Back now to the end of the war.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.600 position:56%
By the end of the war Rivka's father
was no longer alive, he was murdered

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.810
in a camp in Estonia just
before the war ended.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:02.470
So, at the war's end Rivka
was alone in the world.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:08.420
She met and married Shmuel
nicknamed Mula Ben-Hayim

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.390
after the war in Belgrade.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:17.560
Mula ran the Belgrade station of
the organization known as Berihah,

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.440
the Hebrew word for
flight or escape.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.240
The members of this organization
gathered the stateless Jews then

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:32.270
wandering all over Europe wanted
by no one and sent them illegally

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.290
to what was then Palestine.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:40.450
Here then was a young couple
just starting life together

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.460
who took it upon themselves
to dodge the Interpol,

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:48.020
the Interpol was looking for them
and put their lives in danger

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.660
to help settle fellow Jews
in the one place in the world

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.550
that was happy to have them then.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.050
It's not surprising then that
when Rivka and Mula, her husband,

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.280
arrived in Israel in 1947,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.290
they settled in a kibbutz
called Ha-Ma'pil.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:10.940
Literally Ha-Ma'pil means
one who ascends, who goes up.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.580
This kibbutz took its name from
a passage in the Book of Numbers,

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.740
chapter 14, verse 44 and
that's the original story

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.100
of Ha-Ma'pil those who ascend.

can look it up, those of you are not

Q&amp;A section there's a story

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.850
about why this kibbutz
was called Ha-Ma'pil.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:37.510
What mattered for Rivka was that
on the kibbutz she could heal.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.310
She watched things grow,
she got a teaching degree

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:45.520
and she taught children
and she watched them grow.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.060
And that for her was therapeutic.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.000
Most important, she had Mula,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.920
the love of her life
and her life partner.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.420
Mula was an artist,
he's no longer alive.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.970
This picture that you see here
is his picture and all the prints

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.400
in this book are his prints.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.310
This is a poem addressed
to him essentially to Mula,

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.970
it is called [foreign language].

she spoke about being restless

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:07.800
so with Mula, her husband,
she is calm.

I need not withhold any words

myself rooted to streaming wonder,

Anyone notice that the
book is dedicated to Mula?

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.980
Rivka wanted it that way.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:53.770
Never one to avoid harsh truths
Rivka had to admit that even

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.950
as she healed the pain
did not disappear.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:03.350
In the following poem, she speaks
of a slow process of healing

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.610
and the untouched depths of grief.

because I met Rivka Basman Ben-Hayim
in 2009, when I was giving a reading

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:42.200
at [inaudible] in Tel
Aviv and Rivka was there

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.910
and was extremely encouraging
and supportive.

And more recently,
for a literary event

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.390

translated one of my Yiddish poems

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.930
into Hebrew and did a
really beautiful job.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.080

I don't know if we're going to
show this clip, but I should point

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.270
out that the second line
of the poem you're going

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:06.860
to hear is [foreign language]
and that is reference

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.430

and Rivka's poems are
from out of the depths.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:21.760
In the pre-World War 2 era
the Jewish world was divided

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.890
between the advocates of Yiddish
as the language of the Jews

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.750
and of Hebrew as the
language of the Jews.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.380
When the state of Israel was
young Yiddish was denigrated

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.330
as the language of the diaspora

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.070
which Israelis were
told to get rid of.

In the inclusive way that is typical
of her and Rivka does translate

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.980
from Hebrew to Yiddish and back.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:49.850
Rivka was both Yiddish and Hebrew.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:55.450
She spoke Hebrew of course, but she
joined a group called Yung Yisroel.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:21:00.070
This was a group of writers
that was intent on maintaining

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.080
and encouraging artistic

within a Hebrew speaking
environment.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.140
And here is Rivka's poem
called the [foreign language],

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:15.620
the Intimacy Between
Yiddish and Hebrew.

Perhaps the way Yiddish
breathes into a Hebrew word warms

up the letters, gives
them a softer step.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.660

that you've just heard the poet not
only tells us about the intimacy

between Yiddish and Hebrew
she actually demonstrates it.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.500
Yiddish often take a Hebrew word

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.940
and Yiddishizes [phonetic]
[foreign language]

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.240
or in Yiddish [foreign language]
or [foreign language] it.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:48.700
As you may know, tomato,
tomato Yiddish has dialects,

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.420
so it's [foreign language]
in one dialect

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.240
and [foreign language] in another.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.560
From the noun [foreign
language] as we say

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.280
in modern Hebrew Yiddish creates
the verb [foreign language]

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.170
and we say [foreign language]
or [foreign language] depending

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:07.590
on your dialect, they dream.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:15.630
Now there is a Yiddish noun for
the verb to pray, the verb prayer

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:23.190
and that is [foreign language]
in modern Israeli Hebrew

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.430
or [foreign language] in
Yiddish that's how it is,

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:31.930
the Yiddish adopts the word and
Yiddishizes it [foreign language].

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.500
But the Yiddish verb
for praying is not

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.570
from that noun it is
the verb davening,

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.890
that is the standard
Yiddish word for praying.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:49.050
But in this poem Rivka does not use
the standard verb davening instead

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.730
she creates a new Yiddish verb

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.920
from the Yiddish [foreign language]
she makes a new verb [inaudible],

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:01.760 position:56%
it's the verb that she made from
the noun [foreign language] to pray.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.530
So, she takes the verb,
the noun [foreign language]

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.870
or [foreign language] and she
makes it into the verb [inaudible].

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:14.260 position:56%
It's a possible word in Yiddish just
because Yiddish can and does draw

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.140
on Hebrew nouns to
make Yiddish verbs.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.720
And this is intimacy in action.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:26.690
When Rivka was a child she read
and grew to love the poetry

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.530

that's as you pointed out,

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:34.250

biography of Kadya Molodowsky.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.890
Kadya Molodowsky was the
most prolific woman writer

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:44.660
And right after the Holocaust
Kadya wrote a poem called [foreign

English as Merciful God.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.220

against God and she said

But for Kadya white was her
private color for wonder and beauty.

And in this poem Whiteness Rivka
is responding to Kadya's complaint.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:44.250
She counters that complaint against
God by pointing to the beauty

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:52.010
and wonder of nature, his world and
she says is God not there as well

question up in the air.

want to explain to all of you

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.840
that [foreign language]
literally means years

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.250
and I translate it as time.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.100
If you knew Rivka's
[inaudible] you would know

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.130
that she often uses [foreign
language] to mean time.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.330
And I discussed this with her

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.040
and she said it's okay,
it's okay time is good.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.030
So, it's not by accident I do know
what [foreign language] means,

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.240
it means years, but that's
how she means it here.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.640
I owe my editor, Judith P.
Kerman an insight into this poem.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.880
There's a line I the poem that
Aaron just read for you which goes

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:42.970 position:56%
like this, it comes and speaks about
each separately, so Judith said

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.470
to me each what, each
person, each event, each what,

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:47.770
you're leaving her hanging.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.710
And the answer of course,

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:54.140
is that with genuine
friendship you need not spell out

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.800
or give voice to everything.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.680
If you and your friend are on
the same wavelength you can

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:07.230 position:56%
and do leave things unsaid and still
there's complete understanding.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:11.480

not say about each what,

your friend knows the rest.

the tear in them, which has no fear

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:39.000
of time and still looks for
the rider who rides bedecked

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.870
in golden spurs, who comes
and says and deceives.

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:49.930
And then it remembers the tear
and seeks a sword in the words

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:53.240
which are drenched
with the sweet lament.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.780
And after that the old refrain.

&gt;&gt; Zelda Kahan Newman: So, I'm going

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.640
to give you the way I
understand this poem.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:11.690 position:56%
A musical refrain this poem tells
us is hard to shake because it comes

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:16.530
with memory and anticipation
and hopes.

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:21.400
And even after the sought after
hope are dashed the memory

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:27.150
of them remains and we return to
the music and memories associated

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:33.670
with it because the sounds are
drenched with a sweet lament.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.600
Follow with me the
music of this poem,

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:41.930
the song with the old-time refrain
returns and returns once again.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:48.380

question is how long it takes.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.030
Each poem is different and you
know it's like what Rivka says,

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.940

can do it and you want it

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.650

and sometimes it doesn't.

It would be nice if you get it.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.790
There have been times when
I spend an awful lot of time

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:18.340
on a translation and
the next time I look

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.160
at it I erase the whole business.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.190
Every now and then things work
out right, but you've got to get,

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.040 position:56%
you think of the sense, you think
of the rhyme, you think of the meter

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.570
and rarely do you get all three.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:34.630
So, I know one line all in
all in this entire collection,

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:38.810
which I feel pretty comfortable
with and that's [foreign language]

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:43.910
and which I translated as,

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:48.950
a stillness that's concealed
rejuvenates the mind,

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.320
which is as close as I could get.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:55.020
And that requires two things
[foreign language] is a word

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.240
that does not exist in Yiddish it's
a neologism the word is [foreign

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.860
language] which means spring.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:05.190 position:56%
And Rivka makes up the word [foreign
language] to you it would say

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.660
in spring, but that's
not a word in English.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.890
So I decided on rejuvenates

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:14.940
because it fit the rhythm
ba-da-ba-da rejuvenates the mind.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.150
And [foreign language] is not
mind [foreign language] is memory,

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:24.530
but I translated it as mind
because it's a half rhyme with time

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:28.390
and because without your
memories have you got a mind.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:35.930
So, it was two translations
of a sense [foreign language]

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:40.180
with a rhythm that works,
but you know that's so rate

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:44.490
that you get a rhythm and
a half rhyme and the sense,

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:47.450
it's almost asking
for the impossible.

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.090
But you try for the impossible,

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.720
if you don't try you'll
never get there.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.020
Any other questions?

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.320

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.490
How did she save her
poem, how did she?

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:58.180

you, thank you for saying that.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.480
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Repeat
the question.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Zelda Kahan Newman: So, the
question is how she saves her poems.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:05.050
When the Nazi camp was liquidated,

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:10.440
the Nazis liquidated the camps they
stripped the prisoners completely

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.820
nude and they weren't allowed
to take anything with them.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.980
So, at the camp Rivka wrote her
poems in micrography and rolled

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.660
onto her tongue and she
escaped with those poems.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:27.900 position:56%
But she says about those
particular poems [foreign language],

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.590
they were not sublimated enough.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.200
She feels that they
needed sublimation,

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.030
she feels they were
screamed from the heart

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.630
and she hasn't published those.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.700
But she says when she meets
her maker she will put them

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.210
in [foreign language].

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:48.870
But she feels it didn't go through
enough sifting, it was too much

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:52.370
of a scream and she doesn't
think they're good enough.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.110
But she says they remember
the people they were

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:56.770
with in the camps remembers them
and certainly knows what they are

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.320
and she's planning to leave
them with [foreign language]

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.770
as a memory, as a toke of what was.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:05.070

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:09.820

[inaudible] before the Holocaust

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.750

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.920
&gt;&gt; Zelda Kahan Newman: Background
in [inaudible], so Rivka told me

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.070
that in [inaudible] Lithuania
as the Jews called it then was

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.260
in northeast Poland at the time.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.680
There were different
shtetl and in her shtetl,

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.540
she says was the Yiddish
speaking shtetl so she went

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.470
to a Yiddish speaking school.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:31.230
But Mula Shmuel, her husband,
went to a Hebrew speaking school.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.690
So, each shtetl has
its preferred language.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.670
So, she went to a Hebrew
speaking school and began

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.960
to [inaudible] and never finished.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.720
And she got her degree later on
when she was in Israel she went

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.420
to get a teaching degree.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.570

the [inaudible] and then it ended,

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:50.140
but it was all in Yiddish

said it was a secular background

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.890

religious background at all.

She's a very inclusive sort of
person, she knows that I'm religious

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:20.670
and she always calls me before
Shabbos, never afterwards

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.520
and she'll ask me what
time candle lighting is

but of course, Yiddish as she says

in one of these poems, Yiddish words
live for her instead of people.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.400

instead of that world.

but [inaudible] superior.

a good grasp of Hebrew,

don't usually talk to each other,

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:37.440
There's a story it the Book
of Numbers about the children

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.950
of Israel they have just
sinned with a sin of the spies

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:43.980
and Moses tells them they
will not enter the land

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.520
of Israel except for
two who didn't sin.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.470
They cannot, they will not, they
have to wander in the desert.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:53.480
And after he tells them
this defiantly they decide

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:59.300
to it says [foreign language],
they ascended the top of the summit

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.660
of the hill and they try to
enter and they were routed.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.040
And Moses said if you
try you'll be defeated,

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.270
they tried they were
defeated, they didn't manage.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:12.500
So, after the war the
Zionists looked around.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.820
There's a traditional
understanding in in Jewish thought

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:18.990
that there will come a day
when there will be peace

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:23.320
in the whole world, justice will
reign and God will gather the,

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:27.110
do a gathering of all Jews
to the land of Israel.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.600
Well the Zionists looked around
after the Holocaust and guess what,

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.810
there was no peace all over the
world, justice did not reign,

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:38.770
and there didn't seem to be any
way God was taking the children

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:40.350
of Israel to the land of Israel.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:44.600
And they said we're defiant
we're going to do it.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.970 position:56%
There was a song [foreign language],
let us [inaudible] and we'll manage,

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.360
we'll do it, we won't be
routed, we'll succeed,

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.950
well enter the land of Israel.

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.590
They call themselves
[foreign language] based

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:59.780
on the defiant assent, but they
said we won't, we won't lose,

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.540
we'll get it, we'll get
into the land of Israel.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.160
And this kibbutz was
called Ha-Ma'pil.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.800
We will get into the land
of Israel, we will do it.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.290
If we wait too long there'll be
no Jewish people to bring there.

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:13.730
So, these were the early
Zionists and remember she

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:15.620
and her husband were
part of this group

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.670
who illegally brought
Jews to Palestine.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:22.660
So, they went to this kibbutz
which was part of Ha-Ma'pil those

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.570
who believe that there's a
chance for the children of Israel

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:27.360
to get together on the road.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.660
Yeah.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.230
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about
your translation process,

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.540
I mean do you work with her, do
you show them to her [inaudible]?

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.840
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Repeat
the question.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.040
&gt;&gt; Zelda Kahan Newman: Okay Adam's
question is do I work with Rivka.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:42.490
So, at the very beginning I showed
her what we [foreign language],

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.970
a pile of poems.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:46.270
And I was really concerned

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:49.000
because she did not think anybody
had done a good job so far.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.960
And she looked at poem after poem
and she had not encouraged me

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.090
at all, we had never known each
other and she said it's a waste

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:57.950
of your time and mine, no
one's ever done an okay job.

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:01.410 position:56%
And after she looked at I don't
know the 20th translation she looked

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:04.110
at me and she said,
[foreign language] in Hebrew.

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:07.820
So, we became friends and she
thought I did an okay job.

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.110
But when I lived when I taught
at the [inaudible] University

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:13.780
of New York she would
send me poems in the mail

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.620
and then I'd write her back
or I'd see her when I came

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.070
to Israel and we'd discuss it.

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:21.240
And every now and then there's
a word that can be either a noun

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.160
or a verb and I'll say, you
know, which one is best.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:27.890
And we sit together often just
by ourselves in [inaudible]

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:32.800
and I show her my translations
and we talk, we shoot the breeze.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.210
She tells me the background
of her poems sometimes,

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:39.150
it's wonderful hours I
have memories of just her

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.430
and me alone in this big room.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:47.240
Not always has she seen every
translation, but she trusts me

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.450 position:56%
and I hope I don't betray her trust.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:55.250 position:56%
On the whole she knows most of these
and I myself am not happy, you know,

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:58.520
with some things I'll
change it next time.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.200
There's no perfection
in this business.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.260
&gt;&gt; Has anybody done a
biography of her and if not,

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.640
have you thought maybe that
would be one of your projects?

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.120
&gt;&gt; Zelda Kahan Newman: Well right
now I want to finish the one

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:15.830
on Kadya Molodowsky who had
some things about her life

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:18.160
that were pretty much not known.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:24.670
Rivka is very not, she's very
careful about people not talking

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:29.030
about her, she's a very
nonassertive person, very private.

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:34.440
And when one person wanted to do a
movie about her she was hesitant.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.380
If there's something she
doesn't want to talk about,

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:40.520
doesn't talk about the details
of what happened in the camps,

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:44.670
she does not want to and you have
to respect her privacy on that.

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:46.720
With me she's told me
parts about her life,

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:51.330
but I think she wants her poetry to
speak for her that's my impression.

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:54.950
That she doesn't especially want
a biography she wants her poems

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:56.450
to speak for her.

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:59.710
I could be wrong, but
that's my impression.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:05.100
I would her ask about it, but right
now poetry she wants and she put

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:08.040
out a book in 2016, we're in 2016.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:11.000
She's 90 years old and she
published a book this year.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.300
Yeah.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:15.030
&gt;&gt; So two more questions,
have her poems been translated

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:16.660
to other languages?

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:21.300
And then also given that
she has so many books

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.310 position:56%
out how are you able to [inaudible]?

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:24.610
&gt;&gt; Zelda Kahan Newman: Okay,

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:26.120
so the first question is has she
been published in other languages?

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.730
She has indeed in many,
I don't know how many,

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:32.290
but I know her Hebrew
translator is named [inaudible]

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.690
who is a dear friend
of hers and I would

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:36.880
like to think he is
a friend of mine.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.180
He teaches [inaudible].

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:44.190
He's her Hebrew translator, but
she's been translated into German

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:48.560
and into Swedish and I
think Korean and French.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.490
If you look at the back of the
book there's a woman named Sabine

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:57.250
who has done her translations into
French, there's a website for it

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.040
and you can see it online.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.020
I don't know how many,
but quite a number.

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.490
Your second question was?

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:07.780
&gt;&gt; How are you able to [inaudible]?

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Zelda Kahan Newman: Yes, and each
time i think oh I didn't include

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.520
that one oh, what a pity.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.940
I can't even decide really,
there's some that are favorites.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:21.670
The poem about friendship
is one of my favorites.

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.880
There are some that I really love,

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.420
the last poem of the
sleep [foreign language].

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.780
Some I love for their rhythm,

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.600
some for their sense,
they're all beautiful.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.570 position:56%
It's hard, it's almost like deciding

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:36.370
between your children
it's very difficult.

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:39.830
I don't know how I decided,

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:45.650
it was what I thought would
give enough of a range.

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:50.080
She has one poem called [foreign
language] which is what we call

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.380
in Yiddish [foreign language].

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:55.280
It doesn't sound like she's this
woman of sweetness and light,

00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:00.370
but she knows how to answer I
don't know what to say with a barb,

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:03.250
but she has all kinds of,
she's an honest person.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:07.350
And when she feels it's
necessary to let someone know,

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:12.550
someone who she says at their
heart lies a stone not exactly a

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:14.330
compliment, so it's hard.

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:17.150
I tried to do one like
that so that you know

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:19.200
that it isn't all wonderful.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.880
And she's a woman whose known pain.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:26.180
I didn't include the one poem she
considers her political poem, one.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.140
I once said to Rivka,
you know, you don't write

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:30.150
about politics, she
said oh I did once.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:31.810
I said what was that, it's the poem

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:36.110
about we should never
give out a death sentence.

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.810
That's the poem we should
never have a death sentence.

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:41.550
And you might think it's because
we're all human, we're all created

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:43.510
in God's image, no such thing.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:46.770
We should never punish anyone,
give them a punishment of death

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:51.340
because life itself is painful,
let them live, let them suffer.

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.060
So, you never know what
she's going to say.

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:56.180
That's what she considers
her one political poem.

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.580
Yeah, you had a question.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:58.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.680
&gt;&gt; Zelda Kahan Newman: Uh-huh.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:05.130
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:12.080
Yeah okay, so in the 1960's, early
1960's, she went to [inaudible]

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:17.170 position:56%
and she went through Poland on
their way home from the Soviet Union

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:20.470
and she has poems there and
they are extremely difficult,

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:21.770
one at [inaudible] gravesite.

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:25.530
It's so hard to translate, I tried.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:29.660
But you have a word like [foreign
language] you can't translate

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.380
that with one word.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:38.570
You know they talk about [foreign
language], it requires paragraphs.

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:44.470
So, I couldn't include that because
it's just not easily translated.

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:49.080
Those were the ones which
were the references.

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.690
She has a poem in this book

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:55.680 position:56%
which I think the reprises Archibald
McLeish, a poem should be palpable

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:59.090
and mute as a globed fruit
and she has one here,

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:06.090
which is a poem is a plum and
its structure is like that

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:09.110
and its sense is like that.

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:12.660
So, she's pretty smart and
she reads an awful lot,

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.950
but she really mentions
them by name.

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:18.800
And she has a few references
to Sutzkever, so yeah.

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:21.910
But you've got to know enough to
know just as you've got to know

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.210
that when she says
[foreign language],

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:25.840
it's a reference to
[foreign language].

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:30.170
You know she says a
lot with very little,

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:33.110
so the more you know
the more you understand.

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:40.400
&gt;&gt; I came late I'm afraid apologies
so perhaps you mentioned this.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.030
Was she published by
Sutzkever [inaudible]?

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:45.860
&gt;&gt; Zelda Kahan Newman: Absolutely,
that's how I got to know about her.

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.780
I had a subscription to
the Golden [inaudible]

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:51.400
and every time I saw a
poem of hers it moved me.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.980
So, I would sit when the kids
were quiet or I had some free time

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.770
and I'd do a translation
and then after years

00:52:56.770 --> 00:53:00.970
of accumulating translations I
-- actually I call the kibbutz.

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:05.000
I went to the library, those days
libraries are not what they are now

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.270
and I looked it up and it said she
lived in kibbutz I the library.

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:12.300
Those days libraries is not what
they are now and he looked it up

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.900
and it said she lived
in kibbutz Ha-Ma'pil.

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:21.120
When I called kibbutz Ha-Ma'pil
they said, oh Rivka left years ago,

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:26.080
but if it's Tuesday she's at the
dentist and if it's Wednesday she's

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.440
in [inaudible] and they were right.

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:32.930
So, I knew her from her work
in the Golden [inaudible],

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:37.440
not from her collections
I didn't know those.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.670
And then of course,
later I got copies.

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:40.970
Yeah.

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:43.580
&gt;&gt; Did you consider having
footnotes for some of the harder?

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.830
&gt;&gt; Zelda Kahan Newman: The only,
there is one footnote in here.

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:49.350
Yeah, there's one here which
is perhaps I should have

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:50.650
on the [foreign language].

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:53.980 position:56%
There's one footnote here and that's
for the word [foreign language]

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:59.400
because the editor said well who
knows what [foreign language] is.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.290
Okay, so we had a little footnote
about [foreign language], but no,

00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:04.910
I didn't and perhaps
that's a mistake.

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:06.210
I don't know.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:07.990
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Any
other questions?

00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:10.260
Well thank you all
for coming and I want

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.560
to thank Rivka, it was a wonderful.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.860
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
