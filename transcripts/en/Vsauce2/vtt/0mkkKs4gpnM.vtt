00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.049
A new thin film of quantum dots covers glass
and transforms windows into solar panels.

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.000
The dots have a lifespan of 14 years and right
now they’re trying to raise their energy

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.410
conversion efficiency from 1.9% to a more
practical 6%.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.790
And Kengoro is a biohumanoid robot from the
University of Tokyo that cools itself by sweating.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.790
Vsauce!

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.790
Kevin here.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.320
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.620
Kernel is developing a memory prosthesis.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.010
The new company has invested $100 million
to further over two decades of neuroprosthetic

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.340
research by biomedical engineer Theodore Berger.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.260
While company founder Bryan Johnson has longterm
science fiction goals like the ability to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.550
download knowledge or exchange memories, the
current plan is to help people suffering from

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.550
memory disorders.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.699
For instance, using an algorithm to instruct
electrodes involved in longterm memory to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.449
restore the circuitry in people suffering
from Alzheimer's.

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.620
Boosting brains to learn a thousand times
faster would happen sometime down the road.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.610
A new hybrid power fabric uses solar as well
as mechanical movement to harness power.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.620
Solar cells are made into micro-cable structures
and woven with nanogenerators to create the

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.150
smart fabric.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.470
Not only does it charge using ambient light
but the mechanical movement allows wind and

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.030
human motion to gather energy.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.060
And researchers from the Georgie Institute
of Technology say the fabric could be used

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.590
in tents, wearable garments like scarves or
curtains.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.360
Navdy is like projecting your smartphone onto
your windshield.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.700
The headup display is the world’s first
augmented driving device that allows GPS navigation

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.150
and phone access without taking your eyes
off the road.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.281
The steering wheel dial allows for scrolling
through or skipping songs and zooming in and

00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:57.610
out of the map while gesture controls handle
accepting and dismissing phone calls.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.890
And after beginning pre-orders two years ago
they just started shipping this week.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.880
A brain implant allows you to feel with a
robotic hand.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.209
Neuroengineers at the University Of Pittsburg
used magnetic resonance imaging to map the

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.829
regions of the patient’s brain associated
with imagining a touch on different parts

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:16.829
of the hand.

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.010
After getting used to the system the patient
could recognize the location of the touches

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.950
on a robotic hand with 100 percent accuracy
but it’s still very early on in its proof

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.020
of principle stage.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.360
Sundrop is the world’s first farm growing
vegetables in the desert using seawater.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.599
15,000 tonnes of tomatoes a year are now being
grown Australia using 23,000 mirrors that

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.209
generate solar power and seawater from the
Spencer Gulf.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.739
The solar power is used to desalinate or remove
the salt from the seawater to create freshwater

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.870
for the crops.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.480
They’re now planning to create these farms
in Portugal and the United States.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.249
These E-paper displays are like reusable digital
post-it notes.

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:05.629
Microsoft Research developed the display to
run on office lights using a solar panel on

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:06.629
the back.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.049
It can communicate with other e-paper displays
via bluetooth, they can be updated with an

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.969
app and have a sticky back to attach to stuff
easily.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.930
Right now this is just a prototype and isn’t
commercially available.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.000
Yet.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.150
Drones can be charged in mid-air using technology
from Nikola Tesla.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.959
Scientists from Imperial College London use
inductive coupling, demonstrated by Tesla,

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.700
which allows for wireless exchange of power
between copper coils.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.469
They’re about a year away from making this
commercially available and say that this technology

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:42.879
could also be used in healthcare devices as
well as interplanetary missions.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:48.719
Finally, Stanford engineers have developed
gecko-inspired grippers to grab and move space

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:49.719
debris.

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.919
I’ve learned from gecko lizards to make
small adhesive grippers that adhere to smooth

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:59.159
surfaces such as solar panels and fuel tanks
with really little attachment and detachment

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.239
effort.

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.109
Similar functions have been achieved with
the curved gripper.

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.209
Little attachment force, strong grip and clean
detachment.

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.559
I’m gonna leave you with a body movement
activated mid-air display - and as always

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.320
- thanks for watching.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:38.259
 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:42.599
There are those who say today that opportunities
have ceased to exist.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.419
Things are finished.

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.590
We have everything and not enough.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.610
For years, the oilmen cursed gasoline.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.150
It was a troublesome byproduct and they dumped
millions of gallons of it into the rivers

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.900
and streams.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.319
Then, science discovered that gasoline was
liquid horsepower.

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:06.919
In any one of thousands of test tubes of today
there may be a million job opportunities for

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:07.919
tomorrow.

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.030
And the industrial scientists and engineers
are the pioneers of present day America.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.000
The creators of progress.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.800
Of new industries and new jobs.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.960
It’s a bewildering future alright, not because
there are no new frontiers but progress.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:32.220
 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.340
Hey I have a couple of really cool announcements
- first of all I made a series with Google

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.330
Arts &amp; Culture channel called Hyper History.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.080
It’s a super quick look at really fascinating
things throughout history including topics

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.680
from Duck-Billed Platypuses to The Missing
Link.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.460
So click here or the click the link at the
top of this video’s description to watch

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.909
all five episodes.

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:55.789
That’s five more episodes of me talking
about stuff that you should really check out.

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.979
Also, Curiosity Box #1 is almost gone forever.

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.150
Hang on.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.949
It’s heavy because it’s full of awesome,
great stuff.

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.740
But like I said there’s only a couple of
days left to go until this baby is gone forever

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.720
and you can no longer get all of the exclusive
items available like this great Vsauce T-shirt

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.199
of a deepsea diver climbing a tree pointing
at the Vsauce constellation.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.110
This actually glows in the dark.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.240
It’s ridiculously cool.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.520
So if you want to get in on the ground floor
of The Curiosity Box you have to order

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.720
right now.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.400
Okay?

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.700
Like, right now.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.449
Like, CuriosityBox.com.

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.869
You have to go there and order right now.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.300
After I say the word now.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.400
Now.
