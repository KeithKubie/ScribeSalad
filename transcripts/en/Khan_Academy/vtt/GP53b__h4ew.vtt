00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.170
Where we left off
in the last video,

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.420
I think we were getting a
reasonably good appreciation

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.910
for how huge the
sun is, especially

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.110
relative to the Earth, and
how far the Earth is away

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.750
from the sun.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.180
That most of these diagrams that
we see in science textbooks--

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.590
they don't give justice.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.550
In fact, when I showed
this sun over here

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.650
that was about five
or six inches across,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.242
I said Earth would be just this
little speck, about 40 feet.

00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:28.450
It wouldn't be this distance.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.574
It would be about 40 feet
to the left or the right.

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:35.119
Or its orbit would have a
radius of about 40 feet.

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:36.535
You wouldn't even
notice it if you

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:38.070
were looking at this
thing over here.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.653
It would be this
little speck orbiting

00:00:39.653 --> 00:00:42.030
at this huge, huge distance.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.682
If you look at
this sun over here,

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:46.140
if I were to draw
the whole sun, it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.490
looks like it would have a
diameter of about 20 inches.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.330
So in this situation, this
Earth right here-- and this

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.530
is drawn to scale--
this Earth would not

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.960
be anywhere near this close.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.690
It would be about 200
feet that way, or about 60

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.040
or 70 meters, 60 meters.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.700
So you can imagine if the
sun was this size, sitting

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.460
on something like
a football field,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.880
this little speck of an Earth,
this little thing right here,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.440
would be sitting on the other
40-yard line, 60 meters away.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.350
So you wouldn't even notice it.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.050
You might notice
this from a distance,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.030
but you wouldn't even
see this thing over here.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.830
And the other planets
are even further.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:27.850
Well, not all of
the other planets.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.016
Obviously, you have Mercury.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.779
I think most of us are
familiar with these.

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:35.570
But I'll just list them
here, just in case.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.080
That's Mercury.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.160
This is Venus.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.550
Mercury is the smallest of
the planets where it's not

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.850
debated whether it's a planet.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.390
Pluto is the smallest,
but some people

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.720
debate whether it's
really a planet or just

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.969
a large solar body
or a dwarf planet

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.260
or any of those type of things.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.719
But then you have Venus,
probably the closest in size

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:54.260
to the Earth.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.430
Or it is the closest
in size to the Earth.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.590
And then you have Mars.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.870
And then you have Jupiter.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.600
And just to give a
sense of, once again,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.550
how far these things
are, if I were to go back

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.720
to the analogy of this
being the size of the sun,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.360
then Jupiter is five
times further than Earth.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.340
So this would be-- If I were to
actually do the scale distance,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.730
this would be 300 meters away.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.760
So if I had a nice, big,
maybe medicine-balled-size sun

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.567
right over here, maybe
basketball-sized.

00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:27.150
A little bit bigger
than a basketball,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.240
this looks on my screen--
then this little thing

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.260
that's smaller than
a ping pong ball,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.600
I would put this three
football fields away.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.670
That's how far Jupiter is.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.990
And then Saturn's about
twice as far as that.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.980
Saturn is about nine
times the distance.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.180
So let me make it clear.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.220
The Earth is one astronomical
unit away from the sun,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.720
roughly.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.880
Its distance changes.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.030
It's not a perfectly
circular orbit.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.950
Jupiter is approximately
a little bit--

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.830
5 plus astronomical
units-- a little bit

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.560
more than five
times the distance

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.140
of the sun to the Earth.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.210
And Saturn is approximately
nine astronomical units,

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.440
or nine times the distance
from the sun to the Earth.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.732
So once again, this would be
nine football fields away.

00:03:13.732 --> 00:03:16.023
Or another way to think about
it would be, essentially,

00:03:16.023 --> 00:03:16.840
a kilometer away.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.380
If we had kind of a
medicine-ball-size sun,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.720
this little smaller
than a ping pong

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.277
balled Saturn would
be a kilometer away.

00:03:26.277 --> 00:03:27.735
And I just want to
really reiterate

00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:30.090
that because you never
visualize it that way.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.554
Because just for
the sake of being

00:03:31.554 --> 00:03:32.970
able to draw it
on a page, you see

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.990
diagrams that look like this.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.880
And they really don't give
you a sense of how small

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.850
these planets are
relative to the sun,

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.460
and especially relative to
their distance from the sun.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:52.340
And then after Saturn, you
have Uranus and then Neptune.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.850
And obviously, these
guys are even further.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.550
And just to give
you a sense, it's

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.960
very easy to start talking about
galaxies and universes and all

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.750
of the-- or the universe.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.870
But I really just
want to get-- already,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.720
what we've talked about, we're
talking about huge distances,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.720
huge scale.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.410
We already talked about that it
would take a jet plane 17 years

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.850
to travel from the
Earth to the sun.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.150
Multiply that by
five, about 100 years

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.940
to go from Jupiter
to the sun, 200 years

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.140
to go from Saturn to the sun.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.140
So you could have had Abraham
Lincoln get into a jet plane,

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.270
and if he left from
Saturn, he still

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.050
would not have
gotten to the sun.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.931
So these are huge,
huge distances.

00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:39.930
But we're not done with
the solar system, there.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.590
Just to give a sense of
scale-- so this right here,

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.430
that's the sun.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.220
And each of these
planets are actually

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.520
narrower than these orbits.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.020
So they just draw
these orbits here,

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.460
but you wouldn't actually
even see the actual planets

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.160
here at this type of a scale.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.670
But this is one astronomical
unit right over here,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.260
the distance from
the sun to the Earth.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.240
Then you have Mars.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.790
Then you have the asteroid belt.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.644
There you have
the asteroid belt,

00:05:06.644 --> 00:05:08.810
which also has some pretty
big things in it, itself.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.570
And it has these things that
are kind of considered almost

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.040
dwarf planets,
things like Ceres.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.540
You could look those
type things up.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.582
And then you have
Jupiter out here.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:19.040
And once again, we said it
would take 100 years, or roughly

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.720
100 years, for a jet plane to
get from Jupiter to the sun.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.340
But even if you
take this whole box

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.410
here-- which is a huge amount
of distance, of roughly about

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.230
five astronomical units-- it
would take about 40 minutes

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.230
for light to get from
the sun to Jupiter.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.150
So this is a huge,
huge distance.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.140
But even this huge
distance-- we can put it

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.050
into this little
box right over here.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:55.104
So this whole box right over
there can be fit into this box.

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:57.020
And you need to do that
in order to appreciate

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.140
the orbits of the outer planets.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.494
And so on this scale, Earth
and Venus and Mercury and Mars,

00:06:03.494 --> 00:06:05.410
their orbits look pretty
much-- you can't even

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.420
differentiate them from the sun.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.284
They look so close.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:09.700
They almost look
like they're part

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.574
of the sun when you look
at it on this scale.

00:06:11.574 --> 00:06:13.710
And then you have you
have the outer planets--

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.950
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.830
And they we have a Kuiper belt.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.967
And this is more asteroids, but
these are kind of more frozen.

00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:24.300
And when we think of ice, you
always think of water ice.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.890
But out here, it's so cold.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.980
And it's relatively
getting dark, now,

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.620
because we're pretty
far from the sun

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.994
that things that we normally
associate as gases are going

00:06:31.994 --> 00:06:33.600
to be in their
solid form out here.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.280
So this isn't just
rocky elements.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.150
This will also be things that
we normally associate as gases,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.370
like methane, frozen methane.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.700
But even here, we're not done.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.270
We're not even out of
the solar system yet.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.820
And actually, just to give
you a sense of the scale we're

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.040
operating right here, I
have this chart right here

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.310
from the Voyager mission.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.880
So the Voyager missions--
Voyager 1 and 2-- actually,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.600
Voyager 2 left a little bit
earlier, a month earlier.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.700
Voyager 1 is just
traveling faster.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.977
They left about a
year after I was born

00:07:04.977 --> 00:07:06.810
And their current
velocity, just to give you

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.480
a sense of how fast--
Voyager 1 right here is right

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.340
now traveling at 61,000
kilometers per hour.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.105
That's about 17
kilometers per second.

00:07:23.105 --> 00:07:25.950
The size of a city every
second-- it's going that fast.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:31.060
That's, at least in my mind,
an unfathomably fast velocity.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.120
This thing has been
traveling roughly that fast.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.209
It's been going around planets
and gaining acceleration

00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:37.250
as it went around orbits.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.540
But for most of
the time, it's been

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.910
going at a pretty fast speed.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.057
And just to translate
it to people

00:07:42.057 --> 00:07:43.640
who don't relate to
kilometers, that's

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.390
about 38,000 miles per hour,
so this huge, huge unfathomably

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.640
fast speed.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.570
And it's been doing
it since 1977.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.342
I was learning to walk.

00:07:57.342 --> 00:07:58.800
And when I was
learning to walk, it

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.920
was traveling at this
super fast speed.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.174
And then when I was learning
to talk-- our whole lives,

00:08:04.174 --> 00:08:06.090
when we're sleeping,
everything, we're eating,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.190
I'm in elementary school--
it's still rocketing out

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.592
of the solar system
at roughly this speed.

00:08:11.592 --> 00:08:13.300
Its velocity has
changed, but especially,

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.150
once it got outside
of the planets,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.750
it's been roughly
at this velocity.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.370
So it's just been rocketing out.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.111
And I don't want to say only,
but it's gotten this far.

00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:25.610
If we look at it
on this scale, it's

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.160
gotten about that
far right there.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.011
It's about 115, 116
astronomical units.

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.510
And to give a sense-- so there's
two ways to think about it.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.770
One says, like, wow,
that's really far.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.000
Because we know that
even on this scale,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.650
you can't even
see Earth's orbit.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.309
So this looks like it's a
pretty, pretty far distance.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:47.200
And just to give you a sense of
how far 116 astronomical units

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.140
are, if 2,000 years ago,
Jesus got on a plane--

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.210
I actually cut and
pasted a copy of Jesus,

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.000
just for visualization
purposes--

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.880
but if he'd got on a jet liner
at 1,000 kilometers per hour

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.580
and went straight
in that direction,

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.110
in the direction that Voyager,
Voyager would only just now be

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.900
catching up to Jesus.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.877
So this is a huge, huge,
huge, huge distance.

00:09:09.877 --> 00:09:11.460
But at the same time,
even though it's

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.640
a huge distance, especially
relative to everything

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.890
else we've talked about,
relative to just even

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.030
the outer reaches
of the solar system,

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.770
we're still talking in
terms of a small scale.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.250
So that's how far Voyager is.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.020
And just to give a sense, on
this scale-- so this whole box

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:32.534
over here can be
contained in this box.

00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:34.200
And when you look at
this box, Voyager's

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.850
only gotten about that
far after traveling

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.440
at this unbelievable
velocity for over 30 years,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.464
for about 33 years.

00:09:45.464 --> 00:09:47.880
And just to give you an idea
of these other things, Sedna,

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.730
right here, is a reasonably
large-sized outer solar system

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.440
object.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.710
It's one of the
furthest objects that we

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.310
know of in the solar system.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.190
And it has this very
eccentric orbit.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.900
So it gets-- I don't want to
say relatively close, but not

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.280
unreasonably far away.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.140
And then it gets really
far away from the sun.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.970
But even Sedna's orbit-- so
if I were to look at this,

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:17.180
so this whole box over here can
be contained right over here.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.212
So in this diagram
right here, you

00:10:19.212 --> 00:10:20.420
wouldn't even be able to see.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.630
It would be like a
speck how far Voyager

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:27.950
has traveled in 33 years
at 38,000 miles per hour.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.770
You would not even
be able to notice.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.380
You wouldn't even
notice that distance.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.640
And even though you can't
even notice that distance,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.010
we still have the
sun's influence.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.360
The gravitational pull is
still attracting things to it.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.470
And this right
here, we speculate

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:46.740
that there is the Oort cloud.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.573
And this is where the
comets originate from.

00:10:48.573 --> 00:10:51.670
And this is just a
bunch of frozen gases

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.650
and ice particles
and things like that.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.840
But we're starting to
get to the outer reaches

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.960
of the solar system.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.960
And this distance right here
is about 50,000 astronomical

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.460
units.

00:11:07.807 --> 00:11:09.390
And just to give a
scale-- because you

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.900
hear a lot about light years
and all of that-- light years

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.800
are about 63,000
astronomical units.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.320
So if you go a light
year out from the sun,

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.670
you'll end up in the Oort cloud,
the hypothesized Oort cloud.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.910
And just to give a
sense, another scale,

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.210
the Oort cloud is actually--
most of the planets' orbits

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.130
are roughly in the same plane.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.560
But this right here is
the orbit of the planets.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.610
And once again, these
lines are drawn too thick.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.200
They're just drawn the
thinnest possible so

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.575
that you can see them, but
they're still drawn too thick.

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.820
And this gets us all the
way to the Kuiper belt.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.030
But all of this over
here, so all the way

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.840
out to the Kuiper
belt, all the way out

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.850
to all of the major
planets-- this

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.760
is Pluto's orbit
right over here.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.750
This whole diagram is only
sitting in right over there.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.900
You can barely see it.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.720
This whole diagram is
just that dot in this.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.922
And then you can see the
Oort cloud all around it.

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:04.380
And it's more of
a spherical cloud.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.338
And we think it exists.

00:12:05.338 --> 00:12:08.430
Obviously, it's hard to observe
things at that distance.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.180
So hopefully, that gives
you a beginning sense

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.555
of the scale of
the solar system.

00:12:12.555 --> 00:12:14.971
And what's really going to
blow your mind-- if this hasn't

00:12:14.971 --> 00:12:17.320
blown your mind already--
is that this whole thing's

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.040
going to start
looking like a speck.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.950
When you even just look at the
local area around our galaxy,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.220
much less the galaxy, much
less the universe as a whole.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.530
Anyway, I don't want
to get-- well, anyway.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.540
This is starting to get crazy.
