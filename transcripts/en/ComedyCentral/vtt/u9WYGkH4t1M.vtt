00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.872
Last night's RNC speech from
Botox vampire Melania Trump was

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:07.508
monumentally important.

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:09.576
If Donald Trump is elected,
she'd be America's first lady,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.913
and possibly
planet earth's final lady.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.615
Unfortunately for her,

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:17.851
diligent Internet sleuths
discovered that she flat-out

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:20.087
ripped off
a Michelle Obama speech.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.156
Take a look.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.259
The values that you work hard
for what you want in life.

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.561
Like you work hard
for what you want in life.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.263
-That your word is your bond.
-That your word is your bond.

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.797
And you do what you say.

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.266
That you do
what you say you're gonna do.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.103
-That you treat people... -That
you treat people with respect.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.505
-...with dignity and respect.
-They taught...

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.941
-Because we want our children
-Because we want our children

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.277
-and all children in this nation
to know -in this nation to know

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.444
-that the only limit
-that the only limit

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:45.612
to the height
of your achievement

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.080
to your achievements

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:48.549
-is the reach of your dreams
-is the strength of your dreams

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:49.750
and your willingness
to work hard for them.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.818
and your willingness
to work for them.

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.721
Yeah! It...

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.991
-(applause and cheering)
-Or no.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.562
Actually, we didn't show
the whole thing.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:02.996
Melania Trump's speech
does divert

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.531
at the end where she goes,

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:08.802
-"Blah, blah!" Uh...
-(laughter)

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:11.004
(like <i>Sesame Street's</i> Count):
One. One monotone trophy wife.

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:14.141
-Two. Two monotone trophy wives.
-(applause)

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:16.643
Three. Three monotone
trophy wives.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:20.280
-(applause and cheering)
-(laughing) -(thunder sound)

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:21.915
Oh, well, really.

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:23.650
She's the third.

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:26.887
She's also inexplicably cribbed
a popular Internet meme.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.690
Comedians, did she--
A: Rickroll everyone?

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:31.325
B: Tell a heart-wrenching tale

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:34.328
about two girls forced
to share one cup?

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.363
C: Refer to life
in small-town Slovenia

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:38.398
as "Oppa Gangnam Style"?

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:41.535
-Dave Holmes.
-She seems like a rickroller.

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:44.738
-I'm going with "A."
-Let's find out. Let's find out.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.507
♪

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.609
MELANIA:
He will never, ever give up.

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:50.611
And most importantly,

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:54.214
he will never,
ever let you down.

00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:55.916
-♪ Never gonna give you up
-LAPKUS: Oh, my God. -Yeah.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.619
-♪ Never gone let you down...
-HOLMES: Here's the thing.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:02.122
-Here's the thing.
-Yeah. And by the way...

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.658
we do have to thank...
we do have to thank Swog Blog,

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.260
who made this video
and put that all together.

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:08.228
-Dave, what were you gonna say?
-Yeah. But here's the thing,

00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:10.931
history has proven that he
<i>will</i> run around and desert you.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:11.031
