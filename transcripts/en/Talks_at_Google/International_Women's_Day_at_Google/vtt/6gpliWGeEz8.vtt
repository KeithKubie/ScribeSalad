Megan: Welcome to Women at Google.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.160
We have the extraordinary Eve Ensler here
today.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.320
Eve is a playwright, an actress, an activist,
and an amazing world leader.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.779
She has many books and her most recent book
is this incredible book "I Am An Emotional

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.199
Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around
the World".

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.830
And I've great news that they just got a call
that eight days in, it just hit the New York

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.500
Times Bestseller List so [applause].

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.099
Yay, go Eve!!

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:39.620
You know, Eve has really pioneered stopping
violence and starting to help us stop wasting

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.000
talent and so we're gonna have a conversation.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.469
I want to play one - you guys all know the
search on campaign that Google is providing

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:48.490
and we had that Super Bowl ad -- it's the
one called "Parisian Love".

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.719
But I don't know if anyone's seen the high
school girl one so I wanted to play it.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.649
[Commercial starts playing in background]

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.010
Cool.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:35.560
So starting a robotics club -- near and dear
to our hearts at Google.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.560
Welcome Eve Ensler.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.560
[applause]

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.560
Eve Ensler: Hi.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.860
Ow, I just poked myself with the microphone.
[laughs]

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.430
Megan: So I don't know.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.409
Let's start with high school girls.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.740
Talk about the book.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.909
I mean, you - with "The Vagina Monologues"
you - people tell you stories.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.229
You've been all around the world and people
tell you things and you were able to put that

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.750
together and bring that to everybody.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.609
And in this case, you've taken stories you've
heard and changed it into a fictionalized

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:08.609
version.

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:09.609
Is that right?

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:10.609
So talk a little bit.

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:11.609
Eve Ensler: Well, "The Vagina Monologues"
was a fictional version.

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.580
I don't want anybody - they were not interviews.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.470
I think people always misunderstood that.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.920
I listen to people, I watch, I pay attention,
and then I create fiction out of those things.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.450
So - but this particular book, I've had a
great opportunity over the last 12 years with

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.910
V-Day to travel the world.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.740
I've probably been in about 60 countries and
I've gotten to meet amazing girls everywhere

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.060
and I think in the process of this journey
I discovered that there were themes across

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.150
the planet that were really linking girls
and those themes are the reason I ended up

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.150
writing this book.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.310
And one of those themes is it seems to me
that it doesn't matter where you're a girl;

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.310
there is a cultural mandate or a societal
mandate or a familiar mandate or a fashion

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.100
mandate to please somebody and that the verb
of girls is for the most part to please, in

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.290
one way or another.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.410
And it shows up in every different culture
in a completely different way.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.690
I mean, you have cultures where getting purple
Uggs is the way you please and if you buy

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.250
that perfect pair of purple Uggs, you will
be accepted by the tribe and you won't be

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.260
alienated and outside and if you don't buy
the purple Uggs, you will be destroyed.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.740
And I've met those girls who didn't get the
purple Uggs because they couldn't afford the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.270
purple Uggs and they were outsiders and they
were "nobody".

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:40.130
Or there's mandates in places like Beverly
Hills or suburbs where if you are really,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:47.320
really, really, really skinny and you look
like a rendition of Barbie, you will be in

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.430
and then you go across the planet and we have
female genital mutilation.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.940
If you have your clitoris cut, you are part
of a tradition and that will get you inside

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.640
the tribe and keep you in the tribe.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.750
And then you go to Palestine where sometimes
being a suicide bomber will keep you in the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.750
tribe.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.370
And then you go to Israel where joining the
Army - I mean, it just seems like every single

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.800
culture has a particular prescription for
how girls are supposed to behave, what they're

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800
supposed to do.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.359
And if you do that you'll be accepted and
loved and if you don't, you'll be exiled.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.590
And so it just became this amazing kind of
collage of stories where I would hear girls

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.520
talking about various ways that they were
either resisting those mandates, capitulating

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.560
and feeling bad about themselves, capitulating
and being lost, or absolutely refusing and

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.560
living lives as refusers and outsiders.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.020
And that was kind of the basis of the book.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.840
And I think the other thing that I've seen,
and certainly know myself as a teenage girl,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.250
because I really do feel I'm about 15 even
though I'm dressed in this body and I look

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.250
older I think but I really feel that I'm a
teenage girl.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.599
When I was younger, people were always telling
me, "You're too emotional, you're too intense,

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.599
you're too dramatic, you're too alive, you're
too in my face, you're too, you're too, you're

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:06.599
too, you're too."

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.319
And I think that's true for a lot of us and
I don't think it's just girls by the way.

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:16.449
I think boys from the time they're born are
taught, "You're too emotional, you're too

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:24.069
weepy, you're too sensitive. You take things
too seriously."

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.800
And I think for boys, it gets cut off at a
much earlier point.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.499
But I think for girls, they're allowed to
go a little longer.

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:36.510
And then they begin to feel bad about their
level of passion and their level of intensity

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.520
and their level of emotionality.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.009
And I think this book is really a call for
girls and for the girl in all of us, to reign

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.600
and to be supreme and for us to really be
our emotional, authentic, outrageous, true

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.090
selves.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.090
And I was just at a luncheon before here where
a group of women were talking about the fact

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.460
that they were just all beginning to talk
about how they've always been emotional and

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.020
their whole lives, people told them they were
too emotional and now they were going to be

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.689
emotional again and they've had it and it's
just funny when it begins to get uncapped,

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:06.159
what begins to get released.

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.409
Megan: It's so exciting. I think.

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.800
It's funny cause - I don't know, a couple
of years ago, I think it was a year ago, we

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800
got interviewed.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.749
Somebody thought that there was a connection,
which it turned out there was, between Google

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:27.659
and V-Day because we were both ten years old
and so I think one of the things I'm excited

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:30.529
about technology is sort of helping.

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:33.900
We're seeing it all over the world and how
individuals are able to express themselves,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.100
whether it's things going on in Iran or whatever.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.580
So I'm excited for the possibility for women
and girls through technology and allowing

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.699
people to interconnect to each other and whether
it's in a non-technology setting like this

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:52.219
lunch and sort of hearing these stories and
re-empowering yourself to be emotional or

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:55.990
be however you are or whether it's through
technical places that you get.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.710
Eve Ensler: Well, I also think that in terms
of Google and V-Day -- you know V-Day - V

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.690
stands for vagina and it stands for victory
over violence and it stands for Valentine's

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.879
Day but it also stand for virtual.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:12.330
I mean, V-Day at our core is a virtual movement.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.449
We don't have an office.

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.810
We only exist in virtual space and in the
heart and minds and vaginas of people all

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:24.490
over the world and vagina friendly men I might
add and what I've really seen is how quickly

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:31.210
this movement has spread in 12 years which
would never have happened without the Internet.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.210
12 years ago there was one event in New York
City.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:40.779
This year, there are 1,800 places doing 5,000
events in 130 countries.

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:45.879
Now that happened because one person - you
know, it's vagina madness.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:51.580
It's spreading all over the planet [laughs
from audience] and I was just in UC Irvine

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.129
on Sunday night and when they started doing
V-Day's there, the Vagina Monologues, they

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:56.599
were in one little room.

00:07:56.599 --> 00:08:00.309
They couldn't put it in the newspaper, people
were like "please go away".

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:04.469
And when I was there Sunday night, there were
1,200 people in a near stadium.

00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:07.240
It was the pick of the week, it was totally
diverse.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:16.229
It was every age, every ethnic group, every
size, every shape, tons of men and I thought,

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.370
'The movement's growing'.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:22.919
We're really, 12 years later, vaginas have
infiltrated everywhere and …[laughs]

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.430
Megan: It's true.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.949
It's a good thing [laughs].

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:35.600
One of the things that's been exciting to
watch in the technology industry is actually

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.200
if you go vagina's infiltrating route, if
you look at the decades of the computer industry,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.520
you can see women coming in more and more
into the companies.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.840
And I think at Google we have a lot of women
in leadership and I think if you look say

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.531
a decade earlier at Apple or Microsoft, maybe
two decades earlier, they have less and you

00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:59.040
look to Facebook who's younger than us and
they more Twitter and so the boys are always

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.470
there but the women are there too now.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.540
So that's very exciting to watch.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.340
Let's talk a little bit more about some of
the things you were saying at TED India and

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:14.320
what I think is sort of the gift of girls
and the gift of your inner girl in a way and

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.320
you were talking about the girl gene or the
girl cells.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.660
The girl cells that need to infiltrate everybody.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.870
Eve Ensler: Yeah. Well, I still have no idea
why TED keeps inviting me back to speak because

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.500
I'm not a scientist, I'm not a biologist,
I'm not a physicist, I'm not an astronomer

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.090
and I keep going, 'Okay, vaginas, outer space,
okay?'

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.370
I'm just trying to make the connections.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:40.881
But whenever I go and if you've ever spoken
at TED or think about speaking at TED, it's

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:44.430
really intimidating because you think, 'Okay,
these are the smartest people in the world

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:49.890
and what am I doing here?'
So I decided for my TED India speech, that

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.440
I was going to be really like scientific and
I was going to think about cells and genes.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.810
And so I devised this whole talk on the girl
cell and that we all have girl cells inside

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:04.520
of us and it really was a fantastically exciting
thing to begin to work on because I started

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:10.270
to think about the fact that we all really
do have girl cells and boys and women.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:15.170
And I think sometimes in men, it's more developed,
the girl cell, then it is in women, I think

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.980
we all have our - but I started to think like
what is a girl cell and what are the characteristics

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.190
of girl cells.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:27.450
And I was thinking compassion, passion, intuition,
wildness, outrage, revolution.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.520
I was just going through all of that and so
I gave this talk at TED just about how each

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:38.710
of us have a girl cell and how in men I think
this tyranny of patriarchy and the tyranny

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.510
of masculinity has in some ways really hurt
men far more than it's hurt women because

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.670
I think to grow up a boy means that you can't
express your tenderness.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:51.020
And that to some degree you learn very early
on you have to disassociate from your heart

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.630
and that you can't ever be lost and you can't
not know things and you can't ask for directions,

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.460
and you can't -- like you always have to be
on and I think so many boys that I've met

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:07.100
and men I've met over my travels, the things
men have told me just about the legacy of

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:13.760
not being able to be tender and the legacy
of not being able to be lost and have time

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.290
has really hurt them and damaged them.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.810
And so when I gave this talk at TED, I was
talking about all of us releasing our girl

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.630
 - and there's a lot of men at TED so I had
no idea how this talk was going to be received.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:28.980
It was a little nerve wracking and at the
end it was amazing to see how many men came

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.460
up to me and particularly Indian men who were
like, 'My inner girl thanks you, my inner

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.460
girl thanks you'.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:40.030
And they were just so grateful and one man
said, "You know, my whole life I tell my wife

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.650
we have to have boys, we have to have boys,
and I'm going home to make four girls. We're

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.110
going to have girls. We're going to have lots
of girls."

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:55.420
And even the Karmapa, who is the next in line
potential Dalai Lama, who is this incredibly

00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:02.770
beautiful man, was telling me how difficult
it is, in Buddhism even, to honor monks and

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.800
nuns equally and to see, to honor the feminine
and for boys and men to honor the feminine.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:14.520
And we have this private meeting and we just
had a long talk about it and I just got so

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.300
excited by the response of men to this idea.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.200
And now wherever I go men are stopping me
and going, "I'm emotional! And I was emotional

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.260
yesterday!" [laughs]

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:33.760
And in a way, I'm being light about it, but
I think when we are all allowed to feel, to

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.820
feel, to be connected to our hearts.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.810
I spent a lot of time in the Congo and we
have a massive campaign there because in the

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.740
Congo, in eastern Congo, the worst atrocities
in the world are happening to women, in the

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.740
world.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:52.440
And the war, for those of you who don't know
it, in the Congo, has been raging for 12 years.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.170
6 million people have died, 6 million people.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:13:01.570
It's essentially an economic war because the
Congo is one of the richest in mineral countries

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.850
in Africa and they have coltan which goes
into our cell phones and our Playstations.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:11.660
And they have copper and tin and gold and
so many of the Western countries use militias

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:18.510
that get those minerals out of the mines and
then they take them to the West.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.650
And we are all served in our luxurious items
by those minerals but the way the militias

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:28.320
get to take over villages is they use rape
and they use sexual torture and they go into

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.780
villages and they rape very little girls,
six month old babies, eight year old girls,

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.910
eighty year old women.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:41.360
They torture, they rape women in front of
their husbands.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.760
They rape daughters and force husbands and
fathers to rape their daughters, and brothers

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:51.380
to rape their mothers and they do horrible,
horrible acts of crimes that you can't even

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:58.210
imagine and all of that serves to destroy
the community and break up the family and

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.580
absolutely destroy the infrastructure of the
community so that people then flee and then

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.580
the militias take over the mines.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:10.550
So all of us are a part of this same global
story and I've spent a lot of time there in

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.840
the last few years. I've been there a lot
and we're doing a huge campaign which I'll

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.900
tell you more about.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:20.110
And I've interviewed lots and lots of women
and I've heard stories ranging from eight

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.700
year old girls who've been raped by so many
men they have holes inside them where their

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.690
pee just falls out or eighty year old women
who can't lift their leg because it was taken

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.520
over their head when they were raped by seven
men or women who have had their babies cut

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.009
out and been forced to eat them.

00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:42.990
The stories are literally beyond belief and
I think to myself, 'How can men do this?'

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:52.320
Like what happens to a man, and by the way
I don't think all men do this.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.770
I think a small, small portion of men do this
but how does any man do that?

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.770
And the answer is that somewhere along the
way, a man got separated from himself, got

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.770
disassociated from his heart, got separated
from his feelings, forgot about his mother,

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.420
forgot to cherish his mother and honor his
mother and love his mother and that process

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.650
is patriarchy.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:10.200
How do we train boys to go and kill?

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.570
And how do we train soldiers to go and kill
and what is that process about?

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.950
How are most boys brought up on some level
to be soldiers?

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.500
It's really that same process.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:26.380
Megan: I think this point is really important
because there's - the boys are as much - the

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.960
women, the girls are victims but the boys
are victims.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.320
In the gay world, there was a young man murdered
two years ago in Orange County -- a 15 year

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.720
old boy named Lawrence King and he was murdered
for being gay.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.990
And I think in this he was shot by a friend,
a guy from school.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.060
And the tragedy is actually of course him
 -- but also the other kid.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.350
The other kid is now being tried as an adult
 -- he's going to go to prison, he's going

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.820
to be in prison for 25 years, and the system
failed both of them.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.820
Eve Ensler: Exactly.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.890
Megan: It failed both of them; it failed the
kid who shot in not understanding bullying,

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:08.890
indifference, inequality, and, of course,
it failed the kid who was killed.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:14.700
Eve Ensler: And also usually people who are
afraid of being gay or who are attacking gay

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:22.050
people are afraid of their own femininity
and their own vulnerability and their own

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.230
sensitivity because no one has given them
permission to honor their own hearts and honor

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:28.680
their tenderness and you just see it kind
of getting passed down and passed down and

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.680
passed down.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.060
And I think the more I'm in this movement,
and I've been doing this work now for a very

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.120
long time, trying to end violence against
women and girls, like we can't do this without

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.830
boys and men -- it's impossible.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.090
We're not raping ourselves.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:46.360
Unless there's a participation and full participation
of men and boys in this campaign and in this

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:52.860
work, it'll never end and I constantly am
asking, "Where are the good men?"

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.990
Because there's tons of them.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:59.730
Why aren't they standing up to make violence
against women their issue?

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:01.830
Why aren't they honoring their sisters and
their girlfriends and their mothers and their

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.499
daughters and their aunts and all the people
in their families?

00:17:05.499 --> 00:17:09.630
And I think when men and boys really start
committing themselves to this, it will change

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.820
overnight -- it will change overnight.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:20.249
But part of it is how do men risk leaving
the kind of sanctitude of masculinity where

00:17:20.249 --> 00:17:26.659
they have to forfeit their identities and
their security to stand up against this violence.

00:17:26.659 --> 00:17:30.470
And I can only share that when I first started
talking about vaginas it wasn't like everybody

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.289
was happy about it. [laughs from audience]

00:17:32.289 --> 00:17:35.240
It wasn't like, 'Oh goody, the vaginas are
here.'

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:42.039
That never happened and in a way, I think,
for men to stand up, it requires a similar

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:47.840
kind of 'I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna be brave',
and then trust that the rest of the men are

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.980
going to follow.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:54.830
Megan: I think it's extraordinary how - if
you can get - yeah, how do we engage people

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.340
and how do we pull them over.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.720
I want to stay with Congo.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.519
So we have a small team that's going to join
a UN group and it's gonna be in eastern Congo

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:09.280
in about two weeks and our initial focus is
going to be related to mapping and geo things

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.249
that we're particularly skilled at but part
of it is also to learn more about what's going

00:18:14.249 --> 00:18:17.110
on.
You guys are doing extraordinary work at the

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.970
City of Joy which you've created so tell people
about Panzi Hospital and City of Joy and what

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:21.970
might happen.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.749
And, by the way, we've put $50,000 dollars
into helping these guys build a tech center

00:18:24.749 --> 00:18:25.809
Eve Ensler: We're so excited.

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:28.570
Megan: And if anyone wants to help me, we
got to help them do it

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.120
Eve Ensler: We are really, really excited.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.220
Megan: So it's ready for the opening in May.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.590
Eve Ensler: And grateful.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.529
Well, we've been working in the Congo now
with women on the ground and local groups

00:18:38.529 --> 00:18:44.159
on the ground because the way V-Day works
is we've never, ever - V-Day's virtual and

00:18:44.159 --> 00:18:45.240
we're everywhere.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.090
So it would be hard for us to go into anywhere
when we don't really exist in the first place

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:55.480
but there is a kind of central body of people,
and the way we work is that we never go into

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.990
a place and suggest to anybody what they're
supposed to do.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.720
First of all, it works that people do "The
Vagina Monologues" all over the world.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:07.789
They come, they picket, they do it, and then
they translate it into their language and

00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:08.789
into their culture.

00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:12.350
But in terms of supporting people, we support
the work that's going on on the ground and

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.350
we find resources.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.850
We don't direct people what to do; we don't
determine their destinies.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.559
We know that women on the ground know how
to change their lives.

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:22.750
They know what they need to do; they just
don't have the resources to do it.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.389
So in the Congo, when I first went to the
Congo and spent time there interviewing women

00:19:25.389 --> 00:19:33.830
and I did a piece for Glamour, and I just
kind of was - well, to be honest, I was completely

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:34.830
shattered.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:39.539
It was the hardest thing I've ever done, going
to the Congo, and I went because of a man

00:19:39.539 --> 00:19:44.380
named Dr. Denis Mukwege, who is a doctor and
the director of the Panzi Hospital in Bukavu.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:50.370
He's an extraordinary human being and he's
devoted his life to saving women who are being

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.370
raped and tortured in the war.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:57.600
He's sewing up women's vaginas as fast the
militias are ripping them apart and at any

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.690
given time, there are 300 women in Panzi Hospital.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.460
Most of them have fistula which is a hole
between your vagina and your rectum, or your

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:10.409
vagina and your bladder, and a lot of these
women have fistula because so many things

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:16.510
have been shoved inside them -- sticks and
bayonets and many, many penises and they have

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.140
absolutely been ripped apart.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.090
And I actually saw a fistula operation because
I wanted to see what it looked

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:25.140
like and it's like literally a hole in your
soul -- it looks like somebody has punctured

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.649
a hole in your soul.

00:20:26.649 --> 00:20:31.950
And there are many people at Panzi with fistula
at any given time so when you have it, you

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.499
can't hold your pee or your poop and so you
have a world of 300 women who are just peeing

00:20:36.499 --> 00:20:37.499
on themselves.

00:20:37.499 --> 00:20:43.179
It's like a very bizarre Doris Lessing novel
and you just can't even believe you are witnessing

00:20:43.179 --> 00:20:48.059
such a thing in the year 2010 -- it's beyond
belief.

00:20:48.059 --> 00:20:55.659
But Dr. Mukwege has been there and he works
 -- he has 12 operations a day.

00:20:55.659 --> 00:21:04.639
He is there with the women and they name their
babies after him because he's one of the most

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:05.639
extraordinary people.

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:13.129
And when we went, we said, 'What do women
need? What can V-Day do?'

00:21:13.129 --> 00:21:22.419
And after women had been raped, it's very
hard for women to go back to their villages

00:21:22.419 --> 00:21:28.350
because they're exiled and their stigmatized
and they're no longer welcome.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:38.850
And what's happening to many women is they're
sent back to their communities and then they're

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:47.289
re-raped so Dr. Mukwege may do nine operations
on a woman to fix fistula and then she gets

00:21:47.289 --> 00:21:52.019
sent home and she's raped again and then the
fistula operation never works.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:22:01.350
So we decided we would open a place called
the City of Joy and we interviewed and worked

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:08.990
with a lot of women on the ground and it's
an amazing place, and what it's going to be

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:15.889
is essentially a place, a literal place but
a metaphor, a catalyst, a decision.

00:22:15.889 --> 00:22:25.289
There will be a hundred women at any given
time who will stay for six months -- all of

00:22:25.289 --> 00:22:27.789
them will be survivors of gender violence.

00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:33.919
They will be fed, they will be housed, they
will be supported, they will have healing

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:38.150
therapy, they will have theatre and arts and
dance.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:46.550
They will learn their rights, they will have
literacy training, they will get an economic

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.279
empowerment tool, something that the City
of Joy creates.

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:55.179
There is a radio station where they'll learn
to be advocates on their own behalf.

00:22:55.179 --> 00:22:58.529
There will be ways that they fight their own
and prosecute their own cases.

00:22:58.529 --> 00:23:00.509
There's amazing fields where women will plow
and cultivate and grow crops which they can

00:23:00.509 --> 00:23:02.090
then take seeds from them and hopefully we'll
have lots of goats and they'll have baby goats

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.090
that they can bring back to their communities.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.390
The only thing you have to redo to come to
the City of Joy is that you will be a leader

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:12.950
and you will pass on what you're given and
you have to sign that when you come so when

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.779
you leave after six months, there will be
centers in your own community that we set

00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:16.779
up.

00:23:16.779 --> 00:23:21.280
And you'll have a posse that you go back with
and you'll pass it on to the women in your

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.470
community and we'll begin to turn pain to
power.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.649
And the idea is really to create a cadre of
women leaders.

00:23:26.649 --> 00:23:27.649
In five years, we'll have a thousand women
leaders and those women will be the people

00:23:27.649 --> 00:23:28.649
who create the revolution; not the violent
revolution, the soft revolution in the Congo

00:23:28.649 --> 00:23:29.649
that brings about radical change for the whole
country.

00:23:29.649 --> 00:23:35.789
And I was just there in December and first
of all, it's the most beautiful place in the

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:36.789
world.

00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:37.789
It really is extraordinary and the building
crew, about 180 builders, and the woman who

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:38.789
is the director there is this amazing woman
named Christine

00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:39.789
Schuler Deschryver who is a force of nature.

00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:43.390
And she told them that there had to be - a
third of the building crew had to be women

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:44.390
and women had never constructed or been on
a construction crew ever in the Congo.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:45.390
And when I got there, there were 60 women
dancing across the fields with 90 pounds of

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.390
cement buckets on their head screaming and
dancing.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:47.429
They were so happy to be employed, to have
a job, to be building a city which was going

00:23:47.429 --> 00:23:48.600
to liberate and free women.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.779
Megan: That's an extraordinary vision.

00:23:49.779 --> 00:23:53.530
Eve Ensler: And now they are going to have
computers and a whole tech center from Google.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:59.669
Megan: Yay. But we really wanted to contribute
to the City of Joy and we wanted them to be

00:23:59.669 --> 00:24:05.950
able to tell their stories online and blog
and learn about the Web and then also perhaps

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.820
run a side Internet cafe there or whatever
they want to do.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.249
Eve Ensler: That's what we're hoping.

00:24:10.249 --> 00:24:12.309
Megan: We are up for helping them in any way.

00:24:12.309 --> 00:24:13.309
Eve Ensler: That we'll have an Internet cafe
there.

00:24:13.309 --> 00:24:18.730
Megan: I want to open it up for questions
to people so you can start thinking about

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:19.730
questions.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:25.710
Okay. So what kind of support are you getting
from the men of the Congo for this?

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:26.710
Eve Ensler: That's a very good question.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.980
Well, surprisingly a lot of support.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:35.019
We have been doing a lot of - the campaign
does a lot of things as well as the City of

00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:39.780
Joy and over three years, we've been training
an enormous amount of activists, men and women,

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.999
to spread the news about ending sexual violence
and

00:24:40.999 --> 00:24:43.440
women's rights.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.890
And in Goma and Kinshasa and in Bukavu, the
movement is really growing.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:52.960
I was actually in Kinshasa a few months ago
when women did the first production of "The

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.519
Vagina Monologues" there and it was amazing.

00:24:56.519 --> 00:25:00.830
And what was amazing is the next day all these
male activists who've been working for months

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.820
came and talked about their feelings after
seeing "The Vagina Monologues" and they were

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.190
more radical than most people I've ever met
in my life and they were saying, "I had no

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:14.610
idea, I didn't know you could look at my wife's
vagina. I'm gonna go home and look at it.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:23.009
There were so many things I learned, I'm going
to be a much better lover."

00:25:23.009 --> 00:25:27.259
And they were so enthusiastic and so we have
a lot of trained male activists who are really

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:35.450
fighting to bring about the V-Men's movement
there which is the new men's parallel or integrated

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.259
movement in V-Day.

00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:42.450
And then I've seen like in over the last year,
we did these "Breaking the Silence" events

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:46.950
where women survivors came forward and told
their stories in Kinshasa and Goma and Bukavu

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:47.950
to hundreds.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.759
And there were many, many men at those events
and men were literally sobbing and wailing

00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:52.759
over what happened.

00:25:52.759 --> 00:26:01.380
And now a lot of those men are really beginning
to work with us to be part of this movement.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:06.090
And Dr. Mukwege is the godfather of the V-Men's
movement and we gave him a huge award last

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:10.390
year at the Superdome when we did the 10th
anniversary in front of 18,000 people.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:15.820
So he is now the symbol of the V-Men's movement
around the world and I think more and more

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:21.919
men are getting involved in what we're doing
in a very beautiful way.

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:26.279
So one of things - can you connect - you've
connected some of the violence in Congo, not

00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:36.029
only through the technology, but also just
the behavior and how when the behavior ramps

00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:37.029
up in a certain place how it makes other things.

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:41.120
I kind of wondered if you wanted to talk a
little bit about why this is so important

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.590
to go help the women and the men there but
also why it's important on a global level.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.980
Eve Ensler: Well, people always - I was just
at a luncheon and someone said like what do

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:48.980
you say when people say why the Congo.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:56.059
There's so much happening in our own communities
and one thing I've seen by the way is that

00:26:56.059 --> 00:27:02.409
in all the V-Day's that are working locally
to stop violence in Palo Alto or LA, or Alabama,

00:27:02.409 --> 00:27:05.860
or Manila.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:11.730
Working for the women of Congo is really powerful
for them as well because when you have solidarity

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:16.619
outside your community, it gives you a reflection
on what's going on in your own community in

00:27:16.619 --> 00:27:17.619
a whole different way.

00:27:17.619 --> 00:27:23.570
For me, I say this and I say this really strongly,
the worst violence in the world towards women

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.200
is going on in the Congo.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:34.879
It is beyond anything we can rightly imagine
or should ever imagine and if we as a human

00:27:34.879 --> 00:27:38.980
society give permission to this, we basically
license this kind of behavior everywhere.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.980
We are basically saying we're okay with it
and what's interesting and horrifying is to

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:48.470
see the spread of it like in Guinea this year,
or in the post election riots in Kenya, or

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:49.470
in Zimbabwe.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:55.010
We are seeing rape now being used more and
more as a tool of oppression and control and

00:27:55.010 --> 00:28:01.019
war, and I think as countries get poorer and
poorer and have fewer resources to fight wars

00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:06.789
with, if we don't end violence against women
as a tactic and rape as a tactic of war, we

00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:11.009
will begin to see that women's bodies are
the landscapes on which wars will be fought,

00:28:11.009 --> 00:28:12.659
and girls will be fought.

00:28:12.659 --> 00:28:16.299
So we must stop it in the Congo if we're going
to stop the spread of it.

00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:19.330
But also, the Congo is the heart of Africa.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:23.380
If you look at the map of Africa, it's the
heart and to some degree, Africa is very much

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:28.620
the heart of the world so women are in the
heart of the heart of the heart,

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:34.440
and if the heart of Africa isn't pumping blood
and isn't pumping energy through the arteries

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:40.700
and through the veins of the rest of African,
Africa is dying and Africa is suffering and

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.239
will continue to suffer.

00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:47.980
So I feel, and I've had an incredible life
in the last 12 years, I've been everywhere

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.809
in the world and usually the rape mines of
the world, whether it's Haiti or Afghanistan

00:28:51.809 --> 00:28:56.450
or Bosnia or Kosovo, I've seen pretty horrific
things.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:57.659
I really believe that if we can end violence
against women and girls in the Congo, we can

00:28:57.659 --> 00:29:08.470
end it everywhere because it's the worst and
if we create a template there for transformation

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:17.179
and change, we can use that template everywhere
so I'm saying to everybody right now, 'Let's

00:29:17.179 --> 00:29:20.950
make Congo the project. Let's say we will
serve the women of Congo, not tell them what

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:24.100
to do, not do further colonization where we
go in and intervene and direct them and use

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.070
them as they have been forever' because we
know the colonization that occurred through

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:30.659
the Belgians in the Congo was one of the worst
anywhere in Africa and the horrible history

00:29:30.659 --> 00:29:32.909
that has ensued is reflected and grows out
of that colonization.

00:29:32.909 --> 00:29:34.600
I'm talking about allowing women to have their
destinies and to have their vision and to

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.450
have their voices and serving them and finding
the resources to support them coming into

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:48.020
their power and leadership so they can own
the minerals and own their country and own

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.200
their bodies and I think we can do that.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.560
That's something that really can happen if
we all put our minds and will - look, if you

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.559
can Google, come on! I mean, I look at Google
and I still don't have any idea how Google

00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:05.669
exists or what it is or where people are.
Do people just sit in little rooms and put

00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:06.669
this information in?

00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:07.669
Megan: It's pigeons.

00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:09.320
Eve Ensler: I have no idea how it works.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:14.820
But if we can Google, for God's sakes, we
can end violence against women and girls in

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.820
the Congo.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.940
I mean, really.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:25.179
I sometimes think how is it that we have so
much attention to creating apps and I didn't

00:30:25.179 --> 00:30:28.899
know much about apps until last night and
I was just like, "Oh my God, there's a reason

00:30:28.899 --> 00:30:31.419
I didn't go into app world because you just
never get out."

00:30:31.419 --> 00:30:32.659
[audience laughs]

00:30:32.659 --> 00:30:39.109
But I look at things like apps and I think
the attention we have for that.

00:30:39.109 --> 00:30:48.679
Why don't we have attention for stopping the
cruelty and atrocities and the heinous behavior

00:30:48.679 --> 00:30:55.249
that is being perpetuated as we get to have
our apps?

00:30:55.249 --> 00:31:05.739
And I think if all of us really join and make
the focus the Congo and put our attention

00:31:05.739 --> 00:31:10.429
there, we really can, we absolutely can shift
what's happening.

00:31:10.429 --> 00:31:18.529
Umm, yes. Last time you were here you talked
about a slightly different topic which was

00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:29.929
the safe house that you had actually built
and you gave a specific example of certain

00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:45.929
donations were made to buy a van that could
transport women to and from the safe house

00:31:45.929 --> 00:31:57.470
and I'm not sure if it was
in Sudan.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:59.220
Eve Ensler: No, Kenya.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:08.679
Okay. So one, I wanted was to get an update
that and this may be my own personal opinion

00:32:08.679 --> 00:32:16.759
after hearing everything you say about the
Congo is violence against women has happened

00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:19.639
since the beginning of time.

00:32:19.639 --> 00:32:28.850
It's always been a method of warfare and it's
kind of a natural human instinct - I don't

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:40.530
mean it that way but it's something that's
kind of been going on since the beginning

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:56.940
of time and so I guess I'm more pessimistic
about being able to stop that in the Congo

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:09.269
or anywhere and I know it also happens against
men increasingly in the same places so things

00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:14.100
like stopping female circumcisions seem like,
to me, something that's actually a much more

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.169
tractable problem to try to solve.

00:33:16.169 --> 00:33:25.119
So I mean I think it's great to try in the
Congo as well but it's not, it's just much

00:33:25.119 --> 00:33:33.259
harder to fight that as opposed to the circumcision
thing which is a lot more dealing with ignorance

00:33:33.259 --> 00:33:35.520
and social mores in those regions that seem
a little bit more changeable so I wanted your

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.609
opinion, if you agree on that.

00:33:37.609 --> 00:33:41.700
Eve Ensler: Okay. Well, I'm going to address
your second part of that first.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.629
You know, it's interesting when people say
that violence has always been – it's a natural

00:33:45.629 --> 00:33:47.330
thing which I find completely unnatural actually,
just for the record.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:52.269
But you know, I'm sure there was a time when
people said people will always be reading

00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:54.649
on a tablet and that's really natural.

00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:56.200
And then people said, 'Oh, they're reading
in books -- that's really natural".

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.059
And now we have computers and that seems really
natural.

00:33:58.059 --> 00:34:05.269
Now, why do we have the imagination to perceive
and foresee and look out and see an evolution

00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:11.139
in things like computers and online and virtual
reality but we don't have the imagination

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:15.099
to see an end to violence?

00:34:15.099 --> 00:34:20.789
And I think it's something to really examine
in ourselves.

00:34:20.789 --> 00:34:25.770
Why do we assume that the worst of people
will continue forever.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:33.869
It's just something I urge us all to consider
because I think there's a way we're enslaved

00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:37.710
by our refusal to have a bigger vision.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:50.089
We once did an exercise in V-Day where we
asked people one year to say what would your

00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:59.309
life be like if there were no violence towards
women, and it was fascinating.

00:34:59.309 --> 00:35:12.599
I did it in a prison group and women said,
"I can't do this, I won't do this".

00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:17.020
And I was like, "Excuse me?"

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:32.240
And they were like, "First of all, I can't
even imagine it and just to imagine it really

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.740
upsets me."

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:39.750
I said, "It upsets you to imagine it?"

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:47.740
And it was upsetting because so much of their
lives had been about violence that just to

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:56.320
open the door to a time when they would be
safe and free and protected and could walk

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.910
in the world where they wanted to go and wear
what they wanted to do, it was almost unbearable.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:14.700
So I want us to all dare to go into the unbearable,
to imagine what it would be like to live in

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.820
a world without violence.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:22.270
Just even on a daily basis, take an hour,
take ten minutes, take five minutes, you're

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:33.329
walking down the street and there's no more
violence -- what are you doing?

00:36:33.329 --> 00:36:42.839
I'm naked. I'm naked all the time and I don't
care because no one's bothering me.

00:36:42.839 --> 00:36:48.940
No one is harassing me, I don't wear clothes.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:52.339
Why would we wear clothes?

00:36:52.339 --> 00:37:00.480
The only reason we wear clothes is because
people would hurt us.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.320
You just begin to think, 'Would we have doormen?'

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.130
No. Gone. No more doormen.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:10.940
Would they do something else?

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:19.920
They'd probably do something happy and joyful
but you just start looking at how our life

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.180
is based and predicated on attack - so that's
number one.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:31.430
Number two, I'm really happy to report that
in Kenya -- we were just there in August and

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.170
Agnes is a superhero.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:38.980
She, Agnes Pareiyo, is the woman who has been
for years; she was cut as a girl, female genital

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:47.400
mutilated as a girl and decided that she would
devote her life to ending the practice.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:53.560
And she is a Masai women and she is brilliant
and strategic and clever and loving and powerful

00:37:53.560 --> 00:38:00.339
and she created an alternative ritual where
girls come of age without the cut.

00:38:00.339 --> 00:38:07.960
And she walked through the Rift Valley for
years and years with this box and a female

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:15.810
torso and the torso had vaginal replacement
parts and she would show people what a healthy

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:21.440
vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina
looked like.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:29.250
And she would teach girls and boys, and mothers
and fathers and in the years that she walked,

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:42.039
she saved 1,500 girls from being cut and when
we met her I was like, "Okay, this is the

00:38:42.039 --> 00:38:47.760
woman we are going to support."

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:53.881
I said, "How can we help you?"

00:38:53.881 --> 00:39:04.800
And she said, "Give us money and I'll buy
a Jeep and I can get around a lot faster."

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:11.510
So for the first year, she reached, I think,
3,500 to 4,500 girls.

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:21.819
And then we said, "What else can we do?" and
she said, "If you give me money, I could open

00:39:21.819 --> 00:39:28.880
a house and girls could run away. They'd be
protected. They wouldn't be cut. They wouldn't

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:36.289
be forced into marriage with an old man, and
they'd be able to go to school."

00:39:36.289 --> 00:39:38.220
So seven years ago, she opened the first Safe
House.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.240
It's been wildly successful.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.020
She has saved many, many girls from the cut.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:55.569
They're in school and they've been reconciled
with their own families and this year she

00:39:55.569 --> 00:40:04.690
opened a second house in a place called Sakutiek.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:10.359
It's a very remote village and it was very
difficult to build the house but she was so

00:40:10.359 --> 00:40:11.359
clever.

00:40:11.359 --> 00:40:20.450
She worked with another MGO that works on
water and they built her a well and right

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:31.440
now in Kenya, there's a serious drought and
she, in Sakutiek, has the only water so guess

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.440
what?

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:38.640
If you want water, you don't cut your daughter,
right?

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:50.410
And so now [inaudible replies back from audience]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, and so when I was at

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:58.730
the Safe House and we had the ceremony, it
was packed with men who had all brought their

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:03.480
daughters to the house to support them, to
go through the ceremony without the cut, and

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:09.900
were very happy because they were getting
water.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:16.330
And so we are learning how to integrate these
things and bring ecological needs and basic

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:20.460
survival needs together with ending that tradition.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.329
I'll tell you one story.

00:41:22.329 --> 00:41:29.559
When I was there, there was a girl named Jacqueline
and it's actually in the book, a little bit

00:41:29.559 --> 00:41:37.150
of her story but then I embellished and invented
a lot of it, but she was 14.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:47.599
Her sisters had been cut and she was in a
Masai family, a very tight community.

00:41:47.599 --> 00:41:55.549
The cows were dying because of the drought
and she knew things were getting bad.

00:41:55.549 --> 00:42:03.130
She heard her father talking to a man who
was missing an eye, an old man.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:14.930
She knew she was going to be sold, she knew
she was going to be cut, she knew she wouldn't

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:18.440
go to school, and she ran away.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:24.549
She'd heard about our house and she ran for
two days.

00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:33.940
She got there and she slept with the hyenas;
she was really scared.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:38.990
When she got there, Agnes greeted her.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:45.109
She stayed for a year, she went to school,
and her whole life changed.

00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:54.630
She learned her rights and she became this
strong, fierce girl and I was in the hut -- we

00:42:54.630 --> 00:43:01.809
all were -- when she was brought back for
the reconciliation with her father.

00:43:01.809 --> 00:43:07.640
And it was one of the most emotional things
I've ever seen.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:12.800
The whole family, the four wives of her father
and her mother, all wept.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.730
Her mother had been beaten because she had
stood up for her and went to the elders.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.049
The father wept.

00:43:18.049 --> 00:43:21.130
He said she'd become an amazing girl.

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:29.760
He accepted her back and then he looked at
her sisters and said, "I will not cut you."

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:42.069
And then the whole Masai community took the
day off in the market and celebrated her return.

00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:44.240
It was gorgeous.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:52.740
So we're having incredibly good luck and we've
just envisioned a ten year plan where Agnes

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:57.109
will create more houses and a radio station
and this whole amazing plan and I hope in

00:43:57.109 --> 00:44:00.450
ten years we'll see the end of FGM in Masai
land.

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:04.300
So yes, I think it is easier to end that tradition
than it is to end rape but I don't think it's

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:10.619
impossible to end rape, and I urge you to
just go there in spite of your own pessimism.

00:44:10.619 --> 00:44:18.349
Megan: I think part of this being willing
to imagine is sort in another area of Professor

00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:23.049
Yunis, the inventor of the Grameen, micro
loans, and just a brilliant Nobel Prize winner.

00:44:23.049 --> 00:44:25.730
He actually wants there to be a poverty museum
by 2030 and he totally believes that it's

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:31.829
possible because he thought a little bit about
how do you take banking, which is a big industry,

00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:35.170
and include the poor so that everybody gets
to participate.

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:38.250
It's like an airline has first class, business
class, economy.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.320
Why can't every business have something where
everyone can participate.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:56.119
So it's not exactly related but in the way,
can you imagine if the only place you could

00:44:56.119 --> 00:44:59.210
see poverty is in a museum?

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:06.880
And so I think in the same way maybe it's
sort of an extraordinary thing to think about

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.250
but I think memes happen.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:17.230
There was a New York Times piece last summer
about the book "Half the Sky" and some of

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:28.050
the things going on with sort of how we're
thinking about women and girls and half the

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:50.890
talent in the world and how we're including
people who have not been included across a

00:45:50.890 --> 00:46:04.750
lot of different boundaries in the past.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:25.579
And I think that a lot of the people in that
article, the thesis was that in the 19th century

00:46:25.579 --> 00:46:33.820
the majority, the vast majority of people,
came to understand that slavery was wrong

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:38.190
and that that became a meme that we understood
as fundamental meme.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:45.430
And then in the 20th century, totalitarianism,
and the idea of democracy and it became sort

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:49.069
of general meme that moved into many, many
parts of the world.

00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:57.069
And they were theorizing that in the 21st
century that this idea of gender apartheid

00:46:57.069 --> 00:47:08.270
goes away, that gender equality comes and
I think there's a lot to that.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:15.220
And I actually think that many things contribute,
and I think technology has an extraordinary

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:21.079
impact and that because it's interconnecting
people.

00:47:21.079 --> 00:47:34.589
So the little girl in Kenya didn't know she
had power until she had information that there

00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:43.549
was a safe house to run to and then she could
go there and her sisters could go there and

00:47:43.549 --> 00:47:49.940
then their friends could go and so with that
information instead the technology bring the

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:50.940
information.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.970
It's the plumbing of information and community.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:59.829
Eve Ensler: And I also think movements do
it.

00:47:59.829 --> 00:48:05.619
Like Nicholas Kristof and "Half the Sky" didn't
just happen.

00:48:05.619 --> 00:48:19.160
We've been working for years and years and
years in a women's movement and that book

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:28.299
is now visible but a lot, a lot, a lot, a
lot of work happened before that book happened.

00:48:28.299 --> 00:48:32.310
And I think we don't even know what seeds
we're planting when we're activists.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:39.660
I ran into a woman the other night who is
now the head of a city council who was a V-Day

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:45.549
activist for years and I ran into another
woman who's become this and you don't even

00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:50.334
know what saying the word "vagina" is going
to do, what door it's going to open up.

00:48:50.334 --> 00:48:52.589
I'll tell you a really funny story.

00:48:52.589 --> 00:49:00.529
I was once in -- I'm sorry, you want to ask
your question -- but I was once in Bulgaria

00:49:00.529 --> 00:49:10.609
and we had this meeting of women in all of
Eastern Europe and they all came from all

00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:21.359
across the Balkans and all across eastern
Europe and the woman who was running it decided

00:49:21.359 --> 00:49:31.670
the way everyone was going to introduce themselves
was by saying "vagina" in their own native

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:33.880
languages and it was fascinating.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.829
It was like this one 'peechka' and 'puchka'
and 'poopyene'.

00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:50.090
And this woman from Macedonia, she was a gypsy
woman and very much a minority.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:58.349
And just the fact that she was there was a
miracle and she's from a very, very traditional

00:49:58.349 --> 00:49:59.349
community.

00:49:59.349 --> 00:50:03.951
She stood up and was like, "Okay, I couldn't
do it."

00:50:03.951 --> 00:50:07.480
And sat down and stood up again and sat down.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.859
And finally, she just went "NINJA!"

00:50:08.859 --> 00:50:13.060
And for the rest of the weekend, all anybody
did was walk around going "NINJA!"

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:18.000
That so radicalized her, just doing that,
that she went back to her community and they

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.190
had this really horrific tradition that on
the marriage night the husband's father could

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:26.680
sleep with his bride to see if she was a virgin
or that she would lose her virginity and the

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.750
whole community would come and check her sheets.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:34.109
And she was horrified of this and she had
been raped actually on her wedding night.

00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:41.890
So she went home after that and she created
a theatre piece called "The Gypsy Virgin Bride"

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:45.779
which she then toured all through the gypsy
communities and she literally ended the tradition

00:50:45.779 --> 00:50:46.779
 -- she literally ended it.

00:50:46.779 --> 00:50:50.292
So you think who knows what 'NINJA', what
door it's going to open it, and when you suddenly

00:50:50.292 --> 00:50:51.292
realize you have power and you have rights
and your anger arrives and your passion arrives

00:50:51.292 --> 00:50:54.750
and we don't even know how powerful we are,
we don't have a clue how powerful we are.

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:56.650
I was just going to ask what we can do to
help.

00:50:56.650 --> 00:51:00.269
What we as individuals here can also do to
help if we have, let's say, a few hours every

00:51:00.269 --> 00:51:04.770
week or is there a cause you want us to donate
to? Point us in the right direction.

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:10.320
Megan: And think about multiple things. Think
about like things an individual could do but

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.190
think about things like with all our crazy
teammates.

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:13.190
Eve Ensler: Yeah.

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:14.190
Megan: There's 20,000 Googlers all over the
world

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:15.190
Eve Ensler: Wow!! 20,000!!

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:16.190
Megan: And there's people in YouTube world,
phenomenal people all around the world who

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:17.190
could help too.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.190
Eve Ensler: Well, I've always felt that you
should do a V-Day at Google.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:21.309
I've been saying this for years, that the
women at Google should put on a production

00:51:21.309 --> 00:51:23.359
of "The Vagina Monologues" and raise a lot
of money for V-Day.

00:51:23.359 --> 00:51:25.880
That's what I think you should do. You should
do a major production, get all kinds of people

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:26.880
who would be in the cast, produce it, do it
in some incredible space here for the whole

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:27.880
community, and raise a lot of money for the
movement.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.990
That would be the greatest thing you could
do because then you'd be in the play, you'd

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.990
be talking vaginas at Google.

00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.990
And virtual.

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.990
We could do a whole virtual 'V V' for vagina
and merging of the two, and if you do it this

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:34.051
next year, men can be part of it because there's
going to be this whole new men's piece that

00:51:34.051 --> 00:51:36.630
will be coming out so we can bring that in
so that's one and I'd love to see Megan doing

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:37.630
the moans myself [laughs].

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:38.630
You're blushing [laughs].

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:39.640
But if you go online too, there's many things
you can do.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.640
I'll tell you another fantasy I have.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.640
We have something called the Congo Wall where
people from all over the world go on and they

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.640
sign up and write messages to the women of
Congo.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.319
Now it has a couple of thousand people.

00:51:44.319 --> 00:51:47.040
I would like a million people on the wall.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.940
If you would all work with us to get millions
of people to sign up for the woman of Congo

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.289
so we can have a million people on the wall
supporting the woman of Congo, that would

00:51:53.289 --> 00:51:54.289
be an awesome thing.

00:51:54.289 --> 00:51:56.619
And I know you all know how to do that and
could figure out a way to do that so we would

00:51:56.619 --> 00:51:57.660
be greatly - raise money, tell the stories
wherever you can.

00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:58.660
Spread V-girls, read the books, carry the
message.

00:51:58.660 --> 00:51:59.890
Be your emotional, powerful selves.
&gt;&gt; My question is you just mentioned getting

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:01.609
men more involved in the movement.

00:52:01.609 --> 00:52:05.089
I'd love to hear more about that, particularly
how you are going to do it in a way that's

00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:06.089
really going to encourage them to fight for
the cause and not alienate them because one

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:07.089
of the kind of concerns with talking about
"The Vagina Monologues" and using the 'V'

00:52:07.089 --> 00:52:11.220
word is that it can make men very uncomfortable
and maybe feel a little bit alienated.

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:15.130
So how do you get them to really rally around
this cause in a way that's going to get your

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:16.130
average man on the street to feel comfortable?

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:17.319
Eve Ensler: Well, I want to say that many
men have come to "The Vagina Monologues" and

00:52:17.319 --> 00:52:19.130
are actually very attracted to vaginas and
aren't alienated by them, just for the record.

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.130
[laughs from audience]

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:21.130
But I've always felt that when men create
this movement, they'll bring in other men

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:24.550
but I don't think women can convince men to
care about violence against women -- I think

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:25.550
men can.

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:29.220
What's happened over the last year is that
a group of men got together and met a lot

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:30.220
of other men and decided they would launch
something called "V-Men".

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.220
So what they've done this year is they've
launched this pilot project called "Ten Ways

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.220
to be a Man" and there are workshops, a hundred
places signed up this year to do the workshops.

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.220
75 men in Lubbock, Texas, I'm really proud
to say, are doing a workshop on how to be

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:34.220
a man and what they're doing is that there's
a whole pilot – What are those things called?

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.220
 -- PowerPoint where men come to the workshop
and talk; you can see how technologically

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.220
illiterate and scary I am [laughs] but I'm
trying with apps.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.220
Just saying it I feel - [laughs].

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.220
But anyway they are doing these workshops
all around the world this year and then they're

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.220
going to send in all these results they've
had and stories and then they are going to

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.220
be put together by men and they are going
to be made into a play.

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.220
And then next year it will go out with the
V-Day movement to all the thousands of places

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.220
and men will perform this play on "Ten Ways
to Be a Man" and we will probably have a PSA

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:43.220
campaign and we'll have a whole thing about
men celebrating women and what it looks like

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:44.220
and that's all being generated by guys.

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.220
So I'm not telling men what to do.

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.220
I have no idea.

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.220
And also, I don't think men need women telling
them what to do.

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:48.220
I think if men really care about ending violence
against women, they've got to care and they've

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:49.220
got to generate this.

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:50.220
They've got to be the people moving it. We
were just in a meeting last night where a

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:51.220
whole group of men in San Francisco are trying
to figure out how to launch "V-Men" here.

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.220
It's happening, it's definitely happening
and I think it will happen more and more.

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.220
There's so many great guys in the world and
if they would stand up and say it matters

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.220
then a lot of other guys will stand up.

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:55.220
Megan: I think part of the - you know, we
were at TED last week and Esther Duflo, who

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.220
is a phenomenal economist at MIT, a French
economist, was mentioning that there's a Haiti

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.220
that occurs.

00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:58.220
There's so much coverage of Haiti which is
so important to help the people of Haiti right

00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.220
now and she's saying we need to do this and
yet at the same time, for children who are

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:00.220
0-5 years old, there's a Haiti every eight
days if you're in emerging countries, as well

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.220
as even in some of the developed countries.

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.220
And so I think in some ways like poverty,
like violence against women, it's a story

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.220
that's always been present to sort of your
point, it's always here and it's always this

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.220
undercurrent and it's always there.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:05.220
So I think that the collaboration of your
extraordinary storytelling and those in the

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.220
world who have those skills to hear and transpose
and create that together with our skills of

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.220
sort of platforms and apps and getting things
out there when they combine and others who

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.220
have other talents to bring will -- and men
who step, women who step up, will help a lot.

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.220
I don't know if there's any other questions;
otherwise - Eve, it's been incredible to have

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.220
to you here.

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.220
Eve Ensler: Oh, I'm so happy.

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.220
Can I close by reading you one piece from
the new book?

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.220
Okay.

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.220
So, I'm going to do this tonight for all the
girl cells that live in us so boys and girls,

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.220
like the girl in you.

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.220
Something I've been thinking a lot about lately;
violence against women isn't a given, it's

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.220
not a given.

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.220
We don't have to live in a world where 1 out
of 3 women are beaten or raped -- that's a

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:19.220
U.N. statistic; we don't.

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.220
It's really a determination.

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.220
We get to change that but one of the ways
I think we change things is by being outrageous

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.220
and by being emotional and by being passionate
and by being difficult.

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:23.220
And by people saying things like, "Ugh, there
she is again."

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.220
It doesn't matter.

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:25.220
You really have to make a decision whether
you want to be admired or liked.

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.220
Admired or liked, and usually people who continue
to push the edge aren't liked by everybody

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.220
but it doesn't matter because if you keep
going, people get freed because of it.

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.220
So I want to leave you with that.

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:29.220
I'm going to do "I Am An Emotional Creature"
because I'm just feeling that way today.

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.220
So this is for all of you.

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:31.220
"I love being a girl.

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:32.220
I can feel what you're feeling as you're feeling
it inside the feeling before.

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:33.220
I am an emotional creature.

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.220
Things do not come to me as intellectual theories
or hard pressed ideas.

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.220
They pulse through my organs and legs and
burn up my ears.

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.220
Oh, I know when your girlfriend's really pissed
off even though she appears to give you what

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:37.220
you want.

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:38.220
I know when a storm is coming.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.220
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the
air.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.220
I can tell you he won't call back.

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.220
It's a vibe I share.

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.220
I am an emotional creature.

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:43.220
I love that I do not take things lightly.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.220
Everything is intense to me.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.220
The way I walk in the street.

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:46.220
The way my mama wakes me up.

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.220
The way I hear bad news.

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.220
The way it's unbearable when I lose.

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.220
I am an emotional creature.

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.220
I am connected to everything and everyone.

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:51.220
I was born like that.

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.220
Don't you say all negative that it's a teenage
thing or it's only only because I'm a girl.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:53.220
These feelings make me better.

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:54.220
They make me present.

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.220
They make me ready.

00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:56.220
They make me strong.

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.220
I am an emotional creature.

00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:58.220
I am connected to everything.

00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.220
There is a particular way of knowing.

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:00.220
It's like the older women somehow forgot.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.220
I rejoice that it's still in my body.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:02.220
I know when the coconut's about to fall.

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.220
I know we have pushed the Earth too far.

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:04.220
I know my father isn't coming back and that
no one's prepared for the fire.

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:05.220
I know that lipstick means more than show
and boys feel super insecure and terrorists

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.220
are made, not born.

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:07.220
I know that one kiss can take away all my
decision making ability, and you know what?

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.220
Sometimes it should.

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.220
This is not extreme.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.220
It's a girl thing.

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:11.220
What we would all be if the big door inside
us flew open?

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.220
Don't tell me not to cry.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:13.220
To calm it down.

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.220
Not to be so extreme.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.220
To be reasonable.

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:16.220
I am an emotional creature.

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.220
It's how the Earth got made.

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.220
It's how the wind continues to pollinate.

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:19.220
You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave.

00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:20.220
I am an emotional creature.

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.220
Why would you want to shut me down or turn
me off?

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.220
I am your remaining memory.

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:23.220
I am connecting you to your source.

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.220
Nothing's been diluted.

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:25.220
Nothing's leaked out.

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:26.220
I can take you back.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.220
I love that I can feel the inside of the feelings
in you, even if they stop my life, even if

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:28.220
it hurts too much, even if it breaks my heart.

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:29.220
It makes me responsible. I am an emotional,
I am an emotional, devotional, incandotional,

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.220
roller coasteral creature.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.220
And I love, hear me, I love, love, love being
a girl.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:32.220
[applause]

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.220
&gt;&gt; Woo! Eve Ensler. [more applause]

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:33.225
Eve Ensler: Thank you all.
