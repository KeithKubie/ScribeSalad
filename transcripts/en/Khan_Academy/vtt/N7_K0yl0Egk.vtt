00:00:00.728 --> 00:00:02.762
- [Voiceover] So we're gonna
talk a little bit about

00:00:02.762 --> 00:00:04.751
DNA regulation.

00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:07.361
And this is the general
idea that if you look

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:09.270
at a organism's genome,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.259
that not all of the genes are being

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.585
transcribed and translated
at the same time.

00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:17.114
It could actually depend on the type of

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:19.781
cell that that DNA is inside of,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.779
or it could depend on the
environment for that organism.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.811
So for example, if you look at,

00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:29.327
say, a multicellular organism,

00:00:29.327 --> 00:00:31.774
this, maybe this is, and these are

00:00:31.774 --> 00:00:33.882
oversimplifications right over here,

00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:36.978
maybe this is type of immune cell,

00:00:36.978 --> 00:00:37.978
immune cell,

00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:43.450
and let's say that this
over here is a muscle cell,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.371
and they're not necessarily, or not likely

00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:46.684
to be these perfect circles,

00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:48.300
but this is just for the idea.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.616
And they're going to
have the exact same DNA.

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:54.758
So the DNA in both of these is the same.

00:00:54.758 --> 00:00:55.591
So DNA is

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:58.686
the same

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:01.008
inside, and these are going to be,

00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:02.123
these are Eukaryotes,

00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:04.159
so I'll draw the nuclear membrane there,

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:04.992
same DNA.

00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:10.013
But they have very different
roles inside of this organism.

00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:11.819
So it doesn't make sense, in fact,

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:13.977
in order for them to even
have different structures,

00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:15.702
they're gonna have to
produce different proteins.

00:01:15.702 --> 00:01:19.218
They're gonna have
different enzyme proteins

00:01:19.218 --> 00:01:21.385
inside of their cytoplasm.

00:01:22.702 --> 00:01:26.193
And so DNA regulation, one
way to think about it is,

00:01:26.193 --> 00:01:28.542
well if they have the exact same genome,

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:31.314
how do they regulate which of those genes

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:34.451
are being transcribed and then translated

00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:36.068
and which ones aren't?

00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:38.636
And even if you think about
a unicellular organism.

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:41.489
Right here we have a bacterium.

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:43.747
And so it's just one cell, but even it

00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:46.771
will not want to transcribe and translate

00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:48.794
all of its genes at the same time.

00:01:48.794 --> 00:01:51.845
For example, this over here,

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.823
so this is its, this is
the bacterial chromosome.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.802
This right over here might be a gene

00:01:56.802 --> 00:02:01.088
involved in the digestion
of a certain type of food,

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:02.799
if that food is present.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.349
This type of,

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.482
and actually it could
even be several genes

00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:07.736
that are involved in that type of food,

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:10.374
and we will actually talk, go
into a little bit more detail

00:02:10.374 --> 00:02:12.791
about when you have several
genes that are related

00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:14.796
and they tend to be
transcribed all at once

00:02:14.796 --> 00:02:16.782
or not transcribed all at once.

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:18.440
So maybe that's related to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.501
digesting or consuming some type of food.

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:24.795
Maybe you have some genes over here

00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:28.618
that are related to some
type of stress mechanism.

00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:31.684
Maybe it needs to go into
hibernation some time.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.168
And so if it's not under stress,

00:02:33.168 --> 00:02:34.778
it does not have to express these genes,

00:02:34.778 --> 00:02:37.118
but if it is under stress, it
does have to express these.

00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:40.102
Likewise, if that thing that
needs to digest is around,

00:02:40.102 --> 00:02:41.755
it needs to transcribe these.

00:02:41.755 --> 00:02:44.421
If it's not around, it does
not need to transcribe it.

00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:47.036
So that's how DNA regulation works,

00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:48.663
whether you're talking about a Eukaryote

00:02:48.663 --> 00:02:50.830
or a Prokaryotic organism.

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:53.898
And so what we're gonna
do in this video is focus

00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:55.832
a little bit more, or a lot more,

00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:57.508
on the Prokaryote side.

00:02:57.508 --> 00:03:01.020
Especially, we're gonna
talk about this bacterium.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.118
When we talked about

00:03:03.118 --> 00:03:05.350
transcription in general,

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.280
in several videos ago
and in several videos,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.775
we talked about the idea of a promoter.

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.754
That you have a gene that is

00:03:13.754 --> 00:03:18.263
a sequence of DNA that's part
of the broader chromosome,

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:20.139
and we said, "okay, that RNA polymerase

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.144
needs to attach some place,"

00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:25.250
so that RNA polymerase
needs to attach some place,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.991
and we called that place that
the RNA polymerase attaches,

00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.978
we call that the promoter,
and then the polymerase

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:34.119
will transcribe the gene.

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.133
And when we first talked
about the idea of a promoter,

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:40.836
we said, and this is
generally true in Eukaryotes,

00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:44.458
that each promoter is
associated with a gene,

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.611
or each gene has a promoter.

00:03:46.611 --> 00:03:48.974
But when we're talking about Prokaryotes,

00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:51.405
and in this case we're
talking about this bacterium,

00:03:51.405 --> 00:03:53.416
it's actually typical to have

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:56.731
multiple genes grouped together
that have one promoter,

00:03:56.731 --> 00:04:01.542
so this promoter here, and a
promoter is actually called a

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:03.496
regulatory DNA sequence.

00:04:03.496 --> 00:04:04.596
Let me write this down.

00:04:04.596 --> 00:04:07.562
So the promoter, so that's
this part right over here,

00:04:07.562 --> 00:04:09.042
that's the sequence.

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:09.875
That is a

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.891
regulatory,

00:04:12.891 --> 00:04:13.724
regulatory

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:16.019
DNA

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:18.619
sequence.

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:20.943
Well that's what the RNA polymerase,

00:04:20.943 --> 00:04:23.080
which I drew as this big blob,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.039
it's protein here, this big blob,

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.968
will attach to, and then
it will begin to transcribe

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:30.437
all of these genes as a bundle.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:34.184
And when you have a promoter
associated with multiple genes,

00:04:34.184 --> 00:04:36.981
that combination of the promoter

00:04:36.981 --> 00:04:39.141
and the genes, and once
again when I'm talking about

00:04:39.141 --> 00:04:40.593
the promoters of the
genes I'm talking about

00:04:40.593 --> 00:04:42.381
sequences of DNA,

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:45.464
that combination is called an operon.

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:47.404
This is called an opeon.

00:04:47.404 --> 00:04:50.435
It's a combination of that
regulatory DNA sequence

00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:52.369
which says, "Hey, RNA
polymerase, bind here

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:53.780
"so you can start transcribing,"

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.445
and the genes that it, essentially,

00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:59.159
promotes the transcription of.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.624
And then of course, that
transcription process

00:05:01.624 --> 00:05:04.635
takes that genetic information in DNA,

00:05:04.635 --> 00:05:07.367
transcribes it into messenger RNA,

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:09.668
which can then go with the ribosomes,

00:05:09.668 --> 00:05:11.510
and we have the whole translation process

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.073
and this should all be review,

00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:16.385
to produce the actual
proteins that have functions

00:05:16.385 --> 00:05:19.709
within, or even potentially,
outside of the cell.

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:21.610
And so what we're gonna
dig a little bit deeper in

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.907
is what can enhance this process,

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:26.626
make this happen more frequently,

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:30.507
or things that might inhibit
this process in some way.

00:05:30.507 --> 00:05:33.008
So as I mentioned before,
this is just what I had

00:05:33.008 --> 00:05:36.470
just drawn, we have our
big RNA polymerase blob,

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.944
and this is an oversimplification
for what it looks like,

00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:42.106
attaching to the regulatory DNA sequence,

00:05:42.106 --> 00:05:43.913
which we call the promoter,

00:05:43.913 --> 00:05:46.121
and then it will do the transcription

00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:47.638
which will produce mRNA,

00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:51.681
which encodes the
information in those genes.

00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:54.797
But what if we're in an
environment where we don't want to

00:05:54.797 --> 00:05:57.845
transcribe this particular operon,

00:05:57.845 --> 00:05:59.290
this particular,

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.453
or maybe I should say
particular series of genes?

00:06:02.453 --> 00:06:04.561
Well then we might,

00:06:04.561 --> 00:06:06.636
something in our environment might

00:06:06.636 --> 00:06:09.853
allow repressors to take action.

00:06:09.853 --> 00:06:11.880
So what are we talking about a repressor?

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.663
Well a repressor,

00:06:13.663 --> 00:06:16.000
a repressor right over here,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.645
you see it attaching to a sequence of DNA

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:22.654
after the promoter, and so it blocks,

00:06:22.654 --> 00:06:24.535
it blocks the RNA polymerase

00:06:24.535 --> 00:06:27.199
from being able to do the transcription.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.371
And so this right over
here, this is a protein

00:06:30.371 --> 00:06:32.902
that is called the
repressor, it's literally

00:06:32.902 --> 00:06:34.954
repressing the transcription,

00:06:34.954 --> 00:06:38.601
and the regulatory DNA
sequence where it attaches,

00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:40.742
that is called the operator.

00:06:40.742 --> 00:06:43.327
So once again, promoter
was a regulatory sequence

00:06:43.327 --> 00:06:47.055
where the RNA polymerase can attach,

00:06:47.055 --> 00:06:49.851
and then operator is a regulatory sequence

00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:54.635
where a repressor can attach
and keep that RNA polymerase

00:06:54.635 --> 00:06:56.857
from actually being able to perform

00:06:56.857 --> 00:06:59.275
the actual transcription.

00:06:59.275 --> 00:07:01.942
And so this keeps the gene from,

00:07:03.886 --> 00:07:05.696
continuing to

00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:07.875
transcribe and then translate

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:09.964
these actual genes.

00:07:09.964 --> 00:07:13.310
And you might even have extra mechanisms,

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.919
and you can even think of
them as feedback mechanisms

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.710
or ways to understand the environment

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.228
where the repressor,

00:07:21.228 --> 00:07:24.763
this protein can only do its job,

00:07:24.763 --> 00:07:26.118
so let's say that's its repressor,

00:07:26.118 --> 00:07:29.293
where it can only do its job
if it has other molecules

00:07:29.293 --> 00:07:30.964
that attach to it.

00:07:30.964 --> 00:07:32.890
So maybe this one can only do its job

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.340
if it has another molecule attached to it,

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.452
and in that case, these smaller molecules,

00:07:38.452 --> 00:07:40.773
these are called corepressors,

00:07:40.773 --> 00:07:41.606
co, co

00:07:43.417 --> 00:07:44.250
repressor.

00:07:46.058 --> 00:07:48.458
And we'll go into more detail
when we talk about things

00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:50.836
like the trip operon of

00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:53.234
how tryptophan, an amino acid,

00:07:53.234 --> 00:07:56.067
can actually act as a corepressor.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.795
Now over here, we have
the other way around

00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:03.155
where we want even more transcription,

00:08:03.155 --> 00:08:06.116
and in that case we would
have something called,

00:08:06.116 --> 00:08:08.388
we would have an activator.

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:09.221
And this,

00:08:10.582 --> 00:08:11.689
let me shade it in,

00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:13.678
this DNA right over here, this would be

00:08:13.678 --> 00:08:17.406
the regulatory sequence
where the activator binds,

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:19.152
and so this would be positive feedback.

00:08:19.152 --> 00:08:20.592
When you have more
activators, you're gonna get

00:08:20.592 --> 00:08:23.539
more transcription, while this would be,

00:08:23.539 --> 00:08:25.629
and actually I shouldn't
even call it feedback

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:27.371
because that implies that somehow

00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:29.799
these products produce the activator,

00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:31.538
or this products produce the repressor,

00:08:31.538 --> 00:08:33.402
but that's not the necessarily the case.

00:08:33.402 --> 00:08:35.316
It could be, you could imagine that case,

00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:36.617
but it's not necessarily the case.

00:08:36.617 --> 00:08:38.331
I should just say that this is repressing

00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:39.578
and this is activating.

00:08:39.578 --> 00:08:42.316
It's going to make more
of the transcription

00:08:42.316 --> 00:08:43.658
actually happen.

00:08:43.658 --> 00:08:46.073
And just as we could have corepressors,

00:08:46.073 --> 00:08:48.041
small molecules that you could think of

00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:50.059
as activating the repressor,

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:53.319
you can also have small
molecules that can turn

00:08:53.319 --> 00:08:55.057
the activator on,

00:08:55.057 --> 00:08:59.212
and these small molecules
that turn the activator on,

00:08:59.212 --> 00:09:02.015
these are called inducers.

00:09:02.015 --> 00:09:03.989
So this right over here,

00:09:03.989 --> 00:09:05.457
these are inducers.

00:09:05.457 --> 00:09:08.718
So this protein right
here couldn't activate

00:09:08.718 --> 00:09:12.343
that operon, but now that
you have these inducers,

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:13.775
and we'll study that a
little bit more when we

00:09:13.775 --> 00:09:15.508
think about the lac operon,

00:09:15.508 --> 00:09:18.504
this could be a small sugar of some kind,

00:09:18.504 --> 00:09:21.836
well then it can turn on the activation.

00:09:21.836 --> 00:09:24.381
So this right over here is called

00:09:24.381 --> 00:09:25.680
an inducer.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.432
So that's just a high-level overview of

00:09:28.432 --> 00:09:29.682
DNA regulation.

00:09:30.525 --> 00:09:33.471
As you can imagine, this can
get very, very interesting

00:09:33.471 --> 00:09:35.591
and complex, where you
have your repressors

00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:38.636
and corepressors and
activators and inducers

00:09:38.636 --> 00:09:41.149
that might be dependent on the environment

00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:42.946
that the cell is in,

00:09:42.946 --> 00:09:46.710
what's going on in its broader ecosystem.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.072
There's all sorts of
feedback and feedforward

00:09:49.072 --> 00:09:50.788
loops that might be going on.

00:09:50.788 --> 00:09:52.969
And that's why the study,
we can have the sequence,

00:09:52.969 --> 00:09:56.007
and in fact we do sequence entire genomes,

00:09:56.007 --> 00:09:57.813
but even once you have the sequence,

00:09:57.813 --> 00:10:00.283
it's incredibly complex to understand

00:10:00.283 --> 00:10:04.648
all of these loops of these
feedback and feedforward loops

00:10:04.648 --> 00:10:06.980
to understand how these
things actually interact

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.313
with each other.
