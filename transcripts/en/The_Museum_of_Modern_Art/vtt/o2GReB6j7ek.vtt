00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.260
Can you zoom in...

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.880
Let's take a look at how the shadows are falling...

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.440
It just isn't...it's still kind of...

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.720
Yeah, we've gotta remember that...

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.960
We're lighting for photogrammetry, instead of...

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.100
...instead of for a single shot.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.440
So I think we're in good shape.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.420
I like the evenness though, for that.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.730
Yeah, exactly.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.500
So yeah, that's all right for that...

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.000
We're doing photogrammetry.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.500
And photogrammetry is essentially taking two-dimensional images and turning it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.400
into three-dimensional data.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.060
So the idea with photogrammetry is that we're
gonna shoot this model in about 200 to 500

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.840
images with the camera at different angles.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.040
And what we'll do is triangulate the angles
in software, and we'll come up with a 3D rendering.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.400
If it's done correctly, we'll actually have
an accurate model that's equally accurate to

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.580
laser scanning.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.160
But we're just using a regular DSLR camera
and traditional photography principles.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.670
So, it's pretty cool.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:42.229
So I'm thinking we'll start two thirds off
the end, go this way, convex planar, go this

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.530
way, that way, come back planar, this way.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.860
Just work our way as far out as we can on
each side...

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.640
So for all of them, just as a dry run, so
what you're saying is so we're gonna start...

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.729
Yeah, we'll start right there.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.149
On that line.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.810
And then we're gonna move over, and gonna
do it...

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.920
Right there.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.540
Right.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.400
And then lining up so that...

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.640
Okay...

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.700
Right there.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.380
Right.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.240
And then keep going down the line?

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.740
Yep.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.240
Okay...

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.520
There we go.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.520
Okay.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.640
All right, so I'm gonna pull the card...

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.460
Pull the card so that we're getting...

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.100
Well, it looks a little on the mushy side.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.200
Why don't we focus just slightly above the
minimum surface level?

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.520
We'll nail our focus about here.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.400
Right.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.020
If it doesn't carry to the tower, then we'll
go back and get pickup shots with...

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.960
Of the tower, even after...

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.460
Yeah.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.100
...the fact?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.780
So that just means that we can't process all
the files together.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.230
We'll separate out the tower, we'll make it
into a separate chunk, and then we'll realign

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.220
that later on.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.600
Okay, we got a plan.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.120
Yeah, makes it a little bit...one more step,
but it's not too bad.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.620
Okay.
