00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.139
The Association [Between] the great irish writer Samuel Beckett and the game of cricket

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.198
Deserves to Be more Widely Known he

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.179

Wisdoms The Cricketers Bible the only Nobel Prize Winner to be so lauded on One Occasion in the Mid-1960s

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.250
Beckett Travelled From Paris To London to Watch the Test Match between England and Australia it was [a] beautiful Sunny summer Afternoon

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.069
Blue Skies Lord's Cricket Ground [Green] and Glorious One of his Friends Remarked

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.579
What A wonderful day this is A sort of day that Would Make you glad to be alive

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.020
- Which Beckett Responded dryly, I, wouldn't go as far as that

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.699
The Story Nicely Encompasses Two aspects of Samuel Beckett his Famously Bleak view of life and his

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.669
mordant Sense of Humor if as Horace Walpole

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.229
Remarked The World Is a comedy to those who think and a tragedy to those who feel it is fitting that beckett's Waiting for godot

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:15.059
Is subtitled a tragic Comedy in his Theatrical Images and Prose writings Beckett achieve Despair beauty [and]

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.629
Articulation of Human Suffering Shot Through With Dark Comedy [and] Humor it Seems Almost too

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.850
Coincidental That This Most Famous Dramatist of Desolation Whose Work Teams With biblical

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.909
Allusion Would be Born on the day of the Crucifixion yet Samuel [Barkley] Beckett, was Born on good Friday?

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.549
13th of April 1906 in The Affluent Village of Fox Rock eight Miles south of Dublin

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.379
Beckett was Educated at Portora royal School enniskillen Now in [Northern] [Ireland] the Alma Mater of Another great irish Playwright

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.920
Oscar Wilde Where he Excelled Academically and at Sports

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.399
He Graduated from Trinity College [Dublin] in 1927

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.739
First in his Class and was awarded [the] college's Gold medal he Seemed destined for a Glittering

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:06.869
Academic Career and in October 1928 he Headed to Paris for a tWo-year Exchange Fellowship at the distinguished it Called Norman Superior

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.969
his Immersion in The Parisian Literary Scene Had a Profound Impact on the Young irishman

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.390
He Became attached to [this] of Another great irish writer

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.570
James Joyce The Revered Author of Ulysses Published in 1922 and in 1929 published

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.669
His First Critical Essay on Joyce's Work-In-Progress Which Would become Fatigue ins Wake

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.210
On his Return to Dublin Beckett was Unhappy lecturing at Trinity College and resigned Out a little more Than a year

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.959
He often Said that he gave up his [Job] Because he Could not bear Teaching to Others what he, did not Know Himself

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.300
At this Point Samuel Beckett Determined to be a writer and a man of Letters in

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.239
1931 He Published A short Critical Book

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.450
Boost on the great french writer Which Brilliantly IDentified that proust was a Philosopher and his Long Novel

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:02.190
Was in Essence A search for the Meaning of life which rests proust Thought and Beckett agreed on the Making and Appreciation of Art

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.840
Despite The Brilliance of This Essay Beckett Would Have Many setbacks and Rejections in his attempts to [establish] Himself in the Literary World [an]

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.850
Echo of the Themes of Failure that Would so dominate, his Work he Failed to get

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.979
His First Serious attempt at a Novel Dream Affair to Middling women published Though much of it

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.260
Was Reworked Into a short Story Collection more Pricks than kicks Which came out in 1934 the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.700
next Year he published A

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.299
Slim Volume of Poetry Echoes Bones and other Precipitates

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.099
Marked like much Work of This period With dense Erudition and Pessimism

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.650
Beckett's London Novel Murphy was Completed in 1936 This Comic Novel of Ideas is Probably his most Accessible least?

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.850
Experimental Full-Length Work Though This Didn't stop its Going Through 42

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.440
Rejections Before Finally Being Published by ravage in 1938

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.529
Beckett Had Long Suffered from Panic Attacks Anxiety and Depression often With Terrible Physical

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.850
Manifestations he Went To London in The Early 1930s to Undertake Psychoanalysis

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.030
With A famous British Analyst Wilfred Bion

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.009
The interest he Developed in Psychology and Psychiatry Showed Constantly in The asylum Scenes in Murphy and in his next Novel what

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.399
Written While Hiding out in Rural France during the Second World war

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:24.419
His personal Experience of Psychotherapy Emerges [Too] in His later Work much of Which Is in the Form of a Monologue

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.010
[Whereas] Speaker Gabbles in A kind of Delirium To a faceless listener much as, one might at moments in Analysis

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.279
Though Beckett's Works for Highly Nonspecific and tend not to refer Explicitly to the second World war

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.550
Or other historical Events There is little doubt that the traumas of History Deeply Scoured his Imagination

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.270
Appalled by the Treatment of his Jewish [Friends] under Nazi Occupation

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.210
Beckett Became Actively Involved in The Resistance in Paris Principally as an Information Handler

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.800
Beckett's Experience for The Wall and The Devastation he Witnessed in France Afterwards Seems to Have Contributed to a radical Change of Direction

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:09.380
During A return visit to Dublin in 1946 Beckett Had A Vision or Revelation of Literary Purpose Which Marks the Divide between

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.559
1930s Work Third-Person Erudite [Emissions] and A Dwindled Bewildered

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.499
First-Person Story Telling of his Mature Prose

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:27.170
Unlike Some of his Early Writing Which Shows the Influence of Joyce in his Wordplay and Heavy Allusion to other Literary Works the Post-war Work

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.259
Carries it Learning more Likely Making Ignorance Impotence and Failure its key Preoccupations

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:41.240
This Change in Direction was Accompanied by the decision to write in French There Followed between 1946 and 1950 A

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:49.129
Frenzy of writing Which Included much of the Work Which Samuel Beckett is now Famous Namely Waiting for godot and his great Trilogy of Novels

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.759
[Malloy] Malone dies and The unnameable

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.200
Oniton dog Order

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.400
Was written between October 1948 and January 1949 as A?

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:05.840
Diversion From the more Taxing as beckett's [orid] Business of Prose Composition it was eventually Staged in A small

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.410
Avant-Garde Parisian [Theatre] in January of 1953

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.170
The Plays immense Success

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.529
Generated international Controversy and wide Interest

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.850
Set on A bare Stage

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.670
Apart from a Lone Tree and One Rock With Two Characters Exchanging

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.099
Inconsequential Dialogue While Waiting at the Side of A road for a Character who never Comes

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.250
Beckett's Play Provoked Confusion and Hostility When an English Version Transferred to London in

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.640
1955 it was greeted With Whistles and Jeers of Derision

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.400
However Waiting for godot

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:46.659
Sukh Said A scandal and it's Arguably the most influential play of the whole of the 20th Century?

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:52.389
[Gato] Presents A Dark Vision of Human life Mixed with Plenty of Vaudeville Antics and

00:06:52.759 --> 00:07:00.188
Slapstick Comedy The [Play's] Action or Inaction Seems at points Suggestive of Universal Or an Existential Condition

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.558
But at. This Place and at this Moment in Time all Mankind Is us whether

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:11.588
We like it or not Declares One Character did the non arrival of God oh Critics Pondered?

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:16.029
Suggest The Absence of God in The modern World [or] did the play Rather

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:20.289
Dramatize The Yearning and Sense of Incompleteness in Which, We live Most of our Lives?

00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:24.309
Most People after all exists in A state of Anticipation or

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:30.339
Future-Oriented Ness Once I get the right Job or the right House or my beloved said yes Or I retire

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:34.539
Then I will be happy but Once Desire Or Ambition is realized

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:42.158
We start To want something Else The ultimate Satisfaction the God, oh who, will Give us final Fulfillment Never Arrives

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:44.839
Yet for all These Philosophical

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:51.638
Interpretations Nothing is Certain in Beckett's Work he Once Remarked that the key Word in my plays is perhaps

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:57.518
It May Be that Dec its greatest achievement it Is Brave Depictions not of a Pessimistic Outlook

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:03.279
But of A bewildered One if We leave his Plays Perplexed then this IS an Appropriate Response?

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:11.439
We too are Waiting for something that Never Arrives the Reassurance of A clarity of Meaning of Certainty Even The Certainty of?

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.339
Darkness

00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:20.948
Beckett, was Almost Instinctively a Master of The Stage his next great Play Endgame in 1957 Gives us the

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.469
Enduring Image of Human beings in Dust bins

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:30.969
Outside The Room in Which [the] Action Takes place all Seems dead gray and Corpse in Some Sort of Post Apocalyptic Devastation

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:34.448
That Speaks Urgently to our Own Era of Environmental

00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:40.688
Crisis Though A black Humour in Jaws Even Human values and meanings Seem to be Draining away

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:43.749
One Character Remarks as if an answer to those who

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:50.979
Would Turn Beckett's Work Into mere Philosophy Means Something you and I mean Something huh that's A good one at?

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.219
His Career Progressed [Becket's] Plays and Pros

00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:55.970
Generally Became Ever More

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:01.989
Condensed and Minimal The Plays Would often Focus on a single Intense Image the woman buried up to

00:09:01.989 --> 00:09:07.989
her waist in the Sand happy Days a man and Two women Fixed in Some sort of purgatorial urns

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:15.549
Babbling out The Story of Their Adulterous Triangle play a single illuminated Mouth Telling Stories in the Third-Person

00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:18.009
Terrified of using the word I

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.470
Not I

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.319
Beckett Gives Us Works of Art That Offer an Experience

00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:29.979
Not Just an Idea Or a takeaway Message he Takes Us Into the Perplexity of the modern Condition in Which the traditional

00:09:30.619 --> 00:09:35.738
Consolations Belief in A providential Plan Or Hopes for civilizational Progress Have

00:09:35.739 --> 00:09:36.910
Been Shattered by the Barbarism

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.470
of war and Holocaust

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:45.879
Yet if Beckett's Work Presents Us with Human Extremity There are Moments of Fellow Feeling of Compassion and of Exquisite Black Humor

00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:48.638
Moreover His Writing Is marked With the most Scrupulous

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:55.089
Exactitude and Precision There is a shape to his chaos one Which emerges With A sort of Wintry Serenity A

00:09:55.399 --> 00:10:03.399
Combo Let extractor to his Plays it Is this formal and Artistic achievement that allows us to cherish in Beckett's Work a, fragile

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.220
Necessary Grace
