1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,010
It's, um, I mean, time to change
me. You been around for a long time.

2
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:07,570
My friend, I remember the first time
I ever saw you fight. It was a bar,

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,560
a backyard, bare knuckle
fight in the Kimbo slice days.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,910
That was the first time I heard about you.

5
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:16,860
And then I saw you fight Eve Edwards
and Bodog remember Bo dog fight? Yeah.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,910
It was a golden age. The golden age is
manager while ago. Damn. It's crazy.

7
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:25,200
Like Bodog fight was fun organization
and Cain Velasquez fought there.

8
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:29,450
Chill son and fought there. Eddie
average. That's right. Yeah.

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,220
Pay Door fatal or had a fight over.
They're afraid or had a fight over there.

10
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:36,700
Brad Pickett as well. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm Mike Brown. Yeah. What,

11
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:39,100
what happened with them?
They went under because of the,

12
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:41,800
the whole gambling rules online changed.
Right.

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,480
From what I heard from no one I heard
was the spending budget. This is what I,

14
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:49,040
what I heard, um, Calvin there,
there was the owner of both, right.

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,940
He put up this huge budget and these are
just rumors from what I heard from the

16
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:57,840
people working, you know, but it was
like $100 million for Xyz amount.

17
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:01,170
I used to get him publicity so people
would see the fights and then go to the

18
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:04,860
casino and that a hundred minutes and
got blown out like in two to three years

19
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:06,350
is what I heard.
Oh.

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,710
And I wouldn't disagree cause they used
to pay me really good and give us super

21
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,200
perks. They usually give us
some super perks, you know,

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,710
take us to exotic locations to fight,
be there for two weeks,

23
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:19,350
you plus two they'd fly out,
take care of you. They really,

24
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:21,030
really took very good care of me.

25
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,000
So when I heard that they
blew out a hundred minutes
in three years, I was like,

26
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:24,834
yeah, it could be, you know.

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,400
Well they were fighting on the beach
with hot girls in bikinis and wandered

28
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:33,180
around dancing. But you were on the
beach like in the sun. I was like,

29
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:36,600
what the who the fucking ideas to
fight in the sun. But let me tell you,

30
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:38,280
the training sessions that went on,

31
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:41,390
there were some of the best that I've
seen in the world because they it.

32
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,480
So you would go and you'd bring two of
your corner men and then somebody found

33
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,450
that and then before you know you had
like four people over your entourage going

34
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,630
with you from whatever team that was.
And everybody was doing that.

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,520
And we'd have a,
a training place.

36
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,990
And what they had done was laid
out tarps and mats and it was huge.

37
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,740
So we'd have like a hundred pros,
50 pearls from all over the world,

38
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:04,350
just training, you know, and when you
to know each other and it's like, hey,

39
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:06,090
you want a roll? You know, it
gets competitive, you know.

40
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,830
So there was some great training
sessions that I saw and that I,

41
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:13,840
that I took a part of, you
know? Wow. Yeah. It was fun,
man. Good fucking time. Look,

42
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:17,590
the, the world needs more of
those. They meed more one fcs.

43
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:21,280
We need more bell tours. We need
more, you know, competition,

44
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,200
whatever the professional
fight leagues called now,

45
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:26,530
what do they call themselves now?
Is that what it is?

46
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:30,220
It's Pfl used to be world
series of fighting. That's
right. Yeah. We need more,

47
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,930
need more of them. Also PFLs world series.
He used to be world series downs. PFL.

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,370
Okay. Yeah, I think pretty sure. Most
of the same organization. Oh yeah.

49
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,820
Do you need, we need more.
You know, I need more money.

50
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,640
She's got that Oscar de la Hoya thing.
You know that.

51
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,850
That's probably never gonna happen again
after the, the Tito and chuck fight.

52
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,120
It does look like,
but someone of that ilk,

53
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,160
someone like a golden boy promotions,

54
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:56,860
they started getting involved
in MMA and putting together,

55
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,060
they could get some guys that aren't
signed but are super high level with a big

56
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:01,301
name.

57
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:05,230
Like maybe the contract comes up and
they decided to do something with a big

58
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,480
name promoter. You know,
it'd be good for everybody.
