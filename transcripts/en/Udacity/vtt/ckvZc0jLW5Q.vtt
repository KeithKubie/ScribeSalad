00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.050
Okay, so we talked about information
that we think is private,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.890
also something we thought
perhaps is not private.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.240
And then we talked about threats,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.150
how that information can potentially
be abused while letting out privacy.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.540
So one thing that companies do,
companies that we interact with

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.870
in the online world,
is that they have privacy policies.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.810
So they say, if you're going to track
what you do, or we're going to keep it

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.100
from collecting information that
we think you might see as private.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.473
Well, how exactly what we can do
with that, we're going to define,

00:00:37.473 --> 00:00:38.810
that in a privacy policy.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.990
Most websites have
these privacy policies.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.080
How many of us actually
looked at them carefully?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.310
That's a different question.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.570
So we going to look at one example.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.350
Who else to go but
Google that knows a lot about you.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.140
Has collects that information,
builds a profile for you.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.780
So let's sort of look into what is
collected, why is it collected,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.170
how can be shared.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.890
This is all captured in this
policy that Google has.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.230
So let's see some
details of that policy.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.950
So let's start with what information
is collected about us by Google.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.690
Well, all kind of personal information.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.840
We agreed to give it to Google,
actually.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.865
Name, email address,
credit card number, telephone number,

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:23.245
G-mail now does stronger authentication,
using your telephone number.

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:27.257
This is information that we provide
to Google when we set up an account,

00:01:27.257 --> 00:01:29.445
when we create an account.

00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:32.495
This is our personal information
we're giving it to Google.

00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:36.960
Essentially it's private information,
so what can be done with it?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.790
Of course we want to address that.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.400
With visit certain websites or
use Google services,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.030
of course, Google will know about it,
and they can track and record it.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.960
And Google's business model is
that they use it for advertising.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.650
So, we know why they're doing that.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.990
They actually have information
about your device,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.890
from where are you're coming, to Google.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.230
So what kind of hardware it is,
what operating system it's running,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.490
its IP address,
network information, and so on.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.410
So they would have that.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.665
Interestingly, in the case of Google,
they would also know your

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:14.977
search queries, what kind of things
you look for on the internet,

00:02:14.977 --> 00:02:17.480
what kind of information
you're interested in.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.720
If you use Google Voice, they would
know who you call, how long you talk.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.520
And cookies are sort of more
general mechanism by which websites

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.930
keep track of various
types of information,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.370
in particular when we register
them before and things like that.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.685
So cookies,
at some state they keep on our machine,

00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:44.095
about what we have done with respect
to these websites in the past.

00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:46.665
Google actually does set cookies

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:50.390
that they're going to use to track
your activities that you do.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.850
They also collect your
location information,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.890
what kind of applications you use.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.710
All this is what is collected, okay.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.770
So privacy policy should say this is
the information we collect about you.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.600
Well this is an example of
what Google collects about you
