00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.816
We studied a number of different
authentication methods and

00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:06.674
their implementation
in a computer system.

00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:11.539
Our security mindset approach requires
that we consider any threats that

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.628
may exist against these methods and
their implementations.

00:00:15.628 --> 00:00:19.897
So, we did consider the strengths and
weaknesses that exist for

00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:24.020
each of these methods and
how we use them in computer systems.
