00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.370
SPEAKER 1: Stuck
right in the middle

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.330
of this beautiful,
serene water sits

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.150
this brown, stark, brick
building which is either

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.100
the ugliest resort in
the world, or some kind

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.910
of mini Alcatraz-- a place
built to keep people in.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.370
Which, it is.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.220
This place actually once held
one of America's most famous

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.720
prisoners.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.789
The person who took this
aerial shot is this man.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.330
STEVE RICH: Hi, my
name's Steve Rich.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.060
I'm from Aiken, South Carolina,
and I enjoy photography

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.810
as a hobby.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.555
These photos were taken on a
flight from Key West, Florida

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.635
to Fort Jefferson,
Dry Tortugas, in April

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:42.640
of 2010 while on a small private
plane flying over the island.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.160
Access to the island can only
be done by sea plane or by boat.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.720
Our plane was not equipped
for landing on the water,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.199
so I enjoyed an afternoon of
picture taking from there.

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.990
SPEAKER 1: Now for a
quick geography lesson

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.760
to make it clear
just went Steve was.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180
These are the Dry
Tortugas, a small group

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.990
of islands about 70 miles
off the coast of Key West,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.180
Florida, that the US purchased
from Spain in the early 1800s.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.120
It was named by none other
than Ponce de Leon in 1513.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.450
STEVE RICH: Tortugas
means turtles in Spanish.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.270
The name Dry Tortugas was
later given to the island

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.080
to indicate to other mariners
that the land mass lacked

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.350
fresh water, which was an
extremely important detail

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.689
to seafarers to know.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.480
SPEAKER 1: And now for
your history lesson.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.980
Dry Tortugas is one of
the smallest and most

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.240
remote national parks, that not
only protects the reef islands

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.100
and sea life, but also
these historic shipwrecks.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.340
And this place, Fort Jefferson.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.900
It was built as a strategically
placed military fort

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.110
to combat piracy
in the Caribbean

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.320
that was never
completed, and eventually

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.480
ended up as a military
prison after the Civil War.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.240
And it once held a
very notorious man.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.820
STEVE RICH: Fort Jefferson's
most famous prisoner,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.740
Doctor Samuel Mudd,
left his historical mark

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.040
on the Dry Tortugas.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.100
He is most infamously
known for his involvement

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.190
in the assassination of
President Abraham Lincoln, who

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.190
was shot by John Wilkes Booth.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.259
During his assassination
of the President,

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.060
John Wilkes Booth broke
his leg and sought

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.295
the help of Doctor Mudd, who
stayed at Mudd's residence

00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:17.150
until the next day.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.610
Doctor Mudd was later
arrested for conspiracy

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.820
and for harboring Mr. Booth.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.940
Doctor Mudd was
convicted and sentenced

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.182
to life imprisonment at Fort
Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas.

00:02:28.182 --> 00:02:30.015
SPEAKER 1: However,
there was a happy ending

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:32.620
for Doctor Mudd, who was
pardoned by President Andrew

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.820
Johnson.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.920
But maybe an even happier
ending for the fort itself

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.660
and the islands and marine
life that surround them.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.880
STEVE RICH: Seeing the
many islands from the air

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.590
was truly amazing.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.190
We saw sharks,
stingrays, shipwrecks.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.810
Fort Jefferson is part of
our National Park Service

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.610
and represents what really is
special to the American people.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.880
I feel like our park
service takes great pride

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.430
in preserving historical
areas of our great country.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.555

00:03:07.555 --> 00:03:08.750

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.400
