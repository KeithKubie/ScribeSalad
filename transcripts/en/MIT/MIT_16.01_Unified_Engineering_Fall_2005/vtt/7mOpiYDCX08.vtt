00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.869
INTERVIEWER:
Hi.

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.000
Can you tell us your name and
what course you teach?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.636
PROF.
WAITZ: My name is Ian Waitz and

00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:17.705
I teach Unified Engineering.
INTERVIEWER:

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:20.000
Can you tell us a bit about the
class?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.250
PROF.
WAITZ: It is a large class that

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.500
is put together by several
different faculty members.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.000
We have taught it this way for
about 25 or 30 years.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
INTERVIEWER:
In which department?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.192
PROF.
WAITZ: In Aeronautics and

00:00:32.192 --> 00:00:35.187
Astronautics.
And it provides education in

00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:38.768
several of the important
disciplines for Aerospace

00:00:38.768 --> 00:00:41.910
Engineering or Aeronautics and
Astronautics;

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.271
structures, fluids,
propulsion, thermodynamics,

00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:49.436
computers and programming,
signals and systems and systems

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:52.505
engineering.
And those are all taught in an

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:55.281
integrated way over a year long
period.

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:59.227
And it is two semesters with
two subjects per semester,

00:00:59.227 --> 00:01:05.000
so it is the equivalent of four
subjects put together in one.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.897
INTERVIEWER:
And how many students take this

00:01:06.897 --> 00:01:08.305
and what year are they?
PROF.

00:01:08.305 --> 00:01:11.912
WAITZ: It is the entry-level
subject, or set of subjects for

00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:14.602
our department,
so all students who come into

00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:17.414
our department take it.
And they all take it as

00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:20.532
sophomores primarily.
And this year we have about 75

00:01:20.532 --> 00:01:22.537
students in it.
INTERVIEWER:

00:01:22.537 --> 00:01:25.134
And I understand there has been
a bit of a team approach to

00:01:25.134 --> 00:01:27.283
teaching the class.
Can you describe how that was

00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:28.355
worked out?
PROF.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.338
WAITZ: Yes.
It has evolved over time but we

00:01:31.338 --> 00:01:35.457
are each allotted a certain
number of lectures of the total

00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:39.008
number of lectures.
And for each lecture there is a

00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:42.914
homework that goes with that.
And those lectures are all

00:01:42.914 --> 00:01:47.247
interwoven with one another in a
certain order that makes some

00:01:47.247 --> 00:01:50.514
sense in terms of the delivery
of the material.

00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:54.662
And it is team taught.
But you show up and teach your

00:01:54.662 --> 00:01:57.598
lectures and you tend to work
with the other people to

00:01:57.598 --> 00:02:00.867
understand what their teaching
at the same time that you are

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:02.806
teaching.
You try and develop common

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:05.853
problems, common homework
problems that stress more than

00:02:05.853 --> 00:02:08.567
one discipline so that you can
look at some of the

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:11.614
inner-relationships and
trade-offs between the different

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:13.642
disciplines.
INTERVIEWER:

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:15.142
OK.
So what do students do in

00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:17.017
class?
Is it primarily lecture or do

00:02:17.017 --> 00:02:19.282
they work in groups on projects?
PROF.

00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:21.935
WAITZ: The classes are
lecture-based but we have

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:24.362
adopted a lot of active learning
strategies.

00:02:24.362 --> 00:02:27.072
And we have done that for the
last several years.

00:02:27.072 --> 00:02:29.895
There are two techniques that
we use predominantly.

00:02:29.895 --> 00:02:32.153
One we call the Personal
Response System,

00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:34.966
PRS.
It is a commercially available

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:37.063
product.
It is a small television

00:02:37.063 --> 00:02:39.618
clicker.
I have got one here some place.

00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:41.781
So this is the television
clicker.

00:02:41.781 --> 00:02:45.058
And typically in a lecture
there will be one or two

00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:48.269
questions that are asked,
sometimes three or four,

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.808
and the students respond to
these with these television

00:02:51.808 --> 00:02:54.298
clickers.
And in real-time in the class

00:02:54.298 --> 00:02:57.837
we get the responses back.
And we can look at graphs of

00:02:57.837 --> 00:03:01.707
their responses.
So it is a short five or ten

00:03:01.707 --> 00:03:05.121
minute lecture with a question.
Another short five or ten

00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:07.073
minute lecture,
another question.

00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:10.121
And that allows you in
real-time to understand what

00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:13.841
they are having difficulty with
and what things they have made

00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:17.439
progress on understanding and
adjust your lecture as you go.

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.731
That is the primary in-class
technique for engaging the

00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:23.109
students.
We don't grade them on whether

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.182
or not they get the right
response.

00:03:25.182 --> 00:03:30.000
We just grade them on whether
or not they have hit the button.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.146
So it is part of the subject
grade.

00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:35.872
There is an attendance score
which is calculated by how many

00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:39.470
times they have pressed the
button out of the total number

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.186
of questions that are asked.
And, as I said,

00:03:42.186 --> 00:03:46.100
it is two or three per lecture.
The second thing that we do for

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.510
each lecture is at the end we
finish the lectures a few

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.793
minutes early and we ask the
students to fill out the

00:03:52.793 --> 00:03:56.329
muddiest part of the lecture
cards, so here are some from

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.044
lecture today,
where we ask them to take two

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:03.022
or three minutes and reflect on
the items that were discussed in

00:04:03.022 --> 00:04:07.000
lecture and which part was the
least clear.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.423
So the muddiest part of the
lecture.

00:04:09.423 --> 00:04:12.954
And these are terrific.
With these you can find out,

00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:16.140
in an anonymous way,
in the student's own words

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.502
which things they found to work
and which things that they found

00:04:20.502 --> 00:04:23.618
to be difficult.
And often you find that items

00:04:23.618 --> 00:04:27.565
that are tripping them up are
the symbols that you used or

00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:31.650
that they have some lack of
understanding or some deficiency

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.666
in remember some prerequisite
subject material that you had

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:39.128
presumed that they had.
And getting this after each

00:04:39.128 --> 00:04:43.283
lecture then you can take action
on these either by modifying

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:47.368
your next lecture or what I do
is respond to them all on the

00:04:47.368 --> 00:04:51.710
subject webpage.
So I just write short answers

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.248
for each of the questions and
the students can go and look at

00:04:55.248 --> 00:04:57.371
that.
So those are the two techniques

00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:00.792
that we use within the lectures
for better feedback and for

00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:03.210
active learning.
There is also a series of

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.984
laboratory exercises and systems
problems, but I presume you will

00:05:06.984 --> 00:05:10.346
get an interview with Charles
Coleman or something to talk

00:05:10.346 --> 00:05:13.441
about that aspect of the course.
INTERVIEWER:

00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:15.723
But you had said that there are
laboratory assignments as well,

00:05:15.723 --> 00:05:17.049
and there are other special
elements.

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:19.000
There are field trips and
things for this class.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.848
PROF.
WAITZ: Yes, there are a variety

00:05:21.848 --> 00:05:25.171
of special elements for Unified
as a whole.

00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:29.839
For the lecture that I teach,
one of the things that I do is

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:33.874
wheel in an engine and teach in
front of the engine.

00:05:33.874 --> 00:05:37.830
And it is a real engine.
It is a CFM56 which powers

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.786
Boeing 737 airplanes.
And when you're talking about

00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:45.901
propulsion, having a couple
millions dollars worth of

00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:50.727
hardware there to point to and
shake and have the students ask

00:05:50.727 --> 00:05:55.000
questions about is very,
very helpful.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.880
So there are elements like
that.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.338
There are a lot of in-class
small demonstrations that each

00:06:00.338 --> 00:06:03.675
of us do where we ask people to
work problems where they

00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:06.405
estimate things or small
in-class experiments.

00:06:06.405 --> 00:06:09.924
All of those are in the context
of these concept questions,

00:06:09.924 --> 00:06:13.443
or many of them are where we
ask the students to observe an

00:06:13.443 --> 00:06:17.083
experiment, to think about it
and to respond to some question

00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:20.481
all intended to demonstrate
physical principles or to get

00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:24.000
them to think about concepts in
the class.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.675
INTERVIEWER:
OK.

00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:27.421
Well, we want to thank you very
much for making your materials

00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:29.041
available through MIT
OpenCourseWare.

00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:31.652
Is there anything else you can
think of that you would like

00:06:31.652 --> 00:06:34.083
someone to know about how
Unified is taught or anything

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:36.694
else that might not be obvious
from just viewing the course

00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:38.371
materials online?
PROF.

00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:41.123
WAITZ: No.
I would just say that it is

00:06:41.123 --> 00:06:44.991
very important to us in
developing and delivering the

00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:49.082
course materials that it be
viewed by the students in an

00:06:49.082 --> 00:06:53.099
integrated way as a package so
that none of the sets of

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:56.669
materials were developed as
independent pieces on

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:00.983
thermodynamics or fluids but
they were developed within the

00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:05.000
context of it being an
integrated course.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.615
And we think that is very
important for educating students

00:07:08.615 --> 00:07:11.976
in aeronautics and astronautics
that they do have this

00:07:11.976 --> 00:07:15.718
integrated system level view of
how the pieces fit together.

00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:19.270
And we prefer to start that
early by doing it all at once

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.949
early in their careers and then
have them take disciplinary

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:25.676
specialties later on rather than
vice versa.

00:07:25.676 --> 00:07:29.291
So that is the only thing that
I would point out about it,

00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:32.653
that it really has been
developed to be an integrative

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:35.421
learning environment.
INTERVIEWER:

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:36.543
OK.
Well, thank you very much for

00:07:36.543 --> 00:07:37.173
your time.
PROF.

00:07:37.173 --> 00:07:38.239
WAITZ: Pleasure.
