00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.520
Hi, I’m John Green and this is the final
episode of Crash Course: World History, not

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.090
because we’ve reached the end of history
but because we’ve reached the particular

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.780
middle where I happen to be living. Today
we’ll be considering whether globalization

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.390
is a good thing, and along the way we’ll
try to do something that you may not be used

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.099
to doing in history classes: imagining the
future.

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.499
Past John: Mr. Green, Mr. Green! In the future,
I’m gonna get to second base with Molly Brown.

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.819
Present John: No you won’t, Me from the
Past, but the fact that when asked to imagine

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:31.139
THE future, you imagine YOUR future says a
lot about the contemporary world. And listen,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.260
Me From the Past, while there’s no question
that your solipsistic individualism is bad both for

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.560
you and for our species, the broader implications 
of individualism in general are a lot more complex.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:50.660
[Theme Music]

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.380
Man, I’m gonna miss you, Intro.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.240
So last week (ta-da) we discussed how global
economic interdependence has led, on average,

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:01.760
to longer, healthier, more prosperous lives
for humans--not to mention an astonishing

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.850
change in the overall human population. In
the West, globalization has also led to the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.970
rise of a service economy. In the US and Europe,
most people now work not in agriculture or

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.119
manufacturing but in some kind of service
sector: healthcare, retail, education, entertainment,

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.840
information technology, Internet videos about
world history, etc. And that switch has really

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.869
changed our psychology, especially the psychology
of upper classes living in the industrialized world.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.219
I mean, to quote Fredric Jameson, “we are...so
far removed from the realities of production

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.479
and work that we inhabit a dream world of
artificial stimuli and televised experience.”

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.039
Think of it this way: if you had to kill a
chicken every time you visited KFC, you would

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.520
probably eat fewer chickens. Another change
of psychology: many historians-of-the-now

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.770
note that globalization has also led to a
celebration of individualism, particularly

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.950
in the wake of the failures of the Marxist
collectivist utopias.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.820
The generation that lived through the Depression
and World War II saw large-scale collectivist

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.149
responses to both those crises. And they were
responses that limited freedom. Like, the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.229
military draft, for instance, which limited
your freedom, you know, not to be a soldier.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.050
Or the collectivization of health insurance
seen in most of the post-war West, which limited

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.190
your freedom to go bankrupt from health care
costs. Or also government programs like social

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.550
security, which limit your freedom not to
pay for old people’s retirement.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.940
But since the 1960s, the ascendant idea of
personal freedom minimally limited by government

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.500
intervention has become very powerful. Even
the Catholic church was part of this new search

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.730
for individual freedom, as the Second Vatican
Council relaxed church rules in ways that

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.250
weakened central authority, made concessions
to individual styles of worship, even said

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.000
that people of different religions could go
to heaven. What good is heaven if it’s gonna

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.530
be full of Protestants? It’s just gonna
be like Minnesota.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.120
So here in the last episode of Crash Course
World History, in the last thirty seconds,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.540
I have offended, uh, 5/6ths of the world’s
population in the form of non-Catholics and,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.140
uh, all Republicans, and probably some political
moderates. Who are confused about what Obama’s

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.840
healthcare law will and will not do. Stan,
maybe I should just make this episode just

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.410
an extended rant where I reveal all of my
political biases. And also my personal biases.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.720
Look, you’re never gonna meet a historian
who doesn’t have biases. But good historians

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.360
try to acknowledge their biases and I am biased
toward Canada and its awesome healthcare system.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.080
I can’t lie. I’m very jealous of you guys.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.000
But perhaps the greatest effect of the victory
of individualism was on sex and the family.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.130
We haven’t talked much about sex because
my brother’s teaching Biology, which is

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.230
basically just sex, but sex is pretty important
historically because it’s how we keep happening.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.690
But, in the 20th century, greater variety
and availability of contraception made it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.010
possible for people to experiment with multiple
sexual partners and helped to uncouple sex

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.910
from child bearing, which was awesome, but
individualism also had a destabilizing effect

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.490
on families.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.200
As the great Leo Tolstoy put it, all happy
families are alike, but each unhappy family

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.140
is unhappy in its own way. But when your individual
fulfillment trumps all, you needn’t live

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.200
amid your uniquely unhappy family, you can
just leave! So, divorce rates have skyrocketed

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.820
in the past few decades, and not just in the
US. By the turn of the 21st century, divorce

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.750
rates in China reached nearly 25%, with 70%
of those divorces initiated by women.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.539
Technology has also driven families apart,
as parents and children spend increasing time

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.099
alone in front of their individual screens,
sharing fewer experiences. That’s individualism,

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.009
too, but not of a kind that we usually celebrate.

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.800
But probably the biggest consequence of globalization
and the ensuing rise in human population has

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.099
been humanity's effect on the environment.
While populations have increased partly thanks

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:40.729
to better yields from existing farmland, much
more land has also been brought under cultivation

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.569
in the past half-century. Often this meant
cutting down trees in valuable rainforests–

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.430
the best known example of this is what’s
going on in the Amazon, but it happens worldwide.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.590
And we're losing land not just for food, but
also to grow the global economy. Oh, it’s

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.120
time for the open letter?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.870
An Open Letter to Flowers. But first, let’s
see what’s in the secret compartment today.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.349
Oh, it’s fake flowers. Thank you, Stan.
One for behind each ear.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.629
Dear Flowers, You capture the best and the
worst of the globalized economy. You’re

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.810
so pretty. Even the fake ones are pretty.
But the real one are constantly dying. They’ve

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.460
got to be harvested, and shipped, and cut
very efficiently. And it’s a global phenomenon.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.360
Like there are flowers in my corner market
from Africa. These are from China, but because

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.379
they are plastic, they could just be shipped
in a shipping container.

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.610
More people can afford to apologize by giving
their romantic partners professionally cut

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.219
and arranged roses than in any time in human
history, but in that we have lost something,

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.449
which is that the whole idea of flowers is
that you had to go out into the field and,

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.199
like, cut them and arrange them yourself to
apologize. It’s not supposed to be, “I’m

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.280
sorry I forgot your birthday. Here’s $8
worth of work that was done in Kenya.” It’s

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.099
supposed to be, “I’m sorry I forgot your
birthday, so I went into the frakking forest

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.229
and got you some frakking flowers."

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.120
Anyway, flowers, Best wishes, John Green

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.800
Aww... you guys got me flowers for my last
episode of World History. Okay, let’s go

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.029
to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:11.419
As worldwide production and consumption increases,
we use more resources, especially water and

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.319
fossil fuels. Globalization has made the average
human richer, and rich people tend to use

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:21.979
more of everything but especially energy.
This has already resulted in climate change,

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:23.539
which will likely accelerate.

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.669
The global economy isn’t a zero-sum game.
Like, I don’t need to become more poor in

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:34.060
order for someone else to become more rich.
But growth, at least so far, has been dependent

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.860
upon unsustainable use of the planet's resources.
The planet can’t sustain seven billion automobiles,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.509
for instance, or seven billion frequent flyers,
although most of us who can afford to drive

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:47.099
or fly feel entitled to do so.

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:50.219
You'll remember that when we talked about
the Industrial Revolution, we discussed the

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:55.550
virtuous cycle of more efficiency making things
cheaper, which in turn made them easier to

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.770
buy, which increased demand, which increased
efficiency. But from the perspective of the

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:06.509
planet, each turn in that cycle takes something:
More land under cultivation, more carbon emissions,

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:11.770
more resource extraction. That can’t go
on forever, but worryingly, our current models

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.520
of economic growth don’t allow for any other
way.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.599
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:19.659
And then there is our astonishingly robust
health. Although much of the world has been

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:24.770
ravaged by HIV/AIDS for the past three decades,
there’s been a relative lack of global pandemics

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.650
since the 1918 flu. And that’s particularly
surprising given increased population density

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:35.300
and more travel between population centers.
China has seen 150 million people leave the

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.659
countryside for cities in the last 20 years.
This was Shanghai in 1990; and this is Shanghai

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:50.009
in 2010. The population of Lagos was 41,000
in 1900; today, it's almost 8 million. Of

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:54.969
course, people have been moving from country
to city for a long time; remember Gilgamesh?

00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:58.860
But the pace of that change has dramatically
accelerated.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.759
Similarly, there's nothing new about international
trade, but its pace has also increased dramatically:

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:10.150
In 1960, trade accounted for 24% of the world's
GDP; today, it’s more than double that.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:15.689
Almost no human being alive today lives with
stuff only manufactured in their home country,

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:20.490
but a thousand years ago, only the richest
of the rich could benefit from the Silk Road.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.039
Still, trade isn’t new. And while it’s
tempting to say that the types of goods being

00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:29.589
traded-– pharmaceuticals, computers, software,
financial services-- represent something wholly

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:33.890
new, you could just as easily see this as
part of the evolution of trade itself. At

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.810
some point silk was seen as a new trade good.
As tastes change and consumers become more

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.910
affluent, the things that they want to buy
change.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:45.270
So is anything really different, or is it
all just accelerated? Well, some historians

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:49.710
argue that an economically interdependent
world is much less likely to go to war. And

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.330
that may be true, but increasing global, cultural,
and economic integration hasn’t led to an

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.450
end to violence. I mean, we've seen large
scale ethnic and nationalistic violence from

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:04.390
Rwanda to the former Yugoslavia to the Democratic
Republic of Congo to Afghanistan. Globalization

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.540
has not rid the world of violence.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.930
But there is an ideological shift in the age
of globalization that does seem pretty new,

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:15.000
and that’s the turn to democracy. Now this
isn’t the limited democracy of the ancient

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.750
Greeks, or the quirky republican system originally
developed in the U.S.; there are almost as

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:24.280
many kinds of democracies as there are nations
experiencing democracy.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:29.060
The fact is, however, that democracy and political
freedom, especially the freedom to participate

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:34.380
in and influence the government, have been
on the rise all over the world since the 1980s

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.210
and especially since 1990. For instance, if
you looked at the governments of most Latin

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.280
American countries during most of the 20th
centuries, you would usually find them ruled

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:48.270
by military strongmen. Now, with a couple
of exceptions (Fidel, Hugo)… Stan, are they

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.830
behind me right now? Because if they’re
behind me, I am in favor of collectivizing

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:56.060
oil revenue and distributing it to the poor.
If they’re not behind me, that’s a terrible

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.620
idea. Right, but anyway, democracy is now
flourishing in most of Latin America.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.500
Probably the most famous democratic success
story is South Africa, which jettisoned decades

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.230
of Apartheid in the 1990s and elected former
dissident Nelson Mandela as its first black

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.880
president in 1994. It also adopted one of
the most progressive constitutions in the

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.850
world. But it’s worth remembering that democracy
and economic success don’t always go hand

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:22.660
in hand, as much as some Americans wish they
would. Many new African democracies continue

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.760
to struggle, the same is true in some Latin
American countries, and China has shown that

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.370
you don’t need democracy in order to experience
economic growth. But for a few countries,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:37.610
especially Brazil and India, the combination
of democracy and economic liberalism has unleashed

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.640
impressive growth that has lifted millions
out of poverty.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.620
So can we say that it's good, then? Can we
celebrate globalization, in spite of its destabilizing

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.490
effects on families and the environment? Well,
here's where we have to imagine the future,

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.590
because if some superbug shows up tomorrow
and it travels through all these global trade

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:58.110
routes and kills every living human, then
globalization will have been very bad for

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.400
human history: specifically, by ending it.
If climate change continues to accelerate

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.590
and displaces billions of people and causes
widespread famines and flooding, then we will

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.780
remember this period of human history as short-sighted,
self-indulgent, and tremendously destructive.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.040
On the other hand, if we discover an asteroid
hurdling toward earth and mobilize global

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.590
industry and technology in such a way that
we lose Bruce Willis but save the world, then

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:26.010
globalization will be celebrated for millennia.
I mean, assuming we have millennia and can

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.500
convince Bruce Willis to go.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.600
In short, to understand the present, we have
to imagine the future. That's the thing about

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.610
history, it depends on where you're standing.
From where I'm standing, globalization has

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.200
been a net positive, but then again, it's
been a pretty good run for heterosexual males

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.690
of European descent. Critics of globalization
point out that billions haven't benefited

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:50.330
much if at all from all this economic prosperity,
and that the polarization of wealth is growing

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:55.480
both within and across nations. And those
criticisms are valid and they are troubling,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.200
but they aren’t new. Disparities between
those who have more and those who have less

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.080
have existed pretty much from the moment agriculture
enabled us to accumulate a surplus. At some

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.600
times this inequality has been a big concern,
as it was with Jesus and Muhammad, at other

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.540
times not so much. Inequalities are as old
as human history, and almost as old is the

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.540
debate about them. One thing that is new,
however, is our ability to learn about them,

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:24.020
to discuss them, and hopefully to find solutions
for them together as a global community that

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:28.390
is better integrated and more connected than
it has ever been before.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:33.660
Because here's the other thing about history:
you are making it. That old idea that history

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:39.120
is the deeds of great men? That was wrong.
Celebrated individuals do shape history, but

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.280
so do the rest of us. And while it's true
that many historical forces-- malaria, meteors

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:50.470
from space-- aren't human, it's also true
that every human is a historical force. You

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.650
are changing the world every day. And it is
our hope that by looking at the history that

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:59.860
was made before us, we can see our own crucial
decisions in a broader context. And I believe

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.010
that context can help us make better choices,
and better changes.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.820
Thanks for watching. But, there’s no need
to despair, Crash Course fans, I’ll see

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.880
you next week for the beginning of our mini
series on literature.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.370
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.680
Danko. The associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.080
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself. And our
graphics team is Thought Bubble.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.400
Last week’s phrase of the week was "Cookie
Monster". This week’s phrase of the week

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.460
was "Bruce Willis," which I am telling you because
we are retiring the idea of the phrase of the week.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.140
Thank you so much for watching Crash Course:
World History. It has been super fun to try

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:38.180
to tell the history of the world in 42 twelve-minute
videos. I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you’ll

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:43.680
hang around for literature. Thanks for watching, and as
we say in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
