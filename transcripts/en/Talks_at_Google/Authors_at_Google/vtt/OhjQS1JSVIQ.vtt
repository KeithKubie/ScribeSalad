JESSIE: Hi, everyone.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.535
Welcome to an afternoon with
Vikas Swarup, here to talk

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.450
about his latest book, "The
Accidental Apprentice," and

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.590
about the journey of writing
since his famous debut novel.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.450
I also hope he will tell us a
bit more about why he has

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.840
mentioned Google in his

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.600
acknowledgements in both his books.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.740
Also as a way of interaction,
I'm just going to speak a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.320
little bit more about him.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.850
So Vikas Swarup is an Indian
novelist and diplomat who has

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.742
served in Turkey, the United
States, Ethiopia, the United

00:00:38.742 --> 00:00:42.095
Kingdom, South Africa, and
Japan, best known for his

00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:45.250
novels, "Q &amp; A" and "Six
Suspects." He was born in

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.660
Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh in
a family of lawyers and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.100
pursued his education
in Allahabad itself.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.050
Vikas then joined the Indian
Foreign Services in 1986.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.790
He's currently, since 2009,
posted in Japan as India's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.840
Consul-General to Osaka-Kobe.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.849
His debut novel, "Q &amp; A" has
been translated into 42

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.330
languages and was short-listed
for the best first book by the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.630
Commonwealth Writers Prize and
won South Africa's Exclusive

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.550
Books Boeke Prize in 2006 as
well as the Prix Grand Public

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.140
at the 2007 Paris Book Fair.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.460
It was voted winner of the
Best Travel Read --

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.370
Fiction-- at the Heathrow Travel
Product Award in 2009.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.450
The movie "Slumdog Millionaire,"
as you all know,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.930
went on to win eight Oscars
including Best Picture and

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.110
Best Director.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.370
It also won several other
awards around the globe,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.120
making it the movie of 2008.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.170
Vikas' second novel, "Six
Suspects," was released on

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.080
July 28, 2008 and is being
translated into 30 languages.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.430
So, apart from writing books,
Vikas has also written for

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.770
Time Magazine, Newsweek, The
Guardian, The Telegraph in the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.590
UK, Outlook Magazine in India
and Liberation in France.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.650
And in the year 2010, the
University of South Africa

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.120
conferred an honorary degree
of Doctor of Literature and

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.390
Philosophy--

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.240
Honoris Causa--

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
at a graduation ceremony
at Pretoria.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.740
So over to you.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.026
VIKAS SWARUP: Thank
you, Jessie.

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:16.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.390
VIKAS SWARUP: It's wonderful
to be at Google, one of the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.650
most innovative companies
in the world.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.690
Google is a huge part of my
life, but it is your life.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.100
So I think for all you Googlers,
I think you can be

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.020
very proud of the company
that you are working in.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.470
It's also great to see
young India at work.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.880
I'm told the average
age of the Googlers

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.480
here is about what?

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.670
I think, to me it looked
like 16, but I was

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.830
told it's like 21.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.300
And it's really wonderful to
see India is known as a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.500
software nation, and it's
great to see all of you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.480
contributing to that journey.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.050
Well, I'm here to talk about
my journey as a writer.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.520
And as Jessie has
just introduced

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.590
me, I wear two hats.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.070
I'm a diplomat and a writer.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.670
I've been a diplomat now for 26
years and a writer only for

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.300
the last what?

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.220
Nine, ten.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.830
So that's why I call myself
a diplomat who writes.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.200
And the very first question that
people ask me is, how did

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.860
you become a writer?

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.640
Many people ask me, did you
always want to be a writer?

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.830
The short answer is no.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.550
I never imagined I could
be a writer.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.510
I did read a lot in my school
and college days, even wrote

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.680
some short stories.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.580
But the last published short
story of mine was called "The

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.010
Autobiography of a Donkey,"
and it was published in my

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.750
school magazine way
back in 1980.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.070
I joined the Indian Foreign
Service in 1986, and for 15

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.940
years, the thought of writing
fiction did not cross my mind.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.750
It was only when I was posted
in London between 2000 and

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.190
2003 that I first thought
of writing something.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.630
And there were two
inspirations.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.430
One, of course, was the city of
London itself, such a hub

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.560
for the world of
English-language publishing.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.020
And the second was the fact that
some of my contemporaries

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.330
in the Foreign Service were
trying their hand at fiction.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.710
In fact, now there are so many
Indian Foreign Service

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.220
officers who have started
writing fiction that people

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.600
have even started
talking about an

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.660
IFS school of writing.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.559
VIKAS SWARUP: Anyway, I started
this novel called "Q &amp;

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:25.160
A" in the summer of 2003.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.060
And, believe it or
not, I finished

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.280
it in just two months.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.640
And there were two reasons why
I was able to do that.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.740
The first, of course,
was Google.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.330
If I had to research all the
subjects, which I did research

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.800
for "Q &amp; A" and go to the
British Library, it would have

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.340
taken me at least a year plus.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.020
I had to research
so many things--

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.990
Bedia tribal girls sold into
prostitution, the Taj Mahal.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.100
I had to research betting
on cricket matches.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.530
I had to even research
Australian English.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.700
And all that research was
made so much easier

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.610
and faster by Google.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.150
At the click of a button,
I was there.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.420
The second reason I was able to
write it in two months was

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.030
because my wife Aparna and
my two sons had already

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.050
gone back to India.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.280
I had two months left.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.613
They had already gone
back to India.

00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:13.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.590
VIKAS SWARUP: So sometimes
behind a successful man, there

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.330
is an absent woman.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.470
It was only when I went to the
Oscar ceremony in Hollywood

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.700
that I discovered in Hollywood
they do things differently.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.660
There the saying goes, behind
every successful man there is

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.210
a woman, and behind the
woman is the wife.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.710
VIKAS SWARUP: Anyway, I wrote
this book in two months, and

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.020
within three months
of my finishing

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.260
it, it found a publisher.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.970
And publishing, to my mind,
remains central

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.810
to the art of writing.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.880
You may be the best writer in
the word, but unless your

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.710
books get published, you will
keep getting rejection slips

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.500
like the one Samuel Johnson is
believed to have given an

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.340
aspiring writer when he told
him, your book is both good

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.380
and original.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.090
Unfortunately, the parts which
are good are not original, and

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.380
the parts which are original
are not good.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.980
So can you imagine what happens
to such a writer?

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.420
There's the story about a very
devout Christian writer who

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.450
wrote ten novels, none of
which got published.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.820
He got so dejected, he actually
hanged himself.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.200
So naturally when his soul went
up to the pearly gates,

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.550
he was met by Saint Peter.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.690
And Saint Peter asked him,
where do you want to go?

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.850
Because he had not read any of
his novels, so he could not

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.070
decide whether to send him
to heaven or to hell.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.430
And the writer's a
clever fellow.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.470
He says, Google Ads sometimes
make out the reality to be

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.140
much better than
it actually is.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.920
So he says, I would like a
tour of both facilities.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.170
So first, Saint Peter
takes him to hell.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.560
As they descend into the fiery
pits, the writer sees row upon

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.550
row of writers chained to their
desks in a steaming

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.790
sweatshop, writing longhand
in thick registers.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.530
As they worked, they were
repeatedly whipped with thorny

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.850
lashes by demons.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.180
Oh my, said the writer.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.350
This doesn't look very good.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.990
Let's go to heaven.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.930
A few moments later as they
ascend into heaven, the writer

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.050
sees row up row of writers
chained to their desks in a

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.650
steaming sweatshop, writing
longhand in thick registers.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.730
As they worked, they, too, were
repeatedly whipped with

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.520
thorny lashes by demons.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.610
Hey, said the writer.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.630
This is just as bad as hell.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.040
No, it is not, said
Saint Peter.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.885
Here your work gets published.

00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:29.700
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.260
VIKAS SWARUP: So "Q &amp; A" was
written in 2003, and it was

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.090
published in 2005.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.766
It's the story of this
18-year-old waiter called Ram

00:07:36.766 --> 00:07:40.040
Mohammed Thomas, who
participates in the biggest

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.470
game show on Earth.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.930
It's called W3B, Who
Will Win a Billion?

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.070
They're offering a billion
rupees as prize money.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.370
And he answers all their
questions, and then he's

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.040
subsequently arrested because
nobody can believe that a

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.740
waiter, an 18-year-old waiter
who has never gone to school,

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.740
can actually know all
of these answers.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.870
And then subsequently, Ram
Mohammed Thomas narrates the

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.290
sequences of his life to his
lawyer, and that's how she

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.710
comes to understand the genesis
of all the answers

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:10.890
that he knew.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.570
The original inspiration for
this novel actually came from

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.950
a project called Hole
in the Wall.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.130
I'm sure many of you would have
heard of this project.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.690
This was started by a
group of computer

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.990
scientists at NIIT in Delhi.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.120
And adjoining their campus
was the Kalkaji slum.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.130
So they literally carved a hole
in that common wall, and

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.440
they put a freely accessible
computer with a touchscreen

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.090
and internet facing the slum.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.710
And three months later, they
discovered that children

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.260
living in that slum had started
using that computer

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.720
facility entirely on their
own without any teachers.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.850
These are slum kids, children
who have not gone to school,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.440
who don't know a word
of English.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.210
I don't know if Google was there
or not, but they were

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.520
certainly accessing this mobile
internet facility.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.670
So that revealed to me that
perhaps there is some innate

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.710
ability in all of us that given
the right opportunity

00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.640
can surface.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.390
And I thought to myself, I said
if a slum kid can start

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.820
accessing the computer, then a
slum kid can also participate

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.150
in a brain quiz and win.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.350
And that is how really
"Q &amp; A" was born.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:19.190
Once "Q &amp; A" was finished and
it got published, one year

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.530
before the book was published,
I received

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.340
the offer from Film4.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.670
They want to make a movie
based on the book.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.110
And I was astounded because,
as I told you, the book had

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.920
not even been published.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.960
It's one year before
publication.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.640
BBC asked me this question
in an interview--

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.720
Mr. Swarup, when you were
writing this novel, could you

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.220
visualize it as a film?

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.000
And my answer was, I couldn't
even visualize it as a book.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.040
First time writer, what are the

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.730
chances of getting published?

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.790
So it was a great surprise to
be approached by Film4 that

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.480
they wanted to make a film
based on the book.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.340
But as you all know, the
film did come out.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.300
It's what's called "Slumdog
Millionaire," and it literally

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.970
took the world by storm,
winning so many awards,

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:03.355
including four Golden Globes,
seven BAFTAs, and a staggering

00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:04.420
eight Oscars.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.730
And ever since then,
people have been

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.100
asking me this question.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.330
Mr. Swarup, how do you feel
about the adaptation?

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.230
And it's a ticklish question
for me to answer.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.320
I mean, "Q &amp; A" is my book, but
"Slumdog Millionaire" is

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.090
not my film.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.010
It is Danny Boyle's film.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.540
And even as I was thinking how
to approach this question, I

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.080
came across a brilliant
parallel in India.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.540
Bengali writer Mani Shankar
Mukherjee's book was adapted

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.010
into a film by Satyajit Ray.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.340
And Shankar was asked exactly
the same question.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.720
Your book is now a film.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.120
What do you think about it?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.030
And he though about it, and then
he said, you know, giving

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.900
permission for your book to be
made into a film is a bit like

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.510
giving your daughter
away in marriage.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.090
The first thing that happens
is your daughter acquires a

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.050
new surname.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.260
So "Q &amp; A" gets re-marketed as
"Slumdog Millionaire." The

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.250
second thing that happens is
that you are saddled with a

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.140
son-in-law, namely the film.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.660
And then he said, remember, in
India you never, ever speak

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.045
ill of your son-in-law
in public.

00:10:58.045 --> 00:11:03.740
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.550
VIKAS SWARUP: So you will not
hear me complain how the film

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.980
is different from my book.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.330
You will not hear me carp how
a slum kid in the film can

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.980
start accessing Google
and speak in English.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.630
The fact of the matter
is, "Slumdog

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.480
Millionaire" works as a film.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.580
And I think it's to Danny
Boyle's great credit that he

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.560
was able to put together the
package so brilliantly--

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.385
wonderful acting by the child
actors, soulful music by A.R.

00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:31.290
Rahman, and absolutely
mesmerizing cinematography by

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.590
Anthony Dod Mantle.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.090
Otherwise, how many 10
Oscar-nominated films can you

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.850
remember in which not a single
actor or actress was nominated

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.010
for an acting award?

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.560
So that's what's "Slumdog
Millionaire" was.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.490
It was the right film
for the right time.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.610
Once your first book becomes
such a huge success, there is

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.830
always pressure on the
second book, the

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.170
dreaded second book syndrome.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.660
And I thought to myself, I said,
what should be my second

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.440
book all about?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.890
My publishers dropped
some hints.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.300
Perhaps you might like to
continue with the same

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.090
characters that you created in
"Q &amp; A." Maybe we could call

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.280
it "Another Q &amp; A" and trace the
life story of Ram Mohammed

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.380
Thomas from the age of
18 to the age of 25.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.450
I thought about it, but then I
said, you know, if that is the

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.870
only story I have to tell,
then that's not

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.050
what I want to be.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.300
Because the primary question I
asked myself is what did you

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.850
do in "Q &amp; A?" And I said
I told a story.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.700
So I asked myself, do you have
other stories to tell, or is

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.440
that the only story
you can tell?

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.390
And as it happened, at that
particular point in time, I

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.730
was sort of grappling with
six different stories.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.600
So I created a novel called
"Six Suspects."

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.900
Now, that is also inspired by
everyday life in India.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.200
In that novel, I had a playboy
called Vivek Rai.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.870
His nickname is Vicky Rai.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.340
Vicky Rai is a 32-year-old
playboy.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.800
He's the son of a
Home Minister.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.220
When he was 17 years old, his
father gifted him a BMW.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.170
He took it out for a spin and
while coming back at night,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.630
mowed down six homeless
people who were

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.860
sleeping on the pavement.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.110
Rings a bell?

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.190
The case comes to trial.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.440
None of the witnesses remember
seeing a BMW, and naturally

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.760
he's acquitted.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.800
When he is 20 years old, he goes
to a wildlife sanctuary

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.310
in Rajhasthan and shoots
the two black bucks.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.520
Rings another bell?

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.410
Again, case comes to trial.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.220
But within six months, the only
eyewitness who had seen

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.130
him shoot the black bucks,
the forest ranger, dies

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.350
mysteriously.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.160
Again, case closed,
he's acquitted.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.040
When he's 25 years old, he
decides to hold his birthday

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.730
party at a very trendy pub on
the Delhi Airport highway

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.820
called Mango.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.860
At 2:00 AM, he staggers to the
bar and asks for a drink from

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.525
the bartender.

00:13:54.525 --> 00:13:56.560
The bartender is a young woman
who's a post-doctoral student

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.220
at Delhi University.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.040
She says, I'm sorry, sir.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.900
The bar is now closed.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.240
I can't give you a drink.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.710
He gets so enraged, he takes out
his revolver and pumps two

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.410
bullets into her.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.020
She dies on the spot.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.520
Again, Vicky Rai's arrested
The case drags

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.730
on for seven years.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.020
During those seven years,
many things happen.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.330
Six eyewitnesses who had seen
him pull the trigger withdraw

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.210
their testimony and say, sorry,
we did this under

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.540
police pressure.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.210
The murder weapon disappears
from the police lock-up.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.965
The police ballistics report
says that the two bullets were

00:14:23.965 --> 00:14:25.680
fired from two different guns.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.220
So, naturally, Vicky Rai is
acquitted once again.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.280
To celebrate this acquittal,
he holds a massive party at

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.465
his farmhouse in Mehrauli.

00:14:33.465 --> 00:14:35.710
You know, 300, 400
guests are there.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.630
Imported liquor is flowing.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.750
A live band is belting
out the latest hits.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.480
People are enjoying
themselves.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.560
At midnight, suddenly the
lights go off and

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.630
a shot rings out.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.840
Within 10 seconds, the lights
come back on again.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.340
And then everybody discovers
that somebody has

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.420
shot dead Vicky Rai.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.390
Since he's the son of the Home
Minister, the police are

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.500
already on traffic control duty
outside the farmhouse.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.100
They immediately seal
the premises.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.920
They don't allow anyone
to leave, and they

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.650
search all the guests.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.380
And in that search, six people
are discovered with guns.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.590
So remember, if you go to a
party with a gun and the host

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.990
gets shot, you become
a suspect.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.280
So the rest of the novel-- what
I told you happens in the

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.120
first 15 pages of the novel.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.340
The rest of the novel is really
the back stories of

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.430
these six suspects.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.700
Who are these people?

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.830
What were they doing in the
farmhouse that night?

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.470
Why did they have a gun?

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.930
Which one of them
is the murderer?

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.280
So that is the story
of "Six Suspects."

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.250
And just five days ago, I have
released my new book.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.130
It's called "The Accidental
Apprentice." Now, this is a

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.130
book that I think many of you
would be able to relate to

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.190
because, partly, it's about
the world of business.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:53.310
It's about a very simple,
ordinary salesgirl called

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.540
Sapna Sinha.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.380
She's 23 years old, so I'm sure
there's a few in this

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.690
room would be able to relate
to her very easily.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.210
Now, Sapna could be any young
woman in Delhi who travels

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.980
every day by metro, struggles to
make ends meet, and dreams

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.490
of a better life.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.750
As she herself acknowledges,
she's stuck in a dead-end job

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.150
with her future on
permanent hold.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:19.260
There was a time, not so long
ago, when the ship of my life

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.000
had direction and momentum.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.440
Now it seems like an aimless,
rudderless drift, where one

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.060
week leads to another, each day
is the same, and nothing

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.550
ever changes.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.610
Well, everything changes in an
instant for Sapna when one

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:38.010
afternoon she's accosted by
an elderly and eccentric

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.410
billionaire called Vinay Mohan
Acharya, who offers her the

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.070
post of CEO, Chief Executive
Officer, of

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.350
his $10 billion company.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.760
Well, naturally Sapna refuses
to believe this.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.840
I mean, after all, she doesn't
know this man.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.620
She's never been to a management
institute.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.700
How could someone just be
cut out to be a CEO?

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.450
And I'll just read out a little
portion from the novel

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.369
just to give you a little flavor
of how things unfold.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.109
So now Sapna and Vinay Mohan
Acharya, they have crossed

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:18.500
over from the temple, and they
are sitting in a coffeehouse,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.060
and Vinay Mohan Acharya asks
her, "'If you don't mind

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.359
telling me, how much do
you earn in a month?'

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.040
'With my sales commission,
about 18,000 rupees.'

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.290
'That's all?

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.200
Then shouldn't you be jumping
at the chance to lead a

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.980
multimillion dollar company
and acquire a fortune?'

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:35.960
'Look, Mr. Acharya.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.140
I'm still quite confused
about your offer.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.600
I mean, first of
all, why do you

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.330
need a CEO?' 'Why?

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.160
Because I'm 68 years old and
not getting any younger.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.790
God made the human body like
a machine with built-in

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.220
obsolescence.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.600
I'm about to reach
my expiry date.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.420
But before I go, I want to
ensure an orderly succession

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.740
at the organization I have
nurtured for 40 years.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.180
I want to ensure that I'm
followed by someone who

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.110
believes in the same
values that I do.'

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.240
'But why me?

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.190
Why not your own son
or daughter?'

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.460
'Well, for one, I don't
have a family anymore.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.500
My wife and daughter died
in a plane crash

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.860
18 years ago.' 'Oh.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.160
Then what about someone
from your company?'

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.320
'I have searched far and wide
within the company.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.910
I couldn't find anyone
remotely suitable.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.950
My executives are good
implementers, excellent

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.110
subordinates, but I don't see
the traits of a great leader

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.970
in any of them.'

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.620
'And what do you see in me?

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.620
I don't know a thing about
running a business.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.740
I'm not even an MBA.'

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.150
'These degrees are simply
a piece of paper.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.640
They don't teach you how to
lead people, only how to

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.310
manage stuff.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.670
That's why I didn't go to a
management to pick my CEO.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.260
I came to a temple.'

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.890
'You still have not answered
my question.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.830
Why me?'

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.530
'There was something in your
eyes, a sparkle that I'd never

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.560
seen anywhere before.'

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.560
He searches my eyes for
confirmation before glancing

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.570
away."

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.660
'I have always been an observer
of people,' he

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:03.100
continues, looking around the
hall at the middle-class

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.880
shoppers and office workers
sitting on the other tables,

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.450
'and of all the people I
observed in the temple, you

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.620
seemed the most focused.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.960
Call it intuition, psychic
sense, whatever you want, but

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.160
something told me that
you could be the one.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.740
You alone had the compelling
mix of determination and

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.910
desperation that I
was looking for.'

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.520
'I thought desperation was
a negative virtue.'

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.910
He shakes his head.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.142
'Happy people don't
make good CEOs.

00:19:29.142 --> 00:19:31.360
Contentment breeds laziness.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.640
It is aspiration that
drives achievement.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.540
I want people with hunger,
hunger that is born in the

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.390
desert of dissatisfaction.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.110
You seem to have that
want, that hunger.'

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.260
I'm getting caught up in his
sweeping statements and grand

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.200
assumptions.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.026
But the logic behind his
rhetoric still eludes me.

00:19:47.026 --> 00:19:50.540
'Do you always make decisions
based on whims?'

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.110
'Never underestimate the
power of intuition.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.040
11 years ago I bought a troubled
factory in Romania

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.700
called Iancu Steel.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.460
It was losing money every day.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.880
All my experts advised me
against the purchase.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.180
They said I was throwing
good money after bad.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.410
But I remained firm
in my decision.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.280
I was attracted to the factory
only because of it's name.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.860
Iancu means "God is gracious."
Today, 53% of our steel

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.320
revenues come from that
factory in Romania.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.130
God is indeed gracious.'

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.940
'So you do believe in God?'

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.510
'Isn't this proof enough?' He
points at the vermilion mark

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:23.620
on his forehead.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.410
'The main reason I came to a
temple to select my successor

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.710
is because I wanted
a devout like me.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.685
We are living in Kalyug, the
Dark Age, full of sin and

00:20:31.685 --> 00:20:32.770
corruption.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.680
Religion is no longer
in fashion.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.470
The youngsters working for me
are consumed by consumption.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.040
They have probably not visited
a temple to pray in years.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.410
I'm not saying they're all
atheists, but their god is

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.250
money, first and foremost.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.850
But you,' he nods at me
approvingly, 'you seem to be

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:51.240
just the pious God-fearing
candidate I was looking for.'

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.490
'OK, I get it.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:54.655
You act on whims, and your
latest whim tells you that I

00:20:54.655 --> 00:20:55.870
am the chosen one.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.490
Now tell me, what's
the catch?'

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:59.850
'There is no catch.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.050
But there are some terms
and conditions.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.440
You will have to pass
a few tests.'

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.490
'Tests?'

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.450
'Don't worry.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.510
I'm not taking you
back to school.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:10.800
A school simply tests
your memory, but

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.990
life tests your character.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.240
My seven tests are rights of
passage designed to gauge your

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.990
mettle and potential
as a CEO.'

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.920
'why seven?'

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.540
'In my 40 years of running
a business, I

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.970
have learned one thing--

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.870
a company is only as good as
the person who runs it.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.730
And I have whittled down the
traits of a successful CEO to

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.480
seven basic attributes.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.980
So each of the seven tests will
focus on one of those

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.730
seven traits.'

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.780
'And what exactly will I have
to do to pass those tests?'

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.860
'Nothing that you wouldn't
do in your daily life.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.020
I will not ask you
to steal, or kill

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.250
or do anything illegal.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.240
In fact, you won't even be
aware of the tests.'

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.530
'what do you mean?'

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.810
'My tests will come from
the textbook of life.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.300
Doesn't life test
us every day?

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.750
Don't we make choices
every day?

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.750
I was simply evaluate your
choices, your responses to

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.410
life's daily challenges.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.340
That will reveal the stuff
you are made of.'

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.320
'And what if I fail any
of those tests?'

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.840
'Well, then I will have to
look for someone else.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.640
But my gut instinct tells
me you won't fail.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.240
It almost seems destined.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.900
The biggest lottery ticket of
all time will be yours.'

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.860
'In that case, my decision
is quite clear.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.730
I'm not interested
in your offer.'

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:21.740
He seems astounded.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.070
'But why?'

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.130
'I don't believe in
lottery tickets.'

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.640
'But you believe in God.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.870
And sometimes God gives you much
more than you ask for.'

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.450
'I'm not that greedy,' I say,
rising from the table.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.445
'Thank you, Mr. Acharya.

00:22:34.445 --> 00:22:36.800
It was nice meeting you, but I
really must get back to the

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.930
showroom now.'

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.970
'Sit,' he orders me.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.890
There is steel in his voice.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.110
I swallow hard and sit down
like an obedient student.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:48.300
'Listen, Sapna,' his
voice softens.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.400
'There are only two types
of people in the word--

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.380
winners and losers.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.360
I'm giving you the chance
to be a winner.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.150
All I ask in return is for you
to sign this consent form.'

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:59.300
He gestures to Rana--

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.820
that's his aide-- who produces
a printed sheet of paper from

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.010
the inside pockets of his track
suit and lays it in

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.630
front of me.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:06.500
Since Alka's death--

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.420
now, Alka was Sapna's younger
sister who committed suicide.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.640
Since Alka's death, I have
developed a sixth sense about

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.620
some things.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.040
A little warning bell that goes
off in my head whenever a

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.110
situation is not quite right.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.240
That bell is ringing as
I pick up the form.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.240
It is short, just
five sentences.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.310
One, the signer hereby agrees to
be considered for the post

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.930
of CEO of the ABC group
of companies.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.000
Two, the signer hereby permits
the ABC group to perform

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.140
necessary checks and procedures
to assess the

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.200
signer's suitability
for the job.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.110
Three, the signer is not
permitted to terminate the

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.830
agreement midway while the
necessary checks and

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.760
procedures are still
being conducted.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.190
Four, the signer agrees
to maintain complete

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.890
confidentiality of this
agreement by not discussing it

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.310
with any third party.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.750
Five, in consideration of the
above, the signer has received

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.080
a nonrefundable advance
of rupees one lakhs.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.740
'This only talks of one lakh
rupees,' I observe.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.860
'Didn't I hear you mention the
figure of $10 billion?'

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.010
'The one lakh is simply to
participate in the tests.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.280
If you fail, you get
to keep the money.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.680
And if your pass,
you get the job.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.910
I assure you, the CEO salary
will have many more zeroes.'

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.730
By now, the warning bell is
clanging like a fire alarm.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.360
I know that this is a swindle
and that Acharya has tried

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.740
this ploy before.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.975
'Tell me, how many people have
you got to sign this form so

00:24:20.975 --> 00:24:21.960
far?'

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.760
'You are candidate number
seven,' Acharya exhales.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.070
'But I know in my heart that
you will be the last one.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.580
My quest is over.'

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.080
'So is my time,' I stand
up decisively.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.710
'I have no intention of
signing this form or

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.630
participating in any tests.'

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.050
Rana responds by laying
a stack of 1,000-rupee

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.320
notes on the table.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.080
They look crisp and new,
straight from a bank.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.160
He's baiting me, but
I'm not tempted.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.200
'You think you can buy
me with your money?'

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.670
'Well, this is a negotiation
after all,' Acharya insists.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:53.010
'Remember, in business,
as in life, you never

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:54.490
get what you deserve.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.110
You only get what
you negotiate.'

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.230
'I don't negotiate with people
that I hardly know.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.440
What if this is some
kind of trap?'

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.110
'The only trap is that
of low expectations.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.010
Look, I understand your
reservations,' Acharya says

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.360
soothingly, leaning forward
on his elbows.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.990
'But you need to take
a less bleak view of

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.360
human nature, Sapna.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.900
I sincerely and genuinely
want to make you my CEO.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.740
'Do you have any idea
how ridiculous this

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.050
conversation sounds?

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.520
Such things happen only in
movies and books, not in real

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.240
life.'

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.840
'Well, I'm real.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.690
And you are real.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.990
And my offer is real.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.850
A man like me does not waste
time in tomfoolery.'

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.710
'I'm sure you can find other
candidates who would be more

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.370
than willing to accept
your offer.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.870
I'm not interested.'

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.000
'You are making a big mistake,'
Acharya wags a

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.010
finger at me.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.215
'Perhaps the greatest mistake
of your life.

00:25:39.215 --> 00:25:40.900
But I will not pressure you.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.600
Take my card and if you change
your mind within the next 48

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.380
hours, call me.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.170
The offer will still
be valid.'

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.620
He pushes a business card
across the table, Rana

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.100
watching me like a hawk.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.880
I take it, smile tightly at
them, and then without as much

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.030
as a backward glance,
head for the door.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.210
My mind is spinning faster
than a CD as I

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.900
hurry towards B block.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.030
The overwhelming feeling I
have is one of relief, as

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.890
though I had escaped from
some grave danger by

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.470
the skin of my teeth.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.970
I look over my shoulder
periodically to make sure the

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.720
duo are not following me.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.510
The more I reflect on what has
just transpired, the more

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:19.300
convinced I am that Acharya is
either a devious shark or a

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.000
raving lunatic, and I want no
truck with either category.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.350
I breathe easy only once I
return to the safety of the

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.670
showroom, to my air-conditioned
world of

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.330
plasma TVs, frost-free
refrigerators, and fuzzy logic

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.640
washing machines."

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.740
So this except that I read out
is from the opening of the

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.150
novel how Acharya meets Sapna
Sinha and makes her the offer.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.950
She refuses him at first,
as you just heard.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.280
But circumstances force her to
accept the offer because she's

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.530
in need of at least a couple
of lakh rupees.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:51.950
And the rest of the novel is
really about how these seven

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.750
tests unfold.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.810
It is a journey that takes Sapna
from her swanky showroom

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.920
in Connaught Place to a village
in Hariana, a singing

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.470
competition in Mumbai.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.160
Along the way, she meets a vain
Bollywood superstar, a

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.840
crooked kidney specialist, a
dangerous Mafia don, and even

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.200
a kleptomaniac Gandhian.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.650
So on the surface, this novel
may seem like it's about

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.580
finding what it takes to be a
successful CEO, but at core,

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.460
it's really about finding
yourself, knowing what you

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.460
want in life, who you want to
be, what is your ultimate

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.550
dream, and how to fulfil
those dreams.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.100
That's what this novel
is all about.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.820
And I do hope that young India
would be able to connect with

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.540
this novel, because, you know,
my novels are really a

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.720
snapshot of India at that
particular point in time.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.570
I am inspired always by what's
happening around me, the

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.010
everyday stories I read about
in the newspapers.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.790
And right now we find that
women's issues are taking

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:47.760
center stage.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.060
So when I started writing
this novel, of course,

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.020
that was not the case.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:55.390
But it's just fortuitous that
now that my book has come out,

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.870
and it has a very strong-willed
heroine called

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:03.180
Sapna Sinha at a time when all
of us are grappling with

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.510
women's issues.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:10.340
So this was a little peek into
my so-called writer's life.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.270
I have created these
three books only in

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.190
the last nine years.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.540
These are the only three
books I've written.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.020
But I do not really see myself
as a full-time writer.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.380
I do not see myself as a
professional writer.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.440
For me, writing is
really an outlet

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.910
for my creative passion.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.880
And I call myself a weekend
writer, because Monday to

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.490
Friday, I'm so busy and caught
up in my day job

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.360
that I cannot write.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.740
I cannot have time to write.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.160
And secondly, when I want to
write, I need what I call a

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.920
clear horizon.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.090
That is at least six to seven
hours of uninterrupted work

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:42.930
where nobody disturbs me.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:44.850
My cell phone does not ring.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.680
I can concentrate and then write
from that perspective.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.960
And that really only happens
on a weekend.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.350
But I can't complain because the
important thing for me is

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.510
that I am able to write
what I want to write.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:59.930
The security of my day job
actually frees me up to write

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:00.680
in my spare time.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.530
I'm not dependent on writing
for my bread and butter.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.030
So I can create what I would
like to create, not what the

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.570
market wants me to create.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:12.485
And I think there is something
to be said for this kind of a

00:29:12.485 --> 00:29:14.730
life as well.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:19.720
Finally, I think what I would
like to say is that many

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.830
people tend to believe that
creativity ability is

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:27.990
something that is unique to a
few people, that God allots

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.850
that capability only to a select
group of people who can

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:34.480
become writers, or artists, or
musicians, or actors, and that

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.690
the rest of the world,
they just don't have

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:38.100
that creative spark.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.870
And that is something
I strongly contest.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.120
I think all of you sitting in
this room are emblematic of

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.470
the fact that everybody has
that spark, especially now

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.210
that we are living in a 21st
century world, which is

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.090
hyper-connected, where all of
us have the tools at our

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:59.120
disposal where we can all become
creators as we were

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.130
once simply consumers
or downloaders.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:06.580
Now, a poor man with an
internet-enabled cell phone

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.930
has as much knowledge at his
disposal as 15 years ago a

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:12.140
rich man with 10,000 books
in his library.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.740
And the kind of project that
Google is engaged in--

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.850
digitizing all the works of
mankind which will be

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.880
available to all the people
all the time--

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.330
really, I think, is the way
forward, enabling the creative

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.040
genius in all of us
to get unleashed.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:30.160
All I believe is that you need
three things to really unleash

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.960
that creative genius
inside you--

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.540
curiosity, confidence,
and a computer.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.240
Curiosity is very important
because only when you are

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.610
curious about the world will
you like to explore it.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:45.340
You know, every novel, every
fiction starts with that

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.958
simple question--

00:30:46.958 --> 00:30:48.750
what if?

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.730
What if a slum kid participated
in a brain quiz?

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.750
What if there was a planet
called Pandora and there were

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.570
people called Na'vi
living there?

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:01.130
So every work of fiction starts
with that question

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.310
"what if," and that "what if"
will start only if you're

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.520
curious about that
world and want to

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.710
imagine a different future.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.560
Confidence is also very
important because writing is

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.150
about taking risks.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.680
You have an idea in your head.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.260
You don't know if that
idea will appeal to

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.520
other people as well.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.120
Everyone has their grandmother's
story inside

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:21.890
their heads.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.800
Sometimes that should remain
inside their head.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.780
I'm not saying that, but--

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.270
VIKAS SWARUP: --if you believe,
if you are confident

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.830
that that story has some
universal elements which will

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.410
appeal to people outside your
immediate family, then by all

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:35.940
means, go ahead and
test it out.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.170
Testing is very important.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.000
And finally, you need the
computer for the research.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.800
I thanked Google in my first
book because it made research

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.750
so much faster.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:46.720
And in my second book "Six
Suspects," I actually had a

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.000
character called Larry Page.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.450
Now, Larry Page, in "Six
Suspects" is a forklift

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:55.740
operator at the Walmart
store in Waco.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.585
But he comes to India, and
he's mistaken to be Larry

00:31:58.585 --> 00:32:00.510
Page, the founder of Google.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.380
And he goes through some really
hilarious adventures.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.950
So I think on that note, since
I started with Google, let me

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:10.320
end with Google and say that
it's been a huge pleasure to

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.700
interact with you all, to have
this opportunity of speaking

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.710
to a bunch of the smartest
minds in India.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.630
And I do hope that you will
engage with the world of

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.570
reading and with books because
we all know that book reading

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:22.880
is becoming a declining habit.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.450
These days books have
to compete with

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:26.720
so many other things--

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.170
with VH1, "X Factor
2," PS3, and

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:33.520
"Spiderman 4." [LAUGHTER]

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.730
VIKAS SWARUP: So thank
you very much and

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.173
now I'm open to questions.

00:32:37.173 --> 00:32:45.831
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:48.236
AUDIENCE: I guess while
everyone gathers their

00:32:48.236 --> 00:32:50.200
thoughts, maybe I can start?

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.094
VIKAS SWARUP: Yes.

00:32:51.094 --> 00:32:52.435
AUDIENCE: For those of you
who don't know me, I'm

00:32:52.435 --> 00:32:53.329
[? Leeza. ?]

00:32:53.329 --> 00:32:57.040
And it's a very, very great day
for me to have you here

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.460
and to listen to you.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.344
I wish I could take notes.

00:33:00.344 --> 00:33:06.200
What I wanted to ask you is what
are your tricks or tips

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.380
to get a book published?

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.693
All of us here would love to
write, and I know several of

00:33:11.693 --> 00:33:12.455
our Googlers are
very passionate

00:33:12.455 --> 00:33:13.190
about blogging as well.

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:14.880
VIKAS SWARUP: Yes.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.410
AUDIENCE: But it's not always
to get a book published and

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:21.084
get an audience with the word.

00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:22.440
What did you do different?

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.960
VIKAS SWARUP: You know, Somerset
Maugham is believed

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.120
to have said there are three
rules for writing the novel.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.840
Unfortunately, no one
knows what they are.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:33.250
VIKAS SWARUP: So that's the
problem with writing, that you

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.596
just do not know whether it will
work or if it will not

00:33:35.596 --> 00:33:37.170
work because sometimes luck
plays a huge role.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.480
I mean, J.K. Rowling, we all
know, was rejected by 13

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.690
publishing houses, and today her
books have sold over 400

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:43.590
million copies.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.190
She's worth over a
billion dollars.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:46.850
So I think luck is
also important.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.570
But, of course, the effort
is very important.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.120
In my opinion, the most
important thing is that the

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.150
product that you have must
be objectively good.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.920
Many first-time writers believe
that they have written

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.860
the greatest thing possible,
deserving of the next Booker

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.180
Prize or the next Pulitzer
Prize, but very often, that's

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.530
not the case.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:07.630
And that's why testing becomes
very important.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:12.940
Only when you have tested out
the work that you have written

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:17.179
to the peer group, the friend
circle, your teachers, people

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:18.610
who can give you objective
advice.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.070
If you show it to your mother,
she, of course,

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.380
will say, oh, fantastic.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.600
It's the greatest
thing possible.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.210
Go ahead.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:27.420
But only when you show it to
people who are not inclined to

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.760
just boost your ego and who can
give you honest advice,

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.250
then only you will know the work
of what you have created.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.830
And if that feedback tells you
that what you have created is

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:38.600
worthy, then by all
means go ahead.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.159
Because see, the great advantage
of this 21st century

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:45.000
Google world is that we have
cut out the middle man.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.650
If a publisher does not
accept you, you can

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:47.790
go straight to Kindle.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:48.750
Nobody's stopping you.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:51.219
That's the great advantage that
you have now, that you

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:56.550
are no longer dependent on the
approval of a gatekeeper in

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.590
order to cross over to the
world of publishing.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.420
You can either self-publish
or, as I said, go online.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.080
I mean, look at Justin Bieber.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.410
He posted his videos on YouTube,
was discovered, and

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.620
today he's a multi-millionaire.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.720
So that's what I'm saying, that
now in the 21st century

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.530
world that we live in, this
hyper-connected world, we have

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.960
the tools available at our
disposal that allow our

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.280
creativity to flourish, and
there are no limits to what we

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.390
can create.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:27.360
AUDIENCE: So in your whole
journey of writing a book, how

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.470
much of it did you throw
away saying, no,

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.570
it isn't very good.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.028
And how much of it did you go
back to saying, actually, that

00:35:33.028 --> 00:35:34.700
actually fit in the book
and go back to that.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.100
VIKAS SWARUP: You wouldn't
believe it, but "Q &amp; A," what

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.650
has been published is
my first draft.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.520
And not a single paragraph
has been re-written.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.600
It's been edited, very
competently edited.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.500
But normally, first-time
writers, 60% to 70% you have

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.150
to re-write because
it doesn't work.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:53.140
But I just got very lucky that
my publisher, my agent, my

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.850
editor, everybody agreed with
my vision and didn't want

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.600
anything to be cut
out or changed.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.020
So it has been edited, but it
has not been re-written.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:04.650
At the same time, I have gone
down other roads in writing

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:07.880
for my other books where I did
30,000, 40,000 words and then

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.150
suddenly decided no, it's not
making sense to me anymore.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:14.350
Or I'm no longer as enthusiastic
about it as I was

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.510
when I first started
writing it.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.310
And then you give it up, and
you start something else.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:21.030
So that's the hardest thing
to do, deciding what

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.080
you want to do next.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.760
Because if you take a wrong
turn, then you can spend six,

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.530
seven, eight months of your life
and then realize you have

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.420
come up against a blind
alley, and you have

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.510
to come back again.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.990
But nothing is eventually
ever wasted completely.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.860
What you wrote, even that, I
take it that you at least you

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.050
learned something about the
craft of writing and

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:41.930
visualizing that or
in creating that.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:42.710
And who knows?

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:44.220
Later on, you might cannibalize
something from

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.890
that and use it somewhere
else.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:48.580
So nothing is completely
wasted.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:52.070
But at the same time, it's
important for you to have that

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.350
much of confidence in your work
that you have reached the

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:55.700
point of no return.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.540
I think every writer, when he
or she starts writing, there

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.750
comes a point when you know
you will finish this.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:05.090
But before that point, there
is always the process of

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:06.010
self-doubt.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:06.750
Will this work?

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:07.450
Is this good?

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:08.500
Is this not good?

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.210
Because writing is also an
incredibly lonely process.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:12.900
It's a very self-isolating
process.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.890
You lock yourself in your
room, and you create an

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:16.270
invented world in your head.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:17.930
And you are your only
touchstone.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.110
So that's why I'm saying if
you can have a peer group

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:25.220
which can evaluate and critique
your work, then it

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.090
makes writing that
much more easier.

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:32.190
AUDIENCE: Can we expect to see
a movie of "Six Suspects" or

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.330
"Accidental Apprentice"
actually?

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.900
VIKAS SWARUP: Yes. "Six
Suspects" has already been

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.910
optioned for a film by BBC and
Starfield Productions.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.210
The script has been written by
John Hodge, who wrote the

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:44.350
script for "Trainspotting,"
"Shallow Grave," "The Beach."

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.300
And they have just appointed
Pablo Trapero, an Argentinian

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.060
director to helm the project.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.840
So right now, I believe
Trapero is

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.990
working with the script.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:56.830
And if they get a shooting
script ready, then hopefully,

00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:00.680
either this year or early next
year, shooting should start.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.420
And "Accidental Apprentice" has
just been released, but a

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.190
director friend of
mine has just--

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:09.190
on my Gmail, I just discovered
a message from him, saying

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.440
that I'd be very much
interested.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:16.900
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.440
Just curious in terms
of how you would

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.080
monetize what you write.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.033
Once you're on your second book,
your third book, you've

00:38:23.033 --> 00:38:25.340
already built up a brand, so
you know, and you have an

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.730
agent, and it's easier
to negotiate.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.070
But the very first time you
actually write something, how

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:32.870
do you know once a publisher
says yes, this is a good work,

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:33.520
I'd like to publish it.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.510
How do you know if you're
getting what it's worth?

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.460
VIKAS SWARUP: That's a very,
very important question.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.350
How do you monetize, because
it's the same question that an

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.840
artist would have to--

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.010
a first-time artist,
he paints a canvas.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.880
Now what price does he charge?

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.480
So there, I think various
factors operate.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.790
I had an agent, and he was able
to send the manuscript to

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:54.520
eight or ten different
publishers.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.450
And then depending on the
feedback from the publishers,

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:01.330
I think there's an instinctive
feel to a book the moment it

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:02.500
lands at a publisher's place.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.670
They think of it either as a
small book, or a medium book,

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:06.750
or a big book.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:10.120
And the size of the advance is
commensurate with the placing

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.170
of their book.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:14.320
And if they feel that it's a big
book, then sometimes you

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.570
go into an auction situation
where two publishers are

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:19.040
competing with each other in
order to get the rights.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.660
But for me, to be very honest,
the important thing was not

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.910
the monetary factor, that how
much will I get for it.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:28.650
The important thing was how much
will the publisher invest

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:31.160
in terms of promoting the
book, in terms of

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:31.910
publicizing the book.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.600
Because these days, the
old saying, any

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.860
fool can write a book.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.220
It takes a genius to sell one.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.660
Yes.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.660
AUDIENCE: Hi, Vikas.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.328
I have two questions at once.

00:39:49.328 --> 00:39:51.064
I'm from the Mumbai office.

00:39:51.064 --> 00:39:54.920
What I wanted to know is when
you start writing a book, do

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.111
you always envision
the ending?

00:39:57.111 --> 00:39:59.070
Do you know where you
want to get to?

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.666
And in that way, do you sort of
walk your way towards the

00:40:01.666 --> 00:40:04.601
ending, or do you plan it out
very carefully and have road

00:40:04.601 --> 00:40:06.220
maps toward it?

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.670
VIKAS SWARUP: Well, I always
start with the ending.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:12.750
Now I have a perfected my
formula for writing the kind

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.970
of books I write, which I
call social thrillers.

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:16.940
It's the hook, line,
and sinker.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.320
So first is you have to have a
hook, a hook that can entice

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.330
the reader in.

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:24.080
So in the first book, the hook
was how does he answer those

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.900
questions, the 12 or 13
questions that he's asked.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.100
In the second book, it was the
six suspects, which one of

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.090
them is the murderer?

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.140
And in the current book,
it's the seven tests.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.540
Will Sapna pass those
seven tests?

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.200
Will she fail?

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.530
Are the seven tests for real?

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:36.370
Are they not for real?

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:37.490
So that's the first thing--

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:40.410
create a hook which can entice
the reader into the book.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.060
The second is the line.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.330
Have a dramatic narrative, a
narrative in which there are

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.930
lots of twists and turns, things
keep on happening to

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.190
keep the reader engaged.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.650
And sinker in the sense
that emotional

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:53.850
attachment to the character.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.010
If that character sinks,
your heart sinks,

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.200
that kind of a thing.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.910
So that is how I like
to frame my books.

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.900
But for me, the ending comes
first because I want to give a

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.470
surprise at the end
to the reader.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:07.630
And for that, you have to work
backwards from the ending and

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.420
then sort of put in the other
milestones in place.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.050
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:14.710
First of all, I wanted to
confess, being a big quizzer

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:18.880
myself, I really enjoyed "Q &amp;
A." And that actually inspired

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.180
me to keep on quizzing.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.605
So I just wanted to
give that to you.

00:41:22.605 --> 00:41:26.290
My question is you obviously
travel a lot.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.420
And I'm sure there are some
instances where you come

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.290
across some situations that you
say, this would probably

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.230
make an interesting situation
in my book.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:35.885
So has your travels
kind of inspired

00:41:35.885 --> 00:41:38.940
you to write something?

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.930
And are you planning on writing
some nonfiction also?

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:43.860
I mean, you've stuck
with fiction.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.520
Any plans of writing
nonfiction?

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.130
VIKAS SWARUP: I mean, no writer
writes in a vacuum.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.330
Even though I write about India,
but I write about India

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.950
living in South Africa
or Japan where

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.400
I'm currently residing.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.250
The fact that you are living
there means that you are

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.840
having some experiences there.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.270
You are meeting people, you're
having conversations.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:03.990
And subconsciously, some of
those experiences, some of

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:06.350
those conversations return to
your writing, even though it

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:08.440
may not be immediately
obvious.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.450
So certainly the fact that I'm
living in Japan and that I'm

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:13.360
interacting with people
there has had an

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.420
impact on my writing.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.430
But I still feel most connected
with India.

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:20.120
And even though I live thousands
of kilometers away

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.900
from India, because of 21st
century technology, I can

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.410
watch events happening in India
real time sitting in

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.690
Japan as you would
sitting here.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.590
So I do not feel that I'm
at a remove from India.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:34.680
In fact, sometimes distance
gives you a

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.280
better perspective also.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.240
So that is there.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:42.120
But having said that, I still
want to create works based on

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:47.420
my invented landscape and
invented characters.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:51.000
The diplomatic trivia of my
day job could be of great

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.310
interest, but I feel that what
I create in my books--

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:57.100
murder and mayhem and all kinds
of things happening--

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.700
would still be of greater
interest.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.920
So as of now, I would like
to stick to fiction.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.910
And what I love about fiction
is that there are no

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:04.900
boundaries.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.920
A fiction writer creates
a world in which

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.250
he frames the rules.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:10.980
The laws of physics
don't operate.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.400
The laws of the writer
operate.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.116
And that's the great thing
I like about future.

00:43:16.116 --> 00:43:17.520
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.009
VIKAS SWARUP: Yes.

00:43:18.009 --> 00:43:20.454
AUDIENCE: Have ever encountered
what they call as

00:43:20.454 --> 00:43:24.366
"writer's block" and then know
how to move forward and how

00:43:24.366 --> 00:43:26.330
would you face it?

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:28.430
VIKAS SWARUP: I don't have
writer's block, but I've had

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:29.490
writer's cramp.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:32.930
My right hand starts cramping
if I hold the

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.125
pen for very long.

00:43:34.125 --> 00:43:36.200
Surprisingly, the only time it
works brilliantly is when I'm

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:36.980
signing books.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:41.510
VIKAS SWARUP: But otherwise,
I've had banks returning my

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.800
checks saying this signature
does not match the one which

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.080
we have on record and
things like that.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.400
No, I've been a lucky writer in
the sense that I've never

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.480
had writer's block.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.600
Or at least I've never had
writers block for an extended

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.520
period of time.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.200
Certainly, sometimes you sit
in front of the computer

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.990
screen and you wonder how are
you going to fill that screen

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:58.950
with words, and nothing
is happening.

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:01.480
But those occasions
are very rare.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.880
Normally, my mind is bubbling
with too many ideas, and I

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.250
have to decide which
ones to choose and

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:06.410
which ones to ignore.

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:07.660
I think that is important.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:11.300
At the same time, writing
is a difficult process.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.160
Dorothy Parker was once asked,
do you love writing?

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.370
And she gave a classic reply.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:16.770
She said I hate writing.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:19.870
I love having written.

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:25.320
So when you write, actually,
it's tough work.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.180
But only afterwards when you
read what you have written and

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:32.568
then you enjoy that, then you
have a sense of satisfaction.

00:44:32.568 --> 00:44:34.924
AUDIENCE: My question is, are
there any authors you consider

00:44:34.924 --> 00:44:36.852
has your own model of
doing this process?

00:44:36.852 --> 00:44:39.021
And what are your most favorite
books that you've

00:44:39.021 --> 00:44:39.750
read lately?

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:41.610
VIKAS SWARUP: No, I have
read many authors.

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:45.010
I had the big advantage,
unlike all you here, of

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:47.660
growing up in an era where
there was no internet.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.280
There was no cable television.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.660
There was no television even,
forget cable television.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.560
So the only pastime I had
was reading books.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.770
And I read each and every book
that I could lay my hands

00:44:56.770 --> 00:45:00.115
upon, whether it was Franz
Kafka, Albert Camus, Alistair

00:45:00.115 --> 00:45:03.380
MacLean, Agatha Christie, Earl
Stanley Gardner, you name it.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.160
Any and every book that
I could lay my

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.440
hands upon, I read.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.060
And I think it was that reading
which I did so many--

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.710
if I wrote this book in two
months, it's because of the 25

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.340
years of reading I did
prior to writing.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.890
So all of those writers I think
shaped me as a writer in

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.990
the sense they allowed me to
discriminate between what is

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:22.880
good writing and what
is bad writing.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.200
But having said that, you
cannot really adopt the

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.800
writing style of any
other writer.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.210
You have to find
your own voice.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:30.390
You have to find
your own style.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:31.900
You have to find
your own idiom.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:35.920
And that's what I tried to do in
"Q &amp; A," find the voice of

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.090
Ram Mohammed Thomas.

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:38.570
And once I had those words--

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:41.150
"I have been arrested for
winning a quiz show"--

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:43.690
I knew I had the voice of
Ram Mohammed Thomas.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:47.420
Among the current crop of
writers, I greatly admire J.M.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.040
Coetzee, the South
African writer.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.200
I thought "Disgrace" was
an absolute classic.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.890
I also like Paul Auster.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:54.370
I like Haruki Murakami.

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.800
So these are some of the writers
whose writing style I

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.100
like, but some of them
don't believe in a

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.740
resolution at all.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.970
For me, resolution is
very important.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.950
If a reader has invested time
and money in my book, then I

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:07.750
don't want the reader to go
puzzling into the night--

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:08.560
what happened?

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.180
Did he die?

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:12.000
Did he get the money?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:12.980
Did they get married?

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.900
What happened?

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.460
For me, resolution
is important.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.710
Yes.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.240
AUDIENCE: Now that two of your
books are adapted into films,

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.850
how challenging is it
not to think you're

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:30.110
writing for a film?

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:32.293
Because there's always the
penchant that probably my book

00:46:32.293 --> 00:46:33.900
might be adapted for a film.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.460
VIKAS SWARUP: No, I never write
from that perspective.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.630
Because, look, if that is what
you're looking for, then write

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:41.850
screenplays because that is the
correct medium for that.

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.945
"Six Suspects," my second book,
when I was writing "Six

00:46:44.945 --> 00:46:47.930
Suspects," "Q &amp; A" was already
being made into a film.

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.690
It had not been released
yet, but it was being

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:50.640
made in to a film.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.100
Yet I wrote "Six Suspects,"
which is a murder mystery.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.860
Now, you know, a who-done-it
is the most

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.540
difficult book to film.

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.270
In a book, how do you
disguise a murderer?

00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:00.980
Because I never had an idea
that this book would also

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.150
become a film one day or
something like that.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:04.380
So when I write, I write.

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.390
When I write a book,
I write a book.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.520
And I have no expectations
that this will

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.550
be made into a film.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:13.350
But many people tell me that I
write very visually in the

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:16.440
sense that when I create my
book, then I am myself

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.700
imagining that scene in my head,
and then I write from

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.300
that perspective.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.110
So that probably makes it easier
for it to be translated

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:23.863
into another medium.

00:47:23.863 --> 00:47:25.795
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:47:25.795 --> 00:47:30.142
So how much say does a writer
ought to have when his work is

00:47:30.142 --> 00:47:34.060
being adapted into a movie?

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.240
VIKAS SWARUP: That depends
on what kind of

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.180
contract you have.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.570
There is the British contract.

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.800
There is the Hollywood
contract.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.530
The kind of contract
I had had me in

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:45.030
charge of creative control.

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.570
I had creative control in the
sense that I would have to

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:48.720
sign off on the screenplay.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.000
So they would show me the
screenplay, accept my

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.030
suggestions if I had any, and
then on that basis proceed

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.460
further, which I think is
the right way to go.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:59.390
After all, no one is closer to
the work than the writer.

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:02.700
So any film people who want to
completely ignore the writer

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:08.030
or cut out the writer from that
process I think is not

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.750
doing the right thing.

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:13.730
Yes, there are some writers
who are so obsessive about

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.650
their work that they can
become too interfering.

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:20.800
I was on a panel with a Chinese
writer in Shanghai,

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.470
and he had a very interesting
take on

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:23.480
this adaptation business.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.680
He said, the best attitude you
can have towards an adaptation

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.450
of your work is that of
a distant relative.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:33.540
And he says that's very
effective because if the film

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:35.350
does well, you can always
claim the relative.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:36.410
Oh, he's my relative.

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:38.200
And if it doesn't do well,
you can say I had

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:38.840
nothing to do with it.

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.230
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:48:44.576 --> 00:48:46.020
AUDIENCE: I have one.

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.180
VIKAS SWARUP: Yes.

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.510
AUDIENCE: When you were
speaking, I was a little

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:53.080
amazed with you have
a day job.

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.550
And then you said you dedicate
weekends to your passion,

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:56.830
which is writing.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:57.317
VIKAS SWARUP: Yes.

00:48:57.317 --> 00:48:58.780
AUDIENCE: What happens
to the family?

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:02.590
Because in the discussions we
have here a lot of times are

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:05.123
around work/life balance and,
oh, I don't have the time to

00:49:05.123 --> 00:49:09.042
pursue my passion, which
may be [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:09.042 --> 00:49:10.850
How do you organize your time?

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:12.630
VIKAS SWARUP: No, that's
very, very important.

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:15.380
And I am incredibly lucky to
have such a supportive family

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.820
who give me the space
on weekends.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:20.170
Because if Monday to Friday I'm
working at the office and

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.470
Saturday and Sunday I'm doing my
wife's grocery list and my

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:25.130
son's homework, then they'll be
no time to create at all.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.070
So it's not that I work
every weekend.

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.910
There are some weekends where
I goof off or we go with the

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:33.770
family to an outing or travel
or catch a movie or

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:34.540
something like that.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.780
But when the idea is fully
formed in my head and I have

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:41.200
started writing, then my family
respects that OK, he

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.950
has reached that particular
point where we

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:44.640
need to give him space.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.820
Otherwise, he'll be
a cranky old man.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:51.110
And then they allow me that
space and allow me to work.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:53.290
And without that, I think
without having a supportive

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:56.586
family, the creative process
just does not work.

00:49:56.586 --> 00:49:59.827
AUDIENCE: Also a passion
for your art

00:49:59.827 --> 00:50:01.690
because you want to pursue--

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:02.500
VIKAS SWARUP: So that's
what I'm saying.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.430
You have to have the passion,
because if you don't have the

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.950
passion, the creative juices
just won't flow.

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:11.850
But for the passion to be
translated into a product, you

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:13.690
have to have that supportive
family environment, which

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:18.704
allows that creative
process to unfold.

00:50:18.704 --> 00:50:22.480
AUDIENCE: So one of the themes
in "Q &amp; A" and as you spoke

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.055
about "The Accidental
Apprentice" is the process of

00:50:26.055 --> 00:50:30.065
evaluating someone or judging
someone based on-- it could be

00:50:30.065 --> 00:50:31.940
a quiz based on this memory
or it could be

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.190
something totally different.

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:36.855
So was there any instant that
you actually lived or has

00:50:36.855 --> 00:50:39.140
there been a real-life
experience where you've seen

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.944
people being evaluated
in a certain way?

00:50:40.944 --> 00:50:44.602
I mean, nowadays with access to
all the information, it may

00:50:44.602 --> 00:50:46.718
not be that someone has
everything in your mind.

00:50:46.718 --> 00:50:49.646
You have to know what to make
of it and how to get that.

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:52.590
So do you have any anecdotal
stories of that?

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:55.340
VIKAS SWARUP: This evaluation
that you're saying, it does

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.350
not just happen in
the workplace.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.430
We evaluate people
all the time.

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:02.620
In fact, the whole motivation
behind writing "Q &amp; A" was we

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.630
have this tendency, especially
in India, that those of us who

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:08.920
have the good fortune of getting
a decent education,

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.260
going to school, universities,
reading newspapers, we believe

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.470
we know everything.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:16.590
And those who have not had this
good fortune, people who

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.540
work for us, for instance, who
have not gone through a formal

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:22.270
education system, we feel they
don't know anything.

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:23.950
And we tend to put them down.

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:24.750
You know, [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:25.930
You don't know anything.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:27.960
And I have always been
tremendously impressed by the

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.930
amount of wisdom and knowledge
that these common folk possess

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:32.770
who we don't give
the time of day.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:36.180
So the whole purpose behind
writing "Q &amp; A" was to show

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.850
that the best teacher in the
world is life itself.

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:42.940
And those who graduate from the
School of Hard Knocks know

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:47.320
that every moment in life is
meaningful and precious and

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:47.715
significant.

00:51:47.715 --> 00:51:50.120
There are no unnecessary
experiences.

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.430
And that's what happens
in the book.

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:55.610
Ram Mohammed Thomas has street
knowledge as opposed to book

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:58.100
knowledge, and it is that street
knowledge that enables

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:03.600
him to unlock the keys to the
questions not only onto the

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.240
quiz show but to life itself.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.870
AUDIENCE: Do you think that
art is just [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:14.443
for art's sake, or should it
have a greater purpose and be

00:52:14.443 --> 00:52:15.590
socially responsible?

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:18.230
VIKAS SWARUP: Well, that again
depends from writer to writer.

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:19.440
There are some writers
who only seek

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.810
to amuse and entertain.

00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:22.670
And there are some writers who
want to bring about social

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:24.480
change and change the world.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.180
So both kinds of writers
I think have a

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.120
place in the world.

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.490
And I think both kinds of
stories can lead to the

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:32.390
discovery of truth.

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:35.650
The important thing is that
it's a personal truth.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:38.290
It is truth as seen or perceived
by the writer.

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:41.320
Because remember, a novel is not
a reproduction of reality.

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.750
It is a recreation.

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:45.530
And when you recreate that
reality, you do so through the

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:48.350
prism of your own experiences.

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:52.250
So, as I said, the kind of books
I write, I do not set

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:54.880
out to be a game changer
or whatever.

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.170
But at the same time, I say my
books may not have a message,

00:52:58.170 --> 00:52:59.880
but they have a conscience.

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.060
That after you have read the
book, some issues if they are

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.610
still lingering in your mind
about some of the issues that

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:08.560
I have highlighted or touched
upon in my books, then I find

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.560
that to be a bonus.

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:13.420
But primarily, I want you to get
engrossed in my book and

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:14.670
enjoy the ride.
