Okay, so here is our program design. I'm going

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.720
to start by opening a browser and playing a

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.430
song. So previously, I Googled to find out how

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.890
one would open a web browser in python. And I

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.680
discovered that there is this function called webbrowser.open. This

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.340
function takes in the link I want to open.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.810
I just placed a Youtube address in there. In

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.950
fact, this could have been any link you want. Alright.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.380
Let's save the program and run it. I'm going

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.470
to call it Breaktime dot Py. Py stands for

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.200
Python. To run it, I will click on run,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.700
and then click on run module. Now my hypothesis is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.840
that when we run this program it will open

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.330
the Youtube link. Let's see. Oh. It seems like

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.170
we have an error. Okay, it says there's an

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.450
error in your program, EOL, whatever that means, while scanning

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.210
the string literal. Okay? Oh, look Python is

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.840
pointing out the error. It seems like I missed

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.330
the closing quote, so I'm going to add that.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.260
Let me save the program one more time and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.978
run it. Now I believe it will work.

00:01:05.978 --> 00:01:11.140
Hm, another error. You know, when I first learned

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.210
how to program, I felt so intimidated by these

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.940
errors. Look at them. They are red and in

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.080
your face, but to make the program work, we have

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.390
to somehow get past them. So, would you mind reading

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.550
the error and telling us what you think is the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.770
problem with this code? Enter your responses in this box.
