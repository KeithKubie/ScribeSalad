[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.330
SPEAKER: So you are here to hear
about the Innocence Project.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.660
Today, we have with us
co-founder Barry Scheck,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.121
who will also be introducing a
very special guest of his own.

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:17.620
Please help me
welcome Barry Scheck.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:25.420
BARRY SCHECK: Thank
you very much.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.390
It's a real privilege
and pleasure to be here.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.140
And what we hope to do in the
short time we have with you,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.400
and we will certainly be
taking your questions,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.440
is give you a brief introduction
to the Innocence Project

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.820
and the Innocence Network.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.820
That's a series of
organizations that do this work.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.400
But the best ambassadors,
the best advocates,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.660
the people that really
share with the country,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.970
with legislators,
with decision makers,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.000
with judges, with prosecutors,
with defense lawyers,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.380
with everyone what
this work is all about

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.520
are our clients, the exonerated.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.370
And so we are really
privileged today

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.290
to have here Kevin Richardson,
one of the defendants

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.611
in the Central Park Five case.

00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:13.360
Come on up, Kevin.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:31.430
So what we thought we'd do
in unusual format for lawyers

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.170
like me-- and I apologize.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.860
I know I'm here at Google.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.880
And I apologize for
wearing a suit and tie,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.250
but I had to go to
court in the morning,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.490
otherwise I wouldn't have done
that out of respect for you.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.990
OK.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.470
So let's get to it right away.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.690
This should work, right?

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.460
Here we go.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.210
Went too many--

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.390
OK.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.250
The mission of the
Innocence Project

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.270
is to free wrongly convicted
people through DNA testing

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.580
and reform the
system responsible

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.850
for their unjust imprisonment
anywhere in the world.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.560
It's the old mission.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.710
Martin Luther King said,
an injustice anywhere

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.050
is an injustice everywhere.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.310
And we seek to establish as
an international human right

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.370
that in every legal system,
adversarial or inquisitional--

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.310
because in some
countries, many in Europe,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.990
you have legal systems what
they call inquisitional,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.940
meaning that judges essentially
do the investigation.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.570
It's not the typical
adversary system we have here.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.380
However, in every
one of these systems,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.230
what we find-- innocent
people get convicted.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.920
And the international human
right we'd like to establish

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.940
is that there should be
a viable process in place

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.290
to be able to rectify a case,
where an innocent person is

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.950
convicted.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.730
Viable process--

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.210
Now, in 1989, we had the
first DNA exoneration

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.530
in the United States.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.030
By 1992, my co-founder and
co-director, Peter Neufeld,

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.380
and I started the Innocence
Project as a clinical program

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.500
at the Benjamin N.
Cardozo School of Law,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.410
which is just a few
blocks away from here.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.420
By 2004, we had an
independent nonprofit entity.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.920
But what's most important
is that over the years,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.710
almost from the
outset, we had partners

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.610
at law schools and
public defenders offices

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.200
all across the country that
we call an Innocence Network.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.340
And we have 69
organizations worldwide

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.690
in the Innocence Network,
56 in the United States.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.790
And let me be the
first to tell you

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.450
that in the other organizations
within our network,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.770
we use both DNA and non-DNA
evidence to prove people

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.030
are innocent.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.640
And we do that too at the
Innocence Project-- use

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.440
non-DNA evidence.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.300
Here, just very
briefly, the numbers.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.250
There have been 351
post-conviction DNA

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.660
exonerations in 37 states,
20 people sentenced

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.780
to death since 1989.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.740
And we start with 1989 as the
beginning of the innocence era,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.820
because that's when we first
began upsetting expectations

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.800
of everyone in the legal
system that there were

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.710
a lot more innocent people
than anybody ever knew about

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.600
through the DNA testing.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.730
And the reason that we
focus on the DNA testing--

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.700
and if you go to the
Innocence Project website,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.590
you'll see these numbers
and broken down by race,

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.580
by states, every way
you can imagine--

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.530
is that nobody is arguing
with these 351 exonerations.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.930
They are all actually innocent.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.760
They didn't do it.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.690
And it's interesting
to note that in 150

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.300
of these cases, the person
who really committed

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.430
the crime has been identified.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.460
So no one argues this.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.424
There is a website
that I want to urge

00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:13.840
you to look at
called the National

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.470
Registry of Exonerations,
which our colleagues

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.160
and partners run.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.690
It's now at University of Irvine
Law School, Michigan State,

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.250
University of Michigan.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.370
And there, we are keeping
track of an instrumental

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.780
number-- the best the
legal system can do.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.880
And that is cases where there is
new evidence of innocence that

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.140
leads to a conviction being
vacated, meaning thrown out,

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.510
and then the case is dismissed.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.570
Or somebody, in a few instances,
not many go, back to trial

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.860
and they're acquitted.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.360
Now, in these cases, that
is the best definition

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.360
that the legal system
can come to in deciding

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.360
when there has been a
mistake or actually innocent.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.210
The people that run the registry
would be the first to tell you

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.000
that we can't say
that absolutely

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.910
every one of those people is
actually innocent in the way

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.520
that we can say it
in the DNA cases.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.420
But the truth is that the vast
overwhelming majority of them

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.800
are innocent.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.290
And what's good about the
registry is that we now

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.900
have, since 1989,
2,089 cases where we've

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.670
been able to demonstrate that
innocent people were convicted,

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.710
people were convicted, new
evidence of innocence cases

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.400
dismissed.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.520
And we're not even
counting mass exonerations,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.920
and there have been
plenty of those.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.170
And it makes it easier
to look at the data

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:40.720
and make a deep dive into
an analysis of this problem

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.540
of innocent people
being convicted, which

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.640
is a whole field of
scholarship, and we're first

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.630
just getting into it.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.690
So take a look at the registry.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.760
It It's worth looking at.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.210
Now, we know about the causes
of wrongful convictions--

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.160
eyewitness misidentification--
71% of the wrongful convictions

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.500
in our DNA cases.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.830
Misapplication of forensic
science in 45% of them,

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.800
and in the Central Park Five
case, which as you'll hear,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.800
was primarily a false
confession case,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.680
we still had bad
forensic science.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.490
There were hairs that were found
on the poor young woman known

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.830
as the Central Park Jogger.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.440
And they tried to claim
that some of these hairs

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.730
came from the defendants,
looking at it microscopically

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.440
just under a microscope.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.320
And we know that a lot of that
microscopic hair comparison

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.770
evidence is
notoriously unreliable.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.326
We were then able to do DNA
testing many years later

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:41.200
on the shafts of those
hair, something called

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.350
mitochondrial DNA testing,
and able to demonstrate

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.960
that the hairs didn't come
from any of these defendants.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.620
And indeed, the source of
the hairs, as you'll hear,

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.240
comes from the person who
really committed that crime.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.700
So 45% misapplication
of forensic science,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.820
a huge cause of
wrongful convictions.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.050
False confessions in 28%
of the cases, but close to,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.670
I think, half of the
homicides, something like that.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.300
Incentivized informant, a huge
problem around this country.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.710
That, by the way, is a
picture of Betty Anne Waters,

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.771
and that's her
brother Kenny Waters.

00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:22.270
And it's a wonderful
movie you might

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.180
want to take a look at
called "Conviction," starring

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.097
Hilary Swank, Sam Rockwell,
directed by Tony Goldwyn.

00:08:30.097 --> 00:08:31.930
Isn't he the President
of the United States,

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.970
last time I looked?

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.890
But it's worth looking at.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.970
That's that case.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.059
Inadequate representation--
we all know that's

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.520
a terrible cause of
wrongful convictions.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.660
Prosecutorial misconduct, the
field that we focus on a lot.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.780
That's Michael Morton in Texas.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.979
And we, at the Innocence Project
and in the Innocence Network,

00:08:53.979 --> 00:08:55.270
we're kind of the headquarters.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.310
We have a network
support unit, but we

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.280
go around the country,
both lobbying in Congress

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.590
for legislation
and in every state.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.750
So when we started
the Innocence Project,

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.280
there were no
states that gave you

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.160
a right to get
post-conviction DNA testing.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.040
Now, all 50 states
have such a bill.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.260
They can even be improved,
but at least all 50

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.590
states and in Congress and
the federal government,

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.570
we have such a bill.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:27.700
In 31 states, we have efforts,
legislation that requires

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.100
the preservation of evidence.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.500
So you can go back years later
and prove people are innocent.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.360
Recording of
interrogations that we're

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.800
going to discuss a lot today,
this is a critical reform.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.760
We're talking about beginning
to videotape an interrogation

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.890
from the time of
Miranda warnings,

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.660
not as in the Central Park Five
case, after they tuned people

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.570
up, as they used to say at
"NYPD Blue," interrogate

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.780
them for hours, and
then after it's all over

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.420
and all the coercion has taken
place and all the feeding

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.020
of facts, they come in and
they begin a videotape later.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.180
That's not videotaping
of interrogation

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.310
in any meaningful way.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.360
Eyewitness identification--
in 19 states,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.080
we've been able to
seriously change

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.140
the different methods of doing
identification procedures,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.530
whether it's photo
arrays or lineups,

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:24.100
to reduce the risk
of error and trying

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.670
to enhance the capability
of law enforcement

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.340
to get correct identifications.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.300
Forensic science--
we're working on it.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.750
There was just a--

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.690
we had a National Commission
on Forensic Science that

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.840
came about after the National
Academy of Science in 2009

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.180
issued a groundbreaking report.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.390
But the National Commission
is a thing of the past.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.320
After the election,
it was disbanded.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.150
So we are still
working everywhere

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.100
to expand policy reforms.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.620
We're focusing more on indigent
defense, on criminal courts,

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.800
and particularly what we
call America's guilty plea

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.280
problem, the issue of
innocent people pleading

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.920
guilty to crimes
they didn't commit.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.690
That's one of our
earliest clients,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:16.510
Chris Ochoa, who pled guilty
to a homicide in Texas

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.850
under literally being
threatened with,

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.462
if you don't confess
to this crime,

00:11:20.462 --> 00:11:21.670
you're going to get executed.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.510
We will needle you, is
precisely what they told Chris.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.180
He confessed to a crime
that he didn't commit.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.910
Now, he's graduated from the
University of Wisconsin Law

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.600
School and is a lawyer and works
hard in the innocence movement.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.070
But we're really focusing on
innocent people pleading guilty

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.620
in the misdemeanor
courts, because one

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.870
of the major issues, as you all
know, I hope, is bail reform,

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:51.130
is making sure that people
are not kept in jail just

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.650
because they can't
afford bail, where

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.740
they wind up pleading guilty
to crimes they didn't commit.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.490
And misdemeanors or what
they call low level felonies

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.810
has huge collateral consequences
for people everywhere.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.580
But because we have Kevin
here, and he is so kind

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.360
to come and share his
experiences with us today,

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.960
let us talk about one of
the truly historic cases

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.380
in the modern history of
American jurisprudence--

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.490
it really is-- the
Central Park Jogger case.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.530
And I'm looking
around the room, and I

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.650
think a lot-- how many
of you have heard of it?

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.360
Well, that's a lot.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.650
I think it's probably true,
because of the wonderful movie

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.920
that Sarah Burns and Dave
McMahon, her husband,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.120
made called the
"Central Park Five."

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.952
How many of you saw that movie?

00:12:46.952 --> 00:12:48.910
Let the record reflect
a lot of the same people

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.086
raised their hands.

00:12:51.086 --> 00:12:52.460
It's a terrific
movie and you all

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.320
should go see it
and get it online.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.040
But this case started
in April of 1989

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.420
when a young woman who was an
investment banker, actually

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.260
a wonderful person whose
overcome horrible injuries,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.600
was jogging in Central Park, as
was her habit and pattern, when

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.240
she was mugged.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.710
That night in
Central Park, there

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:20.940
were other instances of people
being attacked and mugged

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.720
in the park.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.320
They called it wilding,
as a slang term.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.410
And they developed this
term of super predators.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:33.030
But the jogger herself, as
she was called in those days,

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:39.150
was found, like, in a ditch,
horribly beaten, stabbed.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.490
It's a miracle that she
lived through the experience.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:49.080
And this is what the newspaper
headlines looked like.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.400
But the long story
short, and I'll

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.760
tell just a short
version of the story,

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.310
the involvement of the
Innocence Project in this case

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:05.580
is, strangely enough, after
Kevin and his colleagues

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.380
were convicted in, I guess, two
trials, and all five of them

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.290
went to jail for
different periods of time,

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:18.420
and the city was convinced
that these young men,

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:23.070
these so-called super
predators, as they were called,

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.320
they saw their
confessions on television.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.810
And nobody was showing
any remorse, right?

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.307
Which was a big deal.

00:14:29.307 --> 00:14:31.140
And of course, they
weren't showing remorse,

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.000
because they were innocent.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.810
They didn't do anything, right?

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:40.920
But years later, we at
the Innocence Project

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.310
got a letter from a
man named Matias Reyes.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.442
And Matias Reyes wrote to
us and one other lawyer

00:14:47.442 --> 00:14:48.900
in New York City
and said, you know

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.320
what, I'm the person that
committed that crime.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.450
I'm the one that
attacked the jogger.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:59.130
And of course, he was in
jail himself for murder.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.110
What's really
extraordinary about this

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:05.550
is that a friend, a very
good lawyer, who was working

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.850
in the New York City
District Attorney's office,

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.760
named Harlan Levy
wrote a book called--

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.360
he was their DNA expert.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.900
He wrote a book called
"And the Blood Cries Out."

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.700
And the first
chapter in the book

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.700
is about Matias Reyes
being convicted with DNA

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.670
evidence for a break-in murder.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.940
And by the way, he always tried
to bash the eyes of his victims

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.330
so nobody could identify him.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.290
And the jogger, of
course, her eyes

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.830
were in that state as
well-- broken sockets.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.540
But the beginning
of the book is,

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.490
look at the power
of DNA evidence.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.920
Then he has another
chapter in the book talking

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.660
about how he advised the
prosecutors Elizabeth Lederer

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.910
and Linda Fairstein and others
who prosecuted the Central Park

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.780
Five to ignore it to
get around the fact

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.140
that there was semen evidence
that didn't come back to any

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.260
of the defendants nor the
jogger's boyfriend that

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:03.450
was found on the vaginal swabs
and on the shorts, as I recall.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.000
And that's part of the book.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.960
And little did he know
that years later Matias

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.530
Reyes would come forward.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.070
Matias Reyes said to
the Innocence Project,

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.030
I'm the person who really
committed the crime.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:22.065
And this is really how--

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:23.565
one of the things
we want to discuss

00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:26.250
and I want you to
really focus on

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.510
is, when you have these
media storms in a case

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:34.990
like this, those of you
that are New Yorkers--

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.510
I'm looking around the room--

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.370
ask your parents
what this was like.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:42.390
And we're going to discuss
it in a second with Kevin.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.490
Talk about the daily news.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.400
There was wall to wall coverage.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.770
Everybody was obsessed
with this case.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:54.120
It came at a
terrible time, where

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:58.800
crime was spiking, where you
had an epidemic of narcotics

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.200
distribution in this city.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.840
And people were scared.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:10.650
And Reyes came forward
years, years later.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.810
He said, I really
committed this crime.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:19.175
And we then took this to the
New York County prosecutors.

00:17:19.175 --> 00:17:20.550
And there were
two of them that I

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:25.140
want to single out
for praise, because I

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.710
want it clear that in the
criminal justice reform

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:33.030
movement that we hope is
really taking off now,

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.640
those who are progressive
prosecutors, who

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.870
are willing to admit mistakes
and reinvestigate fearlessly,

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.460
they must be praised.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.380
And this never
would have happened

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:50.160
unless Peter Casolaro and Nancy
Ryan agreed to take this on.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.180
There were a number of reporters
in the city that had heard

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.250
that something was cooking.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.290
And all the lawyers
involved in the case

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:03.210
were able to keep this quiet for
seven months in New York City--

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.780
seven months-- while they
reinvestigated the case.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.730
Now, I don't know.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.690
I'm sure here at Google, you
will appreciate seven months

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.760
with an incendiary
story like this,

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.260
to keep that quiet
is a miracle, right?

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.730
But that was done.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.130
And it gave Nancy and
Peter the opportunity,

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.170
along with their own
DA investigators,

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.340
to independently investigate
this, to go talk to Reyes.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.610
They actually found
another case right

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.220
by that area in
Central Park where

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.010
Reyes, a day or two
before, had committed

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:41.010
another sexual assault,
a vicious one, that

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.700
was never prosecuted,
and partly because they

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.270
couldn't find anybody and
the victim of that case moved

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.500
to California.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:56.030
But it was the same MO, the
same person, Matias Reyes.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.880
And then, of course, by the time
that they were reinvestigating,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.000
they'd known he'd gone
on to commit murders.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.060
And they also, in
their re-investigation,

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.960
he didn't know any of the
five defendants, right?

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.630
And the way it wound
up is that they did

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.370
this massive reinvestigation.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.740
They corroborated
everything Reyes said.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.230
It was completely consistent
with the DNA evidence,

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.870
with the hair evidence,
with the forensic evidence

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.580
at the scene, everything,
and with the timeline.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.010
Because the truth
is, the timeline

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.520
never made any sense in the
Central Park Jogger case.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.250
And at the time, many
people pointed that out.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:37.790
So they presented their case
to District Attorney Robert

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:38.390
Morgenthau.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:43.880
By that time, word
had gotten out.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.240
The police department
began reinvestigating.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.130
And the prosecutors
in the case-- and they

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.380
made a huge presentation
to Mr. Morgenthau

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:56.660
saying, no, no, no, we
think they're still guilty.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.490
We stand behind this.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.290
And Morgenthau, to
his credit, they

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:05.330
filed a huge affidavit
in court detailing

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.900
the entire
investigation and agreed

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.210
to vacate the conviction.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.030
And that is, if you're
interested historically,

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.960
is an important document
for you to take a look at.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:23.200
So Matias Reyes pled
guilty to that crime.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.055
Everybody knows
that he was-- well,

00:20:25.055 --> 00:20:27.430
he didn't plead guilty because
the statute of limitations

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.330
had run.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.850
But everybody agrees that
he is the person that

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:34.000
committed the crime, and the
convictions were vacated.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.140
Very long story
short, it took years,

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.270
but there was massive civil
litigation in this case.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.340
And the City of New York
and our corporation counsel

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.860
Zach Carter, who was a
US attorney in this city

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.420
and is a great great lawyer, all
agreed that these young men are

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.740
innocent, and they
settled a civil case

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.579
for many millions of dollars.

00:20:58.579 --> 00:21:01.120
And that, believe me, wouldn't
have happened unless everybody

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.580
was completely-- in the city--

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.730
completely convinced and
the corporation counsel's

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.070
office that they were innocent.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.980
There is still some
people that to this day--

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.040
I think it's an example of a
certain kind of cognitive bias

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.600
where you can't let go--

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.890
still insist that
they're guilty.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.460
But any reasonable person, I
think, examining the evidence

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.930
can't reach that conclusion.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:31.490
So what do we make of this, and
why is this case so important?

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.550
Well, one reason,
of course, has to do

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.850
with trying to get up
the number of states

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.360
that videotape interrogation
and actually look at the way

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.010
that people are interrogated
to make sure that we don't have

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.260
this problem of false
confessions, which

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.320
is incredibly difficult
and pernicious.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.600
But how do you get that done?

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.390
I'll never forget
that just before--

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.430
and I was telling Kevin
this the other day--

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:03.730
just before we went to announce
in court that the Central Park

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.990
Five were going to have their
convictions vacated, somebody

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:09.715
from The New York
Civil Liberties Union

00:22:09.715 --> 00:22:12.190
and myself went to one
of the deputy mayors

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.240
in the city of New York and
what was going on, and said,

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.270
this is the time to
videotape interrogations.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.970
Let's make sure
there are no errors.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:26.530
We'll see exactly what happens
from Miranda warnings forward.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.840
And we said, use
this as the time.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.840
And the truth is, because of
the real pushback by the police

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.140
department after Morgenthau
vacated the conviction,

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:40.090
we had enormous trouble getting
videotaping interrogations

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.410
passed in this state.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.320
And it didn't happen
until last year.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.466
And I'm going to show you
right now why it happened.

00:22:49.466 --> 00:22:51.650
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.470
[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.840
BARRY SCHECK: Well, if we didn't
have that ad, that by the way,

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.405
was filmed by Sarah Burns
and David McMahon, who

00:23:38.405 --> 00:23:41.650
made the "Central
Park Five" movie,

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.690
we wouldn't have been
able to get this done.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:50.360
And we just were able to get
this done finally this year.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:55.690
The videotaping will go into
effect in June of next year,

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:58.660
but the bill was
passed this spring.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:03.180
So this is an effort
that has to go on

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.790
in all the states
in this country that

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.910
do not videotape interrogations
from Miranda warnings forward.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:14.610
And I'm glad to say that the
FBI recently agreed to do that.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.340
But why is the Central Park
Jogger case so important?

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.490
It's not just because five
innocent young men wound up

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.890
pleading guilty
and wound up giving

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:29.920
confessions that were videotaped
that had all these details.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.350
It has a lot to do
with race in America

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.140
and has a lot to
do with our culture

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:42.310
and has a lot to do with
our current president.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:46.620
So first, Raymond,
let me ask you.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.177
Raymond-- Kevin.

00:24:48.177 --> 00:24:49.510
KEVIN RICHARDSON: We look alike.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.230
It's fine.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.570
BARRY SCHECK: Tell us
how you were arrested.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.205
KEVIN RICHARDSON: Good
afternoon, Google.

00:24:57.205 --> 00:25:00.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.140
Going back to 1989, I see I
have a-- it's young crowd.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.310
So during that time,
I was 14 years old.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:17.710
1989, I remember it was an
Easter vacation, so excited

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.960
to be out for a few days.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.830
I lived across the street from
Central Park, 110th Street,

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.250
so I went to the park
quite often to go swimming

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.460
and to play basketball and
play football actually.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.090
So I remember that night,
there was a group of guys

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:36.716
forming to go into the park.

00:25:36.716 --> 00:25:38.215
I remember a friend
of mine told me,

00:25:38.215 --> 00:25:40.270
oh, don't go, like stay
and play basketball.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.160
But I wanted to go anyway.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.030
The only thing I was
guilty of that night

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:51.200
was being a follower, because I
went into the park not thinking

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.940
anything was going to happen.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.100
So going into the
park, I remember

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:02.190
a lot of kids forming
together, and I see something.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.840
I see, like, a guy
with a bike going by.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.070
I see him being attacked.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.870
Then, I'm telling myself,
this is not my kind of crowd.

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.230
And I had a curfew that night.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.650
I was still 14
years old, so I was

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:21.100
scared of breaking my
curfew more than anything.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.200
So I remember walking out
of the park on Fifth Avenue.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.200
If you're familiar with
Manhattan, Central Park,

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.190
it's Fifth Avenue.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.870
So I remember walking back home.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.960
It was kind of late,
and I formed up

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.730
with a few guys I didn't know,
and we all was walking upward

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.320
Fifth Avenue.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:46.180
And it was a police van
that swung around the kids.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.900
And growing up during
that time in the '80s,

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.720
even if you were innocent,
when you seen police,

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.740
you became afraid.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.900
So what I do?

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.250
I ran.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.040
Everybody else ran,
so I ran as well.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.090
So I remember turning back
to the wall in Central Park.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:09.530
So I jumped back into the park,
and I rolled around in mud,

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.240
because there's a whole bunch
of grass and things like that.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.890
So this one thing I
remember, it still

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:20.110
stands to this day, which
is a white police officer.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:24.340
He told me, stay.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.780
Don't run, or I'll shoot.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:31.230
So I kept running, and all
I remember feeling someone,

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.010
like, a physical being over me.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:36.870
And I remember him tackling me.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.830
At this age I did
not look this size.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:43.140
I was very slim.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.500
And all I remember is him
taking this police helmet

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.430
and hitting me in my face.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:51.360
And during that time, I remember
blacking out a little bit.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.440
I remember I felt my face
feeling a little swollen.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.160
And if you look back
in the film and you

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:01.650
see when they show the
videotaped confession,

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:04.230
my eye was a little swollen.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.640
I remember asking the police
officer, what are you doing?

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.630
I'm innocent.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.600
And he said, didn't I tell you
to freeze, you little animal?

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.220
And that always stood out to me.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.500
During that time, I
remember I was really dirty

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.270
and I remember handcuffing me.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.270
And they took us out of
the park and put us back

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:28.180
in the police car.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.910
And I was there with
another young kid,

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.800
which I did not know.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.990
And in another police car
was, come to found out,

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:39.290
was Raymond Santana, which I
didn't know it at the time,

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:42.360
but they portrayed
that we were gang

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.490
or we were some type of cult.
That we was gangs and stuff,

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.270
which I didn't know him at all.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:50.050
And that was the first time I
met Raymond Santana actually.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:57.430
So from that point, we was drove
to the Central Park precinct.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.970
Like I said, at that time,
the thing I'm most afraid of

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.950
is breaking my curfew.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.680
You know, can you imagine?

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.580
Because my mother, she
raised us to be responsible.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.320
And I knew that weekend,
it was an Easter vacation,

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.820
so I can hang out
a little bit more,

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:18.250
just being a normal
14-year-old teenager.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.040
So I remember going
to the precinct

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.220
and being with
other individuals.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.275
Well, I come to find out it was
Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana.

00:29:26.275 --> 00:29:27.900
BARRY SCHECK: And
you didn't know them.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.850
KEVIN RICHARDSON: No.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.600
BARRY SCHECK: That's
what's extraordinary.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:37.170
And we're not going
to focus right now,

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.660
because we don't have the
time, on the methods that

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.725
were used to coerce the
confession from Kevin.

00:29:47.135 --> 00:29:51.210
The good cop, bad cop
routines and feeding facts

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.250
about how the crime
really occurred that,

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.440
in theory, only the police
and the real perpetrator

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.680
would know.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.260
And look at the movie,
read the literature.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.570
You really need to
read this literature.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:09.450
But one of the things that
only Kevin can share with us--

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.400
take a look at this picture.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:16.530
See that picture of the
protesters of the Central Park

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.660
Five as they're entering court?

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.540
And this has always
troubled me enormously,

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:25.220
because I remember all of this.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.420
I was a practicing
criminal defense lawyer.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.120
I was teaching at
Cardozo Law School.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.520
I'd been a public defender.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.230
I knew something
about DNA evidence,

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.300
so informally I was
trying to assist

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.420
the lawyers in this case, at
least explain what it was.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.180
But all of us involved in
the criminal justice system

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.330
were watching this unfold.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:53.820
And it's just hard to
imagine how it was for you.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.900
Kevin, if you could tell us
what it was like every day

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:04.008
to walk into court
and face trial

00:31:04.008 --> 00:31:07.320
with these crowds
outside of the courtroom.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.130
Can you explain for us what
this atmosphere was like?

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:16.000
KEVIN RICHARDSON: During
this time was even '89, 1990.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.420
Almost a full year went by.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.915
And instead of enjoying
regular activity like a kid,

00:31:22.915 --> 00:31:27.410
just being outside,
just hanging out,

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:32.040
my everyday life was going
to court, five days a week.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.510
And I was so sheltered
during this time,

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:39.680
and scared to even be outside,
because I didn't think what

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.200
people thought of me,
because we was portrayed

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.732
so much-- during the '80s,
there was such a media frenzy

00:31:46.732 --> 00:31:47.440
during that time.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.170
There was a lot of
racial things going on.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:57.140
And because of this, it was like
paparazzi around us every day.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.810
They used to come into
actually where I live

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:02.090
and used to interview
people and neighbors

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:03.680
and try to look for us.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.620
We were, like, physically
scared to come outside.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.280
At this time, I was already--

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.260
I was 15 years old at the time.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.500
I remember my
family just hovering

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.730
over me going to
court, taking a train,

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.910
and getting out on Canal Street
and walking to the courthouse

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.130
and seeing these signs.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:28.790
And my mother seeing this
signs about her children

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:32.380
and the other five as well.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.200
And just experiencing
that at 14 years old,

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.330
it's hard for anybody
for that matter,

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:42.310
but being so young and naive,
I thought I was in a nightmare

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:44.790
and I actually didn't
wake up from it.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:48.060
And just going through
this, I thought every day,

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.800
what's going to happen to me?

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.860
What's going to
happen to my mother?

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.770
Because of this, my
mother, she became ill.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.490
She caught a stroke
actually in the courtroom,

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.050
and they had to rush her to the
hospital when I was on trial.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.520
It takes me back, just seeing
the sign and just seeing things

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.320
like this, because
people didn't--

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.840
like, they rushed to judgment.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.300
But they didn't know
that my character.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.270
They didn't know I was
raised by five women.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:20.330
So it was hard.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.120
BARRY SCHECK: And this picture
shows you just one side.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.300
There was white
people on one side,

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.890
people from the black community
and the Latino community

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.110
on the other screaming
at each other

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.770
as people walk in
to this courthouse.

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:40.360
It was a pretty
terrifying atmosphere.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.860
And one of the
things that happened

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:52.050
is that this man,
Donald Trump, put an ad

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:54.750
in the newspapers,
a full page ad,

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:58.110
calling for the death
penalty to be brought back.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:07.130
And what we have done is, we
have given you at Google--

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.120
and it will be online here--

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.040
a copy of this ad.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.670
And what's the
hashtag that we use?

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
/bringbackourpolice.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.337
BARRY SCHECK: I'm sorry?

00:34:18.337 --> 00:34:19.331
AUDIENCE: /bringbackourpolice.

00:34:19.331 --> 00:34:20.679
KEVIN RICHARDSON: Our police.

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:21.550
BARRY SCHECK: Yeah.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.159
Did you all hear that?

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:28.360
OK, we'll put it in
the tape for the--

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.830
And you really need to
read this document, right?

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:35.110
You really need to read it
and take it home with you

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.679
and look at it.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:39.040
Or look at it on your
phone at some point.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.020
But in this ad, the
businessman Donald Trump

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:49.760
went on "Larry King," looks lot
different than he does today.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:55.820
But he was not being ostracized
for taking this position.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:59.610
And the kinds of things
he said were, in this ad,

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:03.550
quote, "at what point
did we cross the line

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.360
from the fine and noble pursuit
of genuine civil liberties

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.170
to the reckless and dangerously
permissive atmosphere which

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:16.270
allows criminals of every age to
beat and rape a helpless woman

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:19.510
and then laugh at her
family's anguish?"

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.720
And then he goes
on to criticize,

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.910
of all people, Mayor Koch.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:28.900
Now, Mayor Koch was a real
law and order guy, all right?

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.170
But even Mayor Koch during
this period of time,

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:33.610
he's criticizing.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:36.430
He says, quote,
"Mayor Koch has stated

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:40.270
that hate and rancor should
be removed from our hearts.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:41.980
I do not think so.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.490
I want to hate these
muggers and murderers.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:49.420
They should be forced to
suffer and when they kill,

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.880
they should be executed
for their crimes.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.730
They must serve as
examples for others,

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:57.520
so that others will think long
and hard before committing

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.950
a crime or an act of violence.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.790
"Yes, Mayor Koch, I want
to hate these murderers,

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:06.840
and I always will.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:11.160
I am not looking to
psychoanalyze or understand

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.360
them.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.280
I am looking to punish them.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.270
If the punishment is strong,
the attacks on innocent people

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:21.090
will stop.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.390
I recently watched a newscast
trying to explain the, quote,

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.580
'anger in these
young men,' unquote.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.830
I no longer want to
understand their anger.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.230
I want them to
understand our anger.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.210
I want them to be afraid."

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.460
And on it goes.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:40.890
And this is a kind of call
for vigilante justice.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:42.630
He goes on to tell
the story about how

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.910
he was with his
father in a diner,

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:47.880
and people were acting
up in the diner,

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.340
and the cops came in and
just threw them out--

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.900
self-help.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.540
And it is very reminiscent
of the kinds of things

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:58.260
that I think are
troubling about President

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.130
Trump and his campaign.

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:04.980
It is not simply the criticism
of a judge, that he's Mexican,

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.870
and therefore he can't be fair.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:09.300
Did you see in
Suffolk County when

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.630
he made that statement
in front of police,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.480
and he said to them, well,
you know, when you put people

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.000
in the police car,
you know how you

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.820
put your hands over their heads
to make sure they don't get

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.660
hurt, well, don't be so nice,
and don't put your hands

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.620
over their head.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.530
And essentially was
justifying calling

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.350
for, you want to be
rough with these people,

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:33.495
you want to make them scared.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:40.230
He said this in 1989, 1990.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:45.780
So Kevin, tell us how you
and your colleagues reacted.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.445
Tell us how your
mother reacted to this.

00:37:48.445 --> 00:37:49.320
KEVIN RICHARDSON: OK.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.194
How much time we got?

00:37:50.194 --> 00:37:51.708
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:51.708 --> 00:37:55.404
BARRY SCHECK: Well, right after
this we'll take your questions.

00:37:55.404 --> 00:37:57.749
KEVIN RICHARDSON: Hmm.

00:37:57.749 --> 00:37:58.290
Donald Trump.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.960
I can't even say my president.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.540
That's how personal it is
to myself and my family.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.530
When he took this
ad out, my mother

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:19.840
told me a story that it hurt her
and our mothers, our parents,

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.760
because it took her back to--

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.150
my mother grew up in the
South when there was actually

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:27.440
things like this going on.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.000
There was lynchings and
things of that nature.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.840
And she grew up in
the South, where

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.230
she said it was
like a KKK rally,

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:42.810
because he physically
spearheaded a movement

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:47.620
and portrayed hate against us
without knowing who we were.

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:55.170
So I think, during this
case, the public was--

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:58.140
you look at the media
and you look at us--

00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.770
the public was swayed
to think that we

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.690
were these kind of animals.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.660
And I think at the time, if
there was a little bit of logic

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.930
used, if you took a step back
and seen, this cannot be true.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.720
But Donald Trump, he
didn't believe that.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.670
And still to this day--

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:17.400
they asked him a question
about it last year

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.860
and he said, they're
guilty, they're guilty.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.730
Despite no DNA evidence,
despite anything

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:28.750
you see within the
film or the documents.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.250
It doesn't make sense.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:35.040
So when he took this ad out, I
was incarcerated at the time.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.030
And I'm hearing about it
when I was incarcerated,

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:42.120
that there are people that's
out there that want us dead.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.220
And that hurt.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:51.850
And to this day, it still hurts,
because even after my case was

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:56.340
overturned, if there's asking
a question, oh, what do

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.260
you feel now, Donald Trump?

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.940
If he were to say, well, I
rushed to judgment that time.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.170
I was wrong.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:07.350
But he's still sticking
to his arrogant ways.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:10.380
And that's what hurts the most.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:14.320
Because actually we would love
to even sit down with him,

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.340
and look him in the face and
wonder why he said that to us.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.130
But he doesn't want
to speak to us,

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.180
and he just believes
what he believes.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.790
So just if he had his way, I
would not be here to this day

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.650
talking to you.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:32.020
If they went back to the days
when people were lynched,

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.930
going back to the days of
Emmett Till when he was he

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.230
was killed for looking
at a white woman,

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:40.030
because during that time--

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:45.140
right now, these days, everyone
is together for the most part.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.890
But in '89, it was divided.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:52.700
It was white against black, and
that was a harsh time to see.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:57.590
And these days, the
youth, we are evolving.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:02.400
And we need more people to make
it better because of this man.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.630
Because if it was
up to him, he'd

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.330
have people that's
really following him.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:10.510
And they really want to
make America great again.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.510
They really want to take
it back to a slavery stage.

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:18.250
So it's very hard to even
see this to this day.

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.920
And it's been 27 years ago.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.990
And that's how much it hurts
deep inside to still see.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.800
Because, yes, my
case was overturned.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.430
Yes, I'm raising my
family, but the five of us,

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:34.150
we have this invisible
scar that nobody sees.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:38.287
And no money will
cover that, So whenever

00:41:38.287 --> 00:41:40.120
I see this, and thinking
about Donald Trump,

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.714
is just very harsh.

00:41:41.714 --> 00:41:43.380
BARRY SCHECK: And I
urge you to read it.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:49.630
And it's not-- there
are lots of people

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:52.600
that may believe in capital
punishment for the most

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.700
heinous crimes.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:58.870
And that's not necessarily
a morally bankrupt position

00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:59.860
to take.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.480
Reasonable people
can differ about it,

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.480
although the death
penalty I don't think you

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.020
can take a reasonable position
in favor of the death penalty

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.920
as it exists today, in
terms of the race effects,

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.640
in terms of our inability
to get it right.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.050
The innocence movement has
certainly demonstrated it.

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:22.600
But what makes the Central
Park Five case so important

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.690
to study and to understand--

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:29.320
when you look at this ad
and you look at the things

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:33.820
that Donald Trump
citizen said then,

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.670
he wasn't a pariah for
saying these things.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.950
And soon thereafter,
when you look

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:42.010
at the history of criminal
justice in this country,

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:46.060
we had laws that created
mandatory minimum sentences.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.480
We had laws that were passed
in Congress that cut back

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.780
on federal habeas corpus.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.090
We had a whole shift.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:58.660
Even in the years when
crime began going down,

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.310
we had all these
measures from which

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:03.341
we are all trying to recover.

00:43:03.341 --> 00:43:04.840
And I really do
believe that there's

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.430
an alliance between
conservatives and progressives

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:12.610
to bring about criminal
justice reform.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:16.240
But you will not understand
the roots of resistance

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.320
to this unless you look at
the Central Park Five case

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.790
and tie it right back to all
the problems we're suffering

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:30.550
and we see vividly in regard to
the controversies arising out

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:31.980
of Charlottesville.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.740
So I'm so thankful,
Kevin, that you're here

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.250
today to answer any questions.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:41.110
I'll certainly do my best.

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:45.940
We ask you to join in the
innocence movement, both here

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.740
and across the world.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.980
The people here at
Google and the people

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.020
that will be
watching this online,

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.020
obviously go to the website
of the Innocence Project

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.190
and other organizations.

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:58.090
Give generously.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:03.310
But more to the point, give
some thought to all the things

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.300
that we're trying to do in
science, forensic science,

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.870
in cognitive science,
in reforms that we

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:13.460
can bring to this country.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.360
We've been able to
accomplish a lot.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.580
And the good thing about
the innocence movement,

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:23.800
I hope you all realize, that
every time an innocent person

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.410
is convicted, as
happened to Kevin

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:29.470
and his colleagues,
the person who's

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.410
really committed the crime,
in this case, Matias Reyes,

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:37.370
goes out and can commit
at large another crime.

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:41.650
And so this movement is about
finding out what's wrong,

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.570
correcting errors,
and fixing it, which

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.840
is very hard in all
kinds of institutions,

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.720
and enhancing the capability
of law enforcement

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.720
and the court system and all
the stakeholders to make sure

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.610
we don't convict
the innocent, but we

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:58.300
do apprehend those who
really did commit the crime.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.290
Thank you very much.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:02.224
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.210
And so I guess you can all
line up and ask questions.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:09.290
Thank you.

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
everything, both of you.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.790
I was wondering if you
could speak briefly

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:19.850
about the standards
of evidence on paper

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.760
needing to be overwhelming
to convict someone.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.980
To get a conviction
thrown out, do

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.520
you just need to establish
a reasonable doubt?

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:32.150
Or are the standards equally
high, or is it even harder

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:34.640
to get something
overturned than it is

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.595
to get the original conviction?

00:45:36.595 --> 00:45:38.470
BARRY SCHECK: It's very
hard to get something

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.580
overturned in most states--

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.250
I think, in actually just
about every state right now.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.720
And it wasn't always true.

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:52.810
There are statutes that
say that a state must

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:57.790
have a mechanism whereby
new evidence of innocence

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:01.600
can be brought forward so that
a conviction can be vacated.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:06.850
In most states, the standard
is a reasonable probability

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:08.560
of a different outcome.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.560
The problem when you talk
about newly discovered evidence

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:15.730
like that is they define newly
discovered evidence as evidence

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:19.020
that couldn't have been
found with the exercise

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.210
of due diligence by
the defense lawyer.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:26.200
So there's plenty of stuff
that lawyers don't find.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.260
We won't go on at any
great length about it,

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:32.720
but Kevin's lawyer was
not up to the task.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.570
And in the middle
of the trial, they

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.370
substituted in a new lawyer.

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:38.050
All right.

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:40.880
This case would have been
hard under any circumstances,

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.700
but when you go
back and look at it,

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:46.130
there was plenty of information,
particularly the time

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:47.980
line, that raised doubts.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.950
Even some jurors in this
case held out for a while,

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:53.230
because they said,
wow, not withstanding

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.810
the publicity and the
terrible way this looks,

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:57.950
we see problems in this case.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:00.820
So reasonable probability
of a different outcome

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.110
is usually the standard.

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.870
In some states, it's clear
and convincing evidence

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:05.980
of innocence.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.410
But the problem that we've
had in the United States

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:11.770
is that after a certain
number of years, sometimes

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.540
you can't get back into court.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.000
It is very, very, very hard.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.030
And also, if you want to
claim ineffective assistance

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.630
of counsel--

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:23.920
and this is something that
is very, very troubling--

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.750
the standard for
ineffective assistance

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:28.360
of counsel, Peter
Neufeld and I sometimes

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.820
say jokingly and our
colleagues in the movement,

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.010
if you put a mirror under
the nose of the lawyer

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:36.670
and it fogs up, that's an
effective lawyer, right?

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:39.940
It's very, very hard to reverse
convictions on that ground.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.640
And one of the reasons
is that they say, well,

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.960
the standard is--

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.420
what are the likely
errors and omissions

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:52.210
of lawyers in a community
like you're practicing.

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.400
And that is defined as too low.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.170
There should be a
national objective

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:59.050
norm of what constitutes
effective assistance

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.230
of counsel.

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:03.460
There are jurisdictions all
across this country where

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.170
you show up the
first time in court,

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:07.060
there's no lawyers there, right?

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.150
People plead guilty
all the time.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:13.480
We have many, many
great public defenders.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:18.790
But in general, in terms of
all criminal justice reform,

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:24.520
in my opinion, the least
effective reform movement

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.270
now is getting
funds to represent

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.010
people charged with crimes.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.230
And it is really the
key, because if we

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:34.330
want to deal with
mass incarceration,

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:37.930
and you want to have a way to
get people who are mentally

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:40.420
ill out of this system, people
who have substance abuse

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:44.440
problems out of the system,
people that have family

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.190
violence problems
out of the system

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:49.570
and effectively treated,
to know who should get bail

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:52.750
and who shouldn't, to
have a fair sentencing,

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:54.520
it's got to be individualized.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.920
How can that really
be done unless you

00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:00.580
have defense lawyers that
know not just the defendant,

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.920
but the whole family?

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.220
That knew Kevin was raised
by women, that his mother was

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:10.030
from Richmond, that knew the
whole family context, that

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:11.210
knew everything.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:12.730
You don't have that
in this country,

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:16.960
because we don't give
money sufficiently to those

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.360
who are representing the poor.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.030
And a lot of it has to do
with structural racism,

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:25.480
but we need a Marshall
Plan for indigent defense

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.390
in this country.

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:29.320
That's what we need, and we
need to have it working together

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.250
with all the stakeholders.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:36.460
So even if I told you we could
change the legal standard,

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.170
we'd still need
lawyers to get it done.

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:41.630
I guess over there.

00:49:44.288 --> 00:49:45.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.330
Thank you, Kevin and
Barry, both for being here.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.200
So I wanted to say,
first of all, Kevin,

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.630
I'm so sorry for what
you went through.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:58.020
And I appreciate you being
here to speak for what happened

00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.670
and to speak and to talk to us.

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:01.987
KEVIN RICHARDSON: Thank you.

00:50:01.987 --> 00:50:03.570
AUDIENCE: I was here
a couple of years

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.690
ago when "Central Park
Five"-- when Sarah

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:08.760
came in and showed that for us.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.616
And I saw the movie again.

00:50:10.616 --> 00:50:12.240
And I wanted to ask
you in particular--

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.930
I remember in that movie
when she interviewed

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:16.560
the journalist Jim Dwyer.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.220
And he talked about that he
felt badly, that at the time,

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.430
he just kind of believed it,
that everybody kind of believed

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:26.150
it, that he didn't think
a little harder about it

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:29.640
and interrogate what the
story that was being told.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.390
And I'm curious to
know, Kevin, when

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:38.865
you hear the news today, things
that are happening today,

00:50:38.865 --> 00:50:40.490
is there anything
that you see that you

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:45.500
think that doesn't seem right?

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.800
I don't believe that
from my experience.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:53.570
Is there something, a story
that people are being told today

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:56.690
that isn't quite right, that
people are buying and believing

00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:01.262
now, but it's not quite right?

00:51:01.262 --> 00:51:02.220
KEVIN RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:06.070
Well, personally, I guess,
from what I've been through,

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:08.800
when I do see
things on the news,

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:12.420
I take a step back and
actually analyze the situation,

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:16.950
because you can't
rush to judgment fast.

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:20.560
And you have to use a
little logic actually.

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.470
And especially now, these
days, with so many things

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.980
happening in this
world, whether it's

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:31.100
disasters or things
that's happening,

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:33.970
it's unbelievable to see.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:38.230
And speaking of like Jim
Dwyer, during that time,

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:39.940
there was many
reporters or people

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:42.220
that maybe felt the same way.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.790
But during that time,
everybody-- not everybody--

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:48.070
there was many that
was on our side,

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:52.210
but there was others that swayed
the other way, because they

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:54.880
probably didn't want to be
that one person that stand out

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.050
and stand up for us.

00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:01.240
Like, for instance, when
Sarah Burns, when we actually

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.635
first met her, myself and
Raymond Santana met Sarah--

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.770
when '89 happened,
she was six years old,

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.860
so she didn't even
know anything about it.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:15.940
So she just wanted to find
out more about our case.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.950
And long story short, she
worked for a lawyer of mine,

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:20.780
and she was an intern.

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.420
And we met her.

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.010
And myself, I was,
when I met her,

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.440
I was, like, who is
this young lady that--

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.850
she's younger than me.

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:31.400
But she really did her research,
and she was very passionate

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.680
about it, because she
wanted to make a difference.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:39.700
So if we had one person, like
Sarah, that would stand for it,

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.000
we'll be better today.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.140
Of course, if we had more people
like the Innocence Project,

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.160
we will be better.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:49.910
And I'm glad that we trying
to make some kind of reform

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:51.561
to make things better like that.

00:52:51.561 --> 00:52:53.060
BARRY SCHECK: I
should add something

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:54.260
about good journalism.

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:01.340
And I told Kevin this
story just the other day.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:06.740
When we were working with
Nancy Ryan and Peter Casolaro

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.570
reviewing the case,
it's very hard

00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:10.390
to read these
transcripts very quickly.

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:14.720
So we picked up a book by a
journalist named Tim Sullivan

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.520
who worked for Court TV.

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.440
And he was covering the case.

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:22.170
And I'm reading this book,
and I'm going, oh my god.

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:24.470
He's accurately
reciting everything

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:26.510
that happened in this trial.

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:28.100
It's a very easy read.

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.860
He notes all the different
contradictions, makes

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.770
it look like a closed
case, explains why

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:35.900
the juror had all these doubts.

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:40.130
So after that seven
month secret period,

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:43.850
right, but before the
announcement was made in court,

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:45.920
I went to see him,
because Court TV had

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.850
those offices on Third Avenue
and like 40 something street.

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:52.820
I took him across the street
to this bar called Docks--

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.890
I think it's still there--

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:58.340
and sat him down, and I
said, I'm buying your whisky.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.180
I looked at him and I
said, they're all innocent.

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:06.470
And he's looking at me, and
he just couldn't believe it.

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:09.110
And of course, eventually he
did, and he understood it.

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:12.050
But what was great about it,
is you could go back and find

00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:15.200
a document where somebody
just looking objectively

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.380
at the evidence
contemporaneously

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:21.170
was able to highlight
all the problems.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:24.770
Because if you just watch
the news, you'd think this

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:26.360
was an open and shut case.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.730
Oh my god, they've
got these confessions.

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:31.310
Now, of course, by the time
they turn on the cameras,

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:32.810
people have been
told what to say,

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:35.487
taken to the scene of the
crime, all kinds of things.

00:54:35.487 --> 00:54:37.070
And of course, they
showed no remorse.

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:40.490
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:42.360
Thank you both for being here.

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.540
My sister-in-law works
for the Innocence Project,

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.970
and she's in the process
of applying to law school,

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:50.300
so she can continue her passion.

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.067
BARRY SCHECK: Good.

00:54:52.067 --> 00:54:53.900
AUDIENCE: So my question
is sort of similar,

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.840
but you shared
this advertisement,

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.550
and there was a headline that
you shared of a newspaper.

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:03.590
And so I was just curious your
perspective on 30 years later,

00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:05.360
the media landscape has changed.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:10.340
And in theory, we are
able to see, get access

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.500
to more information.

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.180
Sometimes people are even
posting videos of things

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:18.080
that they've observed
online, that they've seen

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:19.340
from the scene of the crime.

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.830
And do you think
that helps or hurts?

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:24.680
And are things getting
better or worse?

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.740
What is the role of
the media companies

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:30.509
in sort of helping to
mitigate some of these issues

00:55:30.509 --> 00:55:31.550
that you guys brought up?

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:34.400
If you have a perspective,
I'd love to hear it.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:38.060
KEVIN RICHARDSON: Well,
I think it helps now,

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:41.150
because people are more aware.

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:45.610
And thank god for
internet and media,

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:48.150
because people really
want to know the truth.

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:53.280
And situation that's happening
now, far as police brutality,

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.120
you see it.

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.080
People are filming it.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.460
It's online.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.060
You Google it, you check it out.

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.500
And so I think it helps
out, because people just

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.370
want to be--

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.990
want to know for
themselves what happened.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:11.294
As far as now
videotape is being--

00:56:11.294 --> 00:56:12.710
you could see it,
the footage now.

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:14.750
Because in my case,
you didn't see

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:17.330
anything that was happening
behind closed doors.

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:20.020
So now you see that, now
you can see what's going on.

00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:21.740
And maybe it'll be
a little change.

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:24.009
So I think it helps actually.

00:56:24.009 --> 00:56:25.550
BARRY SCHECK: Well,
it's complicated,

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:27.340
as you know, here with Google.

00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:34.760
As Kevin said, there is
so much more information

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.250
out that you can
get quickly, right?

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:39.050
You can get transcripts.

00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:42.410
You can go online
and look at decisions

00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:45.174
and look up people and look
at their Facebook pages

00:56:45.174 --> 00:56:47.465
and the social media and get
some much more information

00:56:47.465 --> 00:56:50.060
than you ever could before.

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:54.570
And there are increasingly
websites that,

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:58.100
on criminal justice
issues, are terrific,

00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.360
like the Marshall Project.

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.860
I highly recommend that.

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.150
Those of us in the criminal
justice reform movement,

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:05.900
we get up in the morning, we
look at the Marshall Project.

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:08.300
But what I want to
commend to your attention

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.730
about the Marshall
Project is the person

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:13.120
who really started it
is Bill Keller, who

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.320
was an editor of
"The New York Times."

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.020
And all the people that are
involved in the Marshall

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:21.620
Project and other journalists
that they bring in

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:26.210
to write articles,
they care about facts.

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:28.280
They care about what's truthful.

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.500
They'll be politically
incorrect when

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:34.010
it comes to looking at
solutions to the problems.

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:38.960
I think it's great that there
are all kinds of other websites

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:43.370
that can do this and
investigative teams

00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:46.460
like the people at ProPublica.

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:49.370
It's a heyday now
for publications,

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:52.640
like "The Atlantic" have
been terrific and of course,

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.890
"The New Yorker"
and others that will

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:58.520
do deep dives and
investigative reports.

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:02.480
But what's so important
now is that we have

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.570
to stop being so tribalized.

00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:10.400
You really have to search
the web and look for facts.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.100
And I'm hopeful-- we
don't have it now,

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:16.280
but I'm hopeful that
what will happen

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:21.242
is that we will begin to
get authoritative voices,

00:58:21.242 --> 00:58:23.450
whether they're on the left
or the right or anywhere,

00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:28.550
where you will have some
assurance that what I'm seeing

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:33.410
online here so quickly has
actually been fact checked,

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:36.870
that responsible people
are doing the research,

00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:40.820
so we'll get some confidence
in the truth of what's

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.350
being reported.

00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:45.470
These democratic
rights that we have--

00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:48.470
the presumption of innocence,
trial by jury, proof

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:51.560
beyond a reasonable doubt--

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.020
you think these
things are just going

00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:57.440
to be here forever and work.

00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.970
Wake up.

00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:02.420
Unless you fight
for them, people

00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:05.390
will say, well, be scared.

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:06.800
Let's go punish them.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.810
I didn't make this up.

00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:11.670
Go look at that ad
that President Trump,

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:13.160
when he was a citizen, raised.

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:14.826
I mean, this is what
he really believed,

00:59:14.826 --> 00:59:18.710
and he wasn't run out of
town because he said it.

00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:22.370
And I wish he would really
give it more thought.

00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:24.410
Nobody should be
considered hopeless

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:29.169
in this kind of enterprise,
but if you want a democracy,

00:59:29.169 --> 00:59:30.710
you're going to have
to fight for it.

00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:33.510
If you want a fair
criminal justice system,

00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:35.390
you're going to have
to fight for it,

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:39.830
because it is really imperiled
and under attack in many ways

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:41.490
today.

00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:45.230
On the other hand, I'm
extremely optimistic myself

00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:50.630
that people such as yourselves
will look at this history,

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:56.510
learn the lessons, bring to
bear real science, real science,

00:59:56.510 --> 01:00:03.050
in looking at how this system
can work and will protect

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:07.220
the innocent and try our
very best to convict only

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.788
those who committed the crimes.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.200
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much
for having this event

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.770
and speaking here.

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:23.780
I have a kind of
obvious question,

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.090
which I can appreciate
as probably very

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:27.890
difficult to answer.

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.885
But is there any
research done to estimate

01:00:30.885 --> 01:00:32.510
the number of people
that are currently

01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:35.200
incarcerated that are innocent?

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.049
How many are there?

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.840
BARRY SCHECK: Yeah.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.950
That's a great question,
and people ask all the time,

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:42.980
how many innocent
people are in jail?

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:47.900
And the answer to that is,
well, if I knew, I'd tell you.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.410
We have huge backlogs at the
Innocence Project and innocence

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:54.260
organizations across the
country of people claiming

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:59.040
to be innocent that we're trying
to help all of our colleagues

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.380
and look at.

01:01:04.876 --> 01:01:08.730
A very good study
was done by Sam gross

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:12.270
from the University
of Michigan Law School

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:14.580
and I think Barbara O'Brien
from Michigan State that

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:18.630
was published in the "National
Academy of Science Journal."

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:21.180
Because in order to get a
handle on this question,

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:23.880
you have to compare
apples to apples.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.740
And I can tell
from your question

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:28.380
that you understand the
difficulties of this.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.470
And we do have a class of
cases that we can look at.

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:34.230
And that is capital
cases, because we

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:35.850
have more data on those.

01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:37.740
We have more
transcripts, more of them

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:40.830
gone through the court system.

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:44.430
And then frankly, even though
capital representation isn't

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:46.650
as good over the years
as it should have been,

01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:49.520
it is better ordinarily--
or more resources

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.270
are devoted to it,
let's put it that way--

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:52.950
than the average case.

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:54.720
And what they've
been able to estimate

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.260
is that the error
rate is at least 4%.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.670
And they were comparing capital
cases over a period of time,

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:04.950
where they could look at
real evidence of innocence,

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:07.258
compared to other cases.

01:02:07.258 --> 01:02:08.650
AUDIENCE: That's so high.

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:08.950
BARRY SCHECK: What?

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:10.350
AUDIENCE: That's
really, really high.

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:12.150
BARRY SCHECK: Well,
that is absolutely--

01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:15.090
you're quite correct in
say-- the questioner said

01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:15.930
that's so high.

01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:19.300
And of course, it's high when
you consider that we have,

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.410
what, something like that
more than two million people

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:25.230
incarcerated in
the United States,

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.180
more per capita than
just about anywhere.

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:29.910
And then you look at a
lot of these place states,

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:33.510
like Louisiana,
which has the highest

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:37.200
per capita incarceration
plate of any jurisdiction

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.450
on the planet.

01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:42.270
And that's one reason we get
all these innocent people out

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.602
in Louisiana.

01:02:44.602 --> 01:02:45.810
There's plenty of them there.

01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:47.970
So the rate is very high.

01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:52.980
There's other data that is
very suggestive about this.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.510
When we first began doing
DNA testing, starting in 1989

01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:01.350
and moving forward,
and the FBI was

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:03.780
one of the few
public agencies that

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.680
would do it for state and
local law enforcement for free,

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.230
they were finding
consistently when they

01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:14.010
had a suspect in a case, right?

01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:18.030
Which in theory meant that
there was some probable cause

01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:21.210
or reasonable basis for picking
somebody up, arresting them,

01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:23.460
charging them, and then
they would move forward

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.200
with the DNA testing--

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.970
that one third of the
time, the primary suspect

01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:32.470
was excluded by the DNA testing.

01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:38.550
So that is very, very
suggestive that the rate

01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:40.530
of innocent people
being convicted

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:43.210
is much higher than
any of us ever thought.

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.400
And that is the truth.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.300
I think that the one thing
you'll find from our colleagues

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:53.220
in the prosecution, we
get a lot of support

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.020
from the International
Association

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.940
of Chiefs of Police,
from policing people

01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:00.630
all across the country, because
police officers, when they

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.492
go into it, they
didn't get into it

01:04:02.492 --> 01:04:04.200
and risking their
lives because they want

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.880
to lock up the wrong person.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.360
They want to lock up the right
person and protect the public.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.140
| we need to make
that job easier.

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:16.860
We need to bring more
science to bear on this.

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.860
We need to change
those institutions,

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.150
so we can get better at it.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:24.000
It's a very difficult
and imperfect enterprise.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.180
And we have to constantly
be improving the system.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:31.590
But there is no doubt-- that's
what DNA and the innocence

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:36.000
movement proved, I think, to
everybody's satisfaction among

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.390
stakeholders in the
criminal court system--

01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:43.900
that there are far more innocent
people than anybody ever,

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:46.290
ever, ever suspected.

01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:49.410
And we are still at the
beginning of this process.

01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:51.690
I mean, when we started
this 25 years ago,

01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:55.170
this is our 25th anniversary
of the Innocence Project.

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:59.520
And you'll see "Time Magazine"
did a whole issue that you

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.800
can find on this
on the newsstands

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.000
right now, because it is
an important historical

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.420
and cultural and
political development

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.550
to see an innocence movement.

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:15.030
Everybody thought that
as more DNA testing

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:17.580
was done at the
beginning of the case,

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.560
right, that we'd all
go out of business.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.970
Well, the answer is, we have
more exonerations, which

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:28.720
look at the National Registry
numbers, than ever before.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.990
And the DNA has
remained constant

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:34.230
in terms of the
number of old cases.

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:37.950
And even some new ones, where
the DNA wasn't done right,

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:40.470
we've been able to
exonerate people.

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:45.750
But we now know more
about how innocent people

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:51.990
get convicted and get better at
trying to correct these errors.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:53.770
So that's a very--

01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:55.790
you're right it's a
complicated question.

01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:58.820
If you put a gun to my head and
said, what's the error rate,

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:02.840
I'll go with the article in
"The National Academy of Science

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:03.950
journal," at least 4%.

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:06.217
AUDIENCE: So that's
like 100,000 people.

01:06:06.217 --> 01:06:07.800
BARRY SCHECK: Oh,
it's more than that.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.910
And in truth, I mean, guessing.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:12.770
But we don't like to guess.

01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:14.540
We like to bring
all the data that we

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:16.460
can to bear on the problem.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.200
So I think that's it.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.344
And we thank you
very, very much.

01:06:23.344 --> 01:06:26.592
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:28.448 --> 01:06:30.660
And hope for your support.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:34.440
Anyone in the innocence
movement, go online--

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.720
innocenceproject.org,
Innocent Network,

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:41.660
