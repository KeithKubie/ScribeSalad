00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
[TYPEWRITER]

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.910
Hi, I'm Kristin George.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.060
And I head up product
at TuneIn.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.290
We have 40 million monthly
active users from

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.460
all over the world.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.630
And TuneIn brings you the world
of live radio to your

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.670
smartphone.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.620
So we're here today to talk
about the Android product and

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.820
why we're so excited about our
fastest growing platform.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.160
Over the last two years, we've
been working on increasing our

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.400
overall retention of our
Android product.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.450
In our first version of our app,
we focused on UI elements

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.670
that we thought would
communicate to users how to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.960
move from screen to screen, or
navigate between tabs, and use

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.800
a mini player.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.120
So we had our own way
of doing this.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.530
And it really was this big
bar across the screen.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.980
And it said swipe here.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.430
And we thought that this UI
element was going to be

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.630
extremely successful.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.480
And what we found is people
just weren't seeing it.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.480
So we moved over to a Google
UI element that really is

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.530
being used in places like
The Play Store.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.840
And so at first, we didn't think
that this UI element was

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.710
as prominent.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.710
And what we found was--

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.610
when we released it and tested
it on our listeners--

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.820
we found that it was actually
much more successful than the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.420
feature that we had in place.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.010
And as a result, people were
discovering a new great

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.680
content that they wanted
to listen to.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.790
So it ended up moving our most
important engagement metric,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.040
which is listening hours.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.330
And then as a result, people
were finding really great

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.420
content that they wanted to
listen to on our platform.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.120
And they were finding more
reasons to come back and

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.005
listen to TuneIn.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:50.860
What we found was by
implementing fragments, Google

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.370
is helping us handle all these
different device sizes and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.910
resolutions, so that we were
creating a really great user

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.640
experience on different
platforms.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.270
And so I'm going to show off a
little bit about fragments.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.270
If I come in here, you can see
that there are three different

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.240
fragments on the browsing
side of this screen.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.100
So the first is here.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.510
The second is here.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.550
And then the third is as you
choose a particular genre of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.350
music to consume.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.740
There's another fragment
over here on the side.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.200
And so you'll see this with
our little mini player.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.890
And this fragment moves from the
side of the screen during

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.420
a tablet UI to the bottom of the
screen during a phone UI.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.150
And what we did is we invested
once, and then Google is

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.850
helping us--

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.780
through this process--

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.950
conform to all the different
types of screen

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.460
sizes that they have.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.110
We decided to make a very
content-first screen.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.410
So a user can come in here and
they can say, these are all my

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.630
favorites as far as genres.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.500
And then we can show them
the world of live

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.300
content as it happens.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.280
So this is our very content-rich
experience that's

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.360
made for tablets.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.750
I always shipping a new
app every two and a

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.750
half to three months.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.410
So what that gives us the
ability to do is lean in to

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.690
the new features that Google
puts out into their releases.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.930
So an example of this is
rich notifications.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.650
And you'll see that we made it
really easy for people to

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.020
favorite stations and songs
that they like, stop, and

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.070
play, and then also discover
new content

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.130
with our Jump button.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.430
So you'll see that we have a
full, rich notification, and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.830
our users, as a result, feel
like we're constantly

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.540
improving our app, and making
them feel like we're paying

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.940
attention to them, and
that we're always

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.830
building new things.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.120
So I'm looking forward
to continuing

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.680
to improve our product.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.920
Always reaching for
higher retention.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.880
And I really appreciate
your time.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.130
So thanks for listening.
