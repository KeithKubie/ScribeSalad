00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.670
PROFESSOR: OK, so this takes us
into the paper by Heitler

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.030
and London, where, by using
the concept of linear

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.410
combination of atomic orbitals
into molecular orbitals for a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.660
large number of atoms, instead
of splitting one plus one

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.690
atoms, making a bond into two
energy levels of bonding and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.430
AN antibonding, we take a large
number of atoms, bring

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.640
them together, and we get a
large number of bonding

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.370
orbitals and a large number
of antibonding orbitals.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.410
And they have to lie within a
zone of about 5 to 10 electron

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.840
volts, which means if you put
Avogadro's number of these

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.550
things together, you're going
to end up with an energy

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.950
difference between successive
energy levels on the order of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.530
about 10 to the minus 20
electron volts, or 10 to the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.890
minus 40 joules.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.610
And for all intents and
purposes, that is a continuum,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.730
and hence, the term band.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.040
And now we start populating this
with electrons, and each

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.050
one of these is a
separate state.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.110
And electrons go in two by two,
just like Noah's Ark, all

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.950
the way up-- either halfway
up or all the way up.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.820
But now the energy difference
is very, very tiny.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.240
And a second instance, we looked
at insulators where--

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.950
for example, in diamond--

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.070
where the bonds are
really strong.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.890
So that means if the atomic
orbital is roughly at the

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.550
middle here, the depression to
make the bonding orbital is

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.870
very, very great, and
very negative.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.330
And therefore, the elevation to
the antibonding orbital is

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.300
great and relatively positive.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.650
And when we start putting
Avogadro's number of these

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.980
things together, we still
end up with the 10 to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.440
the minus 40 joules.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.590
But when we get to the top of
the bonding orbitals, we have

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.990
still got 3 or 5 or 5 electron
volts to get to the bottom of

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.600
the antibonding orbitals, hence
the formation of the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.700
band gap with an energy of--

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.420
as I mentioned.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.110
So up here, we have the
conduction band where

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.950
electrons are free
to move about.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.060
And this is derived from the
antibonding orbitals.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.130
And down here, we have the
valence band, which consists

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.720
of the bonding orbitals derived
from sigma and pi.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.160
And then the semiconductor is
sort of like an insulator--

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.820
as they say in California, it's
like an insulator-- but

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.140
the band gap isn't
quite so severe.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.560
It's down on the order of 1 to
3 electron volts, and that

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.300
gives it unique properties.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.760
Why?

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.590
What's magical about 1
to 3 electron volts?

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.410
Number one, visible light.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.980
Visible light is 2 to
3 electron volts.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.790
So visible light shines right
through an insulator, because

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.510
visible light has an energy of
about 2 to 3 electron volts.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.390
If that's the energy of 2 to 3
electron volts, and this is 6,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.540
it zooms right through.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.200
But if it's 2 electron volts and
this is 1 electron volt,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.390
we're going to get thermal
excitation.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.760
I know Professor Ballinger
talked about thermal

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.270
excitation the last day and what
happens, and it's very

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.220
reminiscent of excitation in
the case of the Bohr model.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.680
Photoexcitation across
the band gap.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.940
Incident photon with energy
greater than the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.220
energy of the band gap.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.100
And it's the same drill
as you've seen before.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.260
That's why those early
lessons on--

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.410
photon comes in or electron
comes in, strikes the Bohr

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.390
atom, electron rises up,
momentarily sits there, falls

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.440
back down, photon emitted.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.060
It's the same set of ideas.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.470
Only instead of moving from n
equals 1 to n equals 2 in the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.150
Bohr atom, you're moving from
the valence band to the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.810
conduction band, sitting
in the conduction band

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.170
momentarily, you fall back
down, and you get a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.990
photoemission.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.320
So that was covered last day.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.590
And I know towards the end of
the lesson, he started talking

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.750
about thermal excitation.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.560
So let's look at that in
a little more detail.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.090
Thermal excitation.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.370
So thermal excitation of what?

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:30.670
Thermal excitation of electrons
across the band gap.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.400
So this is matter energy
interaction, only in this

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.360
case, it's thermally inspired.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.590
So let's draw our
cartoon again.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.890
Up here, we have the conduction
band, and below we

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.880
have the valence band.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.200
So in the conduction band
we have free electrons.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.180
In the valence band is where
all the bonds live.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.470
And we've got an energy gap
here of some value.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.270
Could be semiconductor,
could be insulator.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.720
In this case, we're going
to use visible light.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.580
And we've gone through the
analysis with incident photon

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.270
and the emission.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.060
In this case, I want to look
at thermal excitation.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.860
So with thermal excitation, I
start with an electron down

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.360
here in a bond.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.480
This electron lives in a bond.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.790
And with thermal excitation, the
electron jumps out of the

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.160
bond and up into the
conduction band.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.050
So I'm going to designate the
electron in the conduction

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.210
band with an e minus and
a circle around it.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.880
And it leaves behind
a broken bond.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.630
As you know, every bond has
two electrons in it.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.080
Well, one of the electrons left
the bond, leaving a hole.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.480
Little h with a plus sign.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.560
This is a broken bond, and a
broken bond is highly unstable

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.870
and very mobile.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.130
If I put a potential
across here.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.070
If I put this material-- and I'm
doing a mixed metaphor--

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.090
this is an energy
level diagram.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.780
But now I'm going to put a
couple of plates across an

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.855
energy level diagram.

00:05:58.855 --> 00:06:00.020
But you're smart.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.020
You can understand this.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.240
So this is not energy.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.070
Now I'm going to make the right
electrode negative and

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.540
I'm going to make the left
electrode positive.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.650
What would happen?

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.380
Well, the electrons in the
conduction band are going to

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.150
be attracted to the positive
electrode or repelled by the

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.300
negative electrode, but the
complementary situation occurs

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.600
in the valence band.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.100
This broken bond is like a
hot potato, and it has an

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.970
effective charge.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.290
This is a zero in a
land of minus one.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.370
A broken bond is a zero in
a land of minus one.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.000
So therefore, if I make the
right side negative, this hole

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.350
is going to be drawn.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.340
So I have two forms of
electronic conduction.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.660
I have electrons moving to the
left in the conduction band

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.150
and I have holes moving to the
right in the valence band.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.600
So for every thermal excitation
I get two carriers.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:03.200
Every excitation of electron
from valence band to

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.880
conduction band generates
two carriers.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.830
Carriers of what?

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.920
Water?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.680
Carriers of electrical charge.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.600
Two carriers of electrical
charge.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.680
And what are they?

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.810
The electron in the conduction
band and the hole--

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.730
little h with a plus sign--

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.790
in the valence band.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.330
So that's how thermal
excitation works.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.410
And you can see that the numbers
have to be equal.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.590
So we write, therefore, that
the populations are equal.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.180
The number of electrons in the
conduction band equals the

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.860
number of holes in
the valence band.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:52.340
Now electrical engineers have a
similar expression, but they

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.470
don't care about numbers and
electrons and holes, they care

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.210
about the functionality.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.380
And the electron is a carrier
of negative charge and the

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.070
hole is a carrier of
positive charge.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.040
So the electrical engineering
books will write, thermal

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:15.410
excitation gives rise
to pair generation.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.070
Pair of what?

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.720
Pair of charge carriers.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.400
And the population of negative
charge carriers equals the

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.310
population of positive charge
carriers, which in chemistry

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.030
is the number of electrons
equals the number of holes, or

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.070
the number of broken bonds.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:36.020
So that's the way it works, but
there's a conundrum here.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.200
Thermal excitation is based upon
the thermal energy, and

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.430
we know that the average
thermal energy in an

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.220
environment is roughly given--

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.720
I mean there are fancier
calculations--

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.240
but to a first order, I can
approximate it as the product

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.130
of the Boltzmann constant and
absolute temperature.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.850
So at room temperature--

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.450
room temperature, I like to
say, about 300 Kelvin.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.620
300 Kelvin is 27 Celsius.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.575
That's kind of a warm room,
but 300 is a nice number.

00:09:09.575 --> 00:09:10.440
All right?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.900
So if you take 300 Kelvin, you
get on the order of about 1/40

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.520
of an electron volt.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.190
1/40 of an electron volt, which
is a lot less than one

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.820
electron volt, which is roughly
the band gap of a

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.550
semiconductor.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.920
So how is it that we get any
thermal excitation of data

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.940
indicate that there is some
thermal excitation even at

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.870
room temperature?

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.620
So the question is, if the
average thermal energy is a

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.410
fortieth of electron volt
according to this-- and this

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.550
is correct--

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.030
and the band gap is one eV, then
it should be no thermal

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.780
excitation.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.160
But we know what happens.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.210
So, one eV, which I'm
going to say is Eg.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.120
All right?

00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:02.900
So how do we get any thermal
excitation under these

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.460
conditions?

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.470
So there's an answer to this.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.410
And for this we go to merry old
England and James Clerk

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:18.810
Maxwell, that you know or will
come to know in 8.02 as the

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.480
annunciator of Maxwell's
equations of

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.800
electricity and magnetism.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.530
He also thought about physical
chemistry, and in particular

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.350
he thought about the physical
chemistry of gases.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.100
And what did he teach
us about gases?

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.310
He said, if you look here in
this room, you see nitrogen

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.420
and oxygen and all the other
constituents of air.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.530
But to a first approximation,
we have four parts nitrogen,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:42.950
one part oxygen.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.430
The room is roughly
300 Kelvin.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:51.340
What Maxwell taught us is that
velocities of the gas species

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.720
zooming around in this room
are not all equal.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.100
Some of the gas species are
moving around as though

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.350
they're at 500 Kelvin.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.860
And some of them are moving
around very slowly as though

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.650
they're at 100 Kelvin.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.440
On average, it's 300 Kelvin,
because we can

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.060
feel it as 300 Kelvin.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.970
But some of them are
zooming around.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.945
Some are really lazy and they're
just moving along

00:11:13.945 --> 00:11:15.340
really slowly.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.950
And furthermore, he was
quantitative about it.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.020
He said, I'm going to tell you
what the distribution of

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.850
energies is.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.510
So let's get that on the
board for starters.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:38.290
That in any ensemble of gas
species, could be gas atoms or

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.870
it could be gas molecules or gas
compounds, in any ensemble

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:49.610
of gas species, that
all molecules--

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:54.560
because you can always say the
atom is a degenerate form--

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:02.465
all molecules do not have
the same velocity.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.000
And furthermore, he gave
us the distribution.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.480
He calculated the distribution
of velocities.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.340
So that was about 1859.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.100
Forgive me here.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.350
Velocities.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.340
OK.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:35.990
And then Boltzmann came
along in 1872.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.480
And Boltzmann generalized
this idea.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.870
He made the link between gas
velocity and temperature.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.120
So, he took the idea and he
said, if the gas molecules

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.300
move at different velocities,
that means they

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.920
have different energies.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.600
And why do we call this the
Boltzmann constant?

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.730
Because Boltzmann made the link
between particle energy

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:57.850
and temperature.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.140
So he said there's a variation
of instant temperature.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.200
All right?

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:13.700
So Boltzmann generalized
Maxwell's idea to energy and

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.360
then ultimately temperature.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.430
And so I'm going to show you,
instead of the Maxwell

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.440
distribution, I'm going to give
you the Maxwell-Boltzmann

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.630
distribution.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.480
But before I do, I want to make
sure you understand the

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.510
math and appreciate what I'm
going to plot for you.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.790
So we just had a test, right?

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:38.560
In fact, we can go back
to the slide.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.400
All right.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.790
So what do we have here?

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:45.010
I could plot on this axis,
the abscissa, the grade--

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.200
g--

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.320
and on the ordinate, I'll plot
the number of people who have

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.730
any given grade--

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:52.700
n of g.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.520
Now the class av was
66, all right?

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.350
This is going to go
from 0 to 100.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.400
Now what we see here is-- and
by the way, I'm going to

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.150
normalize it.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.670
Instead of dealing with 463 or
whatever, I'm going to divide

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.100
by the total class.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.855
So the number is going
to go from 0 to 1.

00:14:10.855 --> 00:14:13.060
So this a normalized
distribution.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.450
What I'm teaching you applies
all through science.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.400
As I told you, this is the
most important class.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.100
Not because I'm teaching, but
because the subject matter is

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.160
general, just as
Boltzmann did.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.820
So let's look at the normalized
distribution.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.100
Now the class av was 66.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.910
Now we didn't have everybody
getting 66.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.560
That was not the distribution.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.160
That's one solution to the
problem, isn't it?

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.930
Instead, what we got
was we got that.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.280
Now one possibility
would be this one,

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.610
the bell-shaped curve.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.600
Goes like this.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.450
That's bell-shaped.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.230
This is Gaussian.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.240
This is a Gaussian distribution,
and its

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.410
functionality is y equals e to
the minus x minus x average,

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.670
quantity squared.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.570
Now, to have a normal
distribution, you have to have

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.560
a class of normal people, so
that didn't happen on this

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.320
test. That's a joke.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.500
God, you're so serious.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.380
Have you no fun in your lives?

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.580
Have you ever laughed?

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.550
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.460
PROFESSOR: Overachievers, you.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:21.860
OK.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.132
So we're not going to have
a Gaussian distribution.

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:25.560
We're going to have
that one there.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.830
It's kind of a skewed Gaussian
with a long tail.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.130
All right, so that's
the one thing.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:39.310
But what Boltzmann gave us,
instead of the number of atoms

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.780
of a given grade, he plotted
it as a function of energy.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.690
So instead, the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:49.070
has energy as the ordinate
instead of the grade, and up

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.890
here, the number of atoms--

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.530
or more importantly--

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.790
the atom fraction.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.660
The fraction of atoms
in the distribution

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.890
that have that energy.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.695
And it doesn't look like
a normal distribution.

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:04.810
It looks sort of off-normal.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:05.480
Skewed, like this.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.420
It rises to a peak and it
has a long tail that

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.450
moves off to the right.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.820
So this is the Maxwell-Boltzmann

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.500
distribution.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.960
It's not y equals x minus
x bar squared.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:29.730
So this is Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution of energies.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:35.010
And furthermore, what we see
here is that the area under

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.030
this line has to equal 1.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.710
If you integrate the fraction
from 0 to infinity, because

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:45.490
this asymptotically goes out
to infinity, the integral

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.040
under this line is 1.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.560
OK.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:53.570
Area equals 1, which is
the integral of ndE.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.830
Now, because of the asymmetry
here, clearly this is the

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.730
average energy.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.450
The average energy isn't
the maximum energy.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.860
Whereas in the Gaussian--

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.090
let's keep the Gaussian over
here, just for grins and

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.520
chuckles-- so the Gaussian
looks like this.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.650
It's symmetric.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:21.550
And this is the n of g max and
also a g average, whereas

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.610
here, the average is a little
bit to the right.

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.160
A little bit higher.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.160
OK.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.590
So now, if this is the
distribution, and this at room

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:37.810
temperature is 1/40 of an
electron volt, and way, way up

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:43.210
here is the band gap energy,
there's a tiny but non-zero

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.910
fraction of this distribution
that has energy in excess of

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.580
the band gap energy.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.930
And so this tiny fraction of the
total distribution has the

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.660
thermal energy to allow this
excitation and pair

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.300
generation to occur.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.842
And furthermore, this is a
function of temperature.

00:18:02.842 --> 00:18:04.510
This is a function
of temperature.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.365
So E average is related
to temperature.

00:18:08.365 --> 00:18:13.055
So, I'll say E average
1 at T1.

00:18:13.055 --> 00:18:15.210
And then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to heat this to a

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.330
higher temperature, so
I'll use red chalk to

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.740
indicate it's hotter.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.250
And what happens to the
distribution under an increase

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:23.110
in temperature?

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.780
Well, the average had better
move to the right, and that's

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.530
what happens.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.990
But it doesn't just move to the
right, it skews a little

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.360
bit and broadens.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.660
So in point of fact, at
a higher temperature,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.910
it looks like this.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:37.850
OK.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:44.930
So this is now E average
2 at T2 where T2 is

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.900
greater than T1.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.360
T2 is greater than T1.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.450
OK, so that's the
Maxwell-Boltzmann

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.320
distribution.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.330
But here's where the interesting
stuff occurs.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:19:00.790
So I'm going to blow up this
high energy end of the

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.040
distribution.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.040
So again, this is going
to be n of E

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.390
normalized, and this is E.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:13.360
And what we're going to find
here is that at T1--

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.930
this is the curve at T1, and
the area under the line is

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.370
shown here--

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.410
and then--

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.050
not to scale--

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.550
we're going to put
a break in this.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.550
And I'll show you how much
of a break is needed.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:35.960
And then, at T2 I'm going
to have this come down.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.450
This is T2.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:41.640
And the area under the
line T2 captures the

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.690
T1 plus all of this.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.930
And so what we see, is that
for a modest increase in

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:56.790
temperature, this maximum shifts
modestly, but the area

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.800
under the line in excess
of this critical

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.850
energy increases radically.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.460
And that's the powerful
leveraging factor of increase

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:06.850
in temperature.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.620
And I've done some calculations
just to show you

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.840
what this does.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.920
The functionality of the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:29.800
is e to the minus some critical
energy divided by the

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.220
product of Boltzmann constant
temperature.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.100
So we can put in a
value here-- eg--

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.330
what have you.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:36.620
All right.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.180
So I chose for silicon--

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:43.780
for silicon, I know the band
gap energy is 1.1 eV--

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:49.340
and I have it at room
temperature--

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.380
when I go through the
calculation--

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.750
the fraction underneath that
line is 10 to the minus 19.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.350
One part in 10 to
the minus 19.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.370
This is the area.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:07.200
Area under the curve is greater
than the band gap

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.810
energy of 1.1 eV.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.440
So then I said, let's go up
to the melting point.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.390
I'm not going to melt the
silicon, I'm just going to

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.580
bring it up to its melting
point but not melt it.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.830
So it's like ice cubes
at 0 Celsius.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.330
It's still solid.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:22.630
OK?

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.710
The melting point of silicon,
you can look in your Periodic

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.880
Table, it's over
1400 degrees C.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.240
And this is 10 to the minus 4.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.460
10 to the minus 4.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.880
Area under curve: da da da da.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.360
So that means that
the red area--

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.760
A2, the red.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.240
Actually, let's use red chalk so
that everybody is in tune.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:52.970
A2 to A1 is equal to 10 to the
15, whereas T2 over T1--

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.752
well, red chalk.

00:21:54.752 --> 00:21:57.160
It's my chance to use red chalk
and I'm not going to

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.100
squander it.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.510
T2 divided by T1--

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.140
it's about 1700 Kelvin divided
by 300 Kelvin--

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.240
is about 6.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.570
So for a change in temperature
by a factor of 6, I get a

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.265
change in population
of 10 to the 15.

00:22:14.265 --> 00:22:17.410
So you can see how modest
increases in temperature have

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:22.340
a huge impact on thermal
excitation.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:27.650
So now you say, if we wanted
to make a device, we can't

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:33.350
heat our computers up to 1600
degrees, 1500 degrees C in

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.970
order to get an adequate number
of charge carriers.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.980
There has to be another way
to get charge carriers.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.750
I'm going to show you
a third way that's

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.430
called chemical promotion.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:48.470
So now I want to talk about
charge carrier generation.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:57.670
Charge carrier generation by
change of chemistry, and it's

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:03.810
going to be specifically
by the introduction of

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.140
impurities.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.410
Charge carrier generation by
introduction of impurities.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.800
You might say, gee, aren't
impurities bad for a system?

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.950
Well, I want to tell you,
there are two kinds of

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.750
impurities in this world.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.630
There are bad impurities which
we call contaminants, and

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.150
that's what you're commonly
taught to think about.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.060
That's bad.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.230
But there are good impurities,
and these are called dopants.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.880
Dopants are impurities
that we are happy

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.330
to have in our system.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:42.280
And so by the introduction of
impurities of value, we can

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.020
lead to engineered materials.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.700
So I'm giving you the
introduction to high

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.660
technology, where we're going
to control the engineering

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.960
properties of a material through
control of chemistry.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:10.780
So that's chemical composition
tailored--

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.030
for specific--

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:24.240
for targeted values
of properties.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.210
And that's the essence
of material science.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.840
We control the chemistry.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.670
We control the properties by
controlling the chemistry.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.750
So what I want to do is give a
vivid example of this, and

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.130
it's not going to be an
isolated example.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.910
It's going to be the example
that pertains to all of the

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.080
microelectronic devices
in our world.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.340
So that's silicon.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.700
So let's look at how doping
works in silicon.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.810
It also applies to germanium,
but we don't use much

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:53.970
germanium in devices.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.960
It's dominantly silicon.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.910
So what we're going
to do is dope.

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:02.030
The gambit here is to dope--

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.470
that's introduce an impurity--

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:08.880
with aliovalent impurity.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.450
What do I mean by aliovalent?

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.100
You know the word alias?

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.080
It's another name.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.690
Alio in Latin means other.

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.300
So we're going to dope silicon
with something that has a

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.980
different valence from
that of silicon.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.400
Can't before.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.770
So let's look at the
simplest example.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:28.840
And I'm going to put phosphorus
into silicon.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.760
I'm going to dope phosphorus
into silicon, and phosphorus

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.740
is Group 5, or more properly,
IUPAC calls it Group 15.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:39.290
So we're going to put Group 15
element into silicon, which is

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.330
Group 14 element.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.920
So we call phosphorus a
supervalent dopant, meaning it

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:49.390
has a valence higher than
that of the silicon.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:53.090
So it's a supervalent dopant.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.830
Supervalent dopant.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.450
So now let's look at how that
supervalent dopant works.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:01.730
I'm going to show you some
silicon here, and I'm going to

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.290
give you the silicon.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:07.340
This is sp3 hybridized.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:12.110
it's sitting here as
a single crystal.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:18.960
Here are three silicons.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.100
So it's a single crystal.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.620
All these silicons on the
bottom row line up.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.860
All the silicons in the
center line up.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.220
And there are silicons at the
top and they all line up.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.390
So that if I look at it on the
edge, it's a perfectly,

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.440
atomically smooth system.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.220
And I have one of these.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.110
I know Professor Ballinger made
reference to it last day.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.990
This is last-generation
technology.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.640
It's only eight-inch diameter.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.440
But this is an eight-inch
diameter silicon wafer.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.070
So this started as a giant
salami, eight inches in

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:50.460
diameter-- probably
two meters long.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.040
Single crystal.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.710
Every atom here is adjacent to
the next atom according to the

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:59.220
rules of atomic arrangement.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.320
And when this thing is
cut and polished,

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.680
it's flat to one atom.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.390
It is atomically flat.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:09.600
And it makes a fantastic
shaving mirror.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.510
Actually Dave, can
you cut to this?

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.550
Yeah, here we go.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.250
Here's the penny.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.430
And this is silicon here.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:19.080
It's going to drive this thing
nuts because it can't focus on

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.400
this thing, because it's so--

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.500
there we are.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.850
So this was a part of a giant
salami, and now it's been cut.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.560
And obviously you can't
cut it one-atom thick.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.380
It's some submillimeter
thickness, because you need to

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.580
have some mechanical
strength to it.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.740
But the surface is absolutely
flat to one atom.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.470
All right.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.060
And that's what we're
going to dope into.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.290
We're going to dope into this
thing, and I'll show you how

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:43.350
we're going to dope it later.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.710
Actually, why don't
we cut to that.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.190
Here's something that's already
been doped and made

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.310
into devices.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.500
So there's the plain old
silicon, which you're having a

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.600
hard time seeing anything
except a little bit of

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.590
reflection.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.290
And now here's the thing that's
been processed, so

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.190
let's zoom.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.440
Zoom.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:04.250
OK.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.600
So now you can see
all the features.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.480
So these features involved gas
phase reaction to introduce

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.740
dopant atoms into the
silicon lattice.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.630
And then we're going to chop
these little things up and put

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.280
them in your cell phones and in
your laptops and whatever

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.210
other devices are out there.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:22.500
OK.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.770
So this is what we're talking
about, and if we live long

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.320
enough, we'll see
one of these.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.330
This is a Pentium chip.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:28.520
OK.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.920
So where's the chip?

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.640
The chip is underneath
this piece of gold.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.890
Where did I put my pointer?

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:37.780
Ah, it's over here.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:38.520
All right.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.610
So the actual silicon device
is underneath this.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:47.120
And all of these are this
spider's web of leads.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.700
It's trying to access all
the tiny devices.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.870
It doesn't do you any good to
have a device density that's

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.110
greater than your
access density.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.010
So the technology that goes
into this is phenomenal.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:01.400
Plus, these things all
generate heat.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.260
When you put all these tens of
thousands of devices into

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.230
something the size of your
fingernail, you've got a

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:12.660
toaster oven working here, and
you have to get that heat out.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:15.560
And this is several
generations old.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.500
What you have in your
machines today is

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.760
even denser than this.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.880
And supercomputers?

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.440
Forget it.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.830
You have to have those things so
aggressively cooled or else

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.200
they'll heat up and it'll
be just like a

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.530
light bulb, just bursting.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:30.920
So that's what's going
on inside.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.720
So let's see how that happens.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.560
Let's cut back to-- well,
you can leave that up.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.053
It's a pretty image and will
probably soothe the nerves of

00:29:37.053 --> 00:29:38.590
the students.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.515
So now I'm going to put
phosphorus in here.

00:29:40.515 --> 00:29:43.570
I'll put phosphorus in here, but
where does phosphorus go?

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.490
Phosphorus goes onto
a silicon site.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.260
So it actually comes
in and sits here.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.000
Phosphorus comes and sits
at a silicon site.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.170
Now what do we know about
the number of bonds that

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.110
phosphorus likes to form?

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:58.340
It has five valence electrons.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.500
So it forms one, two, three,
four bonds, and

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.650
it has a fifth electron.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:07.500
And that fifth electron is
sitting there somewhere.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:13.860
It's sitting there somewhere
in the lattice.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.130
All right.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.970
It's sitting somewhere in the
lattice because it has no

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.070
place to go.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:20.370
Now in energy space, I
know where it goes.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:24.220
So here's the conduction band
of silicon, and this is the

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.850
valence band.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:31.700
And this is all of the silicon
host crystal, because the

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.750
dopant is in a tiny,
tiny amount.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.540
We're talking parts
per million.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.120
So for all intents and
purposes, it's

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.310
still a silicon crystal.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.700
It has tiny amounts of
phosphorus in it.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:47.090
So this is the band gap of
silicon, where this is about

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.700
1.1 electron volts.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.640
And where does this
fifth electron go?

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.220
This fifth electron sits up in
here in the conduction band,

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.440
doesn't it?

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.050
And every time I introduce a
phosphorus, I have a fifth

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.220
electron that goes in
the conduction band.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.240
But I don't have to
generate a hole.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.490
I don't need to break bonds in
order to put electrons in the

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.860
conduction band.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.060
Because the fifth electron
is like the fifth wheel.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:11.790
You know?

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.810
It goes in the conduction
band.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.045
So there's no generation
of holes here.

00:31:16.045 --> 00:31:16.980
All right.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.575
And furthermore, I can control
the conductivity.

00:31:20.575 --> 00:31:23.030
At the end of last lecture,
Professor Ballinger showed you

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.480
that the conductivity of a
substance is related to the

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.000
number of charge carriers.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.500
So if I want to double the
number of phosphoruses, I will

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.740
double the number of electrons
in the conduction band,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.260
independent of temperature.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.090
All right.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:48.920
So for every phosphorus dopant
atom, we get one electron in

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.070
the conduction band.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.425
We get one electron in the
conduction band and no holes.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:04.140
No holes in the valence band.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.520
It's direct.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.770
It's direct.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:07.880
All right.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.260
Now, electrical engineers would
look at this and they'd

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.840
say, I don't care if
it's phosphorus.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.880
They don't care about the
chemistry, they care about the

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.390
functionality.

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:20.990
What kind of carriers am I
throwing into this crystal?

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:22.490
For an electrical engineer,
there are only

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:23.740
two kinds of carriers.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.730
Positive carriers and
negative carriers.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:28.280
For every phosphorus,
what's the outcome?

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.230
A negative carrier.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:33.250
So this is now doped silicon.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.520
It generated negative
carriers, so

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.300
this is called n-type.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.990
This is now n-type silicon.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:45.850
And its properties are governed
by the population of

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:47.630
these-- because I'm going to
show you in a second that the

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.210
number of these far exceeds the
number that are thermally

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:51.940
generated--

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.585
so the properties here
are called extrinsic.

00:32:54.585 --> 00:32:59.600
So now we have a crystal that
is exhibiting it's extrinsic

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.550
behavior, thanks to the doping
with the supervalent impurity.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.440
One more thing.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.090
One more thing.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.180
Something very, very
cool here.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.690
You see this electron?

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:15.390
It's sitting here somewhere
in the--

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:18.310
now this is Cartesian map.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:20.540
I'm looking through a scanning
electron microscope.

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.400
I see all the silicons.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.580
I get the phosphorus.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.120
And there's an electron
in here somewhere.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.610
And this has 15, right?

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:28.670
This has 15 protons.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.690
This has 14 protons.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:36.110
So in a land of 14 plus,
15 plus is relatively

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.630
positive, isn't it?

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.480
The phosphorus is locally
positive in comparison with

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.800
the rest of the silicon
lattice.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.690
And it's pinned, because
it's covalently bonded.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.360
And there's an electron
sitting here

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.620
with no place to go.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.570
Do you know of a model that
describes the behavior of a

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:58.380
one-electron system around a
pinned positive nucleus?

00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.510
AUDIENCE: The Bohr model.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.470
PROFESSOR: Bohr model?

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.330
Just for grins and chuckles,
what if we were to use the

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.260
Bohr model to describe the
behavior of that electron?

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.080
You can say it's crazy.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.910
That doesn't make any sense,
because that's not a

00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:12.700
one-electron system.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:17.880
But what if we modeled
it as though it were?

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.130
I'm going to-- just for grins
and chuckles-- get a sense of

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.210
what that ground
state value is.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:29.900
And recall that in hydrogen,
the ground state--

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.160
E1, ground state of
the electron--

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.780
is equal to minus k.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:41.400
Which is minus me to the fourth
over 8 epsilon naught

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.640
squared times Planck
constant squared.

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.880
Which is minus 13.6
electron volts

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.530
So what is the energy of that
electron there if we use the

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:55.160
Bohr model?

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.800
Well, we have to modify it
a little bit, because the

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.220
electron isn't moving
in a vacuum.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.970
Depending on how far this
electron is from the center,

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.300
it could be moving around, and
there are all kinds of silicon

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.160
atoms and bonds and whatnot.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.022
So there are all kinds of stuff
between the electron and

00:35:10.022 --> 00:35:10.860
the center here.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.460
So I have to use a
modified form.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.260
I don't use the permittivity
of vacuum.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.620
I map the permittivity
of vacuum into

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.350
the dielectric constant.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:27.360
This is the dielectric
constant of silicon.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.730
Remember there's so little
phosphorus there that it

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:31.910
doesn't alter the properties.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.400
And then for reasons I can't
go in to here, I have to

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.560
change the mass of
the electron into

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.690
the effective mass--

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:46.310
we saw this when Bohr did the
calculation about the lines of

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.390
helium plus--

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:54.440
effective mass of electron
in the conduction band.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.380
So if you put both
of those in--

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.270
and I've got numbers
for this--

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:06.150
this value is 11.7 and the
second one is about 1/5 of the

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:07.800
rest mass of the electron.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.720
So if you put all of that in,
you end up with the energy of

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:18.610
this ground state electron equal
to minus k times 0.2

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:23.340
divided by 11.7 squared,
which equals minus

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.490
0.02 electron volts.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:28.240
0.02 electron volts.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.070
So this is 2/100 of an electron
volt below something.

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.450
What's it below?

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.760
It's below the conduction
band.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.180
It's right here.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:43.700
This is the ground state of the
electron from phosphorus.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.650
It's the ground state of the
electron from phosphorus.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:53.040
E1 of electron from
phosphorus.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.595
And phosphorus, the electrical
engineers call a donor.

00:36:56.595 --> 00:36:58.210
A donor of what?

00:36:58.210 --> 00:36:59.530
It's a donor of electrons.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:05.340
So this thing here is called
the donor level.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.330
And that's the ground state.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:08.740
So the electron should
be sitting.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.900
Isn't the ground state here
lower than the bottom of the

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.210
conduction band?

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:12.960
Sure it is.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.790
So the electron really should
be down in here.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:17.130
There's the electron.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.160
Now you're saying, how are you
going to get conductivity?

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:25.020
Well, we just figured out that
the energy level of the ground

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.540
state of the donor--

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:33.280
so I'm going to call this the
energy of the donor level,

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.350
ground state--

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:35.600
is 0.02.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.730
How does that compare with
thermal energy at room

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.220
temperature?

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.140
It's comparable.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:44.030
So at room temperature with
1/40 of an electron volt,

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:48.790
there's enough energy to promote
this electron up into

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:52.270
the conduction band by
thermal excitation

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.170
from the donor level.

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:56.080
Thermal excitation from
the donor level.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.870
And in fact, if we want to do
something really, really--

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:01.090
I want to use an adverb here--
really, really cool.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:02.600
If that's the ground state--

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.000
I'm going to blow this up.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.810
So this is the bottom of
the conduction band.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:10.010
And now this is the
ground state.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.990
This is the donor level.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.360
This is the donor level,
which I was calling E1.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.210
Is it just the donor level here
and the conduction band,

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:27.630
or can you see that there's
an E2 and an E3 and an E4?

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.320
And I have a whole set of
quantum states from the donor

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.590
level right up to the
conduction band.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.550
And if I have enough energy--

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:43.410
if E thermal is on the
order of E donor--

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:46.030
I get promotion of
these up in here.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.780
Now what would we say if this
were the Bohr model?

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.840
You'd have an electron loose in
a ground state up in here

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.410
where it's free to move.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:57.330
What's that process called?

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:58.280
Ionization.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.220
And you know what the electrical
engineers call

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.450
these electrons?

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.370
They call them ionized
electrons.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:07.290
But they're referring to the
ionization of the electron out

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.160
of the donor level into the
conduction band, not out of

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.270
the silicon crystal.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:23.800
So these are ionized electrons
out of donor level.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.440
So we've come full circle.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.480
By the way, this is
a calculation.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.940
You know what the measured
value is?

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:37.630
It was measured as minus
0.045 electron volts.

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:39.340
You might look at that and say,
whoa, that's about two

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:39.970
times this.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:40.560
Hey, wait a minute.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.650
We started at 13.6.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:47.160
We went from 13.6 to this, and
the real value is this, and so

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.590
we are in good shape.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:57.490
Now, what happens if I put
another phosphorus in here?

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.960
Another phosphorus, it's also
going to sit at this--

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.110
I'm going to do it over here.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:03.990
If I put another phosphorus,
it also has

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.220
the same donor level.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.920
And another phosphorus, it
has the same donor level.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.345
How can I justify this?

00:40:09.345 --> 00:40:12.810
Am I not violating the Pauli
exclusion principle?

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:16.120
How come all the phosphorus
donor states

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.240
are at the same level?

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.110
Or put another way, under
what circumstances is

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.910
this diagram accurate?

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.310
If the number of phosphorus
atoms that I

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.270
introduce is tiny--

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:30.530
parts per million--

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:34.010
the separation, the physical
separation of this phosphorus

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:37.190
from its nearest phosphorus
neighbor is so great, that for

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:40.660
all intents and purposes, they
are at infinite separation.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:44.320
And therefore, all of the
phosphorus donor atoms

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.190
establish a donor level
at the same value.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:52.990
And if you dope to very, very
high levels, you see this

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:54.000
break down.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.390
If you go to very, very high
concentrations of phosphorus

00:40:56.390 --> 00:41:00.060
dopant, you will discover what
happens if these two energy

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:04.490
levels get close enough together
in real space.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:06.030
They have to split.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.770
And so you'll see all of that
happening down here at the

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:09.570
miniature level.

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:13.420
The last thing I wanted to do
was to push the Bohr model

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.170
just a little bit harder.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:18.180
And so I've given you an energy,
and the energy seems

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:18.870
to make sense.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:20.110
Even though you might say,
this is the crazy.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.580
It's not a one-electron system,
but it gave us a

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.210
reasonable number.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:27.780
Let's just for interest's sake
determine: what's this radius?

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:33.240
I wonder how far this electron
is away from the donor

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.290
phosphorus?

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:37.260
So I plug into the r1.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:40.330
That's the radius of the
ground state electron.

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.900
And that's the Bohr
radius, right?

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:47.440
0.529 angstroms in elemental
hydrogen, but now this has to

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:52.870
be modified by adding the
dielectric constant and the

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:54.330
effective mass.

00:41:54.330 --> 00:42:02.590
And the number is 30 angstroms,
or 3 nanometers, if

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:04.170
you must. All right?

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:09.710
And compare that to
silicon-silicon bond distance.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:15.210
The silicon-silicon bond
distance is 2.35 angstroms. So

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:19.200
clearly this electron is very
far removed from the central

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.310
phosphorus.

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:21.790
It's not as I depicted.

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.505
It has to be way over here,
going way, way around.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.960
This is really, really
something.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:37.590
So now you understand how you
can get extrinsic properties

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:42.650
and the behavior of the system
governed by the introduction

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.040
of impurities.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.220
What I'm going to do next day,
is to show you that at typical

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:52.470
doping levels, when you
dope, dope at about 10

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:53.330
to the minus 6--

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:54.410
1 part per million--

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:58.020
10 to the minus 6 phosphorus
per silicon.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:03.540
It turns out that the number
of electrons from this

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:11.120
operation is much greater than
the number of electrons from

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.780
thermal excitation,
which is tiny.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.570
And therefore, we argue that the
properties are governed by

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:20.070
the dopant atom, and so
we have extrinsic

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.060
behavior that we see.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.520
OK, well that's a day's work.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.430
David, may we go to the
slides, please?

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:44.140
OK, so you saw all that last
day, and this, this, this.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.330
All right, there's the
insulator, and that.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.730
So I'm just doing the lecture
again and fast. You can read.

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:51.150
You can parse visual images.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.980
See?

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.120
There's the n-type
semiconductor.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.710
We're going to look at p-type
next day, quickly.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:57.830
There's a silicon crystal.

00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:58.790
There's the salamis--

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.890
there's the little wafers
that are cut.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.926
And there's the spectrum, the
x-ray spectrum indicating you

00:44:03.926 --> 00:44:05.200
have a single crystal.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.910
There's the first transistor--

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.720
this was a single crystal
of germanium

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.450
lying here on its side--

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:15.440
the point transistor in
the fall of 1947.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.610
Three gentleman at the Bell
Labs that demonstrated the

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:20.010
rectification.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.250
And they won the Nobel Prize
for this in 1956.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.080
Now, you can also make

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.032
semiconductors that have compounds.

00:44:26.032 --> 00:44:28.620
So these are compound
semiconductors--

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.590
Professor Ballinger showed you
last day-- tin, germanium,

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:32.980
silicon, carbon.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:33.850
And look at all of these.

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:36.100
This is a Group 3 element
with a Group 5 element.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.830
5 plus 3 is 8.

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:38.730
Group 3 and 5.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:41.220
This is Group 2 and 6.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.495
2 plus 6 is 8.

00:44:42.495 --> 00:44:44.720
It's always about
octet stability.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:48.410
But they make strong covalent
bonds that give band gaps all

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:50.470
over the map.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:55.320
So suppose I wanted to have
something like a stoplight.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.630
Suppose I wanted a stoplight,
and I wanted

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:58.740
to make a red light.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:44:59.660
Well, I need--

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:03.057
I can go backwards from 660
nanometers, and I can go e

00:45:03.057 --> 00:45:05.270
equals hc over lambda
and calculate--

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:10.000
I need a material with 1.97
electron volts band gap, and I

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.180
look on here and there's nothing
that's exactly 1.97.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.510
Well, I can mix these things.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.570
I can mix them.

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:23.280
I can mix something that has
1.52 with 2.3 and get 1.97.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.460
That's called band
gap engineering.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.920
And there's more than one mix
here, so why would I choose

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.960
one mix over another?

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.530
It's cheaper, or it's easier to
process, or it's stable in

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:34.790
the atmosphere.

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:36.750
You don't want a semiconductor
that can't

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.470
stand rain and snow.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.710
And so I'm showing you here
a variety of compound

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:44.810
semiconductors, and this is
the basis of things like--

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:50.970
the LED, the CD reader, the DVD
reader is based on light

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.070
that's generated from these.

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.960
What was the big deal
about Blu-ray?

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.410
Why is Blu-ray so cool?

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.480
Because the original
reader was red.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.400
And what's the wavelength
of red light?

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.070
Red light is around
600 nanometers.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.205
And what's the wavelength
of blue light?

00:46:08.205 --> 00:46:10.870
It's down around
300 nanometers.

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:15.540
So all other things being equal,
my stylus is half the

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.480
size, which means for a given
area, I can get double the

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:25.390
density of information without
changing the size of the disc.

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:29.560
But it wasn't trivial to
find a blue laser.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.080
And the person who found the
right mix of compounds that

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.690
could give blue in an efficient
manner became a very

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:37.940
wealthy individual.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:41.570
So this is our stoplight now.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:45.720
These are the materials that
go into the stoplights.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.060
No more do you have that giant
lens with a 150-watt

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.110
incandescent bulb.

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:54.450
Now you have the array of these
LEDs that are designed

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.350
to be in this band gap.

00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:59.070
So I think at this point, we've

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:00.940
probably run out of time.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.780
So we'll resume the discussion
tomorrow.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.060
Same time, same place.
