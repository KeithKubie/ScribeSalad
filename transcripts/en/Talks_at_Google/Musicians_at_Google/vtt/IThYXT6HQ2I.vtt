Presenter: All right.
Hello, everyone,

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.200
and welcome again to
the @Google program.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.867
This installment for musicians
at Google, as you can tell.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:14.934
We're welcoming
today Eric Lewis,

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:16.300
renowned jazz pianist

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.000
and is only getting
hotter on the scene.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.033
He was recently featured
at the April conference --

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.200
TED Conference,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.800
uh, where he was, I think,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.834
his first exposure
to a lot of the Bay Area,

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:28.800
or the Bay Area's
first exposure to Eric.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.900
Uh, tore the house down,
left it wanting more.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.767
And sure enough he came
back a couple of times.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.767
He came back to the DNA lounge
doing a benefit concert,

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:39.734
uh, which he came back
again last night for

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:41.000
and, uh, once again,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.266
just getting rave reviews
all over the place.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.467
Uh, extremely pleased to
have him at Google and, uh,

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.433
if you could join me
in welcoming him.

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:55.633
[applause]

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:57.867
Presenter: Uh, so I just had
a couple of quick questions

00:00:57.867 --> 00:00:59.133
before you dove into the piano

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.200
and we'll also give him a break
to talk a little bit more

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.367
in between some of his
some of his pieces.

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:07.200
But Eric, if you could tell us
in the mic a little bit about,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.100
umm, you know, how you started
playing the piano,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.900
what led you to
where you are today.

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:16.500
Eric: Test.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.000
I come from a musical family.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700
I come from Camden, New Jersey.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.100
It's near Philly, for
those of you who don't know.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.433
Here we are.

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:26.834
And, uh, okay.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.133
So, yeah.

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.734
I come from about three
to four generations

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:32.000
of classical musicians.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.867
I come from, well, sadly enough,
the murder capital,

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:37.300
"the hood" you could say.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.567
But I grew up in
the hood music school.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:45.066
So all the old ladies and young
kids would all come and study

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:48.266
music under my great
grandmother and mother.

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:50.400
We had a very big house
in the neighborhood.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.767
I still don't understand why in
that neighborhood

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:53.767
we had such a big house.

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:55.166
Either way, we had five pianos.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:59.166
I grew up with lots of pianos
and so different classes

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:02.166
were being held in different
parts of the house,

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.667
in the music room, dining room, living room,

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:06.333
'cause there were
pianos all over the place.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:11.500
So I grew up hearing Chopin,
Polonaise, stuff like that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.133
basically.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.700
It wasn't until about fourth
grade and I realized

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.233
everyone didn't play piano.

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:18.767
[laughing]

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:22.300
Eric: Anyway, time passes,
I get better I get better.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.600
They turn me over to the
Southern Music School

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.333
in Philadelphia where I start
getting into, woo hoo,

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:32.300
we started getting into Chopin,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.100
a etudes, and Beethoven and,
you know, the harder pieces,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.066
and then I get exposed to jazz,

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:43.100
I ended up meeting Wynton
Marsalis when I was about 13.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.700
I get enamored with the jazz,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.333
ethos, and the lifestyle 
and the look of it New York

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:50.500
and wanted to be there,
be a part of it.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.800
New York, New York.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.133
And so I ended up getting
a full scholarship

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:55.867
to the Manhattan School
of Music,

00:02:55.867 --> 00:02:58.033
go there and graduate there,

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:00.166
graduate immediately
hit the road

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:03.033
with Cassandra Wilson
doing tours,

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.600
then I ended up hitting tours with Wynton Marsalis

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.333
and then John Hendricks,

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:12.500
and then I end up winning --

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.033
this is only a small international piano competition

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:16.934
in 1999.

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:19.633
Then I go on the road for
two years with Elvin Jones.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.533
That was sort of my sorcerer's
apprentice,

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:27.266
Elvin Jones was the drummer
who supported

00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:32.333
and co-innovated a style of
music with John Coltrane,

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:36.500
and so I got a up-close
and personal dosage

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.667
from a real
master of music.

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.333
Went back out with
Wynton Marsalis

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:42.700
after I finished that tenure,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.400
did a little bit with
Roy Hargrove,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.233
and then I got to a point where there was a certain kind

00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:54.967
of power and emotion and angst
that I was looking to express

00:03:54.967 --> 00:04:02.367
more regularly and I decided
to strike out on my own.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:06.033
By the way, I spent a lot of
time with the chess hustlers

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:08.700
in Washington Square Park
and Greenwitch Village,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.367
and so they kinda gave me an
idea about being more savvy

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:12.767
about business and stuff
like that

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:15.734
'cause I was losing money
from them all the time.

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:17.400
[laughing]

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.567
Eric: And so, uh, that was my
little free business school

00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:26.633
and so they gave me
the idea of --

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:34.266
they -- they sort of created my
taste for the business world

00:04:34.266 --> 00:04:37.433
thinking -- they got me
thinking about branding and,

00:04:37.433 --> 00:04:39.266
you know, a lot of the things that I'm sure

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:43.066
you all are experts in
or very familiar with.

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:45.867
Niche, stuff like that.

00:04:45.867 --> 00:04:49.967
And so took a little time
from the jazz scene

00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:52.400
and tried to figure out
what it is I wanted to do

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.800
and then I discovered alternative rock.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.834
I was so into the jazz world
and so into the whole concept of

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:01.533
being a purist and
these kinda things

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:03.333
that I never listened to rock

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:09.300
and, uh, that's
the irony of it all.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.800
When I started hearing
some of the lyrics

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.867
some of these rock tunes

00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:14.233
and what they conveyed,
what they expressed politically,

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:16.700
and also just internally I was,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.533
like, wow, this is exactly
what I want.

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:20.100
And also there was a lot
of relationship

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.700
between the electric guitar
techniques and sounds

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.000
and the piano techniques
and sounds 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.400
and I decided to try to
explore that a little more

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.667
radically than had been done.

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:33.767
So I saw an opportunity to
integrate my niche mentality

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:37.667
that I got from my chess guys
and the powerful playing

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:39.133
that I got from Elvin Jones,

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:42.266
and the classical training
and stuff like that from home,

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:44.000
and all my world
experience in jazz

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.967
would improvising, all that.

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:48.467
Put it all together,
I called it rock jazz.

00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:52.967
I play tunes that really
send me on the inside and,

00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:56.300
uh, I think that's it.

00:05:57.934 --> 00:05:59.000
Voila.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.467
Presenter: And here we are.

00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:01.900
Eric: I do movie scores
and stuff like that, too.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.900
I got a State Farm
commercial airing right now.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.934
Presenter: Nice.
[laughing]

00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:08.166
Presenter: Umm, I hesitate to
ask you too much before you play

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:10.133
'cause then any questions
because then I feel really begs

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:11.367
having the listen to you

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:13.433
but just one quick one and we'll
let you get to the piano.

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:14.066
Eric: Okay.

00:06:14.066 --> 00:06:18.834
Presenter: Umm, you know,
you add such vibrant color

00:06:18.834 --> 00:06:21.266
to these songs that many
of us are familiar with

00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:23.500
and you take them to
places that we really

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.367
I don't think, anybody who's
ever listened to your music

00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:26.834
could see them going.

00:06:26.834 --> 00:06:30.767
Umm, when you hear
the song initially,

00:06:30.767 --> 00:06:34.166
uh, do you hear all of the color
that you could add around it?

00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:35.800
Does it come out
of experimentation?

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.533
Is it there as soon
as you hear it?

00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:39.700
Umm, where do you get the
inspiration for the amount

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.567
of layers that you put into
the music, or expose

00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:44.333
how ever you see it

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.467
Eric: I'll just, uh, work my
way to some answers for that.

00:06:56.467 --> 00:06:58.867
Right off, the lyrics,
for instance,

00:06:58.867 --> 00:07:01.567
there's, you know,
tunes in jazz,

00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:04.266
a lot of the jazz
standard songs --

00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:06.633
or are regarded as standards
come from the pop repertoire

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:08.500
of Humphrey Bogart's time etc.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.166
or something like
that and they have lyrics like,

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:13.066
"The very thought of you
makes my heart sing

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:15.533
like an April breeze
on the wind of spring

00:07:15.533 --> 00:07:17.600
and you appear in
all your splendor,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.633
my one and only love."

00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:23.133
Lyrics like that and that's
all well and good

00:07:23.133 --> 00:07:29.233
but I experience a lot
of emotional turmoil

00:07:29.233 --> 00:07:32.233
in my life at certain points,

00:07:32.233 --> 00:07:33.500
like anybody else,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.967
it's just that as an artist to
try to pour that into music

00:07:37.967 --> 00:07:42.166
it's difficult to take a song
that's designed to support

00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:46.033
those kind of romantic
emotions and that -- that --

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:53.633
that mode of human thought or
dialogue and be appropriate,

00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:56.900
you know, with the kind of
feelings that I get. So then,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.033
if we turn to something
like "Lincoln Park's calling

00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:01.300
where "I'm crawling in my skin

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.834
these wounds they will not heal fear is how I fall confusing

00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:07.266
what is real."

00:08:07.266 --> 00:08:09.367
Those kind of
lyrics appeal to the angst

00:08:09.367 --> 00:08:12.667
and some of the things
that I felt

00:08:12.667 --> 00:08:16.967
in the process of trying to come
from the strict jazz world

00:08:16.967 --> 00:08:19.567
and get to this world.

00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:21.166
It's the journey of discovery

00:08:21.166 --> 00:08:23.767
that the thing I was
blowing off,

00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:25.934
pushing to the side,
thinking, you know,

00:08:25.934 --> 00:08:28.266
that this is lesser music
than this.

00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:31.633
This music that I was
pushing and brushing off

00:08:31.633 --> 00:08:36.467
held the key to my freedom.

00:08:36.467 --> 00:08:39.700
And artistic freedom at that.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.867
And so looking back, you know,

00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:46.600
there are certain tunes
in this repertoire

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.133
that lyrically remind me
of that whole process.

00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:52.266
Sometimes I felt the feelings
of betrayal.

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:55.767
So then, the Killer's
"Mr. Brightside" you know,

00:08:55.767 --> 00:08:58.533
where it's all about
betrayal and, you know, that

00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:00.633
starts to tickle my fancy.

00:09:00.633 --> 00:09:02.266
And then there's of course,

00:09:02.266 --> 00:09:04.967
the convergence of
the lyrics with

00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:07.867
chord progressions and,
you know, musical elements

00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:18.000
that are very much congruent
or ripe for the exploitation.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.433
Presenter: Mm hmm.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.300
but I'm sure you'd be willing to
stick around for a few minutes.

00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.200
We're gonna be having
lunch afterwards

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.700
so if you have questions,
umm, feel free to ask.

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.967
But I think we're
done with the video.

00:56:03.967 --> 00:56:09.233
[applause]
