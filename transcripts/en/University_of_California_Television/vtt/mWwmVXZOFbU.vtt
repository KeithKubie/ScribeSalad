- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape;
bipedal, naked large-brained. Lone the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.670
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.540
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.360

we got here. An exploration made possible

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.980
- [Brenna] Thank you so much for having
me. So, unlike most of your other

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.770
speakers, I actually work with
contemporary humans and not fossils, but I

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.270
will try to maintain your attention
anyway. I am mostly interested in human

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.680
evolution. And as you've noticed from
these diagrams that people have put up

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.440
regarding the phylogeny of Neanderthals
and Denisovans and modern humans, modern

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.010
humans often get represented as sort of
just a single branch, or maybe a few

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.170
genomes that come off this other branch.
And so what I want to do is really take a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.340
little bit of time and conceptualize what
it means to refer to the Homo sapiens as a

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.500
single species. Did we have a single
origin. There's actually a lot of

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.850
complexity in this question which isn't
necessarily addressed by one of these

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.190
simple tri-part type phylogenies. So,
let's just break down kind of the known

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.410
working model we have for human evolution
which is mostly based on contemporary DNA.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.380
So, if we start out in Africa roughly
about 100,000 years ago. I'm an advocate

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.750
of a Southern African origin. I'm not
going to try to convince you of that

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.970
today, but we actually don't know where in
Africa. There was a single origin of the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.280
Homo sapiens species if indeed it was a
single origin model, all right? And then

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.900
from Southern Africa, putatively, there is
a migration and dispersal into the rest of

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.050
the African continent. And certainly by
60, maybe even slightly earlier, 70,000

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:41.640
years, there were these individuals living
in Northeastern Africa at which time there

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.880
was what we call a "founder event." So,
these populations moved out of Africa into

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.850
the near East. Now, this event is actually
a major event in human evolution, or at

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.540
least in the genomes of all non-Africans
living today. And that is because there

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.800
was a strong reduction in genetic
diversity during this founder event. And

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.710
that's indicated here by the fat arrow,
okay? So every time you see a fat arrow on

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.450
this map, that indicates a reduction in
genetic diversity. Once humans left

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.480
Africa, these individuals spread rapidly
across the Eurasian continent. There are

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.220
some hypotheses of what they call the
South Indian or South Asian migration

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.640
route which is along the coast of the
Indian subcontinent, and eventually into

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.820
Southeast Asia and Oceania, certainly by
45,000 years ago. As well as additional

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.940
migrations into Northern Asia and
eventually into the Americas where it was

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.740
accompanied by yet another strong founder
event or population bottleneck which

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.680
reduced the genetic diversity of those
populations. And we'll hear a little bit

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.850
more about that today from Maria. So
that's our basic model of human evolution

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.580
over the last 100,000 years. But you'll
notice that there's not a lot of detail in

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.880
Africa, actually. There's just a few
arrows and some general little dates.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.510
Geneticists love to put arrows on maps and
I am no exception. So, I'd like to instead

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.600
think about posing this question, "Where
in Africa did humans originate?" And there

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.030
are different types of genetic evidence or
other types of evidence one might use to

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.030
answer this question. And there's a sort
of presentation here. This is by Batini

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.210
and Jobling where they suggest different
types of evidence one could look at. So

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.120
you could look at, for example,
non-genetic evidence, skulls that have

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.390
been dug up from the ground by
paleo-anthropologists. You could look at

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.520
evidence of what we call "symbolic
behaviors," such as the making of art, so

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.270
shell beads or these little crosshatch
ocher pieces that have been discovered.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.020
You might even look at language. So
there's a really fascinating paper from a

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.570
few years ago that looked at phonemic
diversity, not genetic diversity, but

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.070
looking at the number of phonemes in
different languages and can we learn

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.880
anything about the origins of language by
the amount of diversity that's present in

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.650
phonemes? And he argued, indeed, Africa
has the highest phonemic diversity. And in

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.530
particular even Southern African has the
highest phonemic diversity. So I'm a

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.940
geneticist. I focus on a different type of
evidence and you can break down genetic

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.720
evidence also into these little patches.
So one might be the mitochondrial DNA.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.150
Mitochondrial DNA, as we've heard from
other speakers, is something that's

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.750
inherited through the maternal lineage. So
the mother passes it on to her children

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.690
and then it's passed on from the daughter
to her children. Alternatively, you could

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.020
look at the Y-chromosome which has a
different pattern of inheritance from

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:50.480
father to son, and so on and so on, for
many generations. And then last are what

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.680
we call the autosomes, which are the
remainder of the chromosomes 1 through 22

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.330
that compose the rest of your genome. So
when this was done, and this slide is a

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.350
little bit dated, but from mitochondrial
DNA and Y-chromosome DNA, it was a little

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.420
bit hard to pin-point precisely where the
deepest divergence was within Africa, I'm

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.280
going to address that again later, but at
least from the autosomal information. Both

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.040
if you look at SNPs or a single-nucleotide
polymorphism, just your vanilla mutation.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.970
They actually have the highest genetic
diversity, or heterozygosity, in Southern

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:33.340
African populations and even other types
of polymorphism like microsatellites also

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.500
look like they had the highest diversity
in Southern African populations. And so

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.010
we're getting a lot of conflicting pieces
of information maybe from non-genetic

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:47.080
evidence, from genetic evidence. So how
can we sort of conceptualize synthesizing

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.380
all this information? So I'm actually an
anthropologist by training, despite the

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.744
fact that I do genetics, and so I like to
sort of begin with the paleo-anthropology

00:07:56.744 --> 00:08:01.450
and that's what we're going to do right
now. So there's a fantastic amount of

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:06.410
information that's been excavated from the
fossil record. And some of this

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.210
information comes in the form of bones,
right? Like we've seen earlier on the

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:15.360
talk. And on the right here, you have a
fossil cranium from Hurso, Ethiopia that

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.600
was dug up. And it looks
like...morphologically, it's very similar

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:28.210
to modern humans. So the front part of the
skull is actually tucked in underneath the

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:34.180
brow ridge. The skull is actually pretty
short from front to back. The brain size

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.320
is, of course, equivalent to what you
would see in contemporary human

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.000
populations today. And if we put flesh on
this individual, they would probably look

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.340
relatively similar to other human sapiens
around the world. However, so we know that

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.770
there was morphologically individuals that
were probably similar to Homo sapiens

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:58.240
walking around Africa at least 150,000
years ago. But in fact there's a lot of

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.240
additional information that can be gleamed
from stone tools. So, there is a phrase

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.700
that's called the "middle stone age." And
the middle stone age refers, at least

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:13.240
roughly to 250,000 years ago to 50,000
years ago. And on this other map, what you

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:19.490
see are sites in Africa where middle stone
age artifacts have been recovered. So we

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:25.690
know that hominin populations were living
in these areas of Africa during this time

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.720
period. And what you'll notice, right, is
that there is maybe not that many examples

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.020
of this beautifully reconstructed skull
from all over Africa, but there are many,

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:39.750
many geographic locations on this map that
actually date back to the middle stone

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.970
age. And so what does that mean? So that
means of course that there were lots of

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.950
hominins walking around the face of Africa
during this time period. And in fact

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.450
there's also good evidence from North
Africa as well, even though it's cut off

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:58.970
in this particular map. And so let's just
kind of make a little schematic and start

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.470
to think about this. So if I look back
into Africa 150,000 years ago, 200,000

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:10.580
years ago, I know that there are Homo
sapien-like populations, broadly speaking,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.120
that exist in different parts of the
landscape. And so we can ask a relatively

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.210
simple question, "Were these populations
structured?" That means, are they

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.580
different from one another? So perhaps we
have populations in North Africa, East

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.920
Africa and Southern Africa. There is less
information from Central Africa for

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.590
various reasons. And these environments
may have been very different from one

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:39.320
another. So you might have had a cool,
Mediterranean climate up in North Africa

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.920
and then a very hot desert-like climate,
let's say, in Southern Africa. And the

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.090
question then is, are these populations
really separate from one another? Or are

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.760
individuals moving in between them? So
population geneticists like to refer to

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:58.540
this concept as population structure. So
let me just explain what that is briefly.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:04.060
In this little schematic, we have a SNP,
or a single nucleotide polymorphism, up on

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:09.040
the top that either comes in red or
yellow. And we have two populations on

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.690
either side of this river and we can see
that they are very different from one

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:17.320
another. So individuals on one side of the
river carry only the red allele, and

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.340
individuals on the other side of the river
only carry the yellow allele. And this is

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.520
structured populations, or populations
where there are strong differences in

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.980
allele frequency. And this is in contrast,
down to the bottom, of populations which

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.460
are carrying both the purple and the
orange alleles because there is migration

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.760
between these two populations or gene
flow, if you refer to your little glossary

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.380
on the handout, and this is because I've
given them a nice little bridge so people

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:50.620
can walk across and migrate. So, we can
just sort of take that example and apply

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.110
it to the rest of Africa as well. So, were
these populations structured at 200,000

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.860
and 150,000 years ago? Or was there
actually what we call "panmixia" or lots

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:06.130
of migration among the different
sup-populations? And I think we have an

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.540
actual answer to this particular question,
but it's somewhat complicated to infer, in

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:16.110
fact. And one thing to point out is that
in either of these scenarios, if you're

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.160
thinking back to what the landscape would
have looked like 200,000 years ago, means

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.470
that if I went and sampled individuals
from across the African landscape, their

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.520
common ancestor, in terms of their
genetics, would have been very old. It

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.640
would actually pre-date 150,000 years ago
or 200,000 years ago. In order to

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:42.720
understand why that is, you have to again
take a little mini-class in population

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.790
genetics here and think about the
difference between populations and genes.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.250
So this is what we call a "gene genealogy"
which is represented by these little

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.480
lineages right here. And these lineages
exist within these two different

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.380
populations, okay? So we can sort of trace
back the common ancestry of a given

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:07.320
genetic segment to where that individual
shares a common ancestor. And these common

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.710
ancestors exist in some ancestral
population which I'm going to then let

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.800
evolve through time. So now, we have this
common ancestral population and there's

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.110
been some sort of divergence and is
diverging to the blue and orange

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.970
populations. And you can see that these
gene genealogies, these genetic lineages,

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:30.290
are sort of splitting nicely into the blue
and orange population. And then finally,

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.760
at the present day, or down here. You
know, I might go and sample individuals

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:39.010
from the orange population and the blue
population and then ask when their common

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:43.650
ancestor was, okay? And that common
ancestor is indicated up here just like in

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:48.750
a normal phylogeny. The key thing to
remember actually when you're looking at

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:54.040
that is that the common ancestor pre-dates
the population divergence, okay? And this

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.200
is the case for most of the low side that
we would look at in the human genome. So,

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.670
the common ancestor must be older than the
population divergence. So then, we can

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.800
ask, "How old are the common genetic
lineages within human population?" So I'm

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.290
going to do this for a relatively simple
locus, the Y-chromosome, right? So the

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.760
Y-chromosome again is just passed on
between father and son. And one of the

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.310
nice things about the Y-chromosome is that
it's relatively small, so it's easy to go

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:27.610
in and sequence it from many individuals.
So, a few years ago, we captured about 10

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.440
megabases of the Y-chromosome from a
variety of individuals across human

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.810
populations and we actually had a strong
focus here on sampling African populations

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.880
because that's what I'm obsessed with, is
African populations. And what you'll see

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.170
is all the African individuals are sort of
on the bottom half of this segment and

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:50.100
you're just looking at a normal gene
genealogy or phylogeny that's been flipped

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.300
on it's side. So the common ancestor is
right here and then each one of these

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:59.760
lineages represents a single individual's
Y-chromosome that was sampled from a man.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:05.020
Now the first thing obviously to notice is
that individuals from outside of Africa

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.400
have very little genetic diversity on
their Y-chromosomes compared to

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.300
individuals from Africa. And you can
easily see that by their relatively short

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.870
branch lengths up here. So these are all
the out of African individuals, okay? So

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.870
people from Cambodia, people from the
Americas, people from Europe and so on.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:27.390
And instead if I look within Africa, I see
individuals that carry really, really long

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:32.000
branches, okay? So for example,
individuals from West Africa and North

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.890
Africa diverge around here. And
individuals that are from these African

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.240
hunter-gatherer populations, which are
particularly special, carry

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:45.650
extraordinarily long branches all the way
back to the common ancestor. So that graph

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.110
can be a little bit hard to read for some
people who are not geneticists so I've

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:53.670
tried to make a schematic. If we look at
the time to the common ancestor and we try

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:59.200
to date, in years, how long ago that might
have been, we can kind of put an upper

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.990
bound on the population divergence among
all human populations. And so when we do

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.860
this with the Y-chromosome, what you
actually see is that the upper bound on

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:14.480
population divergence would have been
around 150,000 years ago plus or minus a

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.620
couple of tens of thousands of years,
okay? So we're actually seeing relatively

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.900
shallow divergence among contemporary
human populations. And with a little bit

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.990
of additional modeling we can actually
say, "Well, which population diverged

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:32.940
first from all other human populations and
when was that?" And at least looking at

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.130
the Y-chromosome sequence it's most likely
to have been these Khoisan populations

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:42.680
from Southern Africa and we date it to
approximately around 90,000 years ago.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.860
Now, you could say, "Well that's just the
Y-chromosome. It's just a single locus and

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.610
has this bizarre pattern of inheritance
from father to son." So independently,

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:57.160
there was additional papers published by
Renaut [SP] and also Veeramah

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.590
approximately about a year before we
published our Y-chromosome work, and they

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.770
actually independently came up with a very
similar estimate on this time of

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.350
population divergence between these
Southern African hunter-gatherer groups

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:14.830
and the other humans within Africa. And
that time of population divergence is

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:19.370
approximately 100,000 to 120,000 years
ago. So again, what you're seeing is that

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:24.600
the gene genealogies certainly go back in
time, but the actual time depth of this

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:30.050
population divergence is quite shallow,
okay? And if we try to map that on to

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:35.560
these sort of schematics of Africa, what
would that mean? It means that neither of

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:41.630
those two maps that I showed you before
could really represent the actual true

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:46.510
ancestors to the human population. So
something must have happened to reduce the

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:52.050
genetic diversity between 200,000 years
ago and 100,000 years ago. And so let's

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.920
just think for a moment what that might
have been or what that could have looked

00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.430
like. So one hypothesis could be that
there was a strong population bottleneck

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:05.220
during this time period, 200,000 to
100,000 years ago. And maybe that

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.310
bottleneck was associated for example with
climate. So populations actually could

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:14.810
have moved from one region to another
because of climatic fluctuation. And in

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.840
this case, I've had all the individuals
that are living in Eastern Africa and

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:23.030
Northern Africa just sort of trickle down
and move into Southern Africa where things

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.670
were nicer during that time period. That
doesn't have to necessarily be the only

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:32.980
location, it's just one example. This
movement into a refugium would likely have

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:37.620
been accompanied by a population
bottleneck as you can imagine. If things

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.710
are stressful in a given environment then
usually what we see is a reduction in

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:46.160
population size. Conversely, you could
also think about it in a slightly

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.420
different way, maybe there was some
stressful climatic experience and that

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.620
these other populations simply went
extinct, okay? So you have local

00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.490
extinction events for example here in
Eastern Africa, or Northern Africa, and

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:05.780
only a population persists in one
geographic region again indicated here by

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.270
these little Xs in Southern Africa. Then
what would have happened, right? So then

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:17.470
at a 100,000 years ago, we know humans
began expanding again. So if they did sort

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:22.480
of localize to one specific place on the
African continent, what would that then

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:28.730
look like? They would have expanded into
these other regions again, but maybe they

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:33.190
absorbed individuals that persisted there.
So maybe there wasn't complete extinction

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:38.740
events in these other geographic regions,
or indeed maybe all these individuals that

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.460
were living in Eastern and Northern Africa
did completely go extinct and we don't see

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:49.020
their signatures in the human genome. So
this I want to sort of end by emphasizing

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:55.390
that this is a single origin model for the
modern human species, but it fits the data

00:19:55.390 --> 00:20:01.120
actually quite nicely because of this
shallow divergence we see in the genetic

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.090
lineages. And I will emphasize that there
is a lot of additional sequencing that

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.940
needs to be done particularly in African
populations were we probably have the

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:14.590
fewest samples of full human genomes that
have been sequenced. And we really need to

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:19.400
actually think explicitly about testing
these models in a context that connects

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.931
the genetic data with the
paleo-anthropological information. And I

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:27.550
will stop right there. Thank you very
much.
