1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,730
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,760
Some people are failing into
people being really into that. Yes.

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:07,200
He just wants to be admired.
I,

4
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:12,180
I've known some women like that
who are into dating trolls, trolls,

5
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:14,940
because they've never had a woman like
that. And they're like, don't fuck.

6
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:15,774
And they're just,

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,610
my sister had a friend like that to her
friend was only in guys that she knew

8
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:23,760
she could do better. Oh, that's
fantastic. She wanted that.

9
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:27,130
She wanted them to worshiper. Well,
there's that. There's a state,

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,980
apparently there's a psychology where a
lot of men will overfeed their wives and

11
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:35,600
get them super fat so that they
don't step out on him. Oh Geez.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,880
There's a lot of those subconscious
behaviors that go on. God,

13
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:43,350
why are people so God damn crazy? I don't
know. Trauma, you know that Carl Young,

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,220
is it the Carl Young, uh, fucking, uh,

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,240
a line that says that, which we
don't work out in our subconscious.

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,980
We will act out as fate in our lives.
How about that?

17
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,890
Cause you will relive patterns.
You'll relive trauma.

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,670
You will relive these patterns. Yeah.
And you'll do it on your own terms.

19
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:06,120
And you'll wonder why you keep far.
Why do you keep dating the same person?

20
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:08,070
Why do you keep falling
into the same problem?

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,400
Why after two years is this go
bad? What? What is that? Well,

22
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:16,401
there's a way to actually creatively f
at least sit with that and observe it and

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,910
be aware of it. That's what
therapy does. Yeah. Goodness.

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,220
You make the unconscious conscious.

25
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:26,730
It will direct your life and you will
call it fate. What a great quote. Wow.

26
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,030
Until you make the unconscious
conscious. Yeah. I mean,

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,920
there's a lot of fucking
strings pulling on.

28
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:34,020
You will direct your life
and you will call it fate.

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,730
Knowing your own darkness is the best
method for dealing with the darkness of

30
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:42,440
other people. Yeah. Ooh, well that's
what Nietzsche, that's why I like niches,

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,340
niches, niches. Idea was like, look man,
you can have these false models of life,

32
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,460
which is a lot of times life is a
bitch, right? And you're not going to,

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,070
you're not going to be able to
compete or you don't want it.

34
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,950
So what you'll do is you'll go, it's
okay. Meek will inherit the earth.

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,170
That's all right, I'll, I'll, hey, you
have money. But is he happy? Is He happy?

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,350
You know, there's a lot. We make
all of us do this. We make excuses,

37
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:08,900
not live our best life. And he was
like, Nah, live dangerously. And, uh,

38
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,180
try to be the best you can be. Just work
your ass off. And if you have to die,

39
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,210
if you have to take risks and die,
leave a good luck in corpse.

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,580
Is the idea of turn your
life into a fucking circus.
