DORIE GREENSPAN:
Thank you so much.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.095
Hi, thanks for coming.

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:08.720
This is the first
time you're seeing me

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.790
but it's not the last
because I'm moving in.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.390
Yeah.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.764
I like it here,
except that I was

00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:18.000
told that I would be called--
what was it-- a Graygler?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.630
Graygler-- yeah.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.970
I don't know, that might
keep me away, not sure.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.930
So this is the 43rd
year since my first trip

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.510
to Paris, the trip that
just changed everything--

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.300
everything.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.220
From the minute I stepped foot
on Paris soil, my life changed.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.140
And my relationship
to my mother changed.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.180
Previous to that trip, I
thought my mother was swell,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.540
I thought she was perfect.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.920
One day into that trip, I
realized that my perfect mother

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.770
had made a tragic,
tragic mistake--

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.100
she had had me in Brooklyn.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.290
I was meant to be born in Paris,
there's no question about it.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.590
And I keep thinking
about all that I

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.670
missed by not being
born in Paris.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.960
I mean can you imagine how
charming it would sound

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.130
if I were speaking to
you with a French accent?

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.520
I mean it be great.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.070
If I had been French, I would
know how to tie a scarf.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.630
It would be-- the scarf
gene would be in my DNA

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.030
and I wouldn't have
had to buy this.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.380
This is the how to tie a scarf
deck of cards from Hermes.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.390
I also would have known the
proper way to cut cheese.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.700
The French are very fussy
about how cheese is cut.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.840
So you know a slice of
brie, kind of triangular

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.860
slice-- cut that point
off, call it the nose

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.700
and you'll never be invited
to anyone's home again.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.825
So to make sure that I still
got invited I bought this.

00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:57.450
It looks like your
geometry textbook,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.970
but it's called
"L'Art de Couper la

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.460
Fromage"-- the art
of cutting cheese.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.590
I was serious about learning.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.220
I would have known the
difference between boeuf

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.930
bourguignon and boeuf a la mode.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.920
A la mode's one big hunk if
beef and bourguignon is just

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.620
little chunks.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.060
I might even have
been able-- maybe,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.700
maybe-- to walk in high
heels on cobblestone--

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.870
all the French women can.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.350
I mean it's like they
get the scarf gene

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.900
and they get the
high heels gene.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.520
I have none of that.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.350
But had I been born
French, there's

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.680
one thing I wouldn't
have learned to do,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.910
and that would
have been to bake.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.430
The bottom line-- actually the
punchline-- is French people

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.020
don't bake.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.700
They don't bake
anything tricky, they

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.620
don't bake anything complicated.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.430
They don't bake-- they buy.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.280
So here's the line
outside of Pierre Herme.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.820
My favorite is this woman
over here with her hand

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.810
out like I want
money for desserts.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.940
For the first 20
years or so so-- so

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.200
I've been living in Paris
part time for about 20 years--

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.560
and for the first I'd say maybe
5 or 10 years that I was there,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.230
no one invited us to dinner.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.090
You have to really get to know
French people to be invited--

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.790
is anybody here French?

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.860
Oh, I can say anything I want.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.150
OK.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.800
It takes-- this is
changing, but it really

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.490
takes a long time for
someone to invite you home.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.550
And so you'll meet in a cafe
for a drink or for coffee,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.060
you'll go to a
restaurant together,

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.630
and then eventually you'll
be invited to someone's home

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.600
for dinner.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.150
And when you are, they will
make a fabulous meal for you

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.670
and they will cap it
with beautiful desserts.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.210
So you might get an eclair.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.760
So these eclair are from a
shop called L'atelier de Genie,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.700
and the shop sells only eclairs,
or maybe a strawberry cake

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.110
like this.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.840
This is from Hugo and Victor.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.200
Or the ispahan, which is Pierre
Herme's famous, famous cake.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.620
So it's a macaroon.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.470
It's rose, the cream inside
is rose, there's fresh lychee,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.720
and there's a raspberry
trim-- fresh raspberries.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.439
Or do you love this?

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:31.980
This looks like this
would be perfect

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.270
for Halloween, actually.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.805
Pauline, maybe you
should go for this.

00:04:36.805 --> 00:04:40.390
This is a lemon tart
with meringue on top.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.470
Or you would get macaroon.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.550
Macaroon are very,
very popular in Paris.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.020
So these are from Pierre Herme
and these are macaroon from

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.550
McDonald's.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.800
McDonald's has a
cafe and they have

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.130
Laduree make their
macaroon for them.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.970
And I'm hoping when
I go back somebody is

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.596
going to treat me to this.

00:04:59.596 --> 00:05:00.630
Isn't this gorgeous?

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.590
This is also a
Pierre Herme dessert.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.060
It's called Venus and
it's apple and quince,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.380
and that's all fresh apple
forming the flowers on top.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.840
So I loved-- of course, I mean
who wouldn't-- I loved all

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.740
of these very fancy, very
polished pastries that I was

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.630
treated to at friends' homes,
and they make me feel pampered,

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.810
they made me feel
truly like a guest.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.680
But at some point I
started to wonder,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.921
what are my friends having for
dessert when I'm not there?

00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:34.920
You know, what are they
doing on a Tuesday night

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.520
when the kids come
home from school

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.200
and have homework and mom's been
working all day and dad's been

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.300
working all day and they're
not having this for dessert?

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.400
Not only does mom not
have time to go buy it,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.250
this stuff is really expensive.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.305
So this little
lemon meringue tart

00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:57.690
is 20 euros, so what, about $27.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.800
This gorgeous cheesecake
is only about this big

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.720
and it's 27 Euro.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.680
And one little macaroon
from Pierre Herme

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.400
is 2 Euro 10, or
something over $3.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.820
So I figured this isn't
what they were doing.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.520
I already knew that
they weren't whipping up

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.740
complicated desserts,
because one night I

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.790
had some Paris friends
over for dinner

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.580
and I made a chocolate cake.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.830
This is not my chocolate
cake, but it might as well

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.690
have been because
this was the style.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.630
This is my friend
Betty's and it's

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.320
a recipe from "Baking Chez
Moi." but I brought out

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.090
a cake like this and
I put it on the table,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.080
and one of my friends said,
where did you buy that?

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.680
And I said, I made it.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.780
And around the table the
response was the same-- why?

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.140
Why would you do
something like that?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.370
That's what pastry
shops are for.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.060
So it was only
after really years

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.066
of living in Paris
that I-- you know,

00:07:07.066 --> 00:07:09.350
I was having friends
to dinner at that point

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.570
and we were being invited to
friends' homes for dinner,

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.830
and it was only then that
I got a taste of what

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.670
they were making.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:22.005
And I came to think of
it as a parallel universe

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:25.550
to all of those
beautiful patisserie,

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.280
pastry shop desserts
that I showed you.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.800
Here's what my
friends were serving

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.300
at home and to their dearest
friends-- moi, one of them--

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.320
loaf cakes.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.900
These are called-- I love this--
in France, anything that's

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.810
shaped in a loaf pan
is called a cake.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.790
And cakes like these,
which are good keepers,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.320
are called either weekend cakes
or gateaux voyage-- travel

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.950
cakes.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.910
And so even if the travel is as
far as the park for a picnic,

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.870
this is the kind of cake
that French people will make.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.180
These are little
matcha financiers.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.930
It's my version of a
traditional French pastry

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.359
that's really easy to make
and that a French person would

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:11.900
make at home.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:19.297
So financiers were created in
late 19th century in Paris.

00:08:19.297 --> 00:08:21.130
There was a pastry chef
who had a shop right

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.690
across from the stock exchange,
and every afternoon-- see,

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.020
they didn't have Pauline
and Charlie's and they

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.590
couldn't just go for
pastries on campus--

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.169
so they would cross the
street, go to the pastry shop,

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.650
and get something to
eat as their treat.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.470
But they were always
complaining because it

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.150
took too long to eat
what they bought.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.809
They needed a knife and
fork, and sometimes it's

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.720
spotted their ties if
they weren't careful.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.920
So they wanted,
essentially, grab and go.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.375
And so the owner of the shop,
his name was [? Lanya, ?] I

00:08:53.375 --> 00:08:56.840
think, created the financier.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.940
It can be eaten out of
hand, a couple of bites

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.620
and it's finished-- no
crumbs, no knife, no fork.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.150
And he named it for his
stockbroker clients,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
he called them financier.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.140
He made them originally
in ingot shaped bars

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.850
so they would kind of be
familiar with that shape.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.160
I make mine in mini
muffin tins-- easier.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.410
And he made them as
rich as his clients.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.340
There's a huge amount
of butter in them.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.170
Palmiers, so this
is puff pastry.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.290
No French person has ever
made puff pastry at home,

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.820
I'm convinced of it.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.410
They go to the corner market,
they buy it ready made,

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.480
so do I. They buy all their
tart dough ready made.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.860
So this is really just an
arts and crafts project.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:56.010
You buy the puff pastry, sugar,
fold it, bake it-- beautiful.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.990
These are cookies,
French cookies.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.540
So these were given to
me by Edouard Bobin, who

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.780
owns a great little bistro
in Paris called Pantruche.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.830
And he had served a little
hazelnut cookie with coffee

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.116
after a meal, and I said,
oh Edouard, I love these,

00:10:13.116 --> 00:10:14.240
can you give me the recipe?

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.865
He said, I'll give
you a better recipe.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.670
I'll give you a
recipe for cookies.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.790
I though, I don't want
your recipe for cookies.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.860
When the French
say cookies, they

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.590
mean only one thing--
Toll House cookies,

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:27.640
chocolate chip cookies.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.310
That to them is a cookie.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.370
And so when Edouard gave me
this recipe, I looked at it

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.490
and I thought, he just
gave me the Toll House,

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.060
you know, the back of the
Nestle's chocolate chips

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.550
bag cookie.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.850
It had the brown sugar in just
about the same proportions,

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.290
it had white sugar, but
these are really different.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.530
These have almond flour
in them, and almond flour

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.570
is so common in
France that if you

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:58.380
go to the corner convenience
shop, the one that's open 24/7,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.110
you can buy almond
flour in that shop.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.622
Maybe you'll get
a creme caramel.

00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:05.580
This one-- this are all
pictures from the book,

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:11.140
by the way, because these
are recipes from the book.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.090
A creme caramel-- this
one is milk chocolate.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.740
This was one of the
recipes that surprised

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.717
me the most when
I discovered this.

00:11:21.717 --> 00:11:24.050
This is-- I think of it as
the French equivalent of Rice

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.350
Krispies treats.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:30.330
They're called desert
roses, rose de sables,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.130
which is the name for
gypsum, and they're

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.720
made with corn flakes.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.760
So it's corn flakes,
dried fruit, nuts,

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.800
and melted chocolate.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.989
And so it's a great
thing to make for kids.

00:11:42.989 --> 00:11:44.905
You can make it and put
it in the refrigerator

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:46.110
and it will keep forever.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.610
And in fancy
restaurants in Paris,

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.290
they're sometimes made so
that they're really tiny

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.850
and they become the
after dessert dessert.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.710
So they're on a platter
after you've had two desserts

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.250
and when coffee comes around.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.480
This is actually one of my
favorite recipes in the book.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.210
So I loved these desserts
that my friends were making

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.880
and I did-- you know
I was grateful to them

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.580
for making them.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.770
It really made me feel
like one of their family.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.280
And so you can only imagine
how I felt when I asked them

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.360
for the recipes
and they said no.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.410
These were my friends.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:33.600
So I'd say, I love this
cake, may I have the recipe,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.510
and they'd say, no, no, you
don't want it--too simple,

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.160
it's too simple for
you, you don't want it.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.390
And I'd ask and they'd
say, too simple.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.630
No, no, this one's not for you.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.110
So I thought maybe this
was-- all the years that I've

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:52.560
been in Paris as a
faux Frenchwoman,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.330
I thought maybe I've missed
this little point of etiquette.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.455
Maybe there's some
ritual to this.

00:13:00.455 --> 00:13:06.260
The asker asks, the askee
refuses, the asker asks again,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.170
the askee refuses, the asker
gets down on her knees,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.980
begs, and finally gets it.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.680
Well finally, I did
get recipes and I

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.100
realized that my
friends' modesty was--

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.250
I'm taking it as modesty--
was actually genuine.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:28.080
The recipes were so simple
but they were also so perfect.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.460
So here's a recipe
for a gateaux Savoie,

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:38.620
which is one of the oldest cake
recipes in the pastry cannon.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.160
And this was given to
me by a friend, Martine.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.180
It's normally made
in a savarin mold,

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.840
so what we would think of
as a Jello mold-- you know,

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.750
just an oval ring.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:54.500
And I made it in a bundt pan
when I got back to America,

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.120
thinking that it would be so
much easier for us to find

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.160
these pans, though I do
have my mother's Jello pan.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.490
My mother did not
bake, she did not cook,

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.370
she used the oven
as her bread box.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.480
But she made Jello.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.320
So I have her mold.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.550
I could have done this.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.670
I love this picture.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.790
So these are canistrelli.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.360
They're cookies from
Corsica and they

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.020
were given to me by
my friend Leticia.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:28.880
And they are made with olive
oil, white wine, and pastis,

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.860
which is an anise
flavored liqueur.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.070
And they're may be
totally by hand.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.140
So I love anything
that you can just

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.490
get your fingers
in and play with.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.420
And so you start with a fork,
you finish with your hands,

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.010
and you can just bake them
in any shape you want.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.640
And they're really
great and they're not

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.410
sweet, really not sweet.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.010
So you can have
them as a dessert,

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.490
you can have them with
fruit, or you can have them

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.410
with a drink, which makes
them, I think, super nice.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:03.950
And then this is the orange cake
from Bernard's sister-in-law,

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.252
Odille.

00:15:05.252 --> 00:15:06.710
Odille came to our
house for dinner

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.210
and she didn't know
what to bring us

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.460
as-- it was the second
time we had met her

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.870
and the first time she
had come to our home--

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.440
and she didn't know what
to bring as a hostess gift

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.840
and she brought
recipes, and I thought,

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.490
that's the best gift
you can give someone.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.780
Right, so handwritten,
beautiful, and this

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.720
was one of them.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.120
And so this is a really
very plain, very simple

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.140
cake that get soaked
with orange syrup.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.180
And when I was testing it with
my recipe tester, Marry Dodd,

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.050
the wonderful, we
thought wouldn't it

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.660
be fun to put
oranges on top of it.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.550
And so we poached oranges--
you could do oranges,

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.930
grapefruits, blood
oranges, tangerines--

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.640
we poached the
oranges and then use

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.020
that syrup to soak the cake.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.270
And this is one of my
favorite recipes in the book.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:03.710
So this is Laurent's slow
roasted spiced pineapple.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:08.550
Laurent-- well, Laurent
is not my hairdresser,

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.120
he's actually Patricia
Wells's hairdresser--

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.580
Isabel cuts my hair.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.800
So in Paris there's
Isabel at the hair salon,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.180
and Isabel never cooks but
she's great for restaurant

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.470
recommendations.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.580
Right next to her is Laurent.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.510
Laurent cooks all
the time when he

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:29.240
has time, which is the weekends.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.320
So after the
weekend he comes in,

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.190
he's got his pictures on
his phone of what he made,

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.870
and so I try and make
an appointment for right

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.020
after the weekend so I can
see what Laurent has made.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.140
And one day I came in
and the Laurent said,

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.720
I made this pineapple
for dessert.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.267
And I looked at it and
it just spoke to me.

00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:48.600
And I said, how did you make it?

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.960
He said, pineapple-- cut it,
some jam, some orange juice,

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:59.540
some booze, spices, whatever
you've got-- just really,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.040
anything you've got
in the cupboard.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.200
And I said, little bit
more info, like how?

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.319
You just put it in the
oven, couple of hours,

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.260
baste it now and then.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.790
I said, OK, how much jam?

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.290
He said, jam.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.540
I said, how much orange juice?

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.578
He said, like this.

00:17:14.578 --> 00:17:16.619
I said, how much alcohol,
what kind of alcoholic,

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.760
do you need to use alcohol?

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.490
He said, well you
know, rum, Armagnac,

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.229
cognac-- whatever you
have-- more orange juice

00:17:24.229 --> 00:17:25.770
if you don't want
to use the alcohol.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:26.430
I said, how much?

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.554
He said, about the same
amount as the orange juice.

00:17:28.554 --> 00:17:30.320
So I went home and I made it.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.150
It was tasty but I knew it
wasn't right so I went back

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.060
and I asked Laurent.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.640
He said, I told you--
you know, like jam.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.930
He wasn't in a good mood.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.560
So the third time I asked him,
I said, Laurent, I made it with,

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.980
like, three or four
tablespoons of jam.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.030
He said, no, the whole jar.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.690
You need the whole jar.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.780
I said, you didn't
quite mention that.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.760
He said, you should've known.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:02.000
So it's the whole jar of jam
and about this much orange.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.740
So I went home and I actually
turned it into a recipe.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.230
But it is the kind
of desert that you

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.650
can make with truly anything
you've gotten the house

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.730
and there's always extra syrup.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:17.350
And it's fabulous
over ice cream.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:21.920
And so this is the other recipe
that really surprised me.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.590
This is the Mocha DuPont.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.370
Forty years ago, when we went
to Paris for the first time,

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.540
we met Martine Collet.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.360
About 10 years after that,
she married Bernard Collet.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.410
Well, her name was
Martine, I've already

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.755
forgotten her maiden name.

00:18:39.755 --> 00:18:41.090
Martine, we call her Martine.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.200
And she married
Bernard Collet and they

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.010
are best friends in Paris,
we see them all the time.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.450
And for 30 years, Bernard
has been telling me

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:53.150
about his birthday cake
called the Mocha Dupont.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.850
And I said, and what is it?

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.710
He said, oh you
know, it's the cake

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.910
that my mother used
to make for me,

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.040
and it's called Dupont
because she got the recipe

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.200
from Madame Dupont,
who lived next door.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.930
I said, we're
really good friends,

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.430
Id like to taste
your birthday cake.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.860
And his wife said--
you know what

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.310
she said-- it's not for
you, it's too simple.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.330
I said, come on.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.940
So when I was
working on this book

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.770
and when I had had most of the
recipes put together, I said,

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.090
you know I don't want to do this
book without Bernard's birthday

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.740
cake.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.880
Please tell me about it.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.420
This is an icebox cake.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.240
I mean this is just--
I couldn't believe it.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.140
These are petit
beurre cookies, they

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.340
can be any kind of
cookie you want.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.280
They're soaked in espresso-- I
don't know why you would soak

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.970
a cake in espresso
for a two-year-old,

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.160
but c'est la vie en France.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.860
So it's espresso soaked
cookies with a little espresso

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.755
buttercream and you
just constructed

00:19:52.755 --> 00:19:54.010
it any way you want.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:55.750
And when I made
it the first time,

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.367
Bernard said, it's not right.

00:19:58.367 --> 00:19:59.450
And I said, what did I do?

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.520
He said, we like
to put the icing

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.594
along the side of the cake.

00:20:06.594 --> 00:20:09.409
I said, OK, fine.

00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.950
And I did it.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.450
He said, and we like
chocolate shavings on top.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.250
So I did that, too.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.920
But when we did
it for the book I

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.250
wanted everybody to see
the pretty scalloped edges

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.750
of the cookies.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.400
And so I showed him the picture
in the book and he said,

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.660
that is not my birthday cake.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.424
I said, Bernard, I made it for
you so that you could taste it

00:20:30.424 --> 00:20:31.840
and you said it
was good, you said

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.080
it was just what you wanted.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.350
He said, yes, but it
didn't look like that.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:38.710
He said, you have revisited it.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:43.410
It is-- how would you say it--
[SPEAKING FRENCH] or something

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.260
like relooked.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.410
And I said, what bothers you?

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.860
The ice cream.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.170
We never had ice
cream with the cake.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.150
He's still a good friend.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.160
He's forgiven me.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.880
So because my friends
had been so generous

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.790
and they had given
me these recipes,

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.800
I wanted to create
recipes for them

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.060
and I wanted to play
with some of the classics

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.330
in French pastry.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:19.810
So this is my version
of a gateaux Basque.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.010
So a few years ago
Michael and I were-- oh,

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.480
it's more than a few years
ago because the recipe is

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.320
in "Around my French Table"--
we were traveling through

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.970
the Payee Basque, the
Basque country in France,

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:36.870
and we passed a sign that
said, Gateaux Basque Museum.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.980
If there's a museum devoted
to a cake, I have to go.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.590
Who wouldn't stop for this?

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.640
And we went to what we
thought was the museum

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.720
and we discovered that it
was really a cooking class.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.210
There were just rows
of, like, church pews,

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.110
and the place was
packed with people.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.660
And the chef was there with
a stack of dough like this,

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.450
and he made a gateaux Basque.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.950
He also did things that you're
not allowed to do in America.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:08.310
He grabbed a hunk of dough and
said, I want you to taste this,

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.100
and just passed this hunk around
so that every person grabbed

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.740
the hunk, right, and tasted it.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.470
Then he passed the cream
around, we all double dipped.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:17.540
It was tons of fun.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.490
So the traditional
gateaux Basque

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:26.420
is two layers of a pastry dough
that has baking powder in it.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.080
So a, it means it's really
forgiving-- no matter

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.350
what you do, it's going
to bake up beautifully.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.340
And two, the
texture is somewhere

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.240
between tart and cake.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.510
And in the traditional
gateaux Basque,

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.700
it's filled with either
pastry cream or cherry jam.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.920
And if it's filled
with cherry jam,

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.880
you use some of the pastry
to make a Basque cross

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.670
over the top so you can tell
you've got a jam cake, not

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:54.710
a cream one.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:58.720
So mine is filled with dried
fruits, nuts, and apples.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.480
It's a great fall dessert.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.190
And these are apple
croustades, so they're, again,

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.780
another kind of arts and
crafts project-- strips

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.480
of phyllo dough brushed with
butter, sprinkled with sugar,

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.630
and filled with sauteed apples.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:20.380
In the Perigord,
the southwest, this

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.730
is sometimes filled with
prunes, which is also nice.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:29.420
And I make a caramel
tart, which is not really

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:33.260
a riff on a classic,
but caramel is

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.840
like-- you find it
everywhere in France.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.770
I once said that I
wouldn't be surprised

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.060
if I walked into a drugstore
and found caramel toothpaste.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.080
It is like the
flavors of France,

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:48.550
and so this tart is kind of
an homage to French caramel.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.430
And when it's
strawberry season, you

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:55.850
see a fraisier, a strawberry
cake in just about every shop.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.950
And so this is my
version of the fraisier.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:04.081
The layers of cake are based
on a recipe for French yogurt

00:24:04.081 --> 00:24:04.580
cake.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.630
It's the only cake that
every French person

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.340
knows how to make by heart.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.920
Right, they know
the recipe by heart.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.820
Because they get yogurt,
pour it into a bowl,

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.050
clean out the yogurt
container, and then they

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.520
use it for the four, they
use it for the sugar.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.690
It's like a one,
two, three cake.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.580
And a yogurt cake
is the birthday cake

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.270
of choice in France, that's
what most French mothers make

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.706
for their kid's birthday.

00:24:29.706 --> 00:24:31.080
And they can make
it in any shape

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.380
and just stick some
candles on it-- it's great.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.170
So this one is made
with rose flavor.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.620
So the inspiration was that
ispahan that I showed you,

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:45.400
the rose macaroon with
the raspberries around it.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.730
So this is rose flavored
yogurt cake with a rose cream

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.460
and the strawberries
standing up,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.480
like a little forest
of strawberries,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.340
which is the traditional
way that fraisier is done.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.150
This looks more complicated
than it is to make at home.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.400
And then the buche noel.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.560
So this one is-- this is my
Franco American buche noel.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.970
It's gingerbread and the filling
is cinnamon cream cheese.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:15.620
So it's the buche
noel, the French form,

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.860
with kind of American flavors.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.530
And when I was in
Paris in September,

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:25.770
it was not only Fashion
Week, it was buche noel week,

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.720
and all the top pastry chefs
were showing their buches.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.410
And there was a press conference
and pictures were taken,

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:37.520
and then in November,
magazines and newspapers

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.000
will start showing-- it's
like a dream catalog.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.260
They'll show all the
pictures of the buche

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.040
so you can decide what you're
going to buy for Christmas.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.740
We're there for Christmas
usually so I always buy a buche

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.310
and I make a buche.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.240
And some recipes
I just invented,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.020
just because I was in Paris,
the ingredients were there,

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:57.830
and I wanted to.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.820
So these are granola
bars-- actually,

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.020
delicious granola
bars-- based on granola.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.710
And there's a recipe
for my granola

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.660
there that I started to
make for French friends.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.480
So I started to
make this granola

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.030
and I would bring it as house
gifts and people would say,

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.530
it's so great, I
love it, I love it.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.130
And I'd say, here's the
recipe, and then I'd say,

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.510
did you ever make it?

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.570
And they said, no, we
want you to do that.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.000
Would you do that for us?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.300
So I stopped giving
out the recipe.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:31.010
This is a blueberry
corn cream cheese tart.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.130
So about two years ago,
Philadelphia Cream Cheese

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.320
became the cult
ingredient in Paris.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.130
Before that time, I
used to have to bring it

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:41.070
on the plane with me.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.600
I would travel with 10
pounds of cream cheese

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.820
and I would travel with
Graham crackers, too.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.470
Now they can buy it themselves.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:52.410
So when it was like-- you would
see ads for it on bus stops

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:56.170
and on the buses themselves,
it was really a big deal.

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:59.500
And so I made this no
bake cream cheese filling

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.610
and I put it in a delicious
French pastry tart,

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.950
and then thought, I'm just
going to surprise them

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.070
a little bit-- them
being my French friends--

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.210
blueberry and corn,
and it turned out

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:14.600
to be something that
they truly loved.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:19.390
And then these little--
well, I caught them pielets.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.040
So they're little apple pies.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.320
They're filled with apples
and raisins and spice.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.220
And I said, look, don't you love
the idea of an American pie?

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.360
And my French friend
said, oh you mean a torte.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:38.820
A covered pie or a covered
tart is called a torte,

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:44.620
and so the French immediately
claimed this as their own.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.640
And some of the
recipes in the book

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:53.300
are recreations of things that
I love in French pastry shops.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:59.160
So this is the tart Tropezienne,
and years ago Pierre Herme--

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.110
I worked with Pierre Herme,
we did two books together--

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:08.680
and at that time he wasn't yet
known as the Picasso of pastry

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.820
or the Karl Lagerfeld
of macaroon.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.220
Now he's got a million
names-- sometimes

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.600
referred to as
the God of Pastry.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.840
So it was Pierre who
said to me, have you

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.610
ever tasted a tart Tropezienne?

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:26.490
I had no idea what it was
and he said, it's mythic,

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:29.440
it's absolutely mythic.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.500
And as usual, he was right.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.360
So it's like a brioche.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.370
It's a yeast, very rich
butter and egg dough.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.650
This is a little bit less
rich than regular brioche

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.300
and it's filled with cream.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.130
And it was invented
in Saint Tropez, which

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.090
is why it's called Tropezienne.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:53.090
And the story that
goes with it is

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:58.420
that when Brigitte
Bardot was filming

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:04.550
"And God Created Woman,"
this was her first film,

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:08.930
Roger Vadim was the director, it
was his first film, Jean-Louis

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:10.630
Trintignant, Alaine [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:14.330
I mean all of these people
who became great stars were

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:18.400
in Saint Tropez filming
and they used the caterer

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.090
across the street to
supply the craft table,

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.100
to bring food to the set.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:28.060
And it was Alexandra Mika,
who had come from Poland,

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.320
and every day he would
bring a tart Tropezienne

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.200
because the crew just loved it.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.520
And it was Brigitte
Bardot who said to him--

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.810
I forgot what he used to call
it, but it was Bardot who said,

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.760
you should call it
the tort Tropezienne.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:48.590
Now when you go to Saint
Tropez, every other shop

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:52.660
is a shop that sells only
tart Tropezienne-- little ones

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.620
like this, big ones like this.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.160
It is like the
food of St Tropez,

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:01.960
but there's only one Mika,
and that's the label.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.070
When he packages you've
got Brigitte Bardot.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.640
Somebody called me the Bardot
of baking the other day.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:11.800
That made me happy.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.290
This is an Alsatian tart
flambe, but a sweet one.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:19.520
And Michael-- hello, Michael--
that's my husband over there.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.650
We were in Alsace, in
the east of France,

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:32.860
and the tart flambe
is a signature.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.750
It's a specialty
there, usually made

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:42.560
with fromage blanc,
caramelized onions, and bacon.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.720
But we stopped at a restaurant
called Flam and Co. that

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.200
served only tart flambe and
served savory and sweet.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.074
And so we each had
a savory tart flambe

00:30:52.074 --> 00:30:53.865
and then we were going
to have the dessert.

00:30:53.865 --> 00:30:58.420
But by that time, I had asked
the server so many questions

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.760
that when I said, we'd
like an apple tart flambe,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.490
he said to me, would you
like to make it yourself?

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:09.770
And so I got to be with
the tart flambee-er

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.460
and watch how she made
it and put it into-- they

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.610
had a wood fired oven,
which was fabulous.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.650
And so as soon as I
came back, I started

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:21.350
to figure out a recipe so that
I could make this at home,

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:24.090
and so can you.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.560
And this is the grapefruit tart.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.900
Remember the beautiful
strawberry dessert

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.720
that I showed you earlier
from Hugo and Victor?

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:36.200
This is a version of
their grapefruit tart.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:41.330
So the filling is a grapefruit
and Campari cream-- very, very

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.910
light cream-- delicious.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.000
With Ruby grapefruits.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.130
And these are crackle
topped cream puffs.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.780
I think everyone should learn
how to make cream puff dough.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.830
It's like a life skill--
you learn how to drive,

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.540
you learn how to make
cream puff dough.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.640
It's important.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.010
These days, there
are cream puff shops.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.610
The cream puffs are made on a
regular basis during the day,

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.980
and then when you come in they
fill them for you on the spot.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.610
And where cream puffs
used to be glazed,

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.790
they now have this crackle top.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:20.370
It's kind of an innovation
on a desert that's

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:24.270
got to be more
than 500 years old.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:30.320
So it's a little almond cookie,
and you roll the cookie dough,

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.110
you roll it really, really
thin and you cut a circle,

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.930
and right before you put the
cream puff into the oven,

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.820
you put the disk on top.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.460
And it breaks apart as
the cream puff puffs.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.270
And these are
cream puffs crackle

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:51.040
topped from a shop
called Popelini,

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:55.370
after the Italian pastry chef
who came with Catherine de

00:32:55.370 --> 00:33:00.640
Medici to Paris and introduced
cream puffs to France.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.090
They're beautiful, aren't they?

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.140
Don't they remind you of
the sprinkles cupcakes?

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.860
Yeah.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.920
And these are my bubble eclair.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.440
So because it's unlikely
that I'll be making eclair

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.730
like I showed you before,
and maybe you will,

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.010
but I thought it would
be fun because eclairs

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:22.120
are so delicious, to just do
something that would be super

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.520
simple and everybody would be
able to make them and enjoy

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.020
them.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.760
And so it's cream
puff dough just

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.250
scooped with an ice cream
scoop or a cookie scoop,

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.430
and the scoops are placed
close enough together

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.465
that when they bake
they bake together.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:43.065
And macaroon-- so "Baking
Chez Moi" is my 11th cookbook.

00:33:43.065 --> 00:33:48.420
I have never put a recipe
for macaroon in a cookbook.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.340
I thought everyone
should just buy them.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.910
I did one recipe, it was
Pierre Herme's recipe,

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.620
it was in the chocolate book.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:59.130
I tested it-- I can't remember
whether it was 11 or 13 times,

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.790
but it was one of
those numbers that we

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.972
know is supposed
to be good luck--

00:34:02.972 --> 00:34:06.170
but it took me a long
time to get to good luck.

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:10.020
The recipe ran
about seven pages.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.750
This one is a long recipe,
too-- not because it's hard,

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.050
but because I was spooked by it.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:18.610
I was so spooked by the recipe
I took a macaroon baking

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.550
class in Paris, even though
I had made them before.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.489
I went to Pierre's
pastry shop to watch

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:26.020
everybody make macaroon.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.230
I wanted to really get
it right, and I did.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.300
And I put them in the book
mostly because I realized

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.350
I was being a wimp, that I was
just spooked but by macaroon,

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:40.210
freaked by them,
but no one else was.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.210
When I started to look
around the internet,

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:46.659
there were people posting
pictures of the most gorgeous

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:50.415
macaroon and with lines
that said things like,

00:34:50.415 --> 00:34:52.120
I've never baked
before but I thought

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.110
I would try making macaroon.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:57.110
And all of these people
made such gorgeous macaroon

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:59.760
I thought, I can do it,
I can do it, I can do it.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.850
So this is the first time
I've had a macaroon recipe.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:08.620
And last month-- no,
it's now two months ago,

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:13.750
in September-- when I was
having dinner with Pierre Herme

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:18.770
and he said that he was--
I guess it's out now--

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:24.420
he was just publishing his
second book of only macaroon.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.200
And I said, oh, Pierre,
that's fabulous.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.460
And he said, yeah, but I
believe people should buy them.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.220
Even though this
was his second book.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.656
So I usually agree with Pierre
on everything, but not on this.

00:35:37.656 --> 00:35:39.530
I think you should go
home and bake macaroon.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:43.040
In fact, I think you should
bake everything chez you.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.598
So thank you.

00:35:44.598 --> 00:35:47.466
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:51.839 --> 00:35:53.255
MALE SPEAKER: It
seems that you're

00:35:53.255 --> 00:35:55.410
a little bit of an internet
phenomenon-- there's

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:59.000
a Tuesdays with Dorie,
there's a whole community

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.030
that's built up.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.540
Would you like to say a little
bit about how that started,

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.490
what your relationship
is with that and--

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.890
DORIE GREENSPAN: Thank
you for mentioning-- this

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.810
is the most fabulous thing.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:15.350
So when "Baking From My Home
to Yours" came out in 2006,

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:19.424
a young woman named Lori
Woodward, a young mom-- where

00:36:19.424 --> 00:36:20.840
she found time to
do this, I don't

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:26.310
know-- of three little boys,
she got "Baking Chez Moi"

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.330
for her birthday
and she liked it--

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.840
She got "Baking From My Home
to Yours" for her birthday.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.390
She liked it.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:32.860
And she wrote to
me and she said,

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.080
I have two friends who also
have your book and we like a lot

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.870
and we'd like to bake
from it every week.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.860
And we'll put a
recipe up on our blogs

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.630
and just bake through your book.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.153
Is that OK with you?

00:36:47.153 --> 00:36:48.910
I thought, sure.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:51.740
I mean I knew the
internet was-- I mean you

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.650
guys were born with it and
you actually make the internet

00:36:54.650 --> 00:37:01.730
now-- but I wasn't, so
for me to see people

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:04.280
baking-- I mean I thought
only my mother, the non baker,

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.020
bought my books.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.869
But you know, I
looked on the internet

00:37:06.869 --> 00:37:08.660
and there were people
baking from my books,

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.080
making beautiful things
and posting pictures,

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.370
and I was so excited.

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:14.080
That's actually why
I started my blog,

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.982
to be able to be in touch
with all these people.

00:37:16.982 --> 00:37:18.940
And so when Lori said
she was going to do this,

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.640
I thought, oh,
this is just great.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.280
And I asked my editor, and
she said, yeah, and my agent,

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.690
sure, why not?

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.170
None of us thought, what
are the repercussions

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:34.080
of having every recipe in
your book available online?

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.060
We just thought, oh
this was really fun,

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.120
and it's only three people.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.270
Well, they called their
group Tuesdays with Dorie,

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:44.040
and there were
only three people.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.750
And then there were 30,
and then there were 300,

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.960
and then there were thousands
of people baking their way

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.250
through "Baking From
My Home to Yours."

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.640
Oprah wrote about the group,
"The Wall Street Journal"

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.560
wrote about the group,
and it was so special

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.440
because I didn't start it.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.970
This is really-- to me
this is like the power

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.530
of the inter-- my
husband always says

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.870
it's the internet at its best.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:13.720
It just grew organically.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.810
It wasn't me saying,
gee wouldn't it

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:19.980
be great if I had a group
who-- and so they baked

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.000
their way through "Baking
From My Home to Yours,"

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.430
and then they started
on-- and they're still

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:28.540
baking through--
"Baking with Julia."

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:32.180
And then when "Around My
French Table" came out in 2010,

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.429
they started a group called
French Fridays with Dorie,

00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:37.220
and they're cooking
their way through that.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:41.190
And now, on November
1, they're starting,

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:44.180
they'll be baking every
two weeks from "Baking Chez

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.700
Moi" and the other two weeks
from "Baking with Julia."

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.920
And so anybody
who wants to start

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:54.690
baking with this group of
fabulous, supportive, generous,

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.770
adorable people, it's
Tuesday with Dorie--

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:02.820
you have to Google
it because I think

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.742
it's like blogspot or something.

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:06.200
It's got another
little word in it,

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.684
but if you Google
Tuesdays with Dorie,

00:39:09.684 --> 00:39:11.350
the first thing you'll
get is some woman

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.850
named Dorie who's not me who
has a blog called Tuesdays

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.270
with Dorie-- I wish
she would change it--

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:19.730
and then you'll get the
Tuesdays with Dorie group

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.790
and you'll bake with them.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.800
Thank you for asking
me about them, yeah.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.220
From my husband.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.678
MICHAEL GREENSPAN:
The thing that's

00:39:29.678 --> 00:39:31.820
really magical
about that group is

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.090
what Dorie started
to talk about.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.830
But Lori was really brilliant.

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:40.010
First of all, she-- the
thing that's magical

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.044
is that Lori was brilliant.

00:39:42.044 --> 00:39:42.960
DORIE GREENSPAN: Lori.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.740
MICHAEL GREENSPAN: Lori.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:44.390
DORIE GREENSPAN: Not me.

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:45.765
MICHAEL GREENSPAN:
The person who

00:39:45.765 --> 00:39:50.120
is the idea person and who
is the manager of the group.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:54.017
It's a tribute to her that the
group is very, very supportive

00:39:54.017 --> 00:39:54.600
of each other.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.960
That's really incredible.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.310
And the second thing was
that it's a tribute to her

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:00.870
that she said, oh
there's an author

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:04.910
and we can't just do this
without paying attention.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.680
So there was one rule
that was inviolate--

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.730
if you want to be a member
of the group you had

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.140
to buy the book, which
was very nice of her.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.910
And then the second
rule she came up

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.950
with had to do with
distributing your recipes, which

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:20.930
was the only person who
could do the recipe online

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.120
was the person who chose
the recipe for that week.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.800
So that just-- all the
recipes were still out there,

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.960
but they weren't out
there in the thousands.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.990
So it just was a nice
gesture on her part

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.290
towards the author,
which is really great.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.790
DORIE GREENSPAN:
It's a great group.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:40.970
When I spoke at on the
International Food Bloggers

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.130
Conference, and
about 20 people who

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:46.650
are members of TWD
and FFWD-- Tuesdays

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.440
with Dorie and French
Fridays with Dorie--

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.140
came to the conference,
so we actually

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.900
got to meet one another and
they got to meet one another.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.480
But they already-- they'd
never seen one another

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.270
face to face but
they really knew one

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:01.070
another from being
part of this group.

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.960
And in fact, Lori
went to Seattle

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.470
to be the matron of honor
at the wedding of a Tuesdays

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:12.330
with Dorie member and
they had never met.

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:15.600
They only knew one
another through baking.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.420
I just think it's fabulous.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.280
AUDIENCE: A two parter question.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:25.110
So the first part
is at your house,

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.360
when you're in France,
what do you cook when you

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.890
invite your French friends over?

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:33.700
And the second part is have
do you ever thought, gee

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.940
this would be wonderful,
they'll really love it,

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.580
and then not so much?

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.250
Like just their
French taste didn't

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.509
quite jive with
your American taste?

00:41:42.509 --> 00:41:43.550
DORIE GREENSPAN: Oh wait.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.955
OK, so that's an
interesting question.

00:41:44.955 --> 00:41:46.530
And I was going to say,
I don't know the answer,

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:47.750
but Michael knows the answer.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:48.585
MICHAEL GREENSPAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:48.585 --> 00:41:49.475
DORIE GREENSPAN: Yeah.

00:41:49.475 --> 00:41:51.260
MICHAEL GREENSPAN: Um,
when I was growing up--

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.926
DORIE GREENSPAN: Oh,
I know exactly what

00:41:52.926 --> 00:41:54.370
you're going to say, yeah.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:55.910
I know.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:56.780
Yeah, untouched.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:01.170
Potato nik is not
a French favorite.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:05.370
Do you know I cook-- when my
French friends come to dinner,

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:09.400
I cook-- sometimes I cook
very traditional French food,

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:15.400
sometimes we'll fry chicken
or we'll make hamburgers,

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.210
or we'll do something
very American.

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:22.912
The French are-- I was
going to say adventurous

00:42:22.912 --> 00:42:24.620
and I'm wondering now
that I'm saying it,

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.036
are they adventurous
or forgiving?

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:34.140
They're usually really happy
to have anything that I make

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.520
and they're very appreciative.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.140
Some of them are just surprised.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.330
I mean somebody
said to me, oh, you

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:43.650
know how to make a vinaigrette.

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.160
I though, yeah, I know how
to make a vinaigrette, right.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:53.310
I think that there's some amount
of surprise that Americans cook

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:58.360
and eat well, that there's
this idea that-- I mean,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:03.120
it's-- we are a nation of
hamburger eaters to many people

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.400
outside of our country.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.840
But I cook all sorts
of things, and the food

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.240
that's in "Around
my French Table"

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.420
really comes from
the food that I've

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:17.827
cooked for friends
around my French table.

00:43:17.827 --> 00:43:20.160
I'm trying to think if there's
anything else that I ever

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.512
did that they didn't like.

00:43:22.512 --> 00:43:23.220
I don't think so.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:26.440
The potato nik was
just-- went over

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.579
like a heavy potato pudding.

00:43:29.579 --> 00:43:30.370
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:30.470
DORIE GREENSPAN: Hi.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:31.540
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.366
I'm headed to Paris this
summer for the first time--

00:43:34.366 --> 00:43:35.490
DORIE GREENSPAN: Lucky you.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.100
AUDIENCE: --and we are
very, very excited.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.600
My boyfriend's lived
there for some time,

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.680
but it's my first time.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.630
And I'm curious.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:44.100
I've heard a lot
of mixed reviews

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:48.770
about trying to speak
French with the French.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:51.650
What's the best way to
not be hated, especially--

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:52.840
DORIE GREENSPAN: Smile.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.565
Smile.

00:43:53.565 --> 00:43:54.440
AUDIENCE: Just smile.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.606
DORIE GREENSPAN: Just smile.

00:43:55.606 --> 00:43:58.082
All you have to do is smile.

00:43:58.082 --> 00:43:58.790
It's interesting.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:02.280
Sometimes if you
try to speak French

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.010
and your French isn't
good, a French person

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:09.070
might answer you in English
if he or she can do that.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.990
And when I was younger,
I used to think,

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:14.400
how dare you-- is my
French that bad that you

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.580
won't listen to it?

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.915
But I think they're
really just being helpful.

00:44:17.915 --> 00:44:19.290
They want to make
it easy for you

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.560
to be able to be understood
and get what you want.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.490
And if you say to a
French person, oh,

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:30.790
I want to speak French,
I have to practice--

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:35.000
[SPEAKING FRENCH]--
they'll speak with you.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.690
But it's interesting--
when we first

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:41.910
started to go to France it was
very hard to find people who

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:44.620
spoke English or wanted
to speak English.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:48.660
Now so many people do,
and they really want to.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.260
We have friends who work
for French companies

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.980
but all of their
meetings are in English.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:59.690
It's really become the language.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.020
So just smile.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.997
As long as you smile.

00:45:02.997 --> 00:45:06.910
You have a cute
smile, you'll be fine.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:09.010
AUDIENCE: I have a follow-up.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:11.420
So obviously, your
cookbooks are a great start

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.070
for kind of seeing where you go
and what shops and restaurants

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:15.890
you like to visit.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:18.815
Do you have any other kind
of guides to Paris online?

00:45:18.815 --> 00:45:19.690
DORIE GREENSPAN: Yes.

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.720
OK, so I think you should
look at a website called

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.180
parisbymouth.com.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.110
Do you know it?

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.150
Oh, I see a nod over there.

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.770
Yeah.

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:33.580
Yeah, it's a great site
for-- it's a food site.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.160
It's a great site for
restaurants, for pastry shops,

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.230
for bakeries.

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.420
They also do tours.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.820
So I've taken the cheese
tour and learned so much.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.400
It's great.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.910
They do a cheese tour,
they do wine tastings.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:52.861
Yes, it's a friend who started
it, but it's a great site

00:45:52.861 --> 00:45:53.860
and it's all in English.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
David Lebovitz's site?

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:57.938
DORIE GREENSPAN: Yes, David
Lebovitz's site is great.

00:45:57.938 --> 00:46:02.770
It's David L-E-B-O-V-I-T-Z.
And Alec Lobrano,

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.780
or Alexander Lobrano's
site, particularly his

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:11.170
Diner's Diary-- also good.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:13.480
MALE SPEAKER: I guess on the
subject of David Lebovitz,

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.420
we had him here
earlier in the year

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.630
and so it seems like
you two know each other.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.500
Are there bake-offs or
collaborations or things

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.010
like that?

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:22.510
DORIE GREENSPAN:
No, no, no, no, no.

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:24.440
They're a happy going
out to eat together.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:24.940
Yeah.

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:25.320
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.903
DORIE GREENSPAN:
Yeah, no competition.

00:46:26.903 --> 00:46:27.920
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.940
And also how do you test the
recipes in your cookbook?

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:31.750
Is there a--

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:32.640
DORIE GREENSPAN: Oh,
that's a great question.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:32.890
MALE SPEAKER: --trusted tester?

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:33.806
DORIE GREENSPAN: Yeah.

00:46:33.806 --> 00:46:38.600
So all of these recipes were
either gathered, begged,

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.710
groveled for in Paris
or created in Paris

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:46.530
and then they were all tested,
tested, tested, retested,

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:50.010
retested in America with
American ingredients.

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.460
So the two ingredients
that are hardest

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:57.430
to kind of translate
from France to America

00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:58.860
are flour and butter.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.250
Because the flour is
weaker in France, and so

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:05.550
in some instances I had to
use less flour in a recipe,

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:09.960
and the butter is richer
in France than it is here.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.600
And so all of the
recipes were tested here.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.200
I worked with Mary Dodd,
who was my recipe tester.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.480
And by the time I would
give Mary a recipe,

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.630
I had worked on it
and worked on it

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:25.170
until I thought
it was just right.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:29.240
So I didn't send her things
that had holes in them.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.720
And I would send them
to her fully written

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.930
so that she could test the
actual formula, the ingredients

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:37.790
and test the writing.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.750
You know-- do the
directions make sense?

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:43.630
Because after-- if I've created
a recipe, if I've made it

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.780
several times, you know I
can take some things for

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:52.700
granted that-- so
everybody needs an editor.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:55.580
And so it was really good that
she could read them and say,

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:59.360
do you think people will
really know-- and point out

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.080
things like that.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.030
So she tested everything
and we tested the recipes

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:06.330
with volume measures--
cups and spoons--

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:08.190
and also with metric measures.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:13.770
And I'm thrilled, I am so happy,
to have metric in the book.

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:18.569
It's the first time my publisher
has said yes so I'm happy.

00:48:18.569 --> 00:48:19.360
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:24.460
Any final questions to see
us on to the book signing?

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.650
I'll end with another one--
the photos are so beautiful.

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:29.882
Do you use the same
photographer with each book?

00:48:29.882 --> 00:48:31.590
How do you approach
the food photography?

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:33.048
DORIE GREENSPAN:
So the photography

00:48:33.048 --> 00:48:36.780
for my last three books,
"Baking From My Home to Yours,"

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.390
"Around My French Table,"
and "Baking Chez Moi,"

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:40.500
it's the same team.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:44.430
So it's Alan Richardson
who does the photography,

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.790
Karen Tack does
the food styling,

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.390
Deb Donahue does the props.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:51.750
But Alan and Karen wrote
books you might know-- "Hello,

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:56.780
Cupcake"-- yeah,
they're the cupcakers--

00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:01.657
"What's New Cupcake-- and
yeah, so it's the same team.

00:49:01.657 --> 00:49:02.740
MALE SPEAKER: Cool, great.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.280
DORIE GREENSPAN: They're
great to work with.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.060
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.434
Well, on this
Googleween, we were

00:49:06.434 --> 00:49:09.810
supremely happy to have a salute
to the French baked goods,

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:12.340
so thank you very much for
speaking with us, Dorie, and--

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.150
DORIE GREENSPAN:
Thank you, Cliff.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.390
Thank you all for coming.

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.990
Thank you.

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:17.740
