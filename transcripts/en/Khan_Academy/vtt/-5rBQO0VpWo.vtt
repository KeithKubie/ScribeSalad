00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.565
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:06.826
is talk about roughly 1000
years of Japanese history

00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:10.533
that take us from what's
known as the Classical period

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:14.196
of Japan through the
Japanese Medieval period

00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:16.933
all the way to the Early Modern period

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:20.648
and the key defining characteristic
of the Classical period

00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:25.046
is this is when Japan really
began to unify and have an

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:29.111
imperial form and began to
borrow a lot of the traditions

00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:32.453
and philosophy and even
religion from China.

00:00:32.453 --> 00:00:34.521
Then as we get into the Medieval period,

00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:38.634
Japan gets fragmented, it
comes under military rule,

00:00:38.634 --> 00:00:41.285
and then as we get into
the Early Modern period,

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:42.702
it gets reunited.

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:49.131
So as I mentioned, China had
a huge influence on Japan.

00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:52.390
Even though China never conquers Japan,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.632
because of how close they
are, many things like the idea

00:00:56.632 --> 00:01:00.715
of a centralized bureaucracy,
the Japanese borrow

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:06.491
many of these ideas from China
during the Classical period.

00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:10.904
In fact, the Japanese rulers
sent delegations to China

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:14.732
in the 7th century in order
to understand all of what

00:01:14.732 --> 00:01:17.812
the Chinese do, in order
to run their government,

00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:20.308
to run their country,
and they start to borrow

00:01:20.308 --> 00:01:24.078
a lot of the ideas of
Buddhism and Confucianism

00:01:24.078 --> 00:01:26.756
and merge it with some
of their own beliefs

00:01:26.756 --> 00:01:29.015
which are often known as Shinto,

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:33.300
which you can view as the
original Japanese belief system.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.662
So the first part of the Classical period

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:39.940
that we're gonna go into some
depth is the Heian period.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.052
Its capital Heian-kyo, modern day Kyoto,

00:01:44.052 --> 00:01:46.696
and as I mentioned, it
was known for taking a lot

00:01:46.696 --> 00:01:51.082
of these ideas from China and
particularly the Tang dynasty

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:54.632
in China and bringing them to Japan.

00:01:54.632 --> 00:01:58.799
The Heian period was known
as a golden age of Japan.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.917
It was a time of culture, it
was a time of architecture,

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:05.847
people in the imperial court
would focus on the arts,

00:02:05.847 --> 00:02:08.522
they would focus on philosophy.

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:12.689
As an example, this right over
here is the Byodo-in Temple

00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:16.886
in Kyoto which shows the level,

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.020
and this is actually only part of it,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.836
it shows the level of cultural
advancement of this time.

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:25.969
As I mentioned, the arts were a big deal

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.829
and women in the imperial
court of Heian China had a lot

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.475
of influence, in fact, the
most influential family,

00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:35.556
the Fujiwara family
maintained its influence

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:39.837
by having the emperors marry
women from their family

00:02:39.837 --> 00:02:42.397
and those women would end
up having a lot of control

00:02:42.397 --> 00:02:44.727
over the emperor and of
course the next emperor.

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:46.977
But to get a sense of
the arts of this period,

00:02:46.977 --> 00:02:50.310
here's an excerpt from the Tale of Genji

00:02:51.558 --> 00:02:55.007
which was written by Lady
Murasaki, who was believed to be

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.115
a member of the Fujiwara family.

00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:01.470
And Lady Murasaki gets a lot of credit,

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.070
before Chaucer, before Shakespeare,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.568
she is by many historians viewed
as the first true novelist

00:03:08.568 --> 00:03:12.928
that we know of in human history,
not just Japanese history.

00:03:12.928 --> 00:03:16.088
But I encourage you to read it,
its actually quite riveting,

00:03:16.088 --> 00:03:19.208
the Tale of Genji, and
this is just a small quote

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:21.838
from that story or from that novel,

00:03:21.838 --> 00:03:25.447
it's about a very handsome prince, Genji.

00:03:25.447 --> 00:03:28.688
"The difference between
enlightenment and confusion

00:03:28.688 --> 00:03:31.483
"is of about the same
order as the difference

00:03:31.483 --> 00:03:34.836
"between the good and
the bad in a romance.

00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:37.419
"If one takes the generous view,

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.419
"then nothing is empty and useless."
