00:00:00.848 --> 00:00:03.274
- What I want to calculate in this video

00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:08.231
is 53 plus 17,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.864
plus 17.

00:00:10.864 --> 00:00:12.903
And the way that I want to do it is

00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:16.567
by breaking up the 53 and
then rearranging the numbers,

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:18.628
and you'll see what I'm
talking about in a second.

00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:23.164
So 53 plus 17, that's going
to be the same thing as,

00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:25.641
I'm gonna break up 53, essentially

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:27.517
into the tens and the ones.

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:32.516
So 53 can be rewritten as 50 plus 3.

00:00:34.543 --> 00:00:36.195
That's 53 right?

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:38.842
And I could put parentheses
around it like this.

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.914
So these curvy things, so
this is an open parenthesis

00:00:41.914 --> 00:00:43.897
and this is a close parenthesis.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.492
This just means to do whats
inside the parentheses first.

00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:52.195
So 53 is the same thing as 50 plus 3

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:57.195
and we still have the plus,
we still have the plus 17.

00:00:57.732 --> 00:01:01.454
Now, I could just add the 50 plus 3 first

00:01:01.454 --> 00:01:02.913
and then add the 17 and that would just

00:01:02.913 --> 00:01:04.405
get back there, but we want to

00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:06.484
figure out what this whole thing is.

00:01:06.484 --> 00:01:11.324
So I could rewrite this,
this is the same thing as

00:01:11.817 --> 00:01:16.817
50 plus 3 plus 17,

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:20.184
plus 17,

00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:23.939
and I could do the 3 plus 17 first.

00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:26.011
So here I'm doing the 50 plus 3 first,

00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:27.829
I have those in the parentheses.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.722
Here I'm doing the 3 plus
17 first, and this is just

00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:34.128
a property of addition
that I could do this.

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:37.282
I could change the order
in which I'm adding.

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:39.321
So here I'm adding 50 plus 3 first.

00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:41.920
Here I'm going to add 3 plus 17 first.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.202
And so what's this going to be equal to?

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.188
Well this is going to be equal to

00:01:46.188 --> 00:01:51.188
I have my 50 here, I have my 50 plus,

00:01:51.362 --> 00:01:56.324
now whats 3 plus 17? What's 3 plus 17?

00:01:57.102 --> 00:02:02.102
Well 3 plus 7 would be 10, so
3 plus 17 is going to be 20.

00:02:03.253 --> 00:02:06.683
So it's going to be 50 plus 20.

00:02:06.737 --> 00:02:08.232
Now what's that going to be?

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:12.560
Well it's 5 tens plus 2 tens,
which is going to be equal to

00:02:12.713 --> 00:02:17.676
this is just going to be
equal to 7 tens, or 70.

00:02:18.107 --> 00:02:20.120
Let's do another example,
and this is going to be

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.926
one like the type of exercise that

00:02:21.926 --> 00:02:23.589
you might see on Khan Academy.

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.006
So let's, let me take, open that up.

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:29.935
So they'll say "Complete
to solve 41 plus 9"

00:02:30.298 --> 00:02:31.455
so once again we can look at,

00:02:31.455 --> 00:02:36.455
we can look at the 41
and we can break it up.

00:02:36.763 --> 00:02:40.727
41 is the same thing as 40 plus what?

00:02:41.158 --> 00:02:44.334
Well, it's 40 plus 1, and of course

00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:48.011
then you have the plus 9
there and I can do the 9

00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:51.127
see this plus 9 is this plus 9 there.

00:02:51.268 --> 00:02:52.939
Now they change the order
in which we're adding.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.418
So 40 plus 1, that's in the parentheses

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.826
and then you add 9, well that's
the same thing as 40 plus

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:03.231
well, that's the same
thing as 40 plus 1 plus 9.

00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:05.247
So here we're doing the 1 plus 9 first,

00:03:05.508 --> 00:03:08.615
and if we do the 1 plus
9 first what do we get?

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:12.902
Well, 1 plus 9, 1 plus 9 is what?

00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:15.324
Well, that's just going to be equal to 10.

00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.988
Notice what this, this box is replacing

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:21.418
what was in the parentheses before,

00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:25.148
so in the parentheses you
had 1 plus 9, well that's 10.

00:03:25.475 --> 00:03:27.802
And what's 40 plus 10?

00:03:27.882 --> 00:03:31.065
Well it's 4 tens plus
1 ten so that's 5 tens.

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:35.040
Or, 50, and we're done.
