00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.378
assive,
hefty weapon.

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:05.797
This is the rhomphaia.

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:08.508
Wielded by the Thracians
as early as 400 BC,

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.219
it has the ability
to slay multiple foes

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.930
with a swiping blow.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.349
Seems to me it'd be hard to have
both hands together on this.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.017
You'd definitely
do some more damage,

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.728
which is, I guess, why it has
such a big, long grip.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.938
-Try and get some torque.
-You get some torque on it.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:23.732
Would you use this, also,
to kind of shove

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.900
your opponent back,
maybe against something,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.277
and then
maybe chop them down?

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.154
I wouldn't do it.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.989
Uh, you know, we don't do any
thrusts in this sport at all.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.742
So we kind of avoid that kind
of, uh, that kind of gesture.

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.828
But with all the weight
that's up at the tip of this,

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.622
this is a superior
chopping weapon.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:44.377
The root word
of the rhomphaia, "romph,"

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.755
uh, can mean
"to break" or "to tear."

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.465
And when you've got this
in your hands,

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:50.300
that's exactly
what it wants to do.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.801
When you're
using this weapon,

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:55.263
if you can manage
to pull it back from out--

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.182
way outside
and drop it down,

00:00:57.182 --> 00:01:00.143
dropping your weight down
on top of it...

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:01.936
it provides
a hell of a stroke.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:03.480
With that being said

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.814
and with that technique
you just showed us,

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.691
you'd really have to get
some distance

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.193
to be able to land an effective
shot in that manner, right?

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:09.319
-Right, right.
-Yeah.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.112
You're not gonna
see them, um,

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:13.823
whipping this around
in big, large circles.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:17.577
You're not gonna see them doing
some type of winding strikes.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:20.246
You're really just gonna see
them clashing against each other

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.208
and looking for
that super power strike.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.961
Some of the most effective shots
that you're gonna see

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.922
are straight down
shots at the arm.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.465
Ooh!
Yeah, that exposed arm.

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:33.051
A shot that comes across,
horizontal cut,

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.969
is easy to block.
You can show the block for that.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.513
Yeah, just come in
against it.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.807
If I came to the other side,
again, easy to block.

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.558
The mass alone can
ward off that blow.

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.310
What we want to do
is parallel the blade --

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.103
come straight down
onto the arm.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.897
If he over-blocks
or if you could pump,

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:47.899
you can come down and come back
down to the other side,

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.651
to the other --
to the other arm.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.945
Now if you get him to believe
that all your shots

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.072
are gonna be vertical shots,
that's when you can step in

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.824
and throw a shot
at the top of the head.

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.033
Ooh, nice.
