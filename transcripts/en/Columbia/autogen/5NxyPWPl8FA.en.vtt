the people don't believe it's a problem
and so that's an enormous impediment to

a bit he was telling me the other day
that if you look to the future and say

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930
that if you look to the future and say
 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.569
that if you look to the future and say
what do we have to do to cut fossil fuel

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:07.579
what do we have to do to cut fossil fuel

it from going up and he did the

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.259
it from going up and he did the
 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:20.519
it from going up and he did the
calculation this way he said that

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:20.529
calculation this way he said that
 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.809

probably going to increase three percent
a year and that's what it's been doing

a year and that's what it's been doing
 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.889
a year and that's what it's been doing
so if that continues that's four percent

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:35.899
so if that continues that's four percent
 

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:43.839
so if that continues that's four percent
a year then if you want to stop co2 from

in trying to understand how rainfall

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.830

it's clear that as we heat the planet

it's clear that as we heat the planet

it's clear that as we heat the planet
more of the rainfall that it's seared so

more of the rainfall that it's seared so
 

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.810
more of the rainfall that it's seared so
it won't be that much more total brain

it won't be that much more total brain
on the planet but it's good to do it's

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:00.140
on the planet but it's good to do it's
 

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:07.139
on the planet but it's good to do it's
going to be focused more strongly

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:07.149
 
 

00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:10.259
 
more strongly on the tropics and

00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:10.269
more strongly on the tropics and
 

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:14.199
more strongly on the tropics and
therefore places that don't need more

00:11:14.199 --> 00:11:14.209
therefore places that don't need more
 

00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:16.960
therefore places that don't need more
rainfall are going to get more and those

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:16.970
rainfall are going to get more and those
 

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.069
rainfall are going to get more and those
are many places that are very short of

another thing that we have to really

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040
another thing that we have to really
 

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.119
another thing that we have to really
worry about I think sea level which is

00:11:31.119 --> 00:11:31.129
worry about I think sea level which is
 

00:11:31.129 --> 00:11:33.910
worry about I think sea level which is
often the primary thing people talk

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920
often the primary thing people talk
 

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.369
often the primary thing people talk
about sure sea level is going to rise

00:11:36.369 --> 00:11:36.379
about sure sea level is going to rise
 

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:38.860
about sure sea level is going to rise
very slowly but it's not the thing

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:38.870
very slowly but it's not the thing
 

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.949
very slowly but it's not the thing
that's going to stab us in the back its

00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959
that's going to stab us in the back its
 

00:11:41.959 --> 00:11:51.280
that's going to stab us in the back its
food and the presume an intensification

food and the presume an intensification
 

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.360
food and the presume an intensification
of storms this is the things that we're

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:55.370
of storms this is the things that we're
 

00:11:55.370 --> 00:12:00.819
of storms this is the things that we're
really going to notice so this is sort

00:12:00.819 --> 00:12:00.829
really going to notice so this is sort
 

00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:04.929
really going to notice so this is sort
of a bleak outlook because if we keep if

00:12:04.929 --> 00:12:04.939
of a bleak outlook because if we keep if
 

00:12:04.939 --> 00:12:08.230
of a bleak outlook because if we keep if
if we keep producing more and more co2

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240
if we keep producing more and more co2
 

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.429
if we keep producing more and more co2
every year and this goes on for 50 years

00:12:12.429 --> 00:12:12.439
every year and this goes on for 50 years
 

00:12:12.439 --> 00:12:15.340
every year and this goes on for 50 years
just even if we knew what to do would

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:15.350
just even if we knew what to do would
 

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.829
just even if we knew what to do would
probably take 50 years to do it to pay

00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839
probably take 50 years to do it to pay
 

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:21.189
probably take 50 years to do it to pay
for we're going to end up with a lot of

00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199
for we're going to end up with a lot of
 

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:24.210
for we're going to end up with a lot of
co2 in the air so what are our options

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:24.220
co2 in the air so what are our options
 

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.179
co2 in the air so what are our options
we can live with it but i think the

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:28.189
we can live with it but i think the
 

00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:30.490
we can live with it but i think the
negatives are going to far outweigh the

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:30.500
negatives are going to far outweigh the
 

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.329
negatives are going to far outweigh the
positives and it's so everybody will

00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:34.339
positives and it's so everybody will
 

00:12:34.339 --> 00:12:37.150
positives and it's so everybody will
agree that the world was a better place

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160
agree that the world was a better place
 

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.610

the stratosphere that reflected away
 

00:12:50.089 --> 00:12:56.170
the stratosphere that reflected away
sunshine and there is a way to do that

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.929

that probably 10 times cheaper than

that probably 10 times cheaper than
 

00:12:58.939 --> 00:13:01.499
that probably 10 times cheaper than
dealing with the problem itself and that

dealing with the problem itself and that
 

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:07.059
dealing with the problem itself and that
is to put 32 million tons of so2 into

is to put 32 million tons of so2 into
 

00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:09.009
is to put 32 million tons of so2 into
the stratosphere every year that would

little sulfuric acid droplets that would
 

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:20.379
little sulfuric acid droplets that would
be formed would compensate for doubling

of co2 they have to put it up every year
 

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.139
of co2 they have to put it up every year
but it turns out if you do the

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:26.149
but it turns out if you do the
 

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:29.379

would be unfortunate if we had to do

would be unfortunate if we had to do
that but I think the likelihood that

that but I think the likelihood that
 

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.509
that but I think the likelihood that
we'll get into that is rather high not

we'll get into that is rather high not
 

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:55.059
we'll get into that is rather high not
right away but that things are bad and

right away but that things are bad and

right away but that things are bad and
we want to cool the planet it's a way to

we want to cool the planet it's a way to

we want to cool the planet it's a way to
do it rather quickly and it's going to

00:13:59.799 --> 00:13:59.809
do it rather quickly and it's going to
 

00:13:59.809 --> 00:14:05.619
do it rather quickly and it's going to
be a temptation so so we could cope with

be a temptation so so we could cope with
 

00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:11.139
be a temptation so so we could cope with
it we could reflect equivalent amount of

it we could reflect equivalent amount of
 

00:14:11.149 --> 00:14:15.759
it we could reflect equivalent amount of
sunlight away and I mean you might ask

00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:15.769
sunlight away and I mean you might ask
 

00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:17.650
sunlight away and I mean you might ask
what are the problems with that well one

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:17.660
what are the problems with that well one
 

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.889
what are the problems with that well one
big problem is that it isn't going to

big problem is that it isn't going to
 

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:24.119
big problem is that it isn't going to
return climate to what it was because

that's the same amount as of warm we

that's the same amount as of warm we
 

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.360
that's the same amount as of warm we
could do that but the geographical

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:31.370
could do that but the geographical
 

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.569
could do that but the geographical
distribution of rainfall and other

00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:34.579
distribution of rainfall and other
 

00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:39.400
distribution of rainfall and other
things would be different so it would

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:39.410
things would be different so it would
 

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:43.749
things would be different so it would

create a different geography of climate
 

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:46.329

than we have now and of course some

would you know get very upset about it

00:14:51.809 --> 00:14:51.819
would you know get very upset about it
 

00:14:51.819 --> 00:14:55.179
would you know get very upset about it
so there is there's one other way that

so there is there's one other way that
 

00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:59.889
so there is there's one other way that
we can go and I think that it's a

00:14:59.889 --> 00:14:59.899
we can go and I think that it's a
 

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.169
we can go and I think that it's a
reasonable way to go and it will

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:02.179
reasonable way to go and it will
 

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:06.129
reasonable way to go and it will
probably get around to doing it but it's

00:15:06.129 --> 00:15:06.139
probably get around to doing it but it's
 

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:08.949
probably get around to doing it but it's
going to take a while to convince people

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959
going to take a while to convince people
 

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:11.100
going to take a while to convince people
that this is something we have to do and

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:11.110
that this is something we have to do and
 

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:16.600
that this is something we have to do and
that is we could take co2 back out of

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:16.610
that is we could take co2 back out of
 

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.650
that is we could take co2 back out of
the atmosphere you might say that's

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:20.660
the atmosphere you might say that's
 

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.580
the atmosphere you might say that's
outrageous because the co2 is only

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:24.590
outrageous because the co2 is only
 

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.720
outrageous because the co2 is only
there are only 400 molecules of co2 for

there are only 400 molecules of co2 for
 

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.060
there are only 400 molecules of co2 for
a million molecules of air so it's very

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:31.070
a million molecules of air so it's very
 

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:35.290

are different opinions about this for
various reason but since this MIT group

various reason but since this MIT group
 

00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:04.360
various reason but since this MIT group
said it would cost thousand dollars a

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:18.860
expensive and so what I've been trying
 

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.779

to do is to help Lochner get the money

00:23:22.779 --> 00:23:22.789
to do is to help Lochner get the money
 

00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:26.710
to do is to help Lochner get the money
to build prototypes so here we have the

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720
to build prototypes so here we have the
 

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.419
to build prototypes so here we have the
most important environmental problem the

00:23:30.419 --> 00:23:30.429
most important environmental problem the
 

00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:33.669
most important environmental problem the
very serious problem one that you can

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679
very serious problem one that you can
 

00:23:33.679 --> 00:23:35.680
very serious problem one that you can
make scenarios that would really bring

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:35.690
make scenarios that would really bring
 

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.019
make scenarios that would really bring
down civilization I mean we're going to

00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:38.029
down civilization I mean we're going to
 

00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:40.419
down civilization I mean we're going to
do things to the planet on a very large

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:40.429
do things to the planet on a very large
 

00:23:40.429 --> 00:23:44.139
do things to the planet on a very large
scale maybe that's a small probability

00:23:44.139 --> 00:23:44.149
scale maybe that's a small probability
 

00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:47.500
scale maybe that's a small probability
but so is a nuclear exchange of small

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:47.510
but so is a nuclear exchange of small
 

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:52.870
but so is a nuclear exchange of small
probability and yet on air capture the

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880
probability and yet on air capture the
 

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.700
probability and yet on air capture the
total amount of money spent in the last

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:54.710
total amount of money spent in the last
 

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.990
total amount of money spent in the last
ten years about 25 million dollars so

00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000
ten years about 25 million dollars so
 

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.539
ten years about 25 million dollars so
during that time

00:24:01.539 --> 00:24:01.549
during that time
 

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:05.409
during that time
we spent military spends with 500

00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:05.419
we spent military spends with 500
 

00:24:05.419 --> 00:24:08.320
we spent military spends with 500
billion dollars a year so they'd spent

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:08.330
billion dollars a year so they'd spent
 

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.799
billion dollars a year so they'd spent
ten times five hundred billion to defend

00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:11.809
ten times five hundred billion to defend
 

00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:17.320
ten times five hundred billion to defend

us against God knows what and we're not
 

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.359
us against God knows what and we're not
doing the same thing and that's because

00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:19.369
doing the same thing and that's because
 

00:24:19.369 --> 00:24:22.479
doing the same thing and that's because
people are really not convinced that

00:24:22.479 --> 00:24:22.489
people are really not convinced that
 

00:24:22.489 --> 00:24:26.470
people are really not convinced that
this is a serious problem I mean some of

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480
this is a serious problem I mean some of
 

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.190
this is a serious problem I mean some of
us are but unfortunately not a strong

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:35.570
majority I want to see a couple other
 

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.930
majority I want to see a couple other
things about their capture and then

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:37.940
things about their capture and then
 

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.609
things about their capture and then
maybe I'll shut up and you can ask

00:24:39.609 --> 00:24:39.619
maybe I'll shut up and you can ask
 

00:24:39.619 --> 00:24:44.560
maybe I'll shut up and you can ask
questions and we're going to let's mean

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:44.570
questions and we're going to let's mean
 

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.720
questions and we're going to let's mean
the ideal thing as we started doing air

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:46.730
the ideal thing as we started doing air
 

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.639
the ideal thing as we started doing air
capture as soon as possible and that

00:24:48.639 --> 00:24:48.649
capture as soon as possible and that
 

00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:52.359
capture as soon as possible and that
would alleviate the rise we and we would

00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:52.369
would alleviate the rise we and we would
 

00:24:52.369 --> 00:24:54.399
would alleviate the rise we and we would
build up and eventually we could quell

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:54.409
build up and eventually we could quell
 

00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:58.479
build up and eventually we could quell
the rise as we transform our energy

00:24:58.479 --> 00:24:58.489
the rise as we transform our energy
 

00:24:58.489 --> 00:25:02.590
the rise as we transform our energy

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600
system to from 85-percent fossil fuels
 

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.320
system to from 85-percent fossil fuels
to eighty-five percent renewables but

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:08.330
to eighty-five percent renewables but
 

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.479
to eighty-five percent renewables but
let's say we don't do that and we

00:25:10.479 --> 00:25:10.489
let's say we don't do that and we
 

00:25:10.489 --> 00:25:14.979
let's say we don't do that and we
finally reach a time when we're not

00:25:14.979 --> 00:25:14.989
finally reach a time when we're not
 

00:25:14.989 --> 00:25:18.849
finally reach a time when we're not
using fossil fuels that we replace them

00:25:18.849 --> 00:25:18.859
using fossil fuels that we replace them
 

00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:24.519
using fossil fuels that we replace them
with renewable energy well that's when

00:25:24.519 --> 00:25:24.529
with renewable energy well that's when
 

00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:26.619
with renewable energy well that's when
you stop raising co tool it's going to

00:25:26.619 --> 00:25:26.629
you stop raising co tool it's going to
 

00:25:26.629 --> 00:25:28.570
you stop raising co tool it's going to
take hundreds of years to go into the

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:28.580
take hundreds of years to go into the
 

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.810
take hundreds of years to go into the
ocean and really that tail will extend

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:31.820
ocean and really that tail will extend
 

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.379
ocean and really that tail will extend
out thousands of years but the big part

00:25:35.379 --> 00:25:35.389
out thousands of years but the big part
 

00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:37.979
out thousands of years but the big part
of it will go into the ocean but on a

00:25:37.979 --> 00:25:37.989
of it will go into the ocean but on a
 

00:25:37.989 --> 00:25:44.889
of it will go into the ocean but on a
multi century timescale so if we when

00:25:44.889 --> 00:25:44.899
multi century timescale so if we when
 

00:25:44.899 --> 00:25:46.749

this happened let's see where at seven

00:25:46.749 --> 00:25:46.759
this happened let's see where at seven
 

00:25:46.759 --> 00:25:48.869
this happened let's see where at seven
hundred and fifty parts per million I

00:25:48.869 --> 00:25:48.879
hundred and fifty parts per million I
 

00:25:48.879 --> 00:25:53.109
hundred and fifty parts per million I
mean I would be astounded if the world

00:25:53.109 --> 00:25:53.119
mean I would be astounded if the world
 

00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:56.320
mean I would be astounded if the world
didn't say it's the disadvantages of

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:56.330
didn't say it's the disadvantages of
 

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.590
didn't say it's the disadvantages of
that enormously outweigh the advantages

00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600
that enormously outweigh the advantages
 

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.419
that enormously outweigh the advantages
we want to go back to what the world

00:26:01.419 --> 00:26:01.429
we want to go back to what the world
 

00:26:01.429 --> 00:26:05.409
we want to go back to what the world
looked like you know now or in eighteen

00:26:05.409 --> 00:26:05.419
looked like you know now or in eighteen
 

00:26:05.419 --> 00:26:09.009
looked like you know now or in eighteen
fifty or something then you could

00:26:09.009 --> 00:26:09.019
fifty or something then you could
 

00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:13.119
fifty or something then you could
implement our capture and do it ok so I

00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:13.129
implement our capture and do it ok so I
 

00:26:13.129 --> 00:26:15.580
implement our capture and do it ok so I
would say that if we don't start

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:15.590
would say that if we don't start
 

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.409
would say that if we don't start
doing it during the transition period

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:17.419
doing it during the transition period
 

00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:19.090
doing it during the transition period
we're certainly going to do it

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:19.100
we're certainly going to do it
 

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.000
we're certainly going to do it
afterwards but you but we don't know how

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.010
afterwards but you but we don't know how

much it costs if it costs a thousand
 

00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:28.360
much it costs if it costs a thousand
dollars a ton then it turns out we'll

dollars a ton then it turns out we'll
 

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.220
dollars a ton then it turns out we'll
probably never do it because that's just

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:30.230
probably never do it because that's just
 

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.470
probably never do it because that's just
too expensive and that mean a lot of

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480
too expensive and that mean a lot of
 

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.019
too expensive and that mean a lot of
energy has to go into it and so forth

00:26:37.019 --> 00:26:37.029
energy has to go into it and so forth
 

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:40.120
energy has to go into it and so forth
but there's another thing you can think

but there's another thing you can think
 

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:44.730
but there's another thing you can think
of there's a big movement to go to

completely the co2 would be pulled out

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880
completely the co2 would be pulled out
 

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.659
completely the co2 would be pulled out
of the air now to go back so it wouldn't

of the air now to go back so it wouldn't
 

00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:56.130

we're saving so energy use is going to
 

00:29:02.619 --> 00:29:05.339
we're saving so energy use is going to
go up and most of that's going to come

00:29:05.339 --> 00:29:05.349
go up and most of that's going to come
 

00:29:05.349 --> 00:29:14.700
go up and most of that's going to come
from fossil fuels so we've got what we

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:14.710
from fossil fuels so we've got what we
 

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:17.599
from fossil fuels so we've got what we
learned when we were throwing our

00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:17.609
learned when we were throwing our
 

00:29:17.609 --> 00:29:20.789
learned when we were throwing our
ancestors we're throwing garbage in the

00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799
ancestors we're throwing garbage in the
 

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:22.560
ancestors we're throwing garbage in the
street that that could cause lots of

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:22.570
street that that could cause lots of
 

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:26.879
street that that could cause lots of
problems and disease and everything and

00:29:26.879 --> 00:29:26.889
problems and disease and everything and
 

00:29:26.889 --> 00:29:29.129
problems and disease and everything and
so we learn to collect garbage and put

00:29:29.129 --> 00:29:29.139
so we learn to collect garbage and put
 

00:29:29.139 --> 00:29:33.029
so we learn to collect garbage and put
it away in a sensible way our our

00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039
it away in a sensible way our our

waterways got badly polluted was sewage
 

00:29:36.879 --> 00:29:40.589
waterways got badly polluted was sewage
and we bit the bullet and hurt near each

00:29:40.589 --> 00:29:40.599
and we bit the bullet and hurt near each
 

00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:46.649

city put in sewage plants and and we've

00:29:46.649 --> 00:29:46.659

problem now we're loading the atmosphere

00:29:51.629 --> 00:29:51.639
problem now we're loading the atmosphere
 

00:29:51.639 --> 00:29:54.989
problem now we're loading the atmosphere
using atmospheres of co2 garbage can and

00:29:54.989 --> 00:29:54.999
using atmospheres of co2 garbage can and
 

00:29:54.999 --> 00:29:59.579
using atmospheres of co2 garbage can and
we just can't do that and so the what's

00:29:59.579 --> 00:29:59.589
we just can't do that and so the what's
 

00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:01.799
we just can't do that and so the what's
going to have to happen I think as we

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:01.809
going to have to happen I think as we
 

00:30:01.809 --> 00:30:04.339
going to have to happen I think as we
put a price on carbon one way or another

00:30:04.339 --> 00:30:04.349
put a price on carbon one way or another
 

00:30:04.349 --> 00:30:07.019
put a price on carbon one way or another
so when you take carbon out of the

00:30:07.019 --> 00:30:07.029
so when you take carbon out of the
 

00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:11.310
so when you take carbon out of the
ground matter what you're going to do

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:11.320
ground matter what you're going to do
 

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.889
ground matter what you're going to do
with it it's ninety nine percent of it

00:30:13.889 --> 00:30:13.899
with it it's ninety nine percent of it
 

00:30:13.899 --> 00:30:15.450
with it it's ninety nine percent of it
is going to get burned one way or

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:15.460
is going to get burned one way or
 

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.119
is going to get burned one way or
another you have to pay to take it back

00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:18.129
another you have to pay to take it back
 

00:30:18.129 --> 00:30:22.710
another you have to pay to take it back
out of the air it's pay to capture

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720
out of the air it's pay to capture
 

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.250
out of the air it's pay to capture
and so the price of getting the carbon

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:26.260
and so the price of getting the carbon
 

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.310
and so the price of getting the carbon
out is built into the price of fuels and

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:29.320
out is built into the price of fuels and
 

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.830
out is built into the price of fuels and
of course that really helps a non fossil

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840
of course that really helps a non fossil
 

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.060
of course that really helps a non fossil
fuel energy because it makes it easier

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:39.070
fuel energy because it makes it easier
 

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.930
fuel energy because it makes it easier
for them to compete with fossil fuels so

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:42.940
for them to compete with fossil fuels so
 

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.210
for them to compete with fossil fuels so

trouble on the planet because it's you
know just food alone I'll stop and you

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:17.860
know just food alone I'll stop and you
 

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.950
know just food alone I'll stop and you
can beat on me and say you know you're

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:19.960
can beat on me and say you know you're
 

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:40.820
can beat on me and say you know you're
talking about broker and maybe I don't

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:40.830
 
 

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.529
 
okay well thanks well we were going to

00:31:43.529 --> 00:31:43.539
okay well thanks well we were going to
 

00:31:43.539 --> 00:31:45.330
okay well thanks well we were going to
have people come to the mic if you'd

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:45.340
have people come to the mic if you'd
 

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.770
have people come to the mic if you'd
like to ask the question because we're

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:46.780
like to ask the question because we're
 

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:53.549
like to ask the question because we're
taping and the floor is open I was

00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559
taping and the floor is open I was
 

00:31:53.559 --> 00:31:55.350
taping and the floor is open I was
intrigued by your use of demented

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360
intrigued by your use of demented
 

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.690
intrigued by your use of demented
allergies of that we learned to clean

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:57.700
allergies of that we learned to clean
 

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.480
allergies of that we learned to clean
our river ways and get rid of the sewage

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:00.490
our river ways and get rid of the sewage
 

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:02.070
our river ways and get rid of the sewage
we learn to kind of get where the trash

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080
we learn to kind of get where the trash
 

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.620
we learn to kind of get where the trash
out of the streets and I'm wondering it

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:04.630
out of the streets and I'm wondering it
 

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.789
out of the streets and I'm wondering it
seems like one of the benefits of that

00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:05.799
seems like one of the benefits of that
 

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:07.680
seems like one of the benefits of that
is that you can immediately see the

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:07.690
is that you can immediately see the
 

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:11.120
is that you can immediately see the
benefits it's a visible tangible kind of

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:11.130
benefits it's a visible tangible kind of
 

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:13.289
benefits it's a visible tangible kind of
disease we're getting rid of disease

00:32:13.289 --> 00:32:13.299
disease we're getting rid of disease
 

00:32:13.299 --> 00:32:15.930
disease we're getting rid of disease
people are getting healthier it's not as

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:15.940
people are getting healthier it's not as
 

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.409
people are getting healthier it's not as
nasty to look at every day we're making

00:32:19.409 --> 00:32:19.419
nasty to look at every day we're making
 

00:32:19.419 --> 00:32:23.010
nasty to look at every day we're making
it the environment prettier but it seems

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:23.020
it the environment prettier but it seems
 

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.930
it the environment prettier but it seems
like the analogy kind of breaks down

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:24.940
like the analogy kind of breaks down
 

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.730
like the analogy kind of breaks down
because if you assume that we could take

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:26.740
because if you assume that we could take
 

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.890
because if you assume that we could take
the carbon out and do something about

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:28.900
the carbon out and do something about
 

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.799
the carbon out and do something about
climate change I'm wondering what the

00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:31.809
climate change I'm wondering what the
 

00:32:31.809 --> 00:32:33.779
climate change I'm wondering what the
what this what the analogy would be

00:32:33.779 --> 00:32:33.789
what this what the analogy would be
 

00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:34.940
what this what the analogy would be
about the

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:34.950
about the
 

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.830
about the
kind of the benefits that we would see

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840
kind of the benefits that we would see
 

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.690
kind of the benefits that we would see
what would be the tangible kind of

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700
what would be the tangible kind of
 

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.820
what would be the tangible kind of
things that we can kind of observe and

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:40.830
things that we can kind of observe and
 

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.159
things that we can kind of observe and
say we're actually doing something good

00:32:43.159 --> 00:32:43.169
say we're actually doing something good
 

00:32:43.169 --> 00:32:46.730
say we're actually doing something good
for Humanity as well as ourselves we're

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:46.740
for Humanity as well as ourselves we're
 

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:51.379
for Humanity as well as ourselves we're
dead right I mean the co2 is much

00:32:51.379 --> 00:32:51.389
dead right I mean the co2 is much
 

00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:53.899
dead right I mean the co2 is much
different because you can't see it it's

00:32:53.899 --> 00:32:53.909
different because you can't see it it's
 

00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:57.590
different because you can't see it it's
a long-term problem I mean the thing you

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600
a long-term problem I mean the thing you
 

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.360
a long-term problem I mean the thing you
should think of it what kind of world

00:32:59.360 --> 00:32:59.370
should think of it what kind of world
 

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.500
should think of it what kind of world
are you leaving for your

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:00.510
are you leaving for your
 

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:04.700
are you leaving for your
great-grandchildren and is is that they

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:04.710
great-grandchildren and is is that they
 

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.889
great-grandchildren and is is that they
may look back and say you all were

00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899
may look back and say you all were
 

00:33:06.899 --> 00:33:10.129
may look back and say you all were
really awful there was bad as the Nazis

00:33:10.129 --> 00:33:10.139
really awful there was bad as the Nazis
 

00:33:10.139 --> 00:33:13.070
really awful there was bad as the Nazis
you were putting co2 in the air and you

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080
you were putting co2 in the air and you
 

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.690
you were putting co2 in the air and you
knew damn well it was going to make a

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:14.700
knew damn well it was going to make a
 

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.669
knew damn well it was going to make a
lot of trouble yet you kept doing it

00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679
lot of trouble yet you kept doing it
 

00:33:16.679 --> 00:33:18.649
lot of trouble yet you kept doing it
because you didn't want to spend the

00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:18.659
because you didn't want to spend the
 

00:33:18.659 --> 00:33:22.039
because you didn't want to spend the
money to stop it so I mean that's a

00:33:22.039 --> 00:33:22.049
money to stop it so I mean that's a
 

00:33:22.049 --> 00:33:25.820
money to stop it so I mean that's a
harder sell but that's basically the way

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:25.830
harder sell but that's basically the way
 

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:30.350
harder sell but that's basically the way
to think about it is that the warming

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360
to think about it is that the warming
 

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.070
to think about it is that the warming
and changes are so slow and we have all

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080
and changes are so slow and we have all
 

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.799
and changes are so slow and we have all
of the climate noise superimposed on it

00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:36.809
of the climate noise superimposed on it
 

00:33:36.809 --> 00:33:40.220
of the climate noise superimposed on it
so we can't say sandy wouldn't have

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:40.230
so we can't say sandy wouldn't have
 

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.200
so we can't say sandy wouldn't have
happened that there were no co2 in the

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.210
happened that there were no co2 in the
 

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:45.169
happened that there were no co2 in the
atmosphere and I mean probably would've

00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179
atmosphere and I mean probably would've
 

00:33:45.179 --> 00:33:53.980
atmosphere and I mean probably would've
so if it's it's going to be very hard to

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:53.990
so if it's it's going to be very hard to
 

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.600
so if it's it's going to be very hard to
do what you do with sewage because you

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:56.610
do what you do with sewage because you
 

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:59.180
do what you do with sewage because you
take sewage away you start to see the

00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.190
take sewage away you start to see the
 

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.399
take sewage away you start to see the
benefits right away there's less tight

00:34:01.399 --> 00:34:01.409
benefits right away there's less tight
 

00:34:01.409 --> 00:34:08.599
benefits right away there's less tight
for there was this or whatever but I'm a

00:34:08.599 --> 00:34:08.609
for there was this or whatever but I'm a
 

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:10.819
for there was this or whatever but I'm a
scientist it's somebody else's problem

00:34:10.819 --> 00:34:10.829
scientist it's somebody else's problem
 

00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:14.780
scientist it's somebody else's problem
to figure out how to sell is to humanity

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:14.790
to figure out how to sell is to humanity
 

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.369
to figure out how to sell is to humanity
I can sort of lay out the basic facts

00:34:18.369 --> 00:34:18.379
I can sort of lay out the basic facts
 

00:34:18.379 --> 00:34:22.089
I can sort of lay out the basic facts
but I can't

00:34:22.089 --> 00:34:22.099
but I can't
 

00:34:22.099 --> 00:34:25.089
but I can't
i well I said in the meeting before that

00:34:25.089 --> 00:34:25.099
i well I said in the meeting before that
 

00:34:25.099 --> 00:34:30.159
i well I said in the meeting before that
would students that I don't think we're

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:30.169
would students that I don't think we're
 

00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:31.899
would students that I don't think we're
going to come to grips with the problem

00:34:31.899 --> 00:34:31.909
going to come to grips with the problem
 

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:36.129
going to come to grips with the problem
until we create an entity of global

00:34:36.129 --> 00:34:36.139
until we create an entity of global
 

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:41.139
until we create an entity of global
entity like the UN but not the UN that

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:41.149
entity like the UN but not the UN that
 

00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:43.479
entity like the UN but not the UN that
controls carbon and has somewhat

00:34:43.479 --> 00:34:43.489
controls carbon and has somewhat
 

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:45.849
controls carbon and has somewhat
dictatorial powers about regulating

00:34:45.849 --> 00:34:45.859
dictatorial powers about regulating
 

00:34:45.859 --> 00:34:48.789
dictatorial powers about regulating
carbon charging for it and so forth

00:34:48.789 --> 00:34:48.799
carbon charging for it and so forth
 

00:34:48.799 --> 00:34:51.960
carbon charging for it and so forth
that's very idealistic and it may never

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:51.970
that's very idealistic and it may never
 

00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:55.259
that's very idealistic and it may never
probably won't ever happen but I think

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:55.269
probably won't ever happen but I think
 

00:34:55.269 --> 00:34:58.450
probably won't ever happen but I think
if we're going to really do something to

00:34:58.450 --> 00:34:58.460
if we're going to really do something to
 

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.269
if we're going to really do something to
prevent the worst we should have such an

00:35:01.269 --> 00:35:01.279
prevent the worst we should have such an
 

00:35:01.279 --> 00:35:10.550
prevent the worst we should have such an
entity

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560
 
 

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.440
 
you said that you think that the biggest

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:13.450
you said that you think that the biggest
 

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:15.930
you said that you think that the biggest
impacts of that are going to harm human

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:15.940
impacts of that are going to harm human
 

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.110
impacts of that are going to harm human
welfare are going to come it with

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:18.120
welfare are going to come it with
 

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.130
welfare are going to come it with
potential declines in food production

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:20.140
potential declines in food production
 

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.340
potential declines in food production
and so I mean if you want to make an

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:23.350
and so I mean if you want to make an
 

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:27.510
and so I mean if you want to make an
argument for adaptation than should not

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520
argument for adaptation than should not
 

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.290
argument for adaptation than should not
be a focus now in boosting production of

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:31.300
be a focus now in boosting production of
 

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.510
be a focus now in boosting production of
foodstuffs or finding ways to you said

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520
foodstuffs or finding ways to you said
 

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.190
foodstuffs or finding ways to you said
that earlier that you didn't think there

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200
that earlier that you didn't think there
 

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.900
that earlier that you didn't think there
would be another Green Revolution but I

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:36.910
would be another Green Revolution but I
 

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.060
would be another Green Revolution but I
mean wouldn't the logic of that position

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:39.070
mean wouldn't the logic of that position
 

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:42.780
mean wouldn't the logic of that position
dictate that we try to find one yeah I

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:42.790
dictate that we try to find one yeah I
 

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:47.370
dictate that we try to find one yeah I
mean it's clear i mean the estimates are

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:47.380
mean it's clear i mean the estimates are
 

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.580
mean it's clear i mean the estimates are
that the increase in co2 is going to

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:50.590
that the increase in co2 is going to
 

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:54.060
that the increase in co2 is going to
decrease food production and you know

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.070
decrease food production and you know
 

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.940
decrease food production and you know
estimates range from doubling of co2

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:56.950
estimates range from doubling of co2
 

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:59.790
estimates range from doubling of co2
maybe ten percent reduction in food

00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800
maybe ten percent reduction in food
 

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.180
maybe ten percent reduction in food
production grain production to as much

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:03.190
production grain production to as much
 

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.210
production grain production to as much
as thirty percent and with an increase

got to get the co2 and water together

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760
got to get the co2 and water together
 

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.730
got to get the co2 and water together
and then it was out in the water and

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:12.740
and then it was out in the water and
 

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.610
and then it was out in the water and
there's infinitely more water down there

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:15.620
there's infinitely more water down there
 

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.970
there's infinitely more water down there
than there is co2 and the one that

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:18.980
than there is co2 and the one that
 

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:23.130
than there is co2 and the one that
happens is co take the co2 loaded water

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:23.140
happens is co take the co2 loaded water
 

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.800
happens is co take the co2 loaded water
becomes more dense than either liquid

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:26.810

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:30.820
becomes more dense than either liquid
co2 or normal water and it's going to be

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:30.830
co2 or normal water and it's going to be
 

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:32.920
co2 or normal water and it's going to be
like a fountain can't go back down again

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:32.930
like a fountain can't go back down again
 

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:36.790
like a fountain can't go back down again
before it reaches a shale cap which

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800
before it reaches a shale cap which
 

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.390
before it reaches a shale cap which
would be great impedance to it leaking

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400
would be great impedance to it leaking
 

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.590
would be great impedance to it leaking
but there you know there may be

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:41.600
but there you know there may be
 

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.810

get up and of course 1% leakage is not

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440
get up and of course 1% leakage is not
 

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.710

trivial because we're going to have to

trivial because we're going to have to
 

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.450
trivial because we're going to have to
put a lot of carbon away and so the

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:55.460
put a lot of carbon away and so the
 

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.520
put a lot of carbon away and so the
amount stored is going to get greater

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:57.530
amount stored is going to get greater
 

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.560
amount stored is going to get greater
and greater in that one percent going to

00:41:59.560 --> 00:41:59.570
and greater in that one percent going to
 

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.270
and greater in that one percent going to
get greater and greater and of course

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280
get greater and greater and of course
 

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:07.000
get greater and greater and of course
you have to then pay to put it back but

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:07.010
you have to then pay to put it back but
 

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:11.320
you have to then pay to put it back but
I think that there are plenty of places

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:11.330
I think that there are plenty of places
 

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:14.950
I think that there are plenty of places
to store co2 where the likelihood of it

that's interesting if you can pay for

that's interesting if you can pay for

dissolves out magnesium and calcium ions
 

00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:11.380
dissolves out magnesium and calcium ions
and that makes a co2 into bicarbonate

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:11.390
and that makes a co2 into bicarbonate
 

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:13.990

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:30.380
and say you're trying to with taking co2
 

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:33.160

and you can't do it in one place that

00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:58.330
and you can't do it in one place that

and so I called a free port sulphur who

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:41.540
and so I called a free port sulphur who
 

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:44.980
and so I called a free port sulphur who
and I asked him you know how much it was

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:44.990
and I asked him you know how much it was
 

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:48.520
and I asked him you know how much it was
a ton and he said 110 dollars of time it

that we should shut it down and Columbia

00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:31.220
that we should shut it down and Columbia
 

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.520

01:01:11.599 --> 01:01:11.609
I'm the same kind of student they loved
 

01:01:11.609 --> 01:01:13.939
I'm the same kind of student they loved
it and they thought it was one of the

01:01:13.939 --> 01:01:13.949
it and they thought it was one of the
 

01:01:13.949 --> 01:01:18.380
it and they thought it was one of the
best semesters at Columbia but people we

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:18.390
best semesters at Columbia but people we
 

01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:21.259
best semesters at Columbia but people we
couldn't support it with Columbia barn

01:01:21.259 --> 01:01:21.269
couldn't support it with Columbia barn
 

01:01:21.269 --> 01:01:26.149
couldn't support it with Columbia barn
students weren't enough of them so we

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:26.159
students weren't enough of them so we
 

01:01:26.159 --> 01:01:28.339
students weren't enough of them so we
had to get other students and Columbia

01:01:28.339 --> 01:01:28.349
had to get other students and Columbia
 

01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:30.169
had to get other students and Columbia
tuition is too high and that's what

01:01:30.169 --> 01:01:30.179
tuition is too high and that's what
 

01:01:30.179 --> 01:01:34.189
tuition is too high and that's what
killed the engine the education program

01:01:34.189 --> 01:01:34.199
killed the engine the education program
 

01:01:34.199 --> 01:01:42.510
killed the engine the education program
which was that tragedy to go really good

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:42.520
 
 

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.589
 
well I think that should be written up

01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599
well I think that should be written up
 

01:01:44.599 --> 01:01:47.650
well I think that should be written up
as how to build a habitable biosphere 2

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:47.660

know what I would do I would make sure

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400
know what I would do I would make sure
 

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.089

that that plants produce more oxygen

01:02:07.089 --> 01:02:07.099
that that plants produce more oxygen
 

01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:14.109
that that plants produce more oxygen
than the soils and you would have to you

01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:14.119
than the soils and you would have to you
 

01:02:14.119 --> 01:02:19.120

there if you'd have to cheat in a way

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:21.230
there if you'd have to cheat in a way
 

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:22.660
there if you'd have to cheat in a way
because you'd have to have ingredients

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:22.670
because you'd have to have ingredients

the first year they almost started and

01:02:28.859 --> 01:02:28.869
the first year they almost started and
 

01:02:28.869 --> 01:02:31.660
the first year they almost started and
part of it was they grew the wrong plans

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:31.670
part of it was they grew the wrong plans
 

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:35.230
part of it was they grew the wrong plans
the other part was that it was an El

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:35.240
the other part was that it was an El
 

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.170
the other part was that it was an El
Nino year is very cloudy and so they

01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:38.180
Nino year is very cloudy and so they
 

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.450
Nino year is very cloudy and so they
didn't get as much sunshine and a cloudy

01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:40.460
didn't get as much sunshine and a cloudy
 

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.069
didn't get as much sunshine and a cloudy
year they would have grown twenty

01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079
year they would have grown twenty
 

01:02:42.079 --> 01:02:43.870
year they would have grown twenty
percent more and you know that's the

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:43.880
percent more and you know that's the
 

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.870
percent more and you know that's the
twenty percent in food production can

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880
twenty percent in food production can
 

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.620
twenty percent in food production can
make a big difference so they changed

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:50.630
make a big difference so they changed

really just recently a science group has

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:39.270
really just recently a science group has
 

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:42.660
really just recently a science group has
determined that the the mixture the

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:42.670
determined that the the mixture the
 

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:45.710

conventional oil being pumped and I so I

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:52.870
conventional oil being pumped and I so I
 

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:54.750
conventional oil being pumped and I so I
just wonder if the water is an issue I

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:54.760
just wonder if the water is an issue I
 

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.670
just wonder if the water is an issue I
mean it's I mean from an environmental

01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.680
mean it's I mean from an environmental
 

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:02.790
mean it's I mean from an environmental
standpoint it's bad but we had a debate

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:02.800
standpoint it's bad but we had a debate
 

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.520

while i was at Arizona State and I
 

01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:08.670
while i was at Arizona State and I
learned a lot about it from that sort of

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680
learned a lot about it from that sort of
 

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.660
learned a lot about it from that sort of
discussion and I mean there are issues

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:12.670
discussion and I mean there are issues
 

01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:17.310
discussion and I mean there are issues
like energy independence so if we get

01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:17.320
like energy independence so if we get
 

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.480
like energy independence so if we get
stuff from Canada there are friends and

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:20.490
stuff from Canada there are friends and
 

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:23.670
stuff from Canada there are friends and
rather than you know the Arab countries

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680
rather than you know the Arab countries
 

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.770
rather than you know the Arab countries
that you know could turn against us at

01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:25.780
that you know could turn against us at
 

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:32.069
that you know could turn against us at
any time

the other issue well water is I mean I

01:04:39.839 --> 01:04:39.849
the other issue well water is I mean I
 

01:04:39.849 --> 01:04:44.620
the other issue well water is I mean I
mean I don't I don't I've seen one of

they're digging up all this sand and

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:03.890
they're digging up all this sand and
 

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:06.520
they're digging up all this sand and
they and huge equipment you know with

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:06.530
they and huge equipment you know with
 

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:10.480
they and huge equipment you know with
tires that are 15 feet high or something

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:10.490

they put it in conveyor belts and take

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:14.630
they put it in conveyor belts and take
 

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:18.089
they put it in conveyor belts and take
it into a heated up get the tower off

01:05:18.089 --> 01:05:18.099
it into a heated up get the tower off
 

01:05:18.099 --> 01:05:20.950
it into a heated up get the tower off
sand comes out looking like ordinary

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960
sand comes out looking like ordinary

beach sand but they're just tearing up a

01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720
beach sand but they're just tearing up a

huge track I was interested in it

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:26.990
huge track I was interested in it
 

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:30.370
huge track I was interested in it
because the reason they can get at that

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:30.380
because the reason they can get at that
 

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:33.910
because the reason they can get at that
sand is there was a terrible flood room

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920
sand is there was a terrible flood room
 

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.800
sand is there was a terrible flood room
through there at the end of glacial time

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:35.810
through there at the end of glacial time
 

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:39.010
through there at the end of glacial time
and ripped away the overburden and so

01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:39.020
and ripped away the overburden and so
 

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.890
and ripped away the overburden and so
that now they can just drive around and

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:41.900
that now they can just drive around and
 

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.800
that now they can just drive around and
pull it out most of that time and is

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:44.810
pull it out most of that time and is
 

01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:47.680
pull it out most of that time and is
under I don't know 100 feet of

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:47.690
under I don't know 100 feet of
 

01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:50.710
under I don't know 100 feet of
overburden or something and so they'll

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720
overburden or something and so they'll
 

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.510
overburden or something and so they'll
never be able to take it off they'll

01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:52.520
never be able to take it off they'll
 

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.430
never be able to take it off they'll
have the solution mine it they'll have

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440
have the solution mine it they'll have
 

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.190
have the solution mine it they'll have
to send down hot water and take it off

01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200
to send down hot water and take it off
 

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.300
to send down hot water and take it off
inside too and so that's a question how

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:01.310
inside too and so that's a question how
 

01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:03.430
inside too and so that's a question how
much do they really have they claim they

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440
much do they really have they claim they
 

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:08.770
much do they really have they claim they
have a one Saudi Arabia worth of oil but

01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:08.780
