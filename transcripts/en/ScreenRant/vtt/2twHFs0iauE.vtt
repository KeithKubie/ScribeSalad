00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.190
The first draft of the script isn’t the
only one that exists, and filmmakers work

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.580
with a variety of ideas to try to craft the
perfect story.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.000
This means that lines, scenes, or even entire
sequences are retooled or cut entirely before

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.780
the movie hits theaters.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.720
And that means the whole movie could be drastically
changed.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.290
If you haven’t seen part 1, stay tuned for
a link to it in this video!

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:36.410
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 amazing movie
twists you’ve never seen PART 2.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.230
Army of Darkness

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.190
American audiences know Army of Darkness as
the story of Ash taking on the Deadites in

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.780
Medieval times and then using the Necronomicon
to return home to kill another possessed demon.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.160
But international viewers got a different
version.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.109
Ash still beats the Deadites in the past,
but is then given a potion that allows him

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.510
to sleep one century for each drop he drinks.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.680
The hero misuses it and lands himself in a
future apocalypse overrun by Deadites.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.251
He screams in anguish and the film ends.

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:08.970
It seems like a cool concept, but it’s a
bleak end for Ash and seems to go against

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.980
the film’s humorous tone.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.330
Watchmen

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.580
Zack Snyder’s superhero epic sees the villainous
Ozymandias blowing up US and Russian cities,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.960
blaming it on Dr. Manhattan so the two nations
have a common enemy, forcing Manhattan to

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.500
leave Earth for world peace.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.880
But he originally targeted Manhattan for a
totally different reason.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.110
When Terry Gilliam was attached to direct,
Ozymandias convinced Manhattan to go back

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.522
in time and stop the accident that gave the
Watchmen their powers because the existence

00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:40.522
of the god has a negative impact on everything.

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:42.910
The decision creates a better timeline where
heroes only exist in comic books.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.480
It would have been an interesting, if different,
way to end the film.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.160
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.960
After defeating Ramona’s seven evil exes,
Scott Pilgrim can be with his newfound love,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.640
but Edgar Wright didn’t always have that
ending in mind.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.500
An alternate version sees Scott leaving Ramona
behind to reunite with Knives, and while that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.850
has a nice touch, it undermines the crux of
the narrative.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.890
After seeing all Scott went through, audiences
deserved to see him and Ramona together.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.879
It’s just too bad Wright couldn’t shoot
his other ending, which saw a news report

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.090
detailing a serial killer who had murdered
seven people and claimed to be in a video

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.660
game.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.230
E.T.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.380
– The Extra Terrestrial

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.100
Steven Spielberg ends his beloved film in
an awe-inspiring, magical way: Elliott watches

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.900
in amazement as E.T.’s ship flies back home.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.560
It’s somewhat uncertain what will become
of the boy, and Spielberg originally had more

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.060
finality in the conclusion.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.100
The original version had Elliott saying a
downbeat monologue about the need to search

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.870
for experience, before showing a scene featuring
him playing with other children.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.430
It shows that Elliott moved on from E.T. afterwards,
but it undercuts the sense of wonder the film

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.790
is known for and didn’t serve a real purpose
in the story.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.120
Dodgeball

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.000
Looking to subvert the typical “underdog”
trope, the original ending of Dodgeball saw

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.310
our heroes defeated by Globo Gym before sulking
off into the sunset.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.750
While Ben Stiller celebrated, test audiences
did not.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.240
After spending the entire film with Vince
Vaughn’s loveable losers, they wanted to

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.940
see the gang come out on top, so a happier
ending was inserted.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.569
However, the filmmakers used this as an opportunity
to fit in one final gag.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.790
In a post-credits scene, a fat White Goodman
pokes fun at the audience, saying that now

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.130
they’re happy because the villains lost.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.069
So this was probably a good call.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.890
Donnie Darko

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.850
Donnie Darko threw audiences for a loop when
at the end, the title character realized he

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.270
had to die in order to correct the timeline
and save his loved ones.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.070
It’s a haunting moment for the character
and viewers and even leaves some things unanswered.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.170
While fans always just assumed Donnie met
his end when the plane crashed through his

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.250
room, they never saw the aftermath.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.660
But one ending treated us to that sight, including
a graphic image of his dying body twitching

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.910
with a pole stuck through it.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.730
We did not need that to understand the message
of the film.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.980
The Town

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.590
Doug McCray manages to get away from Boston
and start a new life in Florida, but he almost

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.590
joined his friends in death.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.060
An alternate ending for The Town saw Doug
bump into Alex Collazo, who shoots him down.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.930
That name sound familiar?

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.819
Viewers will remember Alex better as the thief
Doug and his friend James beat up much earlier

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:25.070
in the film, and nobody expected to see again.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.220
While this cut ending gives the film an ironic
edge about crime not paying, it’s a tad

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.250
anticlimactic, very abrupt, and a little confusing.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.940
Seeing Doug free made for a more satisfying
finale.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.090
The Amazing Spider-Man

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.560
We’ve covered this one before, but we just
couldn’t leave it out.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.900
Peter Parker believes his parents are dead,
but in an alternate ending for Amazing Spider-Man

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.880
2, he gets a surprise visit from his very
much alive father.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.600
Richard Parker gives his son some words of
encouragement to help him get over Gwen Stacey’s

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.290
death and move on as a renewed Spider-Man.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.850
Director Marc Webb eventually went with Peter
being motivated by Gwen’s graduation speech,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.600
which was probably the right call.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.680
Richard’s sudden appearance was jarring
and raised even more questions about the film’s

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.100
messy story.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.970
Ant-Man

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.340
Ant-Man sets up the future of the Marvel Cinematic
Universe by showing undercover Hydra agent

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.100
Mitchell Carson stealing Pym particles for
an unknown purpose.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.410
But it originally wasn’t that open-ended.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.500
The initial conclusion featured Scott Lang
having an encounter with Carson, defeating

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.500
him in a fight to reclaim the particles.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.590
That would have been a nice way to tie up
loose ends and give the film some finality,

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.820
but the MCU is always looking ahead, and the
filmmakers wanted to save this aspect for

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.820
later.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.370
Knowing them, the particles will come back
later in a big way.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.370
Paranormal Activity

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.820
If only the filmmakers had gone with the alternate
ending, maybe horror fans would have been

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.970
spared from the disappointing sequels.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.330
The theatrical version had Katie kill Micah
off-camera and returning to the room to show

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.490
her demon face.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.110
In a different conclusion, Katie murders Micah
downstairs off-camera before returning to

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.760
the room and slitting her throat.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.210
There was also an ending where after killing
Micah, Katie sits in the room alone for days

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.050
on end before her sister comes around to investigate.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.009
After seeing Micah’s body, the sister calls
the cops and they shoot a knife-wielding Katie.

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.880
Either one might have had a more powerful
impact and brought the story to a more terrifying

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.880
end.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880
