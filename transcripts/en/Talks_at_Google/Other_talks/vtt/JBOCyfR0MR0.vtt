00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:06.270
SIMON ROGERS: Thanks
so much for coming

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.119
and welcome to
[INAUDIBLE] live stream.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.650
My name is Simon Rogers.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.500
I am the news editor at Google's
News Lab, News Lab at Google.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.900
And we're working some really
exciting stuff around data

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.160
journalism at the moment.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.560
Coming soon we have
the trends relaunch,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.000
which is going to be amazing.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.220
So today is a really
great talk for us

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.330
to have-- how to tell
stories with data.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.880
And we are incredibly
lucky to be

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.110
joined by David
Leonhardt, who is editor

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.460
of "The Upshot," which is new.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.150
How long now?

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.619
It's a year, a year and a half?

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.480
DAVID LEONHARDT: Just
about a year old.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.063
SIMON ROGERS: Year
old and has already

00:00:35.063 --> 00:00:38.400
become one of the foremost
practitions of data journalism

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.390
out there in the wild.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.240
It's got great experience
about working with data.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.240
He's also won a Pulitzer prize.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.790
Is he the only person in here
who's one a Pulitzer prize?

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.990
I'm going to say yes to that.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.430
And he's worked the
"Times" sometimes,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.180
also before that at
the "Washington Post."

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.290
Has great experience
across the news industry.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.855
So without further delay,
I'll go introduce David.

00:00:58.855 --> 00:00:59.980
DAVID LEONHARDT: Thank you.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.113
Thank you all for coming.

00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:04.819
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.330
Thanks so much for having
me, and for coming here

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.626
on a beautiful day, and watching
on live stream, and all those.

00:01:10.626 --> 00:01:13.250
I've collaborated with a lot of
folks at Google over the years,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.270
and so it's really
nice to be back and be

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.420
talking to all of you.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.795
I want to try to give you a
little bit of the big picture

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:22.810
sense of journalism briefly, and
then we'll talk a little bit,

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.600
and then open it up to any kind
of questions that folks have,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.560
whether it's about
data journalism,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.184
whether it's about
the "New York Times"

00:01:29.184 --> 00:01:32.110
generally, whether it's
about anything you want.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.575
So let's start with
the big picture,

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:36.700
and I want to start by
asking a question, which is,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.180
have you've heard the one about
journalism being in decline?

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.730
It goes something like this.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.700
No one will pay for
serious journalism.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.050
Listicles, dumb down
explainers, slideshows

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.350
about pets are replacing
in depth reporting.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.180
Social media has
created an echo chamber

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.410
in which people read only
articles that confirm

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.420
their pre-existing biases.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.750
The good old days of shoe
leather reporting are fading.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.180
Well, this story is wrong.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.010
American journalism is better
today than it has ever been,

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.120
I believe.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.510
Yes, it faces some challenges,
serious challenges,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.730
real challenges.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.330
The nostalgic narrative is not
completely without some truth.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.310
It has strands of truth to it.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.570
Above all, the business
model of journalism

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.720
is changing rapidly
in a way that

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.660
does threaten some truly
valuable parts of the industry.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.250
I worry in particular
about local news, which

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.550
serves a really vital
role in our democracy,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.370
holding school boards,
and judges, and city

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.080
councils accountable,
keeping readers informed.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.100
And we can talk a little bit
more about local journalism.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.740
But it's important
not to confuse

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.340
the challenges that are out
there with the fuller picture.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.710
The reason that journalism
matters, the reason that it's

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.280
different from, say, the
horse and buggy business,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.640
is that it plays a crucial
role in our democracy.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.360
It helps to keep citizens
informed about the world.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.400
It gives them
information on which

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.990
they can act as voters, as
employees, as investors,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.520
as researchers, or simply
as human beings who

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.650
need to eat, and exercise,
and sleep, and work, and play,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.840
and make decisions
about all of this.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.440
By this standard,
by the standard

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.210
of whether journalism is
keeping people informed,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.690
I would argue that
journalism in 2015

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.520
is stronger than it was
in 2000, is stronger

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.140
than it was in 1990,
or stronger than it

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.710
was in those good old
days of 1950 or 1960.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.290
It's more fun, both
to practice, and I

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.400
think it's more fun to read.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.550
And I think there are four
reasons to believe this.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.500
The first is that journalism
is more accurate than it used

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.890
to be, which is not to say
that it's perfectly accurate,

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.660
or to put it in terms that
an economist like Hal Varian

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.220
might use, the market
for truth is more liquid

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.174
than it used to be.

00:03:54.174 --> 00:03:55.590
I want to show you
an article now.

00:03:59.374 --> 00:04:01.290
This article appeared
in the "Washington Post"

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.820
a little more than 20 years ago.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.680
It's an excerpt of
a story of mine.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.350
It appeared in the
summer of 1994,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.690
and it's about behind the
scenes political efforts

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.400
to build a new sports
arena in Washington.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.260
It would become known
as the MCI Center.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.430
Today it's the Verizon Center.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.310
It's where the Warriors
play the Wizards

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.710
and the Sharks
play the Capitals.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.140
I wrote this story at the
end of a summer internship

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.330
at the "Post."

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.690
And I will confess I felt
pretty good about it.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.980
the paper stripped it across
the top of the metro section.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.600
But there is a problem
with this story,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.410
and I will ask if
anyone can see it.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.800
I don't expect that
anyone will, but I'm

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.200
happy to be
pleasantly surprised.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.050
The problem is that
there is a word that

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.280
is misspelled in this story,
and it's not just any word.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.300
It's Katharine, as
in Katharine Graham,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.090
the woman who ran
the "Washington

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.810
Post," the newspaper in
which this article appeared.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.220
Katharine should have two A's
and one E. As you see it here,

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.640
it has two E's and won A. I
learned about this mistake

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.900
about a week later when I picked
up a copy of the Washington

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.000
"City Paper," which is
Washington's local weekly,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.050
and there was a small item
in it, which read, I quote,

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.590
"there is a special place in
the dungeon of the "Washington

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.820
Post" for David Leonhardt,"
which is not exactly what you

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.640
want when you're a summer
intern trying to get hired.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.900
I did not get hired.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.390
I don't know how much it had to
do with the spelling mistake.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.710
Now, imagine that I
made this mistake today

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.270
rather than in 1994.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.000
Think about how different the
whole experience would be.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.490
The story would go online,
and in all likelihood,

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.160
within a matter of
minutes, certainly

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.050
within a matter of hours,
some eagle eyed reader

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.500
would begin mocking me.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.990
It would not take an
extra week to do so.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.510
In fact, there is
a very good chance

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.430
that this never would
appear in the printed

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.810
edition of the
"Washington Post,"

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.960
because the article would
go online at 9:00 AM,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.870
or 2:00 PM, or 5:00 PM.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.649
We would see it.

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:01.190
We would feel stupid
about it, and we

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.150
would fix it before the
paper ever went to press.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.180
Now, I know that
spelling mistakes

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.320
aren't really important.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.460
They may be embarrassing, but
they're not really important.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.680
But this newly liquid market
for truth is important,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.520
and it's important
for reasons that

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.330
are much bigger than
spelling mistakes.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.950
In the old days when
readers or sources wanted

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.500
to question the conclusions
or facts in a story,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.480
they didn't have
many great options.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.800
They had to write a letter
to the editor, which

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.030
might or might not have
been published days or even

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.580
weeks later, or they had to
persuade another newspaper

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.690
or magazine to write
an article that

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.740
came to different conclusions.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.680
Today, writers and readers
are able to hash out

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.790
big questions in real time.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.360
They're able to debate
them before the article has

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.072
settled into the consciousness.

00:06:53.072 --> 00:06:56.360
To take a tiny example,
just this weekend

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.160
a journalist tweeted
an article with a chart

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.200
showing the Bureau
of Labor statistics

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.130
series on college costs.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.880
I bet you've seen a
version of this chart.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.470
It appears in the
media all the time

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.220
showing how college
costs have outstripped

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.090
nearly everything else.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.120
That Bureau of Labor
Statistics series is wrong.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.620
It is based on a
version of college costs

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.180
that did not include financial
aid until relatively recently.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.100
I responded saying that Bureau
of Labor statistics series

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.690
is wrong.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.929
I sent a link explaining
how it's wrong.

00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:26.720
The journalist wrote
back, and said thanks,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.250
and deleted the tweet.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.340
This newly liquid market not
only is better for readers,

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.210
but it makes us
better at our jobs.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.690
As the great psychologist
Danny Kahneman says,

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.590
"acquisition of skills
requires a regular environment,

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.430
an adequate opportunity
to practice,

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.780
and rapid and unequivocal
feedback about the correctness

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.820
of thoughts and actions."

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.680
With the exception
of unequivocal,

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.360
I would argue that
that whole definition

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.280
applies to social media in
particular and journalism

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.220
today.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.480
The second reason to feel
good about journalism

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.170
involves the tools
and techniques

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.630
that we have for
telling stories.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.620
If you'll permit me a
second brief personal story,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.630
I joined the "New York
Times" in 1999 as a reporter.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.140
I'm happy to report
in my 16 years

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.640
there I haven't I
haven't misspelled

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.110
Arthur or Sulzberger,
and many of the stories

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.970
that I write or edit
today have a lot

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.320
in common with the stories
that I wrote in my first months

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.429
at the "Times."

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.409
They're based on an academic
study or an analysis.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:36.960
I try to understand the data.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.780
I talk to other researchers.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.500
I talk to policymakers about
why the study might or might not

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.200
matter.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.200
I look for real people
who typify the trend.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.360
None of that has changed.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.530
Nearly everything
else has changed.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.030
When those stories went
in the paper in 1999

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.010
when I joined the
paper, they likely

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.430
would have been accompanied
by one or two photos

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.600
and one or two black and
white charts or maps.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.370
Today we have so many more
tools at our disposal,

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.030
and when done right, as my
colleagues are able to do-- I

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.910
do not have the technical
skills to do it--

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.450
those tools are
really, really good.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:20.180
Consider this story from 2013.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.470
This is about how the
odds of escaping poverty

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.560
differ depending on
where you grow up.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.450
Gone is the little
black and white map

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.894
that would have accompanied
this story in 1999,

00:09:30.894 --> 00:09:32.310
and if you had
squinted back then,

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.180
you might have noticed that
Utah was lighter than Georgia.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.380
Today, you can zoom in on every
metro area in the country.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.140
You can hover over
it, and you can

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.780
see what the odds
of a child who is

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.650
in the bottom
fifth of the income

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.300
quintile growing up to
be in the top fifth.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.700
You can see that those
odds are vastly worse

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.920
in the southeast and the
old industrial Midwest

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.740
than they are in
most of California,

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.360
or most of New England,
or the mountain West.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.670
You can also scroll
down, and you

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.040
can decide what income
group you want to focus on.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.770
By any definition, this
is better journalism

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.700
than we could have
done even 10 years ago.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.570
It gives readers more control.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.480
It lets them understand
the data better

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.640
than they could in the past.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.600
Now consider this
follow up, which

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.390
we ran just a few weeks ago.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.640
It's based on the same set of
academic research, an updated

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.340
version of it.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.670
It gets more detailed.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.530
It goes down to
the county level,

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.350
and what my
colleagues did here is

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.580
they set up the journalism
so that wherever you log on

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.420
based on the best we can
tell from your IP address,

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.340
it focuses on that county.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.040
I did not have to put
Santa Clara up here.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.750
It came automatically.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.590
Not exactly right.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.580
Are we in Santa Clara,
or are we in San Mateo?

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.280
AUDIENCE: Santa Clara.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.279
DAVID LEONHARDT: We are.

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:51.895
Exactly right.

00:10:51.895 --> 00:10:53.520
Not only that, but
if you then read it,

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.950
you'll see the text actually
gets into Santa Clara.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.100
There's a template in which
we give you data and text that

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.760
talks about Santa Clara.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.550
I think by any
definition this is better

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.910
than we could have
done several years ago.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.060
Here's another example.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.830
We were looking at the
relationship between family

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.010
income and whether a
child goes to college.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.320
The line is remarkably
straight, but we

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.330
thought showing people
a straight line would

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.470
underestimate just how
interesting it was,

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.400
so we invited them to
draw a line themselves.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.590
Most people drew something
equivalent-- something

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:36.895
like an S like that, and then
we told them what it really was.

00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:39.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.030
So basically that was
not a very good line.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.710
80% of people did
better than I just did.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.390
The real line is straight.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.350
We then show people
that combined

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.666
answers that all readers give.

00:11:50.666 --> 00:11:51.790
This is really interesting.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.020
The situation is depressing.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.690
Your family income
has a huge impact

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.700
on whether you go to college.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.010
It's not as depressing as our
readers think it is, though.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:58.280
Look.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.113
Nearly all readers
underestimate the chances

00:12:00.113 --> 00:12:04.350
that poor kids go to college,
and many overestimate the odds

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.469
that rich kids do.

00:12:06.469 --> 00:12:09.010
The point about all of these is
that they literally could not

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.340
have existed in
1999, and whatever

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.104
you think about any individual
one, whether we did it well

00:12:15.104 --> 00:12:16.770
or whether we could
have done it better,

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.360
they clearly have the potential
to be better than what

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.410
we were doing in the past.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.440
They also have the
potential to improve

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.650
what I think remains the
highest form of journalism--

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.870
the expose that requires
enormous work, whether it is

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.180
on nail salon
workers in New York,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.640
to cite a piece a
colleague of mine

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.014
has recently done, whether
it's on police killings,

00:12:38.014 --> 00:12:40.180
to cite some work the
"Washington Post" has recently

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.310
done, it can make that
work better and easier

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.640
to understand.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.570
One more example.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.170
This comes from
election night 2014.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.420
To be honest, election
night coverage

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.360
has long been terrible.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.560
The media has exit poll results
it won't share with readers,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.030
and it generally
reports raw vote totals

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.980
in a way that doesn't
explain that they

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.350
don't come in randomly.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.020
In some states like
Virginia, Republican areas

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.670
report early and
Democratic areas late.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.310
In other states like
Iowa, the reverse is true.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.850
So some colleagues
of mine realized

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.580
this was possible to do better
on, and what they did was

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.930
they created an
expected vote return

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.350
for every county in any state
with an important election

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.780
in 2014, and they then
compared the results.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.700
So if a county in Virginia was
coming in 70/30 Republican,

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.499
but it usually came in
75/25 Republican, that

00:13:34.499 --> 00:13:36.040
doesn't mean the
Republican is ahead,

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.990
that means the
Republican is behind.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.520
On election night, this
was actually going live.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.060
We froze it at the end.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:48.340
And so over time, the solid
line were the actual returns,

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.624
and the dotted lines were
our adjusted returns.

00:13:51.624 --> 00:13:53.290
And I can tell you
since no one had ever

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.260
done this before publicly, it
was quite anxiety producing,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.050
because by 8 o'clock, we
were already telling people

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:01.670
that Mark Warner
was likely to win

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.220
a narrow victory in Virginia.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.550
That's the dotted blue
line that you see,

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.470
whereas the raw
vote total still had

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.120
Ed Gillespie, the Republican,
up by seven or eight points.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.590
And we were all
hoping against hope

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.830
that the red line would
come down to the blue line,

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.560
not for partisan reasons--
in fact, I'll show you Iowa.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.730
It's the flip-- because we
would have looked silly.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.210
And sure enough, these things
could go wrong sometimes.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.580
Wrong isn't even the right word.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.930
Sometimes there's
going to be uncertainty

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.067
over the course of the
night, but the straightness

00:14:30.067 --> 00:14:32.150
of this blue line I think
provide some pretty good

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.510
evidence that this is a better
way to think about vote returns

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.080
than the raw returns.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.500
You'll see the opposite
in Iowa, as I mentioned,

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.760
in which the Democrats starts
with a pretty substantial lead.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.390
The dotted line is
the adjusted line,

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.760
and it remains quite
straight all night.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.340
These interactive real
time approaches to news

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.830
have all kinds of potential.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.380
For sports coverage, my
colleague, Kevin Quealy,

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.930
did this delightful
NFL playoffs simulator,

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.600
that if you ask
a question about,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.270
I'll be more than happy to talk
about-- about personal finance,

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.450
about all kinds of things.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.070
I want to make one
additional point

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.620
about the new storytelling tools
that we have in journalism.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.310
One of them isn't new at all.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.320
It's the new variety of
voice that journalism

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:26.440
has always had at it's disposal,
but too often hasn't used.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.680
And the reason we're
getting better about voice

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.510
is because of the informal
and direct culture

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.917
of internet conversation.

00:15:33.917 --> 00:15:35.500
I've been a journalist
since I started

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.000
writing for my high school
paper almost 30 years ago.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.120
It's the only professional thing
I've ever done in many ways.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.005
So I offer the following
critique in a loving way,

00:15:44.005 --> 00:15:46.590
but a lot of the traditional
style of news writing

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.390
is just not very good.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.420
It consists of dense
complex sentences

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.530
that begin with phrases like,
in a fundamental shift that

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.390
has the potential to alter
the political landscape,

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.630
and then continues
for 40 more words

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.880
with various dependent clauses.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.590
The web has helped to
break us of these habits,

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.210
or at least it's starting to.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.320
We now more frequently write
in a conversational voice,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.480
an understandable
style that allows

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.780
smart non-experts to engage
with our material more easily.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.580
This change isn't revolutionary.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.790
None of us invented it.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.010
Kate Boo, Michael Lewis,
Robert Caro, Taylor Branch,

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.780
other great writers have been
writing this way for decades.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.300
"Slate," which is a forerunner
of today's journalism

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.160
in so many ways, has
been doing it for years,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.090
but I'm happy that
more of us are now

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.010
attempting this approach rather
than the stultified approach.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.250
And let's be clear.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:42.070
There is nothing inherently
sophisticated or smart

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.656
about a 40 word sentence with
a lot of grandiose words in it.

00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:48.280
The third reason
journalism is stronger

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.488
is actually a reason I've
already covered stealthily.

00:16:50.488 --> 00:16:51.630
It's about the data.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.710
We have better data
than we used to.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.420
Data sometimes gets fetishized,
and probably more often it

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.840
gets maligned as
somehow inhuman,

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.290
which is obviously silly.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.030
Data is just the plural
of fact collected

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.140
in a way that allows for
meaningful comparisons

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.390
when it's done
right, but we really

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.200
do have better data and a
better picture of reality

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.290
than we used to.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.150
Those studies I showed you about
the odds of escaping poverty

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.950
would not have been
possible before.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.450
They're based on administrative
data that follow people over

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.430
many years and track their
earnings in a way that surveys

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.650
simply cannot do.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.490
You cannot survey enough people,
and continue to follow them,

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.100
and expect them to answer
accurately about their earnings

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.710
in the way that
administrative data does.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.371
We don't just have
administrative data.

00:17:33.371 --> 00:17:35.870
We have all kinds of data from
the web that gives us insight

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.670
into what people are
doing and what people

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.622
are thinking as they are doing
it and as they are thinking it.

00:17:41.622 --> 00:17:44.080
We've collaborated with Google
on a bunch of such projects,

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.910
including a fun piece
from Thanksgiving

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.630
about the regional
variations in recipes

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.920
that people search for
on Thanksgiving week.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.130
Thanks to that, I
and readers know

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.980
what frog eye salad is, which
I do not recommend you eat.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.980
And we know what
chocolate chess bars are,

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.790
which I do recommend you eat.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.080
We also know that Jewish apple
cake is popular in Pennsylvania

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.830
and not at all Jewish.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.030
The final reason that I
think journalism is stronger

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.950
is that the market says so.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:14.010
The audience for
ambitious journalism

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.889
is larger than it was
only a short time ago.

00:18:16.889 --> 00:18:18.930
The number of people who
read a typical big story

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.670
at the "Times" has increased
probably 50% or 100%

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.200
since I joined the
paper, and many of them

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.370
are paying for it, either
through a paper subscription

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.350
or an online subscription.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:34.690
Beyond the "Times," a potpourri
of really good new publications

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.280
have arisen, replacing some
of the famous brands that

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.040
have faded.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.080
"Quartz," "Vox," "Buzzfeed,"
"FiveThirtyEight"-- I already

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.150
mentioned "Slate."

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.790
And while the "Atlantic" and
the "New Yorker" are old names,

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.290
they're doing new things,
and they're doing them well.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.210
Just as important,
readers are making clear

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:55.051
that they want more of the
new forms of journalism.

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.550
If you look at the list of the
most read stories on the "New

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.120
York Times" over
any extended period,

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.480
you'll notice a few
fascinating patterns.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.190
First, of course there
are articles about diet,

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:09.270
and exercise, and
sex, and real estate,

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.160
but that's not what most of
the best read particles are.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.210
Most of the best read
articles are about subjects

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.530
that no one would ever
describe as click bait,

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.950
but I find this pattern
may be even more important.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.090
A disproportionate share of the
most read articles at the "New

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.720
York Times" are not
articles, at least not

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.290
in the traditional sense.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:32.140
They're interactives, like the
ones I've been showing you.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:32.750
They're maps.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.440
They're photos.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.850
They're essays.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:35.810
They're videos.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:36.920
They're Q&amp;A's.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.170
They're often highly
substantive pieces

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.160
of work about serious topics.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.500
They're just not in
the form around which

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.280
we've traditionally organized
journalism-- blocks of text.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.160
You see it not just with what
we're doing at "The Upshot."

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.920
You see it through
an Ebola explainer.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.755
You see through ISIS videos.

00:19:55.755 --> 00:19:58.130
You see it through things
we've done on "Game of Thrones"

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.770
and on how people age.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.890
I'm not suggesting
that journalism abandon

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.455
the traditional
article, and if this

00:20:04.455 --> 00:20:05.830
were a journalistic
audience, I'd

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.850
spend five minutes assuring
you I'm not suggesting that,

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.960
but I do think that readers
are telling us something here,

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.240
and I think we could do
a better job of listening

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.590
than we are doing.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.370
The smartest, clearest
way to tell a story

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.830
isn't always the way we would
have told it a generation ago.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.010
It's especially
important for journalism

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:28.960
to listen to this message and
to others, to be self critical,

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.840
and to be open to change,
because we really are

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.840
dealing with some challenges.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.240
As I mentioned at the beginning,
our old business model

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.250
has disappeared, and we don't
know exactly what the new one

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.170
looks like.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.860
On the one hand, I believe there
is a large market of people

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.750
who are willing to pay
for good information

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:53.160
about the world directly through
subscriptions or indirectly

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.830
through advertising,
but the fact

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.170
is that the best
journalism has depended

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:02.600
on cross subsidies for
decades, if not centuries.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.010
In the second half
of the 20th century,

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.740
those cross subsidies
came thanks to local quasi

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.160
monopolies-- newspapers--
that could use the revenue

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.770
from retail, and help
wanted, and other advertising

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.860
to provide a public good--
information about society

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:24.110
that educated readers and that
was often expensive to compile.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.940
It's not like that
information was

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.860
an entirely self
sustaining business

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.250
before the internet came along.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.530
It was partially
self sustaining,

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.070
and it can continue to
be at least partially

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.710
self sustaining.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.390
The main business
task facing journalism

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.000
is to think about what new
services and new revenue

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.400
might replace those
old cross subsidies.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.960
The main journalistic task is
to think openly and creatively

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.040
about the new tools that we
have to use them to give readers

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.800
the clearest, most
accurate, most

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.670
meaningful picture of reality.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.140
That's what journalism is.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.650
It's all that it
has ever been in,

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:10.220
and it's what it will continue
to be, regardless of the form

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.680
in which it is delivered.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.920
Thank you for having me and
thank you for listening.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.678
I look forward to
your questions.

00:22:16.678 --> 00:22:20.219
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:21.510
SIMON ROGERS: Thank you, David.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.390
That was terrific.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.780
I'm interested as a fellow
refugee from newspaper days--

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.780
you grew up as a reporter
working on media,

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.120
on newspapers, that
whole background.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.707
There's deadlines
and everything.

00:22:34.707 --> 00:22:36.540
And now you're at this
area, which is really

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.875
the cutting edge of the
most innovative end of what

00:22:38.875 --> 00:22:41.210
is going across journalism.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:44.440
What do you gain from those
days that you use every day now?

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.725
There are skills that you
learned in the land of print,

00:22:48.725 --> 00:22:51.570
but that you use every day now.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.700
DAVID LEONHARDT: I
think there's a culture

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.550
in traditional journalism
that is extremely

00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:02.560
valuable-- a culture of
skepticism that I actually

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.790
think sometimes goes too far.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:09.050
I do think the bar for positive
stories is too high sometimes.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.240
But a culture of
skepticism, a culture of we

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.500
exist to give you what is the
most important information,

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.370
even if it isn't
always the thing

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.470
that readers want to hear.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.690
We're going to have reporters
in Afghanistan, regardless

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.620
of the immediate
readership for that.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.890
That, I think, is very useful,
because I think otherwise

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.730
some of the new
tools and new metrics

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:34.250
we have could cause us
to quickly just write

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:38.530
about the diet
stories, the exercise

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.840
stories, the things like that.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.322
SIMON ROGERS: And what's
been the most difficult part

00:23:43.322 --> 00:23:45.720
of this transition
to "The Upshot?"

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.240
What's the weirdest thing that
you do that you would never

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.165
have done before?

00:23:50.165 --> 00:23:52.290
DAVID LEONHARDT: I think
the most traditional thing

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.350
is the frustration
that I have with myself

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:59.690
because I can't use these
new tools personally.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.940
I can write those
long blocks of text.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.930
I can edit those long blocks
of text, and I can be, I hope,

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:07.760
a useful partner
to my colleagues

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.970
who can make the
maps and who can

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.657
make the interactive
calculators,

00:24:11.657 --> 00:24:13.740
and I can help them think
about how to present it,

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.130
and I can be that
first reader, but I

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.960
can't get into the workings
of those calculators

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.940
the same way I can get into
the workings of a sentence.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.130
And I've struggled
a little bit with,

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.100
should I do the equivalent
of going back to school?

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.780
Should I go spend
a month, two weeks,

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.890
six months learning
some of those skills?

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.592
The thing that's hard is I still
won't be very good at them,

00:24:37.592 --> 00:24:39.800
but I think I've landed on
the answer to that is yes.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.300
I should learn some
of the basic tools,

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.190
because in the
course of doing so,

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:47.580
I will probably gain more
insight into the challenges

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.700
that they face.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.150
SIMON ROGERS:
That's interesting,

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.370
because there's been
a lot debate this week

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.830
about the value of having
coders working in the news

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.360
room working next to reporters.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.901
You're in an
environment where you're

00:24:55.901 --> 00:24:59.200
working very closely with people
who can build things and create

00:24:59.200 --> 00:24:59.954
interactives.

00:24:59.954 --> 00:25:01.370
What would you say
in that debate?

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.630
Do you stand on the
side of bringing people

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:04.550
closer together?

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.341
DAVID LEONHARDT: Yeah,
strongly on the side

00:25:06.341 --> 00:25:08.930
of having coders as part
of the entire operation.

00:25:12.187 --> 00:25:13.770
Traditional journalistic
organizations

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.000
have the wrong mix
of talent, which

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.040
isn't to say those of us
who have the old skills have

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.530
useless skills, but
we have the wrong mix.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:25.070
We have too many people whose
skills are like my skills,

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.530
and we have not enough
people whose skills

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.554
are a growing part of what
the "New York Times" does.

00:25:30.554 --> 00:25:31.720
We're trying to change that.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.934
We are changing
that, but I think

00:25:33.934 --> 00:25:36.100
it's almost certainly the
case that we should change

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.269
more rapidly than we are.

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:38.810
SIMON ROGERS: So
when you're thinking

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.330
about what you're going to
run, what kind of audience

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:42.163
do you have in mind?

00:25:42.163 --> 00:25:43.570
Who is "The Upshot" for?

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.350
DAVID LEONHARDT:
Smart non-experts.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.870
That, to me, is always
the audience we want.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:52.230
We want to be writing about
education reform for nurses

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.490
and health care
reform for teachers.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.970
We want to write about
Dodd-Frank for engineers,

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:01.300
and we want to write about,
depending on what kind

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.690
of engineering you're talking
about, bridge structure

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.160
for Wall Street traders.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.474
That is really what we want.

00:26:06.474 --> 00:26:08.890
SIMON ROGERS: And in practice,
does it work out like that,

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.620
or do you find that you have--
is there an over preponderance

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.344
of policy wonks or specialists?

00:26:15.344 --> 00:26:17.010
DAVID LEONHARDT: The
interesting thing--

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.400
so I'm generally skeptical
of win-win arguments.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.410
I think most things
are not win-win.

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.450
They're some
combination of win-lose,

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.160
and you've got to look
for the net positive.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.470
So feel free to take this
win-win argument with a grain

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.596
of salt if you want.

00:26:29.596 --> 00:26:31.220
The interesting thing
that I've learned

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.820
is that, when you write for
smart non-experts in a way

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:41.340
that frames the debate and you
succeed, you get the experts,

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.890
because the experts care
about how smart non-experts

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.092
are viewing their world.

00:26:48.092 --> 00:26:48.800
Think about this.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.880
If you're an economist, you care
about how members of Congress

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.637
think about the economy.

00:26:53.637 --> 00:26:56.220
If you're an economist, you care
about how the president reads

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.140
about your research if he does.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.870
And so if you manage
to succeed in writing

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:05.920
for smart non-experts, you
end up writing for the experts

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.700
as well, because they want to
be part of that conversation.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.075
SIMON ROGERS: So
one of the-- I'm

00:27:12.075 --> 00:27:13.450
going to open this
up in a second,

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:15.033
but one of the
questions I want to ask

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:18.120
was there's a kind of tradition
in data journalism of openness,

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.540
and people publishing their
work, and being transparent.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.151
How important is that, do
you think, to the field?

00:27:24.151 --> 00:27:25.900
DAVID LEONHARDT: I
think that's important.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:31.420
I think we should just be a
little bit careful that-- I

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.470
think it would not be
a good use of our time

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:39.230
if, after every story, we
added 25% of our time to put

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.810
all of our data on GitHub.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.280
Now, to be clear, we put
a lot of stuff on GitHub,

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.970
and with our most
ambitious stuff

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:47.980
I think it's really
important that we do that.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.340
But I also think that
there is always a trade

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.740
off between going deeper
in any one subject,

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.052
and going deeper for
experts, and spending time

00:27:57.052 --> 00:27:59.260
on the next thing that is
going to reach an audience.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.840
And so on the one
hand, I'm strongly

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.660
in favor of more transparency.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.810
It's been one of the
hallmarks of "The Upshot."

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.430
We were not the first
people to publish

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.350
a model that tried to
use polls to predict

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.600
the outcomes of elections.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.529
Nate Silver was
arguably the first,

00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:20.570
although I think some
political scientists did it

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.500
for tiny audiences before that.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.550
We were the first to
have a model like that

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.610
and publish all of
our back end code.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.361
So if you want to come
in and say, whoa, I

00:28:31.361 --> 00:28:33.943
think you guys are putting way
too much weight on recent polls

00:28:33.943 --> 00:28:36.350
and not nearly enough weight
on polls from two months ago

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.530
and you're a political
scientist, you could do that.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:40.430
SIMON ROGERS: Has there
been a response to that?

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.320
Do people come and use it
and do stuff with that?

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.611
DAVID LEONHARDT: Yeah, they do.

00:28:43.611 --> 00:28:44.890
Again, relative--

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:45.440
SIMON ROGERS: How
valuable is that?

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.064
DAVID LEONHARDT:
Relative to the number

00:28:47.064 --> 00:28:49.964
of people who have visited
any one of those stories I put

00:28:49.964 --> 00:28:52.130
up there, it's a rounding
error, but it's a rounding

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:57.610
error that matters, because if
we got something wrong or maybe

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.540
better, if there was an idea to
pursue that we didn't realize,

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.930
people can go in
and say, hey, do

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.930
you realize there's this
other idea to pursue there.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.290
And so it does matter.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:13.582
It's part of this more
liquid market for truth.

00:29:13.582 --> 00:29:16.170
SIMON ROGERS: Of course I'll
love to open it up to the room

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.390
now, because we don't
have an awful lot of time.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.540
Who would like to go first?

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.576
What kind of
questions do we have?

00:29:22.576 --> 00:29:23.970
AUDIENCE: There's a microphone.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:24.670
SIMON ROGERS: There's a
microphone at the back.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.336
I should point out
there is a microphone

00:29:26.336 --> 00:29:29.307
at the back on the
right hand side.

00:29:29.307 --> 00:29:30.140
My right, your left.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.015
AUDIENCE: Hey, David.

00:29:31.015 --> 00:29:32.610
Thanks for coming today.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:35.930
I'm curious as you set
aside your editorial plans

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.140
to tell stories with
data, do you more often

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.975
start with a data set
you've come across

00:29:39.975 --> 00:29:42.058
and try to figure out what
the story is, or do you

00:29:42.058 --> 00:29:44.920
guys, as an editorial team,
think of what kind of story

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.461
do you want to tell, and then
go out and get the data to help

00:29:47.461 --> 00:29:48.380
you tell that story?

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.880
DAVID LEONHARDT: I think there
are three main ways we do it,

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.170
and it's both of those
two, and then it's a third.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:56.460
So sometimes we start
with a question.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.380
One of our two launch
stories was a story

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.860
that compared the incomes of
the middle class in the United

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.580
States with the incomes-- the
median income in the United

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.900
States and incomes of the
10th, 20th, 40th, 80th, 90th

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.810
percentiles in the United
States with the trends

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:16.000
in about a dozen other
mostly wealthy countries.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.560
And that started because I
felt like, why haven't I ever

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.540
read that piece?

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.910
That piece should
be doable, and yet I

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.500
had never read that piece.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.550
Instead it was all
about per capita GDP,

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.202
which is average
instead of median,

00:30:30.202 --> 00:30:31.660
and which has the
big problem that,

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.810
in a time of high and
rising inequality,

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:37.450
is arguably less indicative
of what the typical family is

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:37.950
doing.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:39.820
So in that case, we
just had the sense

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.660
that data must be out there.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:45.140
Let's just keep shaking trees
until-- and unless we find it

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.040
in a way that we're comfortable
with, and we found it.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.130
Some other times we come across
a data set that just really

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.340
seems wonderful.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.800
Some of that is conversations
we've had with you all here.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.790
And then the third thing is we
have academics who come to us

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:02.300
and who say, I've
got this work coming.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.690
It's not released yet,
but I'm happy to give you

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:09.440
an advanced copy of it so that
your data visualization folks

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.070
can work on it in advance.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.420
So really it depends
on all of it.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.900
Our goal is never to do things
for the sake of doing it.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.620
We are not trying to be a
full service publication.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.191
We're not trying to become
a replacement news source.

00:31:22.191 --> 00:31:23.690
We are part of the
"New York Times,"

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.777
and we are very happy about that
and feel very good about that.

00:31:26.777 --> 00:31:28.860
And if the "Times" is
already covering it in a way

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.000
and we feel like we don't
have anything to add,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.370
we're not going to do it
just because we can do it

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:36.060
in a more data-ey way.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.640
SIMON ROGERS: Could "The Upshot"
survive outside the "Times"

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.844
as its own thing?

00:31:40.844 --> 00:31:42.510
DAVID LEONHARDT:
That's a good question.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.884
I'm probably the last person
who should try to answer it,

00:31:44.884 --> 00:31:46.580
but I here's how
I would answer it.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.420
We would do many things
extremely differently

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.710
if we were trying to
survive outside the "Times."

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:55.380
What we try to do is we try to--

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.767
SIMON ROGERS: You mean
you'd be chasing traffic?

00:31:58.767 --> 00:32:00.350
DAVID LEONHARDT:
We'd probably do more

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.231
to chase traffic, which there's
a positive side of chasing

00:32:03.231 --> 00:32:03.730
traffic.

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:05.970
We would try to do more
writing about the things that

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.089
are already on reader's minds.

00:32:08.089 --> 00:32:09.880
We would probably do
more to chase traffic.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.870
We really would say, hey,
we need to have something

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.280
to say about this.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.090
We cannot credibly be a
serious news organization if we

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.800
don't have something to say
about the debate over trade

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.622
in Congress.

00:32:24.622 --> 00:32:26.080
Now, we actually
did have something

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.780
to say about the debate over
trade, but we didn't have to.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.370
I also think that we just--
this is a management thing.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.000
It may not be of
the most interest,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.210
but we try to send a message
to people inside the "Times"

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.580
and even to outside
contributors, hey,

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.240
you don't need to work for us.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.620
You don't need to be a
member of "The Upshot" staff

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.370
to work with us.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:50.250
And so some of our
best work is done

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.360
by "New York Times" employees
who are not technically

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.680
members of "The Upshot."

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.480
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about the design process.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.749
So you're a writer.

00:33:01.749 --> 00:33:02.790
You've got writing staff.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.680
You've got data vis guys
that can do anything.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.870
They can do multi-dimensional
hyper spaces

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.320
with interactive
whatevers, right?

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.050
How do you design and
how do you think--

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.120
can you walk us through
the process of choosing

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.770
what to put into the data vis
and what interactions to do,

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.340
and how you target that for
your audience or your perceived

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.990
audience, because there's a
ton of stuff you could do,

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.297
but you choose not to.

00:33:24.297 --> 00:33:26.130
Can you walk us through
that design process?

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.460
DAVID LEONHARDT: Yeah.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:34.700
So we really try to
be form agnostic,

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.010
and this may say more
about our own need

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:41.130
to break some past habits
than anything else,

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.810
but really the habit at
newspapers and magazines

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.940
is everything is
about the article.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:53.420
And everything but the article
exists to support the article,

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.680
and we've really, really
tried to break that.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.740
And so what we
instead try to say

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.920
is, what is the best
way to tell this story?

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.160
And sometimes we
say, you know what?

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.389
This, if done right, could
be a front page story,

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.600
and having a front page
story in the "New York Times"

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.630
continues to have
a ton of value,

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:15.120
and so we're going to do it
in that traditional way that

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.330
will allow us to a
front page story,

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.500
but that means we need to have
certain things in the headline,

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.670
and we need to have
certain things in the lead,

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.580
and there's certain
things we need

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.163
to do in order to get that story
on the front page of the "New

00:34:26.163 --> 00:34:29.480
York Times" and have all the
benefits that come with that.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:34.290
So in addition, we're going
to create a second URL.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:37.600
The thing I showed you
that the geolocating where

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.020
it guessed what county you were
in, that's an example of that.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.190
We had a front page story, and
then we said, you know what?

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:47.280
We think we can write a
headline and have a graphic that

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.760
is substantially more
appealing to a digital audience

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.139
than we will need to do to
do the front page story,

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:55.070
and we're not going to
try to combine the two.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.090
We're just going to
separate this thing off,

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:58.970
and we're totally
comfortable with that.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.670
That thing that you
saw there I think

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:06.620
got 8x the traffic of the
traditional article, which

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.150
is really good for
us to remember,

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:11.150
because internally the
traditional article is still

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.720
the more important thing.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.170
In any real sense
of the word, that

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:19.590
was the more important, more
influential form of journalism,

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:24.480
and that continues to require
some cultural adjustment

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:24.990
for us.

00:35:27.484 --> 00:35:28.650
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:30.350
For those of us working
with data a lot,

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.550
we all know how noisy, how
much selection bias there is,

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.895
and how easy it is to
make the wrong sort

00:35:36.895 --> 00:35:38.410
of [? cost all ?] conclusion.

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:41.910
So how do you guys make
sure you gatekeep yourself

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.022
and not mislead the public?

00:35:44.022 --> 00:35:45.980
DAVID LEONHARDT: That's
a really good question,

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.345
and it's a really important one.

00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:49.470
First of all, I think it's
important to acknowledge

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:50.594
I'm sure we're not perfect.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.060
It's part of the
reason why I like

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.920
what I described as this
newly liquid market for truth,

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.290
because I'm more confident
that, when we mess up,

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.520
we'll hear about the
fact that we messed up.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.674
We also try to have a somewhat
different process than has

00:36:09.674 --> 00:36:10.840
traditionally been the case.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.070
So traditionally you
would have a reporter

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:18.587
write a story, an editor who
is expert with language--

00:36:18.587 --> 00:36:20.920
actually, several editors who
are expert with language--

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:25.980
edit that story, but you would
not ever have a data editor.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.990
And we don't have anything
formal that is a data editor,

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:31.640
but we're trying to
do that informally.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.340
So we have two
people on our staff

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.090
who are legitimate
statisticians, who have

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:36.870
graduate degrees in statistics.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:39.130
We have several
others of us who work

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.650
sort of amateur
statisticians, and what

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:45.240
we try to do is make sure that,
even when we're not publishing

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.800
the entire thing
on the internet,

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.320
we send around the spreadsheet
and we basically say to people,

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.989
hey, will you please kick the
tires on this spreadsheet.

00:36:52.989 --> 00:36:54.530
Not just kick the
tires on whether we

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:57.940
used an active or passive
verb, but kick the tires

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.840
on whether the calculations we
did, the assumptions we made,

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.880
the conclusions we
came to were right,

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.580
and we try to hash out
a lot of that in slack,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.484
and in conversations,
and in other places.

00:37:08.484 --> 00:37:09.900
AUDIENCE: Has it
ever happened you

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:16.024
had to do some retraction, a
mistake you made in the past?

00:37:16.024 --> 00:37:17.690
DAVID LEONHARDT:
What's the biggest data

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:19.580
mistake that we have made?

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.705
SIMON ROGERS: Should point
out that it's inevitable

00:37:21.705 --> 00:37:23.180
that mistakes are
going to happen.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.763
DAVID LEONHARDT: No,
it definitely is.

00:37:24.763 --> 00:37:28.300
That's why I don't want
to duck the question.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:32.170
So this isn't the most important
piece of journalism we've done,

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:33.660
but it got a lot of traffic.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:39.890
We did a bunch of fan maps
using Facebook data for baseball

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:44.870
and basketball, and for
baseball, based on Facebook

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:47.260
likes where fans were-- and
for baseball and basketball,

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:51.510
we had the advantage that those
are really one-- MLB and NBA,

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.730
those are single companies.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.010
They're not 30
competing companies,

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.720
whatever the lawyers for
major league baseball and NBA

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.590
may claim otherwise.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:00.790
Those are single companies.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.400
And so there's a certain
uniformity to the data.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.200
We then turned to do it
for college football,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.720
and college football
programs do not

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.170
have the same uniformity of
data, and so as a result,

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:14.630
I think there was a little
bit more variation than we

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.320
initially understood,
and we would

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.880
have included more
caveats when we

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.840
published it had we thought
about all of that in advance.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.480
So these exams may be wrong.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.170
In fact, I'll use fake schools
so I don't get it wrong.

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.945
State University doesn't
have a separate Facebook

00:38:28.945 --> 00:38:30.070
page for its football team.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.920
It just has an athletics page.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.400
University of State does
have a dedicated Facebook

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.120
page for its football team.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.230
That will probably influence
how many likes the two get,

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.126
and as a result, will
influence the map,

00:38:43.126 --> 00:38:45.000
and we could have done
a better job of making

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.072
that clearer than we did.

00:38:47.072 --> 00:38:47.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.240
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about the quality

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.435
of data presentation at
the "New York Times."

00:38:56.435 --> 00:38:58.310
It seems that the "New
York Times" has always

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:03.220
maintained the highest
standard in the industry about,

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.450
not only just the data, also
the presentation of the data.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.960
It's always consistent and
designed in a beautiful way.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.810
I think that's an
area that Google

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:14.610
has [? personal appeal ?],
somewhat struggle about.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.980
And so how do you enforce that?

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.940
Is there a committee,
or is it built

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.670
into the collective
consciousness,

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:26.610
or is there-- you are
enforce a set of tools.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.740
Or how did you achieve that?

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.430
DAVID LEONHARDT: Thank
you, first of all.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:36.270
There is an enormously
talented graphics department

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:39.300
that has become increasingly
important over time.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.940
It's run by someone named
Steve Duenes, who really is one

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.470
the most important
people at the newspaper.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:52.240
And it is a department that
has a really strong culture

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.870
of excellence.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.300
So if you notice when
the "Times" has something

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:01.530
successful like the
dialect quiz, which

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.200
is the most viewed page in
the history of the "New York

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.530
Times," we don't then
immediately go and do

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:12.920
five other versions of it.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.800
You haven't seen seven other
quizzes about different forms

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.520
of language for the "Times."

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.230
Now, that has some downsides
if we're being honest about it.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:24.330
That is not a traffic
maximizing decision,

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:28.300
but I think there is this real
culture on the graphic staff

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.440
that what they want to be
doing is they consistently

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.670
want to be pushing
the envelope and doing

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:36.560
new things and excellent
things, and they never

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.790
want to get bored.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.320
They always want to be learning.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.510
It is the most collaborative
department at the paper.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:47.470
It's why you often see five and
six by lines on these things.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.050
It's a department
that really has,

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:54.250
I think, a lot of the best
forms of team culture.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:58.590
And I think that department,
which really started

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:02.197
in many ways as a backwater--
the graphics apartment was not

00:41:02.197 --> 00:41:04.446
one of the most important
departments in the "New York

00:41:04.446 --> 00:41:07.896
Times" 20 years ago-- is
really responsible for that.

00:41:07.896 --> 00:41:09.520
And what we're now
trying to figure out

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.760
as an organization-- and
"The Upshot" in some ways

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.220
is an experiment to think
about, because we work very

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.840
closely with that
department-- is

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.550
how do we take more of
that digital sensibility

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.410
that they have and spread
it around the whole paper.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:23.835
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:23.835 --> 00:41:25.960
SIMON ROGERS: I love
the idea of a committee

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.470
to decide on visuals.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:29.540
That would be great.

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:31.770
AUDIENCE: Kind of a follow
up about presentation.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:35.186
So you can kind of infamously
misinform people with graphics.

00:41:35.186 --> 00:41:36.060
DAVID LEONHARDT: Yes.

00:41:37.704 --> 00:41:40.120
AUDIENCE: Personally I think
that the "New York Times" has

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.786
always done a really
good job with this,

00:41:41.786 --> 00:41:44.050
but I'm wondering if you
guys do any work to validate

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:45.430
that that's true.

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.490
So for example,
I loved the piece

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:51.830
you showed where I was asked to
draw the line of what I thought

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:54.150
the relationship between
income and college attendance

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:57.540
was, because it sort of forced
me to validate my assumptions,

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:02.296
but when you design
an interactive map,

00:42:02.296 --> 00:42:04.420
do you guys do anything to
validate your assumption

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.620
that readers actually
are understanding this,

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.400
or they are able to
draw meaning from it,

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:13.190
or maybe they're being
perhaps misinformed,

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:18.492
or drawing conclusions that
aren't supported by the data?

00:42:18.492 --> 00:42:20.950
DAVID LEONHARDT: Can I answer
the question with a question?

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:24.230
What's a hypothetical way
that we could validate that?

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:28.680
AUDIENCE: That's actually
why I'm asking you.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:33.750
I was kind of hoping you guys
knew more about this than me,

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.940
but I could imagine,
for example,

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.650
doing survey research
following up.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:42.550
If there is something
that was factually true

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:46.520
and you try to present it
graphically, after the fact,

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.520
were people able to
accurately answer

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.400
a question about that factual?

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.150
DAVID LEONHARDT: That's
a really fun idea.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.790
No, we haven't obviously.

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.860
So this you draw it is in
some ways an early attempt

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.710
to try to do that.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:00.510
We should try that.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.566
We should think about giving
people-- it would be tricky.

00:43:03.566 --> 00:43:05.440
I'm sure some readers
would have no interest.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.640
Others would feel that
we were taking them back

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.720
to grade school, but
my guess is some,

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.470
if we did it in a
sufficiently fun way

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:15.500
and made it feel like a game,
would be willing to do it.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.260
And it would be interesting
to see whether, in fact, we

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.070
got it right.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:24.000
I do think that social
media and the emails we

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.310
receive from readers provides
an informal version of that.

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.190
I do think we've
all noticed times

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.830
where we see a reaction
to an article and think,

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:35.130
that's not what I meant.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:37.590
But I think would be good
to make it more rigorous

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:39.247
and fun as well, so thank you.

00:43:39.247 --> 00:43:40.080
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.579
DAVID LEONHARDT:
The only postscript

00:43:41.579 --> 00:43:43.810
I'd add to that is I agree
charts can really mislead

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:48.600
people-- so can
quotations, so can

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.050
some of the traditional
forms of journalism.

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.070
And my guess is everyone in
this room agrees with that.

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:56.240
It's sometimes
something that I want

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.810
to remind some of my colleagues
as traditional journalists--

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.940
that it's not like, oh
yes, you can lie with data,

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.770
but you can't lie with
five person on the street

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:07.170
interviews.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:08.680
AUDIENCE: I think
a classic example

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:12.560
of that is the Iraq
WMD thing, where,

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.280
despite a lot of reporting,
very little of it graphical,

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.220
the American public
overwhelmingly

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:21.210
believed that Iraq was
involved in 9/11, despite tons

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:23.420
of reporting by the "Times"
and other places that

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.042
made no connection whatsoever.

00:44:25.042 --> 00:44:26.000
DAVID LEONHARDT: Right.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:26.560
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.685
DAVID LEONHARDT: Thank you.

00:44:27.685 --> 00:44:30.040
SIMON ROGERS: Cool.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:30.807
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:30.807 --> 00:44:31.640
DAVID LEONHARDT: Hi.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.264
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
earlier that it

00:44:33.264 --> 00:44:38.280
was important for journalists
to learn more technical skills,

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.350
and I was wondering, in
your news organization,

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:48.510
do you find that people in other
departments have the same need

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.290
or could build more
technical skills?

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:56.150
For example, business
strategists, or people who

00:44:56.150 --> 00:45:01.700
just need to understand the
new digital ecosystem in news.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.120
Do you find that that is
lacking in your organization,

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:11.280
or do you feel people are very
well prepared for the changes?

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:11.885
Thanks.

00:45:11.885 --> 00:45:13.010
DAVID LEONHARDT: Thank you.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.760
Most journalistic organizations
have this church state wall

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.880
between business
and the newsroom,

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.820
and so I actually spend
relatively little time

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.300
interacting with folks
on the business side.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.260
There are ways in
which we've decided

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.550
we're comfortable
with some new mingling

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:31.110
that we weren't
comfortable with before.

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:34.140
We don't want the person who's
trying to sell advertisements

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.920
to a car company ever talking
with our reporter who covers

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.030
the car industry, but
the "Times'" revenue

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:44.917
has become increasingly from
readers and decreasingly

00:45:44.917 --> 00:45:47.250
from advertisers, which of
course, is both the good news

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.220
and bad news story.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.699
Our revenue from readers is up.

00:45:49.699 --> 00:45:51.240
Our revenue from
advertisers is down.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:56.400
I do think we want the person
who's writing about the auto

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.490
industry interacting with
the readers who are reading

00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:59.870
about the auto
industry, and that

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:02.450
has led to a little
bit more collaboration.

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:04.540
I think the short answer
to your question is yes.

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:10.330
I think that journalism
has traditionally

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:15.800
had relatively little
investment in technical skills,

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.630
in data skills, and I think
there is now a real realization

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.490
that we need to change that.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:25.900
Some of that is because I think
the returns to specialization

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:27.710
in journalism have really risen.

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:29.970
I bet you notice this at
the "Guardian" as well.

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:33.420
Generalists used to be really
what was valued in journalism.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.870
You'd drop someone in a place.

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:37.220
They have the ability to
go describe what happened,

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.330
and summarize it in
a thousand words,

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:42.320
and come tell you what you need
to know at the end of the day.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.689
That is much more
commoditized than it used

00:46:44.689 --> 00:46:45.980
to be-- what actually happened.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:49.240
And so there are many
more returns to specialty

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.540
than there used to be there.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:51.350
It's much better.

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.480
As a reader, what I
want is a journalist

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:56.170
who knows something about
a subject that I don't know

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.500
and can teach me
about it, and I think

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.060
this increased investment
in technical skills

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.730
is part and parcel
of the way in which

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:07.470
the returns to specialization
have increased.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:08.955
SIMON ROGERS: How
long do you think

00:47:08.955 --> 00:47:12.549
before data is not considered
a specialism in the newsroom?

00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:14.340
We talked about this
earlier, the idea that

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.386
actually in the
future everybody will

00:47:15.386 --> 00:47:16.540
be a [INAUDIBLE]
journalist, but you

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.664
wouldn't say an internet
journalist now, would you?

00:47:18.664 --> 00:47:20.550
Every reporter does
their research online?

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.930
DAVID LEONHARDT: No, and
we're trying to get there.

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:22.550
I apologize.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.230
I showed you all of
these in desktop.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.670
We, now, often when
we're working these,

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:29.470
work in the mobile
view, because that's

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.928
how slightly more than half
the people are going to see it,

00:47:31.928 --> 00:47:35.620
and so we no longer talk
about mobile journalism.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:40.910
I think that we will get
there with data journalism,

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:43.650
and I think we
are not there yet.

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:45.150
In a way, I'm just
quoting something

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:46.760
you said to me
earlier back to you,

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.590
but I think if you took the
best data journalists now

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:52.900
and plopped them in a
traditional newsroom,

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:55.287
you'd have all
kinds of problems.

00:47:55.287 --> 00:47:56.870
SIMON ROGERS: It
would be a nightmare.

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:57.280
DAVID LEONHARDT: It
would be a nightmare.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.540
SIMON ROGERS: All of
those egos together.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.350
DAVID LEONHARDT: It
would be a nightmare.

00:47:59.350 --> 00:47:59.850
SIMON ROGERS: Horrific.

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.850
DAVID LEONHARDT: I also
think that we're really

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:03.120
making progress.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:08.090
When I see Nate Cohn, my
colleague on the upshot, who

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.080
is, I think, one of
the most interesting

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.770
political journalists alive,
talking to Jonathan Martin,

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:15.290
the national political
correspondent

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:16.420
for the "Times,"
who I think is one

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.878
of the most
interesting journalists

00:48:17.878 --> 00:48:21.190
alive-- their skills have very
little overlap in the Venn

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:23.830
diagram, but they realize they
each have something to learn

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:25.830
from each other,
and I'm not sure

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.660
that would have been the
case even a few years ago.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.930
SIMON ROGERS: I think
we can take probably

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:32.794
two more questions.

00:48:32.794 --> 00:48:34.710
AUDIENCE: Hi David,
thanks so much for coming.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:36.880
Let me lower this real quick.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.370
I wanted to follow up on your
point on local news coverage,

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:46.210
and I echo the concern-- the
decline of local news coverage

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:49.750
in this state of media, but
watching your presentation

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:52.180
it really struck me
that "The Upshot"

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.250
is doing local journalism,
that you're drilling down

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.890
to the county level.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:00.200
And so where do you see
these local newspapers

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.465
who are struggling
not only with funding,

00:49:02.465 --> 00:49:04.840
but with the lack of tools to
be able to create something

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.640
like this.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.450
How do they continue to
do local data journalism?

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:13.110
Or do you start seeing the
"New York Times" and all

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.130
of the other publications
that you mentioned

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:18.900
who are doing data journalism
well who are actually

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:22.860
national organizations starting
to take on that role of doing

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.230
good local journalism?

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:25.020
DAVID LEONHARDT: I hadn't
thought about that,

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:25.500
but you're right.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.958
There is a way in which we are
doing some local journalism.

00:49:27.958 --> 00:49:30.920
I don't think it can replace
truly local journalism.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.080
I think truly local
journalism requires

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.900
a kind of expertise
and specialization

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.419
that we will never
have about-- you

00:49:36.419 --> 00:49:37.960
saw I didn't even
know what county we

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.876
were standing in here.

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:46.290
Here's a theory I have, which
could be completely wrong.

00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:50.740
I think that there
is an untapped market

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:56.280
for really useful,
quite local information

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.960
out there that eventually
someone is going to figure out.

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.760
I don't think-- I think the
mistake that journalists have

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.400
made so far is they
think it looks more

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.820
like the local journalism of
old than it actually does,

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:09.770
but I think about myself.

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:12.750
I would gladly pay
some amount of money

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:15.510
that is kind of
significant-- $20 a month,

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:21.080
$30 a month-- for something
that was super local, and smart,

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.290
and maybe even a highly
data based about where

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:24.934
I live in suburban Maryland.

00:50:24.934 --> 00:50:26.600
Something that
essentially every morning

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.110
delivered me information about
the metro system in Washington.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.090
I'm a big public transit user.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:35.680
But also about roads, something
that really got into stuff

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.280
about schools,
and any data there

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.300
is about schools,
which there's a lot of.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:43.110
Stuff that was able to do
much more on youth sports.

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:44.830
There's actually a
lot of information

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:47.740
that I want that,
yes, some of it

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:51.150
you get through things like
Waze and other things like that,

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:53.150
but much of it looks
more journalistic.

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.560
And I think there is a market
for that that, if someone

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.260
figures out, would
have the potential

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.170
to then pay for even
four reporters--

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:05.560
we reporters aren't that
expensive-- even four reporters

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.990
to cover, say,
Bethesda, Maryland.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:09.515
And I have some
hope-- it probably

00:51:09.515 --> 00:51:11.390
won't look exactly the
way I've described it.

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:14.570
It probably requires a little
bit more entrepreneurial rigor

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:16.270
than I'm able to
bring to it, but I

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:19.440
do think there is this gap
between the hyper local

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.680
information that people
would actually pay for

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.260
and what local journalism
is now trying to provide,

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.500
and I'm hopeful that
someone figures that out

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.440
in a way that strengthens
local journalism.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.530
SIMON ROGERS: So this is
kind of related to that.

00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:36.250
So 2012 is possibly the first
data journalism election, what

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:38.440
does 2016 hold in this field?

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.810
What are we going
to see not just

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:45.153
from what you're going to
offer, but across the field?

00:51:49.357 --> 00:51:50.940
DAVID LEONHARDT:
Through much of this,

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.104
I've been wishing that
my colleagues Amanda Cox

00:51:53.104 --> 00:51:54.520
and Kevin Quealy,
who I mentioned,

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.580
were sitting here to answer
these questions, because they'd

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.440
be really good at it.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.898
This is a question which I wish
Nate Cohn, who I mentioned,

00:51:59.898 --> 00:52:00.930
was here.

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:03.790
So I'm copying from
my colleague here.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:05.730
Let me acknowledge that.

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:10.830
I think the fact
that 2008 and 2012

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:14.060
were relatively
predictable elections

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:18.070
have led to an over confidence
about how much we actually

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:20.550
know about the 2016 election.

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:22.530
The last three
elections-- we had

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:25.790
two with incumbent presidents,
which from a data standpoint

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:29.800
are just vastly easier to
model and to think about,

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.400
and we had one
that wasn't close.

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.760
We had the most unpopular
president in many of our life

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.290
times-- those of us who
weren't old enough to remember

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:43.810
Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter.

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:45.990
And so it clearly just
wasn't going to be close.

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:49.100
You had a tanking economy
and an unpopular war,

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.170
and there was no
model that was going

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:53.100
to say that John McCain
was going to win.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:55.200
Then 2012, all the
models again pointed

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.800
to Obama, an incumbent president
running for reelection.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.850
2016 is going to be different.

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:02.380
There is huge uncertainty
about what the economy is

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:03.880
going to be doing.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.380
It's probably going to
be sort of grinding along

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.340
in a way that doesn't point
toward defeat or victory

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:13.560
for the incumbent
party, and we are not

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.810
going to have an incumbent
president on the ballot.

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:20.150
And as a result of that,
and when you overlay that

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:23.430
with stuff that I've talked
with Hal about in great depth,

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:26.400
the real challenges
facing polling--

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.200
the change in polling-- I
think it's really possible

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.120
that, unlike the
last few elections,

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.250
we're going to have an
election in which, three

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:39.300
weeks out, there's still
substantial uncertainty

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.410
about the outcome.

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.660
And even if we
don't have that, I

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:47.380
think we will have much more
uncertainty three months,

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:51.950
six months, nine months out
than I think many people today

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:52.730
realize.

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:55.230
SIMON ROGERS: So I'm sure we'll
be working on that together,

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:57.100
and we've had some
partnerships in the past,

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.400
but what do you
want from Google?

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.730
What can we do to make
your world easier?

00:54:03.627 --> 00:54:05.460
DAVID LEONHARDT: So I
mentioned the polling,

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:06.590
the changes in polling.

00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:09.380
Basically the polling
industry, which

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:11.600
has this phenomenal
record of success

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.360
over its modern
history dependent

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:18.410
on a landline telephone--
there's a small problem there.

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:20.910
And we also have this problem
that a lot of government data

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:22.950
relies on surveys,
and people, not just

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:25.239
because decline of
the landline, people

00:54:25.239 --> 00:54:27.780
are just less willing to answer
surveys than they used to be.

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.530
There's also a desire
among some in Washington

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:32.280
to cut the funding for
government surveys.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:36.530
And so there are all of these
forms of traditional data

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:39.450
that are becoming less good.

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:43.359
And while I am optimistic
about the potential for data

00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:44.900
to become better
and while I actually

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.692
think it is becoming
better, I also

00:54:46.692 --> 00:54:49.150
think it's worth acknowledging
that a lot of that data that

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:51.740
lets us understand the world,
that helps people lead better

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:54.240
lives is now in private hands.

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.080
It's in your hands.

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.340
It's in Facebook's hands.

00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:58.800
It's in other hands.

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.860
And so I understand you
all are a private company.

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:07.230
I understand your obligation
is to your shareholders,

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:10.660
but I do think there is a public
obligation and a public trust

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.140
that companies like Google--
and Google in particular--

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.690
have to think about
ways to make sure

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:17.430
that we're able to
use all of the data

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:19.760
that you're collecting
to make us smarter

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.810
about the world where we live
and ultimately really allow

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:24.914
that world to be a better place.

00:55:24.914 --> 00:55:26.330
SIMON ROGERS: Thank
you very much.

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:28.038
DAVID LEONHARDT: Thank
you for having me.

00:55:28.038 --> 00:55:28.550
