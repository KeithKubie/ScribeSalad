00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Hey, what's up guys today? I'm hanging out with John from Boardshorts TV

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.080
He's got something that I wanted for years, but never got and that's a silver play button check it out

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.799
Oh there it is

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:08.220
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.409
The idea here today is to take the silver play button

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.649
To make a mold [that] we can turn into gummy candies chocolate or basically anything that we want or buttons so as long as John

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.170
Is cool with us ripping open his award no guarantees

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.140
We'll get this thing back in one piece

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.640
[but] I've got insurance on it was cool when the bracket screws are removed

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.079
You [can] basically slide the whole top right off and if we get lucky you know nice John's button wait stop. Talk to my [father]

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.270
You know what you can do is like modify this into a belt bub wouldn't that be sweet like check out my hope that would

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.999
Actually [book] right there. Yeah, [do] check that it works. It works. That would be a cooler belt buckle. [I] forgot to mention

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.799
This is a guy that invented CVX live in Salt Lake City a really cool event and I'll probably be there next year

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.719
What John's got here is a plastic called hdpe that's high-density polyethylene stuff

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.709
I have over here is point zero to styrene this big black sheet here is

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.410
0.004 abs and abs is supposed to be really good for vacuum forming to vacuum mold this thing. I already see a problem

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.910
We've got these little nubs here

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.720
So we're gonna have to take a grinder and shave those off and then use the belt sander to get all flat

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.299
really, but I think there might be a way around then that's just by using a little bit of dollar-store Foam board and the Styro-slicer'

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.180
Maybe we can push this thing down through carve around the edge have a really clean button to use

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.170
Okay, so here's the idea guys John's just got a couple holes in this foam that should accommodate these little rivets

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.649
[they're] what's really impressive as you can see it almost lines up perfectly flush

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.690
We press this flat turn on the foam cutter, and we're going to cut a clean line all the way around this button

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.980
I'll have to do now is take a sounding sponge and kind of clean up some of these edges to get rid of that jagged

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.460
Styrofoam and the rest should be pretty easy

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.799
We're basically just going to take the frame for our vacuum former staple some plastic to it stick it in the oven

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.990
And stick it on our back end for my machine

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.560
So much sure what we're doing here. So now we got the styrofoam reinforced

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.360
I think this is ready to vacuum [form] [for] that

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.840
We're going to need a vacuum forming machine, but it doesn't have to be something complicated

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.079
It could be as simple as this one that I made five years ago, you see

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.389
I just hacked it out of scrap wood and some perfboard and [reinforced] it with duct tape to help keep it airtight

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.339
[this] was inspired by a project. I saw by [Kipkay] about five years ago. We did a video for make magazine

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.630
[I] got a big old dusty shot back that I use this thing is 16 gallons

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.150
6.25 horsepower, so it's got a lot of suck

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.890
You can see it takes a bit to get it in there

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.619
And that's not moving and that's going to suck all the air through these holes and only cares about the amount of suckage, okay?

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.980
So here's the [idea]. We got our button reinforced. It's going to go on top of the vacuum former

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.300
We're going to get a little bit of plastic

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.869
[we] [can] staple around the top put it in an oven and warm it up until it gets saggy

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.589
They're going to flip it over put it on top of the play button and turn the vacuum on

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.820
Look, it's already starting to get soft in here. You can see around all the staples

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.659
It's starting to wrinkle you ready John standing by right here. We go

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.020
Initiate suckage

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.270
Hey check that out guys stealing that John. What do you think that's beautiful take your position?

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.380
Check this out guy that suction worked out really really well it left the play button looking fantastic

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.850
[pull] this up here

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.269
You see actually the button still stuck in there

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:28.219
I'm surprised the styrofoam isn't melting with how hot that is but look how beautiful that comes out guys can initiate suckage

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.809
That thing is so durable. [that's] like what our fourth mold nicely done John boom [all]

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.750
[right] guys, we're doing it

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.279
We're going to try the hDpe it's a little bit opaque at first but once it heats up and starts drooping

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.009
It'll turn clear. This is our first round. Let's see what happens

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:59.159
[Kahlan's] I've been in the way longer than the styrene. I wonder if we should turn the temperature better to temperature Rap pizza pizza temperature

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.049
Our hDpe has not gone clear yet. That is sagging down about two inches

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.799
so I think we're just going to go ahead and throw it on the former and see how it does at this state before we

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.069
push it any Further

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.069
Initiating

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:20.399
Wow, so hdpe obviously takes a lot longer to set up it actually sucked the plastic right through the holes there

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.989
So we lost a bit [of] our suction. I thought for sure that foam would have melted. [oh], yeah look at that

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.229
It's all like wrinkly on the inside. It's a little bit flimsier

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.249
- all right let's throw a sheet of abs [as] a last experiment and Collagen

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.070
Can't imagine this stuff is Gonna work. [oh]

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.309
[droopy] Crap, okay ready

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.140
[oh], yes

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.689
Yeah, and so we're heating this up at 450 [degrees] Fahrenheit. [how] long did that take like two minutes?

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.489
[you] know I was quick. I was surprised that we got a black play button check out the other side

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.960
[oh] yeah, but this is what I love is I love the texture on the front of that button. [no], that's cool

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.170
So there you go guys that's how to use a few simple materials to vacuum cast your own candy molds at home with styrene

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.480
abs hdpe alright guys thanks so much for hanging out with us today big thanks to John for coming out here and

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.749
Sacrificing his silver play button for my cause John I promise

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.620
I will fix this for you at some point in [time]

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.770
But I'm going [to] use it to make a bunch more molds first and maybe even try casting some chocolates with it as well

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.329
They try me out [brad] has been fun. It's been a blend and he's got a channel called Boardshorts TV

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.659
It's super super awesome. Five hundred thousand [subscribers]. They basically have kids tell stories, and then they act along to the stories

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.309
Hey guys, thanks so much for joining us for this experiment. We'll be looking for your next project video. Talk to you then
