00:00:13.403 --> 00:00:15.551
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:17.277
Quarantine,

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:20.968
a state, period, or place
of strict isolation

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:23.893
meant to prevent the spread of disease.

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:25.334
In the 14th century,

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.585
the Bubonic Plague,

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.667
later called "The Black Death,"

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:29.838
spread across Europe

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:32.854
with devastating consequences.

00:00:32.878 --> 00:00:34.004
It's been estimated

00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:36.636
that the Plague decimated
at least one-third

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.312
of Europe's population.

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:41.740
In a vain effort to stave off infection,

00:00:41.764 --> 00:00:44.550
the Italian-speaking port city of Ragusa,

00:00:44.574 --> 00:00:46.506
in what is now Croatia,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.313
mandated that ships arriving

00:00:48.337 --> 00:00:50.708
from Plague-infested areas

00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:52.882
remain isolated on the water

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:54.598
until it was deemed likely

00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:57.523
that they weren't carrying a disease.

00:00:57.547 --> 00:01:00.452
This meant that the entire
contents of a ship

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:02.085
and all of its passengers

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.200
were often forced to remain on board

00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:08.128
for five or six weeks
before being let ashore.

00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:09.415
Though the drastic measure

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.882
was only marginally successful,

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:16.579
it wasn't long before other
port cities followed suit.

00:01:16.603 --> 00:01:20.345
In 1397, the official period of isolation

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.684
imposed on ships and crews

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:25.696
was set at forty days.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.890
Although it did little to protect
ports from infection,

00:01:28.914 --> 00:01:31.114
the directive stuck.

00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:33.643
From the Italian word quaranta,

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:35.190
meaning forty,

00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:38.285
this period of stasis was given the name

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:40.502
quarantine.

00:01:40.526 --> 00:01:42.382
And by the mid 1600s,

00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:44.467
the word quarantine was being used

00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:46.257
to describe any place,

00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:47.018
period,

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:48.964
or state of isolation,

00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:51.771
plague-related or not.
