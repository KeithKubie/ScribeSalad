00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.380
In our series on biology, we spent many weeks together talking about the physiology of animals and plants

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.850
and how cells work together to make tissues
to make organs to make organ systems

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.970
to make us the hunks of meat and vegetables
that we are.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.379
In understanding the whole organism, it's important to know what's going on at all those levels.

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.799
And the same is true for ecology, only instead of zooming in and out on different levels within a living thing,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.040
we can zoom in and out on the Earth.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.420
Depending on the power of the magnification, we can understand a whole range of things about our planet.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.500
For instance, we can look at groups within a species and how they live together in one geographic area --

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.460
that's population ecology.
There's also community ecology,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.700
where you look at groups of different organisms living together and figure out how they influence each other.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.230
And then the most zoomed out we get is ecosystem
ecology,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.390
the study of how all living and non-living
things interact within an entire ecosystem.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.720
So let's start by zooming in with population
ecology,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.239
the study of groups within a species that
interact mostly with each other,

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.599
to understand why these populations are different
in one time and place than they are in another.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.260
"How?" you may be asking yourself, "is that
in any way useful to anyone ever?"

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.900
Well, it's actually super useful to everybody
always.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.240
Let's look, for instance, at the outbreak of West Nile virus that struck Dallas, Texas in the summer of 2012.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.740
In Dallas County, 12 people died from the
virus as of the filming of this,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.860
and nearly 300 people have been infected.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.960
But in 2011, the whole state of Texas reported
only 27 cases of West Nile, and only two deaths.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.080
That seems kind of significant, so what's
up?

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.229
Turns out, this is a population ecology problem.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.049
West Nile is mosquito-borne illness, and the
population of mosquitoes in Dallas in 2012

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.530
busted through brick walls like the Kool-Aid
man, spreading West Nile like crazy.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.490
So why did this outbreak happen in 2012 and
not the year before?

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.810
And why did it happen in Texas and not in
New Jersey? The answer, is population ecology.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:57.430
[Theme Music]

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.840
Before we start solving any disease outbreak mysteries, we've got to understand the fundamentals of population ecology.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.880
For starters, a population is just a group of individuals of one species who interact regularly.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.340
How often organisms interact has a lot to
do with geography.;

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.120
you're going to have a lot more facetime with the folks you live near than those who live farther away.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.760
As a result, individuals who are closer to
you will be the ones that you compete with

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.329
for food and living space, mates, all that
stuff.

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.919
But in order to understand why populations
are different from time to time and place to place,

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:30.400
a population ecologist needs to know a few
things about a population, like its density.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.640
In this instance, how many mosquitoes there are in the greater Dallas area that might come into contact with each other.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.840
A population's density changes due to a number
of factors, all of which are pretty intuitive.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.380
It increases when new individuals are either
born or immigrate, that is move in,

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.889
and it decreases because of deaths or emigration,
or individuals moving out.

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.620
Simple enough, but as a population ecologist
you also need to know about the geographic

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.600
arrangement of the individuals within the
population.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.840
This is their dispersion.
Like, are the mosquitoes all clumped together?

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.379
Are they evenly spaced across the county?
Is there some kind of random spacing?

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.799
The answer to these questions gives scientists
a snapshot of a population at any given moment.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.440
And to figure out a puzzle like the West Nile
outbreak,

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.379
which involves studying how a population is
changed over time,

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.639
you have to investigate one of population
ecology's central principles, population growth.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.730
There are all kinds of factors that drive
population growth, and they can vary radically

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.449
from one organism to the next.

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.989
Things like fecundity, how many offspring
an individual can have in a lifetime,

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.559
make a huge difference in the size of a population.

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.779
So for instance, why do mosquito populations
seem to grow so quickly,

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:37.749
while the endangered black rhino may never
recover from a single act of poaching?

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:42.269
For starters, mosquitoes can have 2,000 offspring
in their two-week lifetime,

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.180
while the rhino can have, like, five in forty
years.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.040
Still, a population doesn't usually, or even ever, grow to its full potential and it can't keep growing indefinitely.

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.799
To understand how fast or slow and high or
low a population actually grows,

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.229
you need to focus on what's keeping growth
in check.

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.609
These factors are appropriately called limiting
factors.

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.109
Say you're a mosquito in Dallas in 2011, the
year before the outbreak.

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.689
Back then, the growth rate wasn't what it was in 2012, so something was keeping you down.

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.589
To figure out what your limiting factors were,
you first have to narrow down what you need

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:16.920
as a mosquito to live and reproduce successfully.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.760
First, you've got to find your food.
Now, you mosquitoes, you eat all kinds of things,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.720
but in order to reproduce, assuming you're
a female, you need a blood meal.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.760
So you have to find a vertebrate and suck
some of its blood out.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.800
Presumably there's no shortage of vertebrates walking around Dallas for you to suck blood out of;

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.460
I have good friends who are vertebrates in Dallas, you might even be able to suck some of their blood.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.520
Next, temperature, because you mosquitoes are ectothermic, it has to be warm in order for you to be active.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.110
Now Texas is pretty warm, and the winter of
2011-2012 was especially balmy.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.580
In fact, the summer of 2012 was exceptionally hot, which helps speed up the mosquito life cycle,

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.980
so that's one limiting factor that's been
removed for Dallas-area mosquitoes.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.720
Moving on to mates. If you're a female mosquito,
you need to find a nice male mosquito,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.580
with a job and preferably his own car, because
you know Dallas is a pretty big city, to mate with.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.390
This isn't actually all that hard because
of the way mosquitoes do it;

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.420
males just gather into a mosquito cloud at
dusk every night during mating season

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.420
and all the female has to do is find her local dude-cloud and fly into it in order to get mated with. Easy cheese!

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.620
Finally, space, and aha! Because here we have
another important clue.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.220
Mosquitoes need to lay their eggs in stagnant water, and if there's anything mosquito larvae hate,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.020
it's a rainstorm flushing out the little puddle
of water they've been living in.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.910
And since Dallas saw a pretty severe drought
in the summer of 2012,

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.810
there were lots of pockets of stagnant, nasty,
mosquito water sitting around,

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.550
acting as nurseries for many, many West Nile-infected
mosquitoes.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.140
So, when we look at this evidence, we find
at least two limiting factors for Dallas's

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:48.220
mosquito population growth that were removed in 2011: the constraints of temperature and space.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.780
It was plenty hot, and there were lots of egg-laying locations, so the bugs were free to go nuts.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.740
Population ecologists group limiting factors
like these into two different categories:

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.140
density-dependent and density-independent.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.120
They do it this way because we need to know
whether a population's growth rate is being

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.530
controlled by how many individuals are in it, or whether it's being controlled by something else.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.460
And the reason these limitations matter is
because they affect what's known as the carrying

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.720
capacity of the mosquitoes' habitat.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.940
That's the number of individuals that a habitat can sustain with the resources that it has available.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.300
So, density-dependent limitations are factors
that inhibit growth because of the environmental

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.670
stress caused by a population size.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.000
For example, there may simply not be enough
food, water, and space to accommodate everyone.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.430
Or maybe because there are so many individuals,
a nearby predator population explodes,

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.660
which helps keep the population in check.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.470
Things like disease can also be a density-dependent
limitation;

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.800
lots of individuals living in close quarters
can make infections spread like crazy.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.460
Now, I don't think that the Dallas mosquitoes are going to run out of vertebrates to dine on any time soon,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.740
but let's say hypothetically that the explosion
of local mosquito populations caused a similar

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.690
explosion in the number of Mexican free-tailed bats, the official flying mammal of the state of Texas.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.600
And they eat mosquitoes -- that would be a
limiting factor that was density-dependent.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.900
More mosquitoes leads to more bats, which
leads to fewer mosquitoes.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.800
It's pretty simple. When density-dependent limitations start to kick in, and start to limit the population's growth,

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.389
that means that the habitat's carrying capacity
has been reached.

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.280
But the other type of limiting factor, the
density-independent ones,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.430
have nothing to do with how many individuals
there are or how dense the population is.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.470
A lot of times these limitations are described
in terms of some catastrophe:

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.160
a volcanic eruption, a monsoon, a Chernobyl.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.920
In any case, some crucial aspect of the population's lifestyle changes enough that it makes it harder to get by.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.020
But these factors don't have to be super dramatic.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.620
Going back to mosquitoes, say in 2013 there's
a huge thunderstorm,

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.930
a real gully-washer, in Dallas every day for
three months.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.480
That's going to disturb the clutches of mosquito
eggs hanging out in the stagnant waters,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.130
so the number born that year would be substantially
smaller.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.580
By the same token, if the temperature swung
the other way, and it was unseasonably cold

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.560
all summer, the bugs' growth rate would drop.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.510
Now the truth is, there are a billion and
a half situations, both big and small,

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:59.230
that could lead to a population either reaching its carrying capacity or collapsing because of external factors.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:05.230
It's a population ecologist's job to figure out what those factors are. And that is what math is for.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.669
Our friend math says that any population of
anything -- ANYTHING --

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:12.349
will grow exponentially unless there's some
reason that it can't.

00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:17.420
Exponential growth means that the population grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.100
So here at the beginning of 2012, we might
have only had a thousand mosquitoes in Dallas,

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.490
but then, after say one month, we got 3,000.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:29.040
Now with 3x as many reproducing mosquitoes, the population grew 3x as fast as when there were 1,000,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.899
so then there are 9,000, at which point it's growing 3x as fast as when there were 3,000, and on and on into infinity.

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:40.959
And in this scenario, the mosquitoes are all "Carrying capacity my chitin-covered butt! There's no stoppin' us!"

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:44.360
But you know what doesn't really happen?
I mean, it can happen for a while --

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.080
humans have been on an exponential growth curve since the Industrial Revolution, for example.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.059
But eventually, something always knocks the
population size back down.

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:56.920
That thing might be a density-dependent factor
like food scarcity or an epidemic

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.780
or a density-independent one like an asteroid
that takes out the whole continent.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.640
Regardless, this exponential growth curve
can't go up forever.

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:08.899
And when those factors come into play, a population
experiences only logistic growth.

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:12.579
This means that the population is limited
to the carrying capacity of its habitat,

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:15.360
which, when you think about it, ain't too
much to ask.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.339
See how this graph flattens up at the top?

00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:22.100
The factor that creates that plateau is almost
always a density-dependent limitation.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.980
As you add mosquitoes, eventually the rate
of population growth is going to slow down

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.140
because they run out of food or space.
And when we get to where that number levels off,

00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:34.389
that number is the carrying capacity of the
mosquito population in that particular habitat.

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:38.580
Now, let's apply all of these ideas using
a simple equation that will allow us to calculate

00:09:38.589 --> 00:09:41.490
the population growth of anything we feel
like.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.880
I know, it's math, but wake up because this is important
-- the city of Dallas is depending on you!

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.960
So, let's calculate the growth of Dallas's
mosquito population over a span of two weeks.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:10:02.920
All we have to do to get the rate of growth, that's r, is take the number of births minus the number of deaths,

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.720
and then divide that all by the initial population
size

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.000
(which we generally just call N).

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.240
So let's say with start with an initial population
of a hundred mosquitoes,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.860
and each of those mosquitoes lives and average of 2 weeks so our deaths, over a span of 2 weeks, will be 100.

00:10:21.869 --> 00:10:25.509
Half of these mosquitoes are going to be female,
so 50 of them,

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:30.540
and they can produce about 2,000 babies in
their lifetime, so that's times 2,000.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:39.680
So 50 mommy mosquitoes times 2,000 babies per mommy and you get births equaling 100,000 little baby mosquitoes.

00:10:39.689 --> 00:10:42.910
Once we plug in all the numbers into this
equation, even though this is totally a hypothetical,

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.850
we will see the true scope of Dallas's mosquito
problem.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:50.930
So blink!, in two weeks the population had
100,000 babies and only 100 of them died,

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.839
so this is a population growth rate, if you
do the math, of 999.

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:59.059
This means that for every mosquito out there
at the beginning of 2 weeks, there will be

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.279
999 more at the end of 2 weeks.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.400
That is a 99,800% increase, by THOR'S HAMMER!

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.700
Again, these are hypothetical numbers, but
it gives you a sense of how a population can

00:11:11.709 --> 00:11:15.350
just go out of control when all the factors
that we talk about go in its favor.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.550
And you guys haven't even seen trouble until
you've seen what the graph of human population

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.459
looks like over the last couple millennia.

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:24.689
But to find out more about that, you going
to have to join us next week.

00:11:24.689 --> 00:11:28.509
Until then, thank you for watching this episode
of Crash Course: Ecology,

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:29.970
and thanks to everyone who helped put it together.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.129
The table of contents is over there if you
want to go rewatch anything,

00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:37.740
and if you have any questions for us we're on Facebook, and Twitter, and of course, in the comments below.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.160
See you next time.
