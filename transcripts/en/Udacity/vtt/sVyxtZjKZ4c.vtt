00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.955
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What advice to you have for students

00:00:01.955 --> 00:00:05.591
that are taking this course that are starting to learn about parallel computing?

00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:08.369
So what can you say to them that they should be thinking about

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:10.511
as they grow and mature in this area?

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:13.037
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well first off, they've picked a good course,

00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:17.427
because this is definitely an enabling technology.

00:00:17.427 --> 00:00:22.159
By having experience and expertise in GPU computing

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:27.796
can let them be a vehicle for extracting,

00:00:27.796 --> 00:00:30.673
you know, that kind of flops are free,

00:00:30.673 --> 00:00:36.040
computation and unlock some of the things that researchers or industry

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.498
or even commercial space haven't been able to do yet,

00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:42.914
because they just don't have the bandwidth, they don't have the compute power, horsepower.

00:00:42.914 --> 00:00:46.206
Cuda NGB/g computing, in some cases, is meant to inspire.

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:48.706
I mean, just think about if computing was free.

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:50.762
If you didn't have to worry about, you know,

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:53.594
the flops or the bits per second.

00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:58.179
What could you do with the kinds of problems in your space or in your field?

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.372
Being part of that revolution is totally fine,

00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:03.820
and I see it everyday when I work customers

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.544
and selling GPUs or talking to developers.

00:01:07.544 --> 00:01:09.929
I think they should be, not only just learning the technology

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:13.252
but thinking about what they could do with it and where they could apply it.

00:01:13.252 --> 00:01:16.206
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much for spending some time with us today. I appreciate it.

00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:19.000
&gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks John.
