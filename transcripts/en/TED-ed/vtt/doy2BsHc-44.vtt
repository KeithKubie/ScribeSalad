00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.647
The epic poem "La Dragontea"

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:11.418
describes how English explorer
Sir Francis Drake

00:00:11.418 --> 00:00:16.305
sailed across 
the Gulf of Venezuela in 1595.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:18.857
He was aiming for 
the nearby Lake Maracaibo,

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:23.518
home to a colony of Spanish settlers
he planned to overthrow.

00:00:23.518 --> 00:00:27.830
But as Drake moved towards the mouth
of the lake under cover of darkness,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.890
his plot was suddenly 
and magnificently foiled.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.692
Huge flashes of lightning 
illuminated the landscape,

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:38.838
exposing the fleet as if it were daytime,

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.615
which warned the Spanish 
about his approach.

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:45.953
Lake Maracaibo is 
the stormiest place on the planet.

00:00:45.953 --> 00:00:50.690
The massive body of water
at over 13,000 square kilometers

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.975
is a place of almost perpetual storming.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:57.670
Thunderstorms rage above it
for up to 200 days of the year,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.952
each earsplitting event lasting
for several hours.

00:01:01.952 --> 00:01:03.980
Like everywhere else on Earth,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.201
lightning at Lake Maracaibo is the result
of opposing electrical charges

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:11.291
that steadily build up 
inside storm clouds.

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:15.314
Once there's a large enough difference
between charges either within the cloud

00:01:15.314 --> 00:01:18.334
or between the clouds
and the Earth below,

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:22.105
it forms a spark that becomes
a lightning bolt.

00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:26.512
Lightning strikes the earth
about 350 million times per year,

00:01:26.512 --> 00:01:29.411
averaging out to eleven strikes a second.

00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:33.556
We know that thanks to satellites
up in space and sensors on the ground.

00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:36.720
We can also measure 
the Earth's lightning density,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.895
which is the frequency with which
lightning flashes in a square kilometer.

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:44.348
Knowing where lightning strikes
and how often

00:01:44.348 --> 00:01:48.235
reveals the most 
lightning-rich places on Earth.

00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:50.169
In the polar regions,

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:55.063
there may only be one strike
per several square kilometers each year.

00:01:55.063 --> 00:01:57.383
Meanwhile, lightning density 
at the equator

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:01.052
averages out to tens of flashes
per square kilometer

00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:05.688
on account of the sun providing
more heat to drive storms.

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:09.133
Yet nowhere can quite compare
with Lake Maracaibo,

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:14.247
where lightning strikes an average
250 times per square kilometer,

00:02:14.247 --> 00:02:18.562
giving it the highest lightning density
of any place on Earth.

00:02:18.562 --> 00:02:23.936
A number of factors converge to create
the lake's seemingly everlasting storms.

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:28.867
Firstly, Lake Maracaibo lies just 
ten degrees north of the Equator,

00:02:28.867 --> 00:02:33.499
so there's a wealth of solar energy
available to fuel the storms.

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:37.618
Thunderstorms also require a supply
of water vapor to feed on,

00:02:37.618 --> 00:02:40.863
and having the warm waters
of the Caribbean so close by

00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:43.475
provides an endless supply.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:46.079
Finally, the lake's southern 
and western edges

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.177
are bordered by two massive 
mountain ranges,

00:02:49.177 --> 00:02:52.263
and as cool winds surge
down these slopes,

00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:54.416
they force up warm air,

00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:59.215
destabilizing the atmosphere
and causing storm clouds to form.

00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:01.145
Together, these ingredients combine

00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:06.103
to give rise to the most awe-inspiring
thunderstorms on the planet,

00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:08.161
a true sight to behold.

00:03:08.161 --> 00:03:13.218
Centuries ago, Sir Francis Drake may have
cursed the lake's intense illumination,

00:03:13.218 --> 00:03:17.076
but today, sailors actually embrace
this phenomenon.

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:19.391
They call it the Maracaibo Beacon,

00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:23.954
and use it as a natural lighthouse
to illuminate their path across the seas.
