00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.568
Uh, there was another story

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.470
that I want to make sure
doesn't get forgotten.

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:06.539
Now, this one's about a judge
who was, let's say,

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:09.075
a bit too cavalier
in his sentencing.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.077 line:0%
REPORTER:<i> 20-year-old
 swimming star Brock Turner</i>

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.079 line:0%
<i> could have been
 looking at 14 years</i>

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:15.314 line:0%
<i> for sexually assaulting
 an intoxicated</i>

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:16.749 line:0%
<i> and unconscious woman</i>

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.385 line:0%
<i> behind a Dumpster
 on Stanford's campus.</i>

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:22.288
<i> But instead of 14 years,
 a judge has ruled Turner</i>

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.457
<i> will only spend
 six months in jail,</i>

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.060
<i> eligible for parole
 in three months.</i>

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.394
Hold on a second.

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:31.397
It's 14 years or six months?

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.199
Those are the two options?

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:35.034
There's got to be
something in between,

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.703
like-like 13 years, maybe?

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.806
Or 13 years and six months?

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.007
(cheering, applause)

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.109
What am I missing?

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:44.377
God.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.947
Or... or what the (bleep)

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.583
was wrong with 14 years?

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:52.552
How about that?

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.957
So, anyhow, the judge
said he understood

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.560
the devastation
the victim suffered.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.129 line:0%
Uh, but that
the "prison sentence would have

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:06.999 line:0%
a severe impact" on Brock.

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:09.735
Yes, because if anyone
isn't supposed to change

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:13.439
after a brutal attack,
it's the attacker.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.576
Brock, man, we're gonna
lock you up for a bit,

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.479
but promise you won't lose
that rapey side we love so much,

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.782
all right, man?
Don't change, man, don't change.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:24.317
Now, in California,
the mandatory minimum

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.018
for this type of case
is two years,

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:29.989
and a judge can sentence
below that, but why would he?

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:32.492
REPORTER:<i> The judge's reasoning?
 The rape carried</i>

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.461
<i> "less moral culpability
 because Turner was drunk</i>

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:36.762
<i> at the time of the attack."</i>

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:39.732
That's a defense?

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:42.802
Was this judge drunk
at the time of sentencing?

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:44.437
(cheering, applause)

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.373
How...
Guys, think about this.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:51.277
How does "too drunk" work
as an excuse for any crime?

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.181
Sorry I committed that DUI.
In my defense, I was drunk.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:57.783
Get out of here.

00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:00.319
Drunk should never be an excuse.

00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:02.221
My coworkers still haven't
forgiven me for

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:05.124
the drunken crimes I committed
at staff karaoke night.

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:08.561
Right? Still paying for that.

00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:12.031
Now, it could be that the judge
may have been swayed by a letter

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:14.800
from Brock 's daddy
in which he wrote...

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.402 line:0%
"that is a steep price
to pay..."

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.776
I smell almonds.
Am I having a stroke?

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.347
"20 minutes of action?"

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.750
He describes rape as "action"?

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.785
Okay, I've said this before:
there's a reason why

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:35.655
we have words, okay?

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.324
And those two words
are not the same.

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:41.093
Only the most horrible
type of human scum

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:42.995
would say something
like that-- "action."

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:46.699
Not to mention, you would be
the worst movie director ever.

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:49.502
All right, everybody,
quiet on the set. Quiet.

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:51.337
And... rape.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.573
Okay, that was bad.
That was horrible.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:57.243
-I know, I know. True. Um...
-(cheering, applause)

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.914
Actually, uh, actually,
you'd be tied with

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:05.685
Roman Polanski
and Woody Allen. But...

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.019
That's right, I went there.

00:03:07.052 --> 00:03:10.890
But... but action-dad
wasn't done.

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:12.325 line:0%
"I was always excited
to buy him...

00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:22.501
Who gives a (bleep)?

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:24.003
(cheering, applause)

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:25.972
God.

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.340
Who cares?

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.909
Oh... oh, the poor widdle fella.

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:32.378
Is the rapist
too raped out to eat steak?

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.350
Okay, here's what's
really gets me about this, guys.

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:41.053
It's 20-(bleep)-16,

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:44.557
and this is the best we can do
about sexual assault?

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.159
I... This is exhausting,
you guys.

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:48.628
Like, take this (bleep),

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.429
who I haven't
forgotten about, right?

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:53.599
(cheering, applause)

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:55.067
Right?

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.838
Okay, he's accused
of over 50 "actions,"

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:02.508
and we can barely get him
into a (bleep) courtroom.

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:03.776 line:0%
REPORTER:<i> We see
 he's making his way there</i>

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.578 line:0%
<i> through the metal detector.</i>

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:08.014
You're not blind.
Open your goddamn eyes,

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:11.250
you fake-blind (bleep)!

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:13.486
You're not.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.488
God.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:19.358
But anyway, I just think
as a society, today,

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.524
I just think we have to find
a way to do better.
