00:00:01.488 --> 00:00:04.071
(bright music)

00:00:33.413 --> 00:00:34.280
- Hi.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.980
Welcome to the second Hitchcock Lecture

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.203
by Professor Peebles.
(clapping)

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.840
That's Professor Peebles down there.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.870
I am George Smoot.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.800
I'm the local, but I'm the person here

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.150
who probably known him the third longest

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.390
or the second longest, I don't
know if Mark has known him,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.240
Mark Davis has known him
longer or not than I have.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.061
But I get the pleasure of introducing him,

00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:01.240
and yesterday you heard this
fairly formal introduction

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.900
and you see in the little
brochure you got when you came in

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.310
that he's highly honored in a lot of areas

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.100
and been a pioneer in the field.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.630
But they actually left
some of the stuff out

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.050
that he did that was
very influential to me

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.410
and I know to Mark Davis and
to a number of other people.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.120
There's a whole book that they left out

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.280
called Physical Cosmology
which came out in 1971.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.650
And that book was extremely formative

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.213
to a whole generation of people.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.750
So you look sort of up in
the history of cosmology

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.220
and everything and you
get statements like this.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.450
According to many books
and surveys of cosmology,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.280
including reviews of a more
or less historical nature,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.730
'cause you know, it always
more or less, right?

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.620
The field of cosmology only
became truly scientific

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.210
about 1965, primarily as a result

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.810
of the discovery of the
cosmic background radiation,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.360
and they give sample (mumbles).

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.750
To me, I noticed that, but it wasn't,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.670
cosmology didn't really
become serious field

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.050
until I read Jim's first book,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.070
because there was the stuff laid out

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.390
with a huge amount of
math, but enough words

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.660
that I could understand it to know

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.990
whether it was worth my trouble
of learning the math, right?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.239
And each of us, Mark learned
a certain kind of math,

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:08.928
I learned a certain kind of math.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:13.928
And it was that book and
the book by Steven Weinberg

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.630
and a couple articles by Dennis Sciama

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.170
and particularly Jim's book
and the articles by Sciama

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.470
that got me interested in the
cosmic microwave background,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.220
and the first experiment
that we did in that area,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.950
we named the ether-drift experiment

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.660
right after the title of
your subchapter in the book.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.820
And Jim wasn't remembering
how long he's known me,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.030
but I stole time out of one of his talk

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.980
almost three decades ago at
the American Physical Society

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.270
meeting in Washington, D.C.,

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.350
which was the big-time
meeting in those days.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.580
And he had an invited talk,
and we had new results

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.410
saying we know that the earth is moving.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.060
Finally Galileo is right.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.850
And he graciously, as he always does,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.340
gave up time to this young post-doc

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.340
who just asked him,
graciously gave up some time

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.550
so that I could present the results,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.170
because it was too late for me

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.600
to get a talk in the meeting and so forth.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.660
And then he's regretted it ever since,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.070
so he promised to roast me tonight,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.060
but (laughs) we'll see what happens.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.090
But I have a couple more
things to say about him,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.930
and that is, you will see from his talk

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.170
how good it is as a public
talk and everything,

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.470
but to physicists, he's what
we'd call elegantly casual.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.830
And let me explain that in more detail.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.260
He goes and gives these simple,
he'll go up to the board,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.110
he'll do the simple calculations for you

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.370
and it'll be, well, it has to be this

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.550
by dimensional analysis, or
this is the simple calculation.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.280
And the answer will
come up exactly correct,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.090
no factor of two, no pi, nothing,

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.670
just exactly correct, and he
does that time after time.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.240
And as teachers, we
occasionally do that, you know,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.060
we don't do Chandrasekhar,
we do the Landau description

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.480
and get the limit on the
mass of a neutron star,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.470
or we do the bending of light by the sun

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.590
or something like that
by dimensional analysis

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.730
and we kind of get the right answer

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.550
if we fudge it a little bit, and so forth.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.360
But he does it time after time,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.480
and I always wonder how many nights

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.830
he spent up doing those
calculations correctly

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.670
to then work out how to do that.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.790
Because it's just beautiful
to see it come out that way,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.090
because you see the
physics of what goes on,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.860
and that's what's characterized his books

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.700
and that's characterized what
he's done over this time,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.660
and again, he's doing
that in these lectures.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.060
And so I say the public
can appreciate him,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.390
the scientists can appreciate him,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.070
and there's a lot of us in
here and all across the world

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.520
that came into cosmology
because we read your books

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.350
and we followed your example and so forth.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.350
And so it's a pleasure for
me to be here and do that.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.590
And then the only bad
thing I can say about you,

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.640
and you already put it in the biography,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.380
is you're a Canadian,
just like our chancellor.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.240
And so, I mean, that's like...
(laughing)

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.010
So rather than take much more time out,

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.920
'cause I already owe him some time,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.370
let's have Professor Peebles come up here

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.253
and give the second lecture.
(clapping)

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:05.730
- Thank you, George.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.860
Friends and colleagues, thank you

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.223
for coming in out of a
beautiful day to this dark room.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.708
It's evidence, clearly, that you share

00:05:15.708 --> 00:05:18.913
our fascination with the world around us.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.020
I like to begin with a general comment

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.720
about the nature of this science.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.070
Cosmology, the study of the large-scale

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.920
nature of the universe,
is a physical science,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.093
and it operates by general rules

00:05:33.093 --> 00:05:36.480
that are familiar from any
other branch of science.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.437
You're free to introduce
conjectures, postulates, ideas.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.430
They should be, and generally are,

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.940
treated for what they are,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.710
just-so stories, until they can be tested.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.860
A successful test, a
prediction that is made

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.510
and successfully
confirmed by measurements,

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.870
confirms our belief that
we're on the right track

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.920
with this just-so story.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.370
A failure is a positive step

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.820
because it tells us we'd
better change the story.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.750
Continued successes without
the need to change the story

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.910
convinces us we're on the right track

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.600
to a good approximation to reality.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.201
You'll notice that in this description,

00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:23.000
it clearly follows that
there is no absolute truth

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.360
in physical science, because after all

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.000
we cannot make an experiment
that is infinitely accurate.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.963
Instead we are searching for
successive approximations.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.334
That is why I can stand up here and claim

00:06:38.334 --> 00:06:40.930
that cosmology at the present day

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.120
is remarkably successful,
even though it has

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.530
some pretty wild just-so
stories buried in it.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.740
So that's gonna be my real challenge,

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.140
to convince you of those two aspects.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.720
We have a good approximation to reality,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.170
but we have a long way to go.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.200
So to begin, the universe
is clumpy on small scales.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.530
Here we are, a concentration in a room

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.130
in the suburban sprawl of the Bay Area

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.330
on a planet around a star

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.803
in a galaxy of stars in the
local supergalaxy of galaxies.

00:07:15.436 --> 00:07:18.910
But the large-scale distribution
is somewhat different.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.190
You'll notice that in this map

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.490
showing the distribution
out to a fixed depth

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.800
of this distribution of
galaxies across the sky

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.880
there are clumps, and I'm going
to be drawing your attention

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.090
in a little while to
this particular clump.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.780
There are other clumps
and there are wiggles

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.210
and fascinating texture,
but you also notice,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.720
I trust, that this part of the world

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.090
looks a lot like that part of the world.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.410
This leads to the first law of cosmology,

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.400
the first conjecture, if you will.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.830
The universe is uniform

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.893
in the large-scale average,
no center, no edge.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.193
The second law is that
the universe is expanding.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.500
Here a description, one observes

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.990
that the light from distant galaxies

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.910
is shifted toward the
red, as if Doppler shifted

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.620
by motion of the galaxies away from us.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.400
The interpretation of this observation

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.830
is that the universe is expanding.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.010
Here is a two-dimensional illustration

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.650
of this expanding universe model.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.830
I remind you that here we are pretending

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.980
we live in two dimensions and not three,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.100
that you live on the
surface of that balloon

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.810
and that you agree not to ask me

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.360
what's off the surface of the balloon.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.990
You live on two dimensions.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.047
Suck it up, that's where you live.

00:08:31.047 --> 00:08:32.090
(laughing)

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.810
The balloon is being blown up.

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.007
That means that if you sit on
a galaxy and look around you,

00:08:36.007 --> 00:08:38.540
you see the galaxies nearby moving away

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.810
and you see more distant galaxies
moving away more rapidly.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.050
That's the expansion of the universe.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.070
Notice that if you go to another galaxy

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.490
and repeat the measurement,
you'll see the same thing.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.780
Here is a universe that
is uniform, no center,

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.390
and yet expanding in such a way

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.170
that everybody sees the
galaxies moving away from them

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.460
as if they were at the
center of the universe.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.260
But they're not, there is no center.

00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:04.791
Good.

00:09:04.791 --> 00:09:06.790
The second law of thermodynamics.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.890
Now we come to some conjectures.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.090
One may ask, does it not mean

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.560
that if the universe is expanding,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.050
that it's growing less dense
and it used to be more dense?

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.210
Fred Hoyle, on the left
here with Tommy Gold

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.680
and Hermann Bondi, not in the photograph,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.070
pointed out that doesn't follow at all.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.223
They said, let us introduce a postulate,

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.890
a just-so story, if you will.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.530
Suppose that matter is
spontaneously being created

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.060
at a definite, exceedingly small rate.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.219
The newly created matter will by gravity

00:09:40.219 --> 00:09:43.260
pool together in clouds,
the clouds may collapse

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.696
to become galaxies of stars,
and these young galaxies

00:09:46.696 --> 00:09:49.720
will fill the voids that are opening up

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.150
as the older galaxies move apart.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.970
You will thus produce a
universe in a steady state,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.630
expanding yet not evolving.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.320
It's arguably a deeply beautiful idea.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.400
Somehow, perhaps for
anthropomorphic reasons,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.810
it's sort of unnerving to think

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.900
that our universe is not forever.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.570
But I can tell you, evidence that it is

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.623
of compelling interest to many people,

00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:18.830
eternal inflation is just
a variant of this picture.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.580
But this classical steady state cosmology

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.530
has very clearly failed,
and here is the reason.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.276
Space is filled with
radiation with an intensity

00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:33.130
at each wavelength that
follows this curve.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.080
It's a very special curve.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.350
It is how radiation will relax

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.730
if sufficiently absorbed and re-radiated

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.450
so that the radiation can relax
to statistical equilibrium,

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.750
so-called black body radiation
or thermal radiation,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.320
This radiation at a temperature

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.830
of 2.7 degrees above absolute zero.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.930
How did this radiation
reach this wonderfully

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.200
characteristic state,
characteristic of equilibrium?

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.630
Surely because the radiation

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.100
was absorbed and re-emitted many times.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.910
But we know the universe as it is now

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.250
is pretty close to transparent
at these wavelengths.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.360
You know that because you can see

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.173
distant galaxies emitting in the radio.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.160
The clear inference is that this radiation

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.360
is a fossil remnant from a time

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.060
when the expanding
universe was dense and hot

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.840
and able to relax to
statistical equilibrium,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.600
a fossil, therefore, that
is in stark contradiction

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.493
to the steady state cosmology.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.030
This is wonderful science.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.580
A postulate is introduced and demolished.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.783
We've made progress.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.335
We have now the notion
of an expanding universe,

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:48.090
and it fits the observation
of that radiation.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.640
That's good, but of course it's also

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.270
in a sense another just-so story,

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.260
particularly when you consider

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.210
that when we look into
the details of this theory

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.640
of the expanding and evolving universe,

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.230
we need to introduce our
own two new just-so stories,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.920
that most of the mass of the universe

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.070
is not in the form of
which you and I are made,

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.320
that you and I are made of material,

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.440
the jargon is baryons, that occupy only

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.170
about five percent of
the mass of the universe.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.920
The rest is in two new hypothetical forms,

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.660
dark matter and dark energy.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.430
Isn't that embarrassing?

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.670
Absolutely.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.900
Does it mean we're on
the totally wrong trail?

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.650
Absolutely not.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.130
We are just trying to get

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.870
successive approximations to reality.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.810
So we begin with the dark matter issue.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.500
On the right you see
Fritz Zwicky, a Swiss,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.370
many years at Caltech
and Southern California,

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.140
a somewhat irascible figure,

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.783
but also a deeply intelligent
and original astronomer.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.060
I spent about 10 years of my life

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.900
working with the data in this book

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.050
of the catalog of the nearby galaxies.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.660
He predicted the
existence of neutron stars

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:07.090
as remnants from exploding
stars, remnants of supernovae.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.000
He predicted that the bending of light

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.250
by mass concentrations would
produce astronomical lenses.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.430
I'll show you an example in a minute.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.430
And he was the one who pointed out

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.480
that this cluster of galaxies
which I pointed out to you

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.060
on the beginning slide
has a curious property.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.610
One can measure the relative
velocities of the galaxies

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.530
by looking in the differences
of their Doppler shifts.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.330
A galaxy moving away from
us has its light shifted

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.430
toward the red, moving toward
us, shifted toward the blue.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.390
From the observations of those shifts,

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.700
one could get the
velocities of the galaxies

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.550
in this cluster, and one can also compute

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:49.100
the mass seen in the stars in
the galaxies in this cluster,

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.040
and one sees a distressing inconsistency.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.603
Much more mass is
required than is observed.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.090
The interpretation in
those days is missing mass.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.510
We've missed some of the mass.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.790
We've made great progress;

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.930
these days we call it dark matter.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.130
We still don't know what it is.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.230
But we can be very sure of one thing,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.770
it's not the baryons of
which you and I are made.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.390
There is no form that could be hidden

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.410
in there in that amount.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.610
There are other examples
of this phenomenon.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.610
Here, oh, and here is an example

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:29.310
of Zwicky's gravitational
bending as astronomical lenses.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.260
Here is an image of the center
of a cluster of galaxies.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.440
It's a negative; where the image is dark

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.380
there are lots of stars.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.360
The arc is in fact one
galaxy in the background

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.250
seen in a horribly distorted image.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.090
Light from that distant object,

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.700
which is about in the
center of this image,

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.200
comes toward us at the upper part,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.900
moving slightly upward and to the right.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.000
But gravity bends it, pulls it over

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.023
and directs it to our eye.

00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:03.070
Light rays coming down
from the galaxy slightly

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.130
and to our right are bent up and over

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.480
and produce the image on the bottom.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.610
Here we see a horribly
distorted image of a galaxy.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.490
It's a gravitational lens.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.350
But what is really striking about this

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.400
is how smooth that arc is.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.710
The bending angle is almost

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.460
identically the same
going around that arc.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.630
The bending angle is the same,
but the mass distribution

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.510
in the seen material
is wildly inhomogenous.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.730
How in the world could that be?

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.500
The mass isn't mainly where the stars are.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.250
There's a smooth component to mass.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.833
Another illustration.

00:15:38.445 --> 00:15:40.943
Here on the left, an optical
image of three galaxies.

00:15:40.943 --> 00:15:43.840
It's a negative again,
dark where there are stars.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.413
On the right an image taken
with a radio telescope

00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:48.430
that is sensitive to the light emitted

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.070
by hydrogen atoms at
21-centimeter wavelength.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.190
You see that there is a
clear physical connection

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.140
between these three galaxies.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.100
They're not just an accidental
projection on the sky,

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.150
they're close, and they're doing a dance.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.560
But if you add up the mass you
see in those three galaxies

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.960
and compare it to the velocity
with which they're moving,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.993
you see these guys shouldn't
be doing a dance at all,

00:16:08.993 --> 00:16:11.290
they should be flying apart.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.490
The standard interpretation,
the hypothesis,

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.680
the just-so story is, there's
a lot of dark matter in there

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.080
that's holding them together.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.320
It's not in the galaxies,

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.453
it's in the general soup
connecting the galaxies.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.410
Here's another galaxy.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.880
Vera Rubin, at the Carnegie
Institutions in Washington, D.C,

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.630
founded by Andrew
Carnegie, the robber baron,

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.810
but you know, old dirty money

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.950
becomes new clean money.
(chuckling)

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.540
He founded the Department
of Terrestrial Magnetism;

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.140
the name hangs on, it's a charming

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.690
indication of past occupations.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.370
Now this is a world-class center

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.510
for many branches of
science, including astronomy

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:52.650
and including Vera Rubin,
who measures in this example

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.800
the motion of material in
the outskirts of a galaxy.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.630
And she finds that this material is moving

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.100
in a nice circular orbit, part
of the disc of the galaxy,

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.600
but with a disconcerting observation

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.595
that the material is
moving much too rapidly

00:17:06.595 --> 00:17:09.750
to be held in a circular
orbit by the seen mass.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.040
Again, we need a hypothesis: dark matter.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.570
As I said, this dark matter

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.120
can't be baryons in any known form.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.410
Instead we have ideas that it might be

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.840
other forms of matter, we
have other just-so stories.

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.450
A big effort to check on some
of these big just-so stories

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.763
is here collected from some
webs, from some posters.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.890
The key point: if standard
gravity physics is right,

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.270
and it has passed demanding tests,

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.457
then matter is not dominated
by the baryons you and I

00:17:41.457 --> 00:17:44.290
and stars and planets are
made of, so what is it?

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.852
One possibility, classes of particles

00:17:46.852 --> 00:17:49.260
that interact only very weakly

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.200
with material of which we are made,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.150
but occasionally will
hit an atomic nucleus

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.970
and give it a little kick.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.650
So perhaps if that's the case,

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.280
you will be able to
detect this dark matter.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.750
Just take a crystal of material

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.470
and wait for it to ring unexpectedly

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.830
because it's been hit by
a dark matter particle.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.610
Now, you don't do this in
the surface of the earth.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.500
Too much radiation floating around.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.360
You go deep in a mine that's clean,

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.710
and you'd cool the detector down

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.560
as close to zero as you can get it,

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.030
and you build very sophisticated equipment

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.340
to look for those occasional
ringing of the apparatus.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.760
Bernard Sadoulet is one of
the leaders of this operation.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.345
I couldn't find him in this
picture of co-conspirators.

00:18:29.345 --> 00:18:30.850
- He's upper left.
- Upper left?

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.555
That's not Bernard, is it?

00:18:32.555 --> 00:18:33.997
- Think that's him.
- Oh.

00:18:33.997 --> 00:18:34.992
Okay.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

00:18:34.992 --> 00:18:35.970
- [Audience Member] He doesn't
look good in a hard hat.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:36.830
- He doesn't look good in a hard hat.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.340
Many of these people do.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.690
Most of them are much younger than Bernard

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.810
and are very capable, very
dedicated, very brave.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.050
They're going after a just-so story.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.890
It'll be wonderful if they
have a positive detection.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.190
If they get a negative result,
that'll be wonderful too.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.023
It'll tell us, change our
just-so story and improve it.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.180
This is the best and the brightest.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.990
They deserve our support,

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.085
and we know that no matter
how the experiment comes out,

00:19:08.085 --> 00:19:12.430
they're gonna go on to do
great things to the world.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:15.200
We must also postulate
that about two thirds

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.600
of the mass of our universe is in

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.300
yet something even more bizarre.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.680
So here we go, suspension
of disbelief required here.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.760
Upper left, Albert Einstein,
upper right, Willem de Sitter,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.213
a Dutch astronomer, director
of the Leiden Observatory.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:35.493
Albert Einstein invented in 1916, '15,

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.723
a new theory of gravity,
general relativity theory.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.840
He applied it to his notion of a universe

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.764
that was uniform, and
found to his distress

00:19:46.764 --> 00:19:50.334
that this universe is
inconsistent with his assumption

00:19:50.334 --> 00:19:52.483
that of course the world is forever.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.430
That led him to adjust his theory

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:59.950
by putting in a new term that
he called the cosmic term,

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.700
that had come to be called for a long time

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.480
the cosmological constant term,
is now called dark energy.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.570
You see the great advance
in science in that.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.440
Ever more romantic names.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.890
Now, the game is this.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.304
Einstein visualized a
universe of this sort,

00:20:16.304 --> 00:20:21.300
but he assumed it's obvious
the universe is forever.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.670
But his theory said no, this universe

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.640
will collapse under the force of gravity.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.850
Gravity pulls things together.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.630
That is a bad thing, it
would seem to Einstein,

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.070
and so he adjusted this theory

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.230
to put in this cosmic term
that acts as a repulsion

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.563
to push apart the tendency
of gravity to draw together.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.200
That is the notion of Einstein's universe.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.040
The pressure is held in that balloon

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.950
just such that the pressure,
which is the operation

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.960
of the cosmological constant term,

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.413
is just such as to balance the
attraction force of gravity.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.870
It was the Belgian Georges Lemaitre,

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.870
whose picture I will show you in a moment,

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.480
who pointed out that this
is an unstable situation.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.110
Touch that static universe a little bit

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.941
and it'll either collapse or expand.

00:21:07.941 --> 00:21:10.450
By the time he made that point,

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.650
it was known that the
galaxies are moving apart

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.260
as if the universe was expanding.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.820
A brilliant connection made,
the universe is expanding.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.240
That led to Professor
Dr Willem de Sitter's

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.160
comment in a Dutch newspaper.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.830
You see his shape; it is
the Greek letter lambda,

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.190
which was Einstein's
symbol for this new term

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:33.190
in his equations, and the
quote from the newspaper is,

00:21:33.387 --> 00:21:36.977
"Who, however, blows up the
ball, the expanding universe?

00:21:36.977 --> 00:21:39.917
"What makes the universe
expand or swell up?

00:21:39.917 --> 00:21:41.950
"That is done by the lambda,"

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.517
Einstein's cosmological constant.

00:21:44.517 --> 00:21:46.737
"Another answer cannot be given."

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.450
As soon as this point was made,

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.160
people recognize that you don't
really need lambda at all.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.930
If you're willing to accept
that the universe is expanding,

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.610
then let it expand, and let
it do it under gravity alone.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.250
Gravity will slow the expansion,

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.397
but under the right initial conditions

00:22:02.397 --> 00:22:05.500
the universe will expand for a long time.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.890
Bob's your uncle.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.603
We don't need lambda.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.130
Here is some correspondence
between Einstein

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.830
and Georges Lemaitre, the Belgian

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.840
who discovered this connection

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.323
between the astronomers'
observations and Einstein's theory.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.080
I was told yesterday I should have made

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.193
a few comments about that clerical collar.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.240
He was an abbe of the
Roman Catholic Church.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.640
He had absolutely zero problem

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.220
with the balancing of
science and religion.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.530
He was deeply influential in
the Vatican and respected,

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:48.450
he was a deeply influential
and original physicist.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.710
He in writings gave his opinion

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.623
of how you deal with these
two aspects of his work.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:01.610
He said, "If you wish to swim,

00:23:01.997 --> 00:23:03.867
"then you would be well advised to do it

00:23:03.867 --> 00:23:06.757
"in ways that believers and nonbelievers

00:23:06.757 --> 00:23:09.400
"have found to be effective."

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.743
I would make it more stark and to say

00:23:10.743 --> 00:23:13.480
that if I decided I'm not gonna swim

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.050
like all of those people who
believe in another religion,

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.920
then there's a distinct possibility

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.930
I'm soon gone, isn't that right?

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.588
And by the same argument, Lemaitre said

00:23:23.588 --> 00:23:28.080
if you would do science, then
you will do it in the manner

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.170
that people, believers and unbelievers,

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.633
have found to be effective.

00:23:34.158 --> 00:23:35.863
Is that so wrong?

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.943
To me, perfect science.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.600
Here is a correspondence just
after the Second World War

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.520
in which Lemaitre makes the point,

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.880
we needn't get into the technical details,

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.880
that Einstein's cosmological term

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.180
just acts like a
distributed energy density,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.070
uniformly distributed through space,

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.990
with some peculiar properties,
let's not bother with them.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.223
It sets the zero level of energy.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.507
Einstein replied with
some complimentary works,

00:24:09.507 --> 00:24:11.633
"Thank you for your very kind letter,

00:24:13.697 --> 00:24:15.357
"I doubt that anyone has so carefully

00:24:15.357 --> 00:24:18.087
"studied the cosmological implications

00:24:18.087 --> 00:24:20.377
"of the theory of relativity as you have."

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.640
He was being nice, but I think

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.440
he was also being correct
and proper in saying that.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.433
But then the line I wish
to draw your attention to,

00:24:30.807 --> 00:24:33.563
"Since I have introduced this term,

00:24:33.563 --> 00:24:37.550
"I had always a bad conscience."

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.120
Einstein hated the cosmological term.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.493
To him, it was an extra
appendix that wasn't needed.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.910
Other great physicists
echoed Einstein's view,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.910
in particular Pauli,
great Austrian physicist.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.400
Einstein was soon aware of
these new possibilities,

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.510
that is to say get rid of lambda,

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.000
and completely rejected
the cosmological term

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.490
as superfluous and no longer justified.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.890
I fully accept this
standpoint of Einstein's.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.613
One of the great physicists of all times.

00:25:12.613 --> 00:25:15.390
A little pompous, but
there it is, he meant it.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.930
He also had a reason for rejecting it,

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:21.610
namely a really ridiculous
problem with quantum mechanics.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.010
You've heard of zero point energy.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.330
Take two hydrogen atoms,
bring them close together,

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.710
they'll get stuck and
make molecular hydrogen.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.050
In computing the binding
energy you have to take account

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:33.390
of the fact that there is a
so-called zero point energy.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.070
Sometimes it's discussed as being a result

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.600
of the uncertainty principle,
you can't make sure

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.140
that the atoms are really at the center

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.790
of their potential well and
not moving at the same time.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.790
The result is a little
bit of uncertainty in both

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.500
that adds up to a little bit of energy.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.190
I don't know that I grab that.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.800
Just live with it, there
is zero point energy

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.183
in any degree of freedom of motion.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.070
The electromagnetic
field in quantum physics

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:58.740
is a field, and it's also particles,

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.113
just as particles are fields.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.950
Was that somebody?
(laughing)

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.170
The electromagnetic
field is well described

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.200
by standard quantum mechanics.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.600
It has lots and lots of zero
point modes of oscillation

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.590
that produces an energy density
that is ridiculously large,

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.995
so big as, Pauli is recalled as quoting

00:26:21.995 --> 00:26:25.310
that the energy density in
the electromagnetic field's

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.980
zero point energy ought to be so large

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.290
they will curve space time so strongly

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.810
that our universe won't
even reach to the moon.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.270
It's absurd.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.150
His response, we can't live with this.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:38.123
It's not there.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.860
This zero point energy of
the electromagnetic field

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.860
would act as Einstein's cosmic term.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.650
Many people recognized
this, including Lemaitre,

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.680
but the person who made it visible to all

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.560
is Yakov Zeldovich, shown here dancing

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:02.433
with his wife at a banquet in Hungary.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.360
He started out, like other Russian,

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.300
Soviet physicists, working
on the nuclear bomb,

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:15.550
was a big factor in the
nuclear hydrogen bomb design,

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.063
soon sickened of that, turned to physics,

00:27:18.063 --> 00:27:20.280
just as Zakharov sickened of it

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.043
and turned to political
concerns, social concerns.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.770
The consequence was that at
the time of this photograph

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.930
he was still not allowed
to leave the Soviet Union

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.583
because he knew too much.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.130
Not until close to the
fall of the Soviet Union

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.070
was he allowed to get out of the country.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:41.820
Deeply original physicist, and the one

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.310
who firmly fixed in our mind,

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:46.180
you had better learn to live with

00:27:49.759 --> 00:27:54.710
the dark energy concept, because
it exists as a possibility,

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.813
the genie has been let out of the bottle

00:27:56.813 --> 00:27:59.933
and it is not easy to force it back in.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.670
Well, you can see that we need

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.980
some help from the observations.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.500
We have these hypotheses,
we've got to test them

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.633
and be guided by what is observed.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.980
Here is an idea behind a test

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.990
about our notions of the universe.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.770
Recall that Euclid's postulate

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.870
or self-evident statement,
parallel lines never meet.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.790
But that's because Euclid
was thinking in flat space.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.630
In general relativity theory,
space time can be curved,

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.776
and that means that lines
that start out straight

00:28:28.776 --> 00:28:31.510
and move in a straight line can cross.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.770
That's an effective curvature.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.060
You've seen in whenever you peel an orange

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.580
and you've seen the segments
with straight lines,

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.040
each a great circle, coming
together and crossing.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.563
That has an important effect.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.501
Look at the light coming
from a distant galaxy.

00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:49.020
Curvature may do two things.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.060
It may bend the light rays

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.650
as you see in the top illustration

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.420
or as in the lower illustration.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.370
The effect of that curvature is dramatic.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.460
In the upper case, the galaxy
appears bigger on the sky,

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.190
so you're gathering more light from it

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.380
so it appears much brighter in the sky

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.890
than in the lower case, where you see

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.400
you're gathering light
from a much smaller cone,

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.040
and so the galaxy is smaller

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.223
on the sky and therefore fainter.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.970
Those two effects can
be tested, of course.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:22.970
Here is Edwin Hubble, left-hand person,

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:28.010
standing in 1931, looking
at the projected design

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.913
for a great new telescope.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.240
He and a few others were convinced

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.230
that it might be possible
to look for this effect

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.170
and to test these ideas about
general relativity theory

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:40.940
and about the expanding universe,

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.840
but it would require a big new telescope.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.403
It was the 200-inch telescope
to be placed on Mount Palomar,

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.653
its installation greatly
delayed by the Second World War.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.470
And I can't just help
but pause to remind you,

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.790
this great telescope is still in operation

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.690
and doing wonderful science.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.980
Show me a particle accelerator

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:08.600
that was designed in
1931 that's still in use.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.565
They're all in the Smithsonian.

00:30:10.565 --> 00:30:13.561
(chuckling)

00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:15.040
(mumbles)

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.259
Allan Sandage.

00:30:17.259 --> 00:30:20.930
1961, the 200-inch has been
completed, commissioned

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:23.090
and is in successful operation.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:26.900
Let us attempt to continue
Hubble's great program,

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.230
let's look at distant galaxies,

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.340
measure how bright they are,
estimate how far away they are,

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.750
look for this brightening or dimming

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.573
due to the curvature of space time.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.890
A bit of data, needn't concern us

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.800
except to point out that
along the vertical axis

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.128
you are looking at the
amount of shift of the light

00:30:45.128 --> 00:30:48.330
due to the expansion of the
universe that I mentioned,

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.360
along the horizontal axis
how bright the galaxy is.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.050
For reasons that are lost
in the mists of time,

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:55.970
bright is over here
and faint is over here.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.170
And the different curves corresponding

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.130
to different hypotheses about
the nature of the universe.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.970
So he made great progress,

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:08.460
but he didn't get any definitive answers.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.090
Here we are in about the present epoch,

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.270
late 1980s, early 1990s.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:19.054
Saul Perlmutter, at the
laboratories just up the hill,

00:31:19.054 --> 00:31:22.200
initiated the Supernova Cosmology Project

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.150
with the idea that instead
of looking at galaxies,

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.390
look at stars that have
exhausted their supply

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:33.350
of nuclear fuel and have
exploded to make a supernova.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.610
Classes of these supernova
have pretty standard

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.070
intrinsic luminosities, and so if you look

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.790
at how bright it is on the sky,

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.100
you can look for these effects
of curvature of space time.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.260
What's pictured here is the debris

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.220
left over after the supernova,

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.370
the material that has
been ejected from it.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:53.310
This is big science, and it required

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.570
lots of work by lots of people.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:59.400
Above is a photograph of Saul's group,

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.120
another group based mainly
in Cambridge, Massachusetts

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:09.120
and in Hawaii, and in
Australia, Siding Springs.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.889
Competed, have joined forces,
they've grown other groups

00:32:13.889 --> 00:32:18.310
and have obtained a bottom line.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:22.770
These measurements require
Einstein's cosmological constant,

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.570
that is to say Lemaitre's dark energy.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.010
Let's not go into the details.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:28.180
There it is.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.380
There was a hypothesis introduced

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.300
and a test, and it worked out.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.987
Now, of course that's only one test,

00:32:34.987 --> 00:32:38.200
and you always have to
be a little bit careful

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.700
about what all of this might mean,

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.680
but I guess I can't resist pointing out

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.130
a wonderful historical situation.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.220
The evidence from these
observations of these supernovae

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.822
by Saul Perlmutter and his
team, Brian Schmidt and his team

00:32:55.822 --> 00:32:59.796
is that the universe
at the present time is,

00:32:59.796 --> 00:33:02.520
the expansion of the universe these days

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.883
is not slowing due to gravity,
but rather speeding up

00:33:05.883 --> 00:33:10.883
due to the repulsive effect
of Lemaitre's dark energy.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.053
That's a remarkable thing.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:21.320
It is just what de Sitter said in 1930.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.330
But of course de Sitter
was talking was talking

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:24.490
about something very different;

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.600
in those days people had the idea

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.690
that originally dark energy
and gravity were in balance,

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:34.260
the balance broke, and the
expansion started accelerating.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.440
The new picture, in the beginning

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.210
the universe was very dense,
gravity was very strong,

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:40.800
but it was expanding very rapidly

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.220
and dark energy had no particular effect.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.730
But as the universe
expanded, gravity grew weaker

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.880
'cause things were moving further apart,

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.120
dark energy started to become important,

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.820
and in this just-so story, gravity is now

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.680
becoming sub-dominant to the
repulsive effect of gravity

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.067
and we have exactly the situation,

00:34:00.067 --> 00:34:02.247
"What makes the universe
expand or swell up?

00:34:02.247 --> 00:34:03.630
"That is the lambda."

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.793
Now, it didn't use to be, but it is now.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.333
Curious how things work out.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.570
Well, we need to check.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:13.050
And we've got a positive check,

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:17.323
but one check often doesn't convince.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.877
Possibly there's some systematic error.

00:34:20.877 --> 00:34:22.730
Let's look around for other checks.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:23.983
Fortunately we have them.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.130
And they deal with the evolution

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.640
of this clustering of
matter which you see here,

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.430
uniform on large scales,
clumping on small scales,

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:38.580
and in particular with the
evolution of this clustering,

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.620
which is here illustrated.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.279
Below, the distribution of galaxies

00:34:43.279 --> 00:34:45.860
in the universe as it is now

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.090
out to a given limiting depth.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:50.380
I should remind you not to look at this S.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.830
That's the disc of our galaxy,

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:57.000
in this projection curved
and distorted greatly.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.760
That disc contains dust, and the dust

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.930
obscures the light from distant galaxies,

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.990
so that's an artifact of where we live.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.000
Here and here we have a good view out

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.320
and you see uniformity on large scales,

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.070
clustering on smaller scales.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.170
Above, the thermal radiation.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.770
I said earlier that we live in a universe

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:17.600
that contains thermal
radiation smoothly distributed.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.560
It's not exactly smoothly distributed.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.570
The temperature varies across the sky

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:24.870
by about a part in a hundred thousand.

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:29.250
Hot and cold spots now
measured and shown above.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.930
This radiation was last
appreciably disturbed

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:35.090
by the irregular mass
distribution, the theory says,

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.083
when the universe was one
thousandth its present size.

00:35:39.072 --> 00:35:41.470
You see therefore that we have a measure

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:45.190
of how clustering has evolved
as the universe has expanded,

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.924
and that measure can be
compared to our hypotheses

00:35:47.924 --> 00:35:51.100
to decide how the universe is behaving

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.980
and whether or not our theories,

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.100
including dark matter and dark energy,

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.710
are on the right track.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.450
Here's an illustration.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:03.450
It's an old one, 1977, we were
still using IBM punch cards,

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.390
but never mind, it tells
in a simple way the story.

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.708
Start with a section of the universe

00:36:09.708 --> 00:36:13.940
that is close to uniform, place
these mass points at random,

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.770
follow the evolution of the universe

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:17.760
as the whole universe
expands and of course

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.350
this section expands,
through an expansion factor

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.210
of eight, I think it was, and then 16.

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.660
You then compare the
distributions of points

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:31.660
at the three times by expanding
this plot to this size

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.610
and shrinking this one to this size,

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:36.610
so you've taken out the general
expansion of the universe

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.250
and you see remaining that the universe

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.313
used to be smooth and is growing clumpy.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.723
The universe is gravitationally unstable.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.980
A further point is
illustrated in the bottom row.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.540
Here the initial conditions are the same

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.840
but the mass of each particle

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.600
is half that in the middle illustration.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.440
You notice the dramatic difference.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.020
The growth of clustering of matter

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.250
depends on the mass of the universe.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:05.356
It's important to notice that small clumps

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:09.150
are still visible because
they happened fast.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.050
In a low-density universe,
the expansion rate

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:15.930
soon becomes large compared
to the effective gravity

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:18.950
and the clustering is turned off.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:23.090
This then is a very important
point to bear in mind.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:25.530
The universe is growing from bad to worse,

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:26.823
but we all observe that.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.390
This evolution of the clustering

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:33.060
depends on the properties of the universe,

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.500
and if we can measure that evolution

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.100
we will have a handle on the
properties of the universe.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.650
So here, this is getting a little turgid.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.520
I've got to make several points.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.040
The first I've already described.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.000
The departures from a uniform
mass distribution grow.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.803
The universe is getting more messy.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.690
Galaxies are not forever,
they didn't exist,

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:56.260
nor did stars, when the
universe was very dense.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.190
They formed as the universe expanded,

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:01.740
cooled, and mass fluctuations grew

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.420
and coalesced into stars and galaxies.

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.120
Second, the rate of this growth depends

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.410
on the properties of the universe,

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.540
things like the mass density,
the dark energy density.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:15.210
Third, in the early universe,

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.150
baryons are ionized by the hot radiation,

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.430
the free electrons scatter the radiation,

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.230
and the result is that baryons

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:24.403
and radiation act like a fluid.

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:27.400
That fluid is squishy.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.750
I at first thought I should bring along

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.440
and example of a squishy
fluid, a bowl of Jell-O.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.754
Would you imagine, please, a
bowl of Jell-O, and shake it.

00:38:36.754 --> 00:38:37.587
What do you see?

00:38:37.587 --> 00:38:39.540
You see oscillations.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.820
These oscillations have
a definite property.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.700
Their wavelengths are fixed
by the size of the bowl.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.980
I was persuaded that Jell-O tends to melt

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.047
and so I shouldn't do that,

00:38:49.047 --> 00:38:52.083
so I have instead brought
along this musical instrument.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.870
Now, this is not gonna be pretty,

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.050
you will understand, but it's
making a very important point.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.950
So I make noise
(whistling)

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.710
and I make a sound.
(whistling)

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.119
I change the boundary condition.

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:09.670
(low whistling)

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.150
I get a different sound.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:12.614
I send in noise.

00:39:12.614 --> 00:39:15.110
(blowing raspberry)
(whistling)

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:18.570
I select out of that noise certain tones.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.844
Mark is looking (laughs)
a little disgusted, but

00:39:20.844 --> 00:39:21.677
(laughing)

00:39:21.677 --> 00:39:24.090
this is good science, you will agree.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:27.080
I am in this device favoring

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.370
some wavelengths and suppressing others.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.870
In the expanding universe,

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.890
there is a similar effect
of boundary conditions.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:37.660
Musicians all understand
boundary conditions.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.510
It's the top and bottom of
the strings of the violin,

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:45.473
it's the organ pipe's length of this sort.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.797
Boundary conditions in the
expanding universe are,

00:39:48.797 --> 00:39:50.560
and the universe started expanding

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.630
from a uniform state,
because it's unstable,

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.130
since it's fairly smooth now,

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:57.610
it had to have been very smooth back then.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.490
Second, when the universe
has expanded and cooled

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:03.940
so the temperature is 3,000
degrees above absolute zero,

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.960
when it was about one
thousandth its present size,

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.800
the baryons, plasma recombined,

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.150
made neutral atoms and
decoupled from the radiation.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.010
So you stop the oscillation.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:19.410
The result is that favored modes grow,

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:21.433
disfavored modes are suppressed.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.360
Here is a photograph of some people

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.560
who figure in all of this.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.670
On the left Bob Dicke, my teacher,

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.490
a great physicist and
deeply admirable person.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.500
On the right a close friend and colleague

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.980
for many years, David Wilkinson.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.460
You'll see some more of him.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:41.370
In the middle, Jer Yu,
my first graduate student

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.100
at Princeton, now high in the ranks

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.153
of the City University of Hong Kong.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.190
Jer Yu and I worked out this rigging

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.470
and the choice of favored
and disfavored modes,

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:57.273
the analog of this musical instrument.

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:01.983
Favored modes, disfavored modes.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.990
The effect of those favored
and disfavored modes

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:08.760
is to make favored and disfavored modes

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.600
of distribution of the thermal radiation.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.431
This is a modern picture,
this is what we now know,

00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:18.360
but we knew then, of
course, that the favored

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.149
and disfavored modes in the
wavelengths for the matter

00:41:21.149 --> 00:41:23.520
make favored and disfavored modes

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.373
for the disturbance of the
distribution of the radiation.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.850
Apparent early on, therefore,
that we'll learn a lot

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:34.270
if we can measure these
modes of oscillation,

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:36.360
and so people started measuring.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.190
Here's David Wilkinson again

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.580
with another friend and colleague,

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.173
Bruce Partridge, on the left.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:45.520
The clipping is from a newspaper.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.010
I do not wish to comment on the caption,

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.970
but I can't resist drawing your attention

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.740
to the handwritten note on the side,

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:56.823
Denver Post, July 24th, 1967.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:58.963
I can't read it.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:01.530
Oh, Harold, of course.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.600
Harold and Thelma Wilkinson

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.360
happened upon this article
at the Brass Lantern Post

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.350
restaurant in Kimball,
Nebraska while traveling.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:14.613
Dave's mum and dad were made proud.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.760
They are setting after the great goal

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.130
of discovering these irregularities

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.500
in the radiation distribution,

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.210
which they'll compare to the theory

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:29.193
and see whether our hypotheses
are in line with reality.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:34.243
Here is David again in the '70s.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.000
I forgot to remind you, now,
notice the width of the tie,

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
okay, this is '60s.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.036
Notice the length of the hair.

00:42:43.036 --> 00:42:44.770
David on the right,
(chuckling)

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:47.140
Peter Saulson, a graduate
student, in the middle,

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.560
and Ed Chang, another
graduate student, on the left,

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.180
and an instrument that would
be taken up in a balloon

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:56.560
to look for this variation
in the temperature

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.030
of the radiation across the sky,

00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:59.859
and it oughta be there and oughta teach us

00:42:59.859 --> 00:43:02.520
about how the universe is behaving.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:07.080
Here is a project report for
a satellite that became COBE.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.370
We mentioned yesterday that this guy

00:43:12.492 --> 00:43:17.492
was project scientist, and he is pictured

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.653
in the next transparency.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.340
This is John Mather; he
received a Nobel Prize

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.220
in physics just a few weeks ago.

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.970
Here is another PI for the experiment

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.140
I'm going to be describing in a moment,

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.170
George Smoot, who you've just seen,

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:40.820
a Nobel Prize in physics
just a few weeks ago.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.860
The third PI, Mike Hauser,
another good friend

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.880
and he deserves a Nobel Prize too

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.050
for magnificent work, but you can't do it,

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.400
can't have them all.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.803
David Wilkinson, Ed Chang you
saw, and a cast of thousands.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.033
Not exactly big science,
but a hardworking group.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.290
And here is an illustration
of the situation

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:05.989
just before the satellite

00:44:05.989 --> 00:44:08.600
that these people built, tested and flew

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.820
and used for observations was launched.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.470
1990, an article by Joe Silk,

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:16.510
who was a professor of astronomy here,

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.870
now the professor of astronomy in Oxford

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:20.900
in England, and I wrote.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.810
You can't read anything on here,

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:25.940
you're just supposed to notice
that it's a pretty full page.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.080
The columns are sets of hypotheses

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.630
about the nature of the universe.

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:32.330
Some have dark matter, some don't.

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.433
The rows are observations,

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.640
and the entries each are grades

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.723
for how well the hypothesis
fits the observation.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.310
The details are of interest

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:49.530
entirely and only to
historians of science.

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:51.740
Some of these things are
woefully misconceived,

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.230
others more or less on the mark, I guess.

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:55.700
But that's not the point.

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.280
We needed the help of the observations

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:02.945
to sort out all of these
possibilities, and we got 'em.

00:45:02.945 --> 00:45:07.880
Upper left, the red symbols
are the COBE results

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.540
for which George Smoot
received a Nobel Prize

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.890
as PI for this marvelous experiment.

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:15.750
Down below, the map showing the variations

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.480
of the temperature across the sky.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.580
You understand the mean
has been subtracted,

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:22.233
these are variations of a
part in a hundred thousand.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.560
You notice to the right,
people had jumped on this

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.180
and were trying very hard to
look at what the anisotropy is,

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.670
the fluctuations across the sky

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:34.060
on smaller scales, without much success.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:35.880
Nothing was believable.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:39.750
You might also be able to see
blue lines running through.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:40.840
Those are different theories

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.050
based on different of the
hypotheses in that last chart.

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:47.400
You can see how good measurements

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.000
are going to straighten this out.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.390
Already COBE pointed us
in the right direction.

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:57.170
The observations by Smoot et
al pointed us in the direction

00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:01.530
of one of those sets of
hypotheses in that last slide,

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:06.530
the now very successful cold
dark matter dark energy theory.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.700
So let us look at the next step.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.810
It's obvious we've got to
do even better than COBE.

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:17.390
You know it can be done, now do it.

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:21.060
This is a proposal for a
next-generation experiment.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:25.190
It was called MAP,
Microwave Anisotropy Probe.

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:29.533
I couldn't resist showing you this memo

00:46:29.533 --> 00:46:34.533
dated 1991, even before
COBE had its first results,

00:46:36.422 --> 00:46:40.060
the result of a proposal
by David Wilkinson

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:45.060
to build a satellite to
do even better than COBE.

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:48.980
Involved in this first project

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.640
were Ed Wollack, then a graduate student,

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.960
Norm Jarosik and Lyman Page,

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.260
then instructors at Princeton
along with David Wilkinson.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.520
They went down to Washington,
D.C. to talk to NASA

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.150
and to Martin Marietta,
one of the Beltway bandits

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:07.370
but an expert on the technology
these people would use.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:10.297
And I just wanted to point
out the opening statement.

00:47:10.297 --> 00:47:12.343
"They seem to like the science."

00:47:12.343 --> 00:47:13.176
(chuckling)

00:47:13.176 --> 00:47:16.033
Oh my god, this is spectacular science.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:19.010
And indeed, people liked it.

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:22.240
The proposal was submitted,
the group formed,

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.203
and here is a group photograph.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.620
David Wilkinson is seated on the far left,

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:33.870
you can see Lyman Page seated
with the Scandinavian sweater,

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:37.550
above to the right Ed Wollack,
whose name you saw earlier.

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:40.860
Norm Jarosik far right, standing,

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:45.860
and others, Licia Verde, now
at University of Pennsylvania,

00:47:46.955 --> 00:47:51.955
Peiris, now at University of
Chicago if I remember right.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.833
And some results.

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:56.540
Just spectacular.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.830
This is, again, the
texture of our universe,

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:01.650
but looked at in a different way,

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:04.345
the results of the disturbance
to this thermal radiation

00:48:04.345 --> 00:48:06.760
by the irregularity in
the mass distribution

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:10.270
back when the density of the
universe was very much higher

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.810
and it was able to
interact with radiation.

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.130
I just can't resist the comparison

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:19.363
between what people were doing
in 1967 and what they got.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.403
There is progress.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:26.683
And an illustration of,

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:31.280
I should have remembered to show you.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.663
You've seen this before.

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.230
And now I wish to boast a bit.

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:39.100
Notice how wonderfully well

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:43.040
the theory follows the measurements.

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.350
Noisy in here.

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:47.142
It even improved since
this transparency was made

00:48:47.142 --> 00:48:52.142
just a year ago, less than a year ago.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.220
But that's okay, it's
spectacular agreement.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.800
I wanted to show you, though,

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.853
an example of yet another test.

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:03.510
Take the theory as it now is assumed to be

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:05.720
and notice that we have this ringing

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.595
that favors discrete modes

00:49:08.595 --> 00:49:12.340
of variation of the mass distribution.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.880
And notice that if those
modes are evenly placed,

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.440
it will have the implication
that there's a correlation

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.250
between the mass fluctuation here

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.290
and a mass fluctuation over here

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:25.400
at a really well defined length,

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.010
about 400 million light years.

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:32.943
Go measure that correlation,
and there it is.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.223
It showed up.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:39.630
I point this to you
only as an illustration

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:44.100
of the situation illustrated
on this exceedingly busy slide.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.830
Now, here's the situation.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:47.410
We have lots of postulates.

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:49.730
In those postulates, for example
that there is dark matter,

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:51.550
we have to say how much?

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:54.810
Dark energy, baryons, how much of each?

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:57.523
Initial conditions, do we
really have them right?

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:01.210
All of these parameters can be adjusted

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:04.020
so as to fit this curve,

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.880
but you don't have
complete freedom to adjust.

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.980
First, you can only
adjust this curve so much

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.854
to fit the observations, and then second,

00:50:09.854 --> 00:50:13.680
we have lots of other
checks on what is going on.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.200
I showed you one.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.250
There's a long list of others.

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:20.773
And the situation now is very
clear and straightforward,

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.380
clear and straightforward.

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.640
We have redundantly and overwhelmingly

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:29.500
tested this set of hypotheses,
this just-so story,

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.160
and it's passed many tests.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.480
We've got to accept,

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.863
this is a good approximation to reality.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.610
No one should ever tell
you that this is reality,

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:40.560
this is the absolute truth,

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.403
but it is a very good approximation.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:46.700
That, of course, is all
we could ever hope to ask.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:50.200
So I'd bring now a summary pair of slides

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.023
just to comment on the
way things have gone.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:58.570
Up above, this dream of testing
ideas of curved space time

00:50:59.772 --> 00:51:04.772
and of the effect in the curved
space time of dark energy.

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:09.980
We have one may say here
three generations illustrated.

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:13.200
First generation, 1930s,

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:17.313
Georges Lemaitre, a wonderful theory.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:21.160
Edwin Hubble, a wonderful telescope

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.393
that may be able to test the theory.

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:28.740
30 years later, in the
early 1960s, Allan Sandage.

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.540
The telescope has been
built, let's use it.

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.370
Let's learn how to measure these galaxies

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:36.720
and make these tests.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.970
Another 30 years after that,

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:42.320
Saul Perlmutter and co-conspirators,

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.440
let's do it even better
by looking at supernovae,

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.040
and at last success.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.780
Through three generations,
one at last succeeded

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.130
in making the measurements.

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.670
These people are tenacious.

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:59.023
They're tough, and they
succeed, sometimes.

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.210
Zwicky.

00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:03.750
He disapproved of many things.

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:05.230
Actually he was always polite to me,

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:07.130
but you had to be careful.

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:08.590
I don't know whether
he would have approved

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:12.220
of the way we are treating his
dark matter, but there it is.

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:16.930
This story would not work
if the dark matter he noted

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:18.010
and if the dark matter

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:21.580
that Vera Rubin saw had not been present.

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.660
Of course you only knew
that the dark matter

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.170
had to be there because of these tests,

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:28.740
including David Wilkinson and the 1967s

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.890
learning how to make these measurements,

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:33.803
this group, and here is George again.

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:35.933
Longer hair there.

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:39.200
- It was different times.
- Different times, yes, yes.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.050
Your tie is gone now.

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:43.230
In fact, you didn't have it there.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:45.480
Made these measurements and showed us

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.973
the way the world really is.

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:50.930
And some more thoughts.

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:53.520
We have open problems.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.054
Although we have brilliant successes

00:52:56.054 --> 00:52:59.100
in checking our ideas about the curvature

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.020
of space time, we have deep problems.

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.800
We needed to postulate dark matter.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.170
We've gotta find it, and
people are working hard on it.

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:10.427
We have this ridiculous dark energy

00:53:10.427 --> 00:53:14.820
that great authorities were
willing to assure you is absurd.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.620
Einstein, Pauli.

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.210
But yet it should be there.

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:23.920
And yes, it should be there,
and my goodness, it's there.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:24.753
But what is it?

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.430
We don't know.

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:30.780
We can only leave it to groups

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:34.920
such as those on the
upper right to find out

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.660
by getting new hints, test new hypotheses

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.573
and finally find some success.

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:44.320
In short, cosmology has
had a brilliant run,

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:46.170
but I think it's by no means over.

00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:49.484
There are lots of open questions
for the next generation.

00:53:49.484 --> 00:53:54.367
Thank you.
(clapping)

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:07.430
- [Audience Member] A
very elementary question,

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:10.933
what is the difference between
dark matter and dark energy?

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:17.133
- It's elementary, but really important.

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.563
Dark matter has no pressure to speak of.

00:54:22.388 --> 00:54:24.793
It's able to cluster very easily.

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:28.030
Dark energy has so much pressure,

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:30.910
it's almost totally
incapable of clustering.

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:33.710
Furthermore, the pressure has
a bad sign, it's negative.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.360
It's material with a
bizarre set of properties.

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.610
It's called dark energy in part

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:42.670
because it just has the properties

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:44.410
you would expect for zero point energy

00:54:44.410 --> 00:54:47.520
from all of the fields
of standard physics,

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.530
except for the wrong value.

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:52.330
It acts like an energy,
but to give it that name

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:55.000
is somewhat misleading; it
suggests we know what it is.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.073
That's quite wrong.

00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.480
Ask the question again
in another generation.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.016
You might get a better answer.

00:55:03.016 --> 00:55:05.349
(chuckling)

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:11.910
- [Audience Member]
Yesterday you suggested

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:14.460
that we should perhaps write
to our congressman or somebody

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:19.460
to support the idea that
basic science is useful,

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.170
and it occurred to me it might be useful

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:24.380
to have a couple of
examples, and maybe more.

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:25.750
I'd like to give two examples

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:28.710
of basic science which have
turned out to be useful.

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:32.120
If you use a GPS system to
drive around in your car,

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.150
it won't work without general
relativity corrections.

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:36.530
I don't remember what the error is,

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:38.330
perhaps someone knows here in the room,

00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:39.580
but it's a big error.

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:42.550
The second example is, if
you go in for what's called

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:44.360
an MRI scanner, they took the nuclear

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.830
out of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:48.660
- Yes.
- And that works

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:52.070
because the nucleus, like a proton,

00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:54.850
is spinning around, has angular momentum

00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:57.360
like a top with a magnet attached.

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.170
And those were basic things
which were discovered

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.730
at the beginning of the last century,

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:04.110
and it took a bit of computers

00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:06.950
to get the magnetic
resonance imaging to work.

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:08.870
What could you withdraw
from your experience,

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:10.590
not necessarily from cosmology,

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:12.800
but what would you emerge for people

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.720
to put in their letters
to the congressman?

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.530
- I'm not sure if I
would put it in a letter

00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:20.670
to the congressman, but
the example I often use,

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:22.660
your examples are excellent.

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.410
I may even steal them.

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:26.700
But the one I use is a cell phone.

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:30.160
Now, I am not at all
convinced that cellphones are

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.280
an entirely unmixed blessing,
(laughing)

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.390
but I am deeply admiring of the fact

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:37.240
that it that little handheld device

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.300
we see evidence of the
ability of engineers

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.530
to control the behavior of molecules

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:45.740
to make that liquid crystal display,

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:48.130
to control crystals and electrons

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:49.710
to move around and do logic

00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:52.563
and to remember my phone
number and dial it,

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:55.220
the ability of electromagnetic fields

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.780
to control molecules and electrons

00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.580
and to send and receive signals.

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:00.763
It's spectacular.

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:06.604
And where would faith-based
science have taken cell phones?

00:57:06.604 --> 00:57:11.104
(laughing)
(clapping)

00:57:13.674 --> 00:57:16.257
(bright music)
