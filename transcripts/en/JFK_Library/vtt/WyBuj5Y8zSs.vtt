00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.870
- President Kennedy's legacy calls us

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.430
to focus on fighting for
the future that can be,

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.070
not holding on to a past that never was.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.880
We know that the towns, the cities,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.780
the counties, the state, the countries

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.720
that wanna attract people, create jobs,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.410
grow wealth, give our kids
a better life than we had

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.060
will be places that are open, inviting,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.530
inclusive, tolerant, entrepreneurial,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.530
creative, healthy, culturally
rich, authentic, and smart.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.610
You see, the future does not belong

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.700
to the place that closes its
door to those seeking refuge.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.390
The future does not belong to a country

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.610
that closes its heart to our
Hispanic brothers and sisters

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.640
who, in New Orleans, helped us rebuild.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.340
The future does not belong to a place

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.370
that bans our Muslim neighbors

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.210
who assert their constitutional rights

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.360
of religious liberty, to
choose his or her faith,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.910
or the country that rejects those

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.080
who have the right to be
free from discrimination

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.860
because of who they choose to love.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.550
The future does not belong to a country

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.046
who closes itself off to
young African American

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:11.660
boys and girls who still feel
left out of the mainstream,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.710
and it certainly does
not belong to a place

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.100
where working-class men
and women in the heartland

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.780
who feel left behind by an
economy that feels rigged

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.330
and rewards only a few, who every day,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.550
fight the temptation
to turn on each other,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.720
because they know in their marrow

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.200
that diversity is this
nation's calling card

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.863
to the cause of freedom and liberty.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.040
This notion is central to
our American aspiration.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.670
It is central to who we are as a people.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.660
And it is why it is so important

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.890
that we have to confront our history.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.630
We cannot change history,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.333
but we can surely, surely learn from it.
