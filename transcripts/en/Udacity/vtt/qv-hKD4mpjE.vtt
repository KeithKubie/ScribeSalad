00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.860
Let's take a look at the kind of tags
that can be handled in Tag Manager.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.427
Click on Tags &gt; New.

00:00:06.427 --> 00:00:11.470
You can use Tag Manager to send events
from your app to Google Analytics,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.300
to Google AdWords, and to doubleclick.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.090
You can also have events by
Function Calls and Custom Image Tags.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.630
And we're going to be focusing on
sending events to Google Analytics.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.410
When you want to send data from your app
to Analytics, you can send your tracking

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.650
data to Tag Manager instead
of directly to Analytics.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.676
Tag Manager will forward
the tracking data to Analytics.

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:41.640
The end result will be the same as
if we'd send it direct to Analytics.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.120
The tracking data shows up in Analytics.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.510
But now, if you want to make changes
to the way the data appears in

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.730
the Analytics dashboard,
you can implement these changes through

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.210
the Tag Manager dashboard instead of
having to code the changes in the app.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.930
While you're testing your app on your
device, right there connected to your

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.080
computer, it seems simple enough to
compile the changes, and re-deploy.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.920
But once your app's in production,
and available on the Play store,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.320
it's easier to change the description
of the data that's collected,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.730
using the Tag Manager UI.
