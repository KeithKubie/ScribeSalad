00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.250
Shane Shifflett: I work for The Bay Citizen.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.000
I work a lot on the news applications,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.042
so things like the Bike Accident Tracker,
the Census data.

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.667
Aurelio Tinio: So, this particular
infographic that we focused on

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:16.000
was about bike accident tracker.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.583
It came about because one of
our beat reporters, Zusha Elinson,

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:21.208
who's focused on transportation,

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:23.792
got this data set from the San Francisco
Police Department,

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:28.125
which had detail on the various
accidents in the past two years

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:29.833
for the City of San Francisco.

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:33.583
And so, this particular use of
Google Maps and Google Fusion Tables

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:36.917
seemed like an easy way to get
something up as soon as possible.

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:42.833
And it provides an easy way to import
a KML file or different data sets

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:46.250
so that you can create maps,
different charts as well.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.250
And so, as of right now, it's already
very integrated as part of our newsroom,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.208
where other reporters are already
comfortable using it on a regular basis.

00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:57.333
And it's a go to solution already.

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.708
Shane Shifflett: People can work
more autonomously.

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:00.333
It's a very easy to use tool.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.792
And I mean it's pretty clear once
they start throwing data in there,

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:05.083
exactly what they can do with it.

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:07.625
And they can start slicing
and dicing and pulling it apart

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.542
and generating ideas for stories 

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:14.292
that maybe it would take a long time
to get those sort of ideas moving

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:17.250
because you have to involve other people
and the staff or something like that.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.292
So, it's really nice in terms of speed
and agility when you're reporting.

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:26.167
And then, in terms of just like
the technology aspect,

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:30.167
it's really nice to not be able to have
to support our own geospatial data sets

00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:34.125
and work with configuring 'em and
optimizing 'em and so on and so forth.

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:38.875
Having Google host all that is just a huge
boon in terms of like productivity.

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:40.208
Aurelio Tinio: We're a limited company.

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:45.500
There's four of us developers and we do
look to other technology companies

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.542
to help put some innovation
into journalism.

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:51.042
And having a data application, 

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:54.667
which was enabled by various technologies,

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:59.417
such as provided by Google,
is what makes my work possible.

00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:01.083
Shane Shifflett: Just the same way
that photography

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.833
is another way of showing the emotion

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:05.708
that people experience 
at important events,

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:11.958
showing data in a way that people
can look at it and really pull it apart

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.833
is another impactful way
of doing journalism.
