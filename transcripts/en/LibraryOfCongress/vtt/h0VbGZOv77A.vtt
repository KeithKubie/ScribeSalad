&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Welcome
everyone.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.870
Good afternoon, hi.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.460
My name is Sasha Dowdy
and I work at the Library

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.040
of Congress Young
Reader's Center.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.430
This is a special place for kids
within the library for kids,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.490
teens and family,
everybody under 16 is welcome

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.220
and we're an awesome place
where you can start finding

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.030
out about the libraries
treasures and exhibits.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.570
All day here at the Library

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.070
of Congress National Book
Festival we're recognizing

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.240
and celebrating the
importance of reading

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.180
and authors and books.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.380
The Library of Congress makes it
seem easy to do this every year.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.580
But the truth is the
National Book Festival is a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.080
huge undertaking.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.720
It's a huge financial
undertaking and it's free

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.330
for everyone because
of the general support,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.340
generous support from our
sponsors and supporters.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.330

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.660
And now on to the main event.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.860
I am here to introduce a
spectacular author Ms. Jewell

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.160
Parker Rhodes.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.470
Ms. Rhodes, yes, please
give it up for her.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.340
[applause] She is a
giant when it comes

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.080
to creativity and
creative writing.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.020
She has a degree in drama
criticism, a Master of Arts

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.040
in English and a Doctor of
Arts in Creative Writing.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.970
And she is the founding
Artistic Director

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.620
of the Virginia G. Piper
Center for Creative Writing

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.780
at Arizona State University.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.700
So when you talk about
Creative Writing,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.920
she knows so much about it.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.380
She's overflowing.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.610
And she's of course an author
of six books for grownups

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.240
and five critically
acclaimed books for kids.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.760
And those are Ninth
Ward, Sugar, Bayou Magic,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.340
Tower's Falling and Ghost Boys.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.650
And Ghost Boys is the book that
we are all here to hear about,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.360
a book about racial
prejudice and the history

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.390
of prejudice towards young
black boys in this country.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.450
It's required reading
and it's something

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.520
that we absolutely need today.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.120
So it is my honor to introduce
Ms. Jewell Parker Rhodes.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.770
[applause]

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.960
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker
Rhodes: Ok thank you,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.520
thank you very much, thank you.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.370
I am so excited to be here.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.400
It's like a dream come true
because all my life I wanted

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.500
to write for you guys.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.600
I wanted to write for youth.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.020
So the fact that I'm doing it
now thrills me beyond measure.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.740
Now I am very proud of my
Louisiana Girl's Trilogy,

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.700
Lanesha in ninth ward
surviving hurricane Katrina.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.300
Sugar in the book, Sugar,
learning that you can be free

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.420
and see the whole wide world
and make friends with everyone.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.920
And then Maddy in Bayou Magic
who has to save the plant life,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.290
the sea life, the animal
life, from the BP oil spill.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.580
I am proud of those
wonderous characters.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.420
But those are stories that I
chose to write for children.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.080
But there were two books
that I was asked to write

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.560
that each time I said nope,
I'm not going to do it.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.180
The first book was
Tower's Falling.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.790
My editor asked me
to write about 911

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.100
so that kids would have a
chance of what it was all about.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.830
And I said no.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.820
But the more I thought about
it, the more I thought that all

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.120
of you who are soon
going to grow up

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.410
and be voting citizens deserve

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.860
to know how our world has
changed, deserve to know

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.080
that we need to have a
country that remains true

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.620
to its democratic values
and that we don't change

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.330
because of tragedy but instead
we grow stronger and better.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.690
Now Tower's Falling
is actually based

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.490
on a real school
in New York, PS146.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.790
And all the teachers there they
actually saw the towers being

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.830
hit by the airplanes.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.360
And the teachers
were so traumatized

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.880
that they swore they would
never, ever teach the story

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.080
of 911 to their students.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.350
So this book was meant to
have them begin the journey.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.610
Can you play it for me please?

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:27.340
[Background Music] It's actually
a mystery story where Deja,

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.230
who is a homeless
African American girl,

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.500
discovers that her father
was a victim of 911.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.240
She doesn't know
that she's homeless

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.160
and that he's sick
because of 911.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.300
She just feels alienated.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.560
But her little brother
says no, we're a family.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.750
We're strong together.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.820
And when she goes to school her
teacher says what are all the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.450
ways in which we're
interconnected?

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.970
Just like you are all
interconnected with your family,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.000
your friends, living in
D.C., going to schools.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.110
And this is my favorite where
Deja says family, friends,

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.510
me, we are all Americans.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.160
Now in school she learns about
how the towers were built.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.980
And she also sees for the
very first time the flames

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.040
on her friend Ben's computer.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.730
And she and Ben decide we're
going to go to the 911 memorial

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.340
and they get on a subway

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.510
and there they see what America
is all about, multiethnic,

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.340
multireligious, multi-diverse
in all kinds of wonderous ways.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.960
And at the memorial they see
the footprints of the towers

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.140
and they can imagine the
absence, the ghost towers.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.880
And at the memorial, which I
hope you all get to go see,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.240
you'll see water falling
down into the footprints,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.730
reaffirming that life
rises, America rises.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.490
And there is my splendid
Deja girl, her friend, Ben,

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.560
her friend, Sabeen and
her teacher Ms. Garcia.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.140
And this is a book that I urge
you all to read and to talk

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.230
to your teachers
and parents about.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.880
So I'm very proud
that I did that book.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.760
And when I got done with this
book my editor said, Jewell,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.640
why don't you write about young
men of color, children younger

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.710
than 18 being killed due
to racism and racial bias?

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.750
What did I say?

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.720
No, no way.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.340
But again I thought about
it and I thought how all

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.000
of you young people are
going to be the change,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.970
that all of you have
an opportunity

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.270
to make the world a better
place where everyone is judged

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.340
by the content of
their character

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.540
and not the color of their skin.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.880
And I remember Emmett
Till being murdered

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.860
when I was just a little girl.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.760
And then I was affected
by the murders

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.240
of Tamir Rice and
Trayvon Martin.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.010
And so I created a
character named Gerome.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:17.210
The novel talks about how
everybody needs their story

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.910
heard, everybody needs
their story felt.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.330
And that we all connect across
time, that all of you are going

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.250
to make the world a better
place for the next generation.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.810
So students, children,
feel your power.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.140
Another part of the novel
is that you can't undo wrong

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.360
so bad things do happen.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.250
So what do we want to do?

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.300
Do our best to make
things right.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.490
Now I want to show you
this wonderous public

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.510
service announcement.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:59.220
[ Truck running ]

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.530
&gt;&gt; Why? [inaudible]

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.940
&gt;&gt; Why?

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:08.760
&gt;&gt; Why are you following me?

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:15.120
&gt;&gt; Why my hoodie make
me look suspicious?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:26.670
&gt;&gt; Why does my music
make me dangerous?

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.160
&gt;&gt; Why are people
that are supposed

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.730
to protect me attacking me?

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.770
&gt;&gt; Why you afraid of me?

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.350
&gt;&gt; Why do you think
I'm dangerous?

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:48.880
&gt;&gt; Why are we afraid of people
who are supposed to protect me?

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.860
&gt;&gt; Why can't I make a peace sign

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.580
without you labeling
it a gang sign?

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:03.420
&gt;&gt; Why does standing your ground
only work when I'm on ground?

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.140
&gt;&gt; Why do you show

stop and frisk me?

&gt;&gt; Why do you have low
expectations for me?

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.140
&gt;&gt; Why can't I run down the
street without causing alarms?

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.440
&gt;&gt; Why do you think I'm a thug?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.740
&gt;&gt; Why do you assume I'm armed?

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.040
&gt;&gt; Why is my mom scared
every time I leave the house?

&gt;&gt; Why are you targeting me?

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.640
&gt;&gt; Why am I a target?

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.940
&gt;&gt; Why?

&gt;&gt; Why?

&gt;&gt; Why?

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.840
&gt;&gt; I know why and
it has to stop.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.140
&gt;&gt; It must stop.

&gt;&gt; I have goals.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.140
&gt;&gt; I can leave the country.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.440
&gt;&gt; I am determined.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.340
&gt;&gt; My life matters.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.640
&gt;&gt; All lives matter.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.940
&gt;&gt; And so did theirs.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.240
[ Sirens ]

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.540
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker Rhodes: Ghost
Boys talks about yes, applaud.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.840
It's beautiful.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.140
[applause] It talks
about bearing witness.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.440
And this filmmaker, Kerry Davis,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.740
is bearing witness how
art can make us understand

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.040
tragedy better.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.340
My novel seeks to help us
understand racial bias better

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.640
so that children can
help be the change.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.940
And in this story there's
a whole crew of ghost boys,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.240
Emmett Till, Trayvon Martin,
Tamir Rice, and the only person

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.710
who can see the ghost boys
is Sarah, the daughter

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.260
of a white police officer.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.770
And Sarah is going to be the
one that helps make the change,

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.610
that helps make the
world a better place.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:31.080
The novel ends with these last
words, Jerome, the ghost boy,

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:37.320
saying, bear witness,
my tale is told.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.810
Wake, only the living can
make the world better.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.980
Live and make it better.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:52.380
Don't let me or anyone
else tell this tale again.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.260
Peace out, ghost boy.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.200
[applause] Thank you,
let's hear some questions.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.200
Yay, thank you.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.770
Now we can go, oops,
oops, I messed it up.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.070
Questions?

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.370
Yes, sir?

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.960
&gt;&gt; What inspired you
to make Ghost Boys?

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.550
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker Rhodes:
You know I am the mother

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:20.460
of a black son and my boy
has the sweetest, warmest,

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.310
most wonderful heart
and personality.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.100
And as he grew older people
would make projections

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.140
of stereotypes upon him.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.590
They would see him
in a negative way.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.040
And it just broke my heart.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.830
And I wanted to make a
book that bore witness

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.620
that nobody should
ever judge anybody

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.040
out of fear, out of prejudice.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.990
And so I'm helping to make
the world better for him.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.360
And I'm hoping you guys will
help make the world better

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.180
for all the world's,
other children of color.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.950
&gt;&gt; Oh and do you remember me

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.760
from the Frederick
Public Library?

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.150
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker
Rhodes: Yes, I do.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.130
I can't see as well because
the light is in my face

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.600
but do you know for the kids
who come to see me it's almost

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.770
as though your images, your
words, become part of my heart.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.500
And it's like I have this idea
that when I maybe dying one day

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.140
that I'm going to call on all
the images of all the children

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.570
that I've ever met and all the
stories they've ever written me

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.860
and hold it and press
it close to my heart.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.160
So thank you.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.650
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker Rhodes:
Can I have a hug later?

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.950
Thank you.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.550
Yes, over here?

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:41.210
&gt;&gt; When you thought of the
idea, how old was your son?

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.810
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker Rhodes:
Well how old was my son?

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.510
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker
Rhodes: My son is,

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.830
I started writing the
book when he was about 25.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.580
And he's now 28.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.770
And actually he's
studying a Master's

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.290
in nursing program in Baltimore.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:01.440
So I'm really, really happy
that he is using his life

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.440
to help people who are ill
and to make a difference.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.060
But we talk about
race and stereotyping.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.160
We talk about how you can make
a difference by making sure

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.720
that you don't become
bitter or so sad.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.590
You have to be triumphant.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.170
You have to live
and make it better

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.290
and believe in that always.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.100
Right on? Right on.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.830
You're so beautiful.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.130
Yes?

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.430
&gt;&gt; Hi, I have two questions.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.730
My first one is

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.030
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker
Rhodes: Is this Mary?

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.330
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.630
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker
Rhodes: Hi, Mary.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.930
&gt;&gt; My first one is
who inspired you

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.230
to be the person you are today?

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.530
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker
Rhodes: My grandmother.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:44.810
My grandmother raised me from
the time I was an infant.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.470
And my grandmother filled me

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.010
with so much love
and so much wisdom.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.620
And she'd say Jewell
everybody in the world is

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.620
as good as anybody else.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.050
We're all a mixed blood stew.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.500
She'd also say Jewell,
child, do good

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.330
and it will fly right
back to you.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:11.280
And she also said Jewell, child,
wear clean underwear always.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.580
[laughter] The grandmother

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.260
on hot summer nights
would tell me stories.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.420
And I think she was
the first storyteller

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.620
that really had an impact on me.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.890
Now my grandmother in those era,

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.390
she never finished
the third grade.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.750
She didn't know how to
read books or write books.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.310
But she worked hard so that
I could become educated

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.480
so that I could read
and write books for you.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.390
But grandmother was the wisest,

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.960
most wonderful woman
I've ever known.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.120
So number two, Mary?

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.020
&gt;&gt; My second question
is why was Sarah able

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.910
to see Jerome instead of Kim?

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.210
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker Rhodes:

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.650
You know the reason why Kim
doesn't need to see Jerome is

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:55.580
that Kim is very much connected
to her grandmother who believes

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.320
in every good goodbye ain't
gone, that African spirits

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.850
and ancestors are
a part of her life.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.380
So Kim knows that
from her grandmother.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.760
She also now has Carlos,
the young Hispanic guy

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.130
who gave Jerome the gun
that caused the incident

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.720
to be misconstrued by
the police officer.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.190
And Carlos has the day
of the dead which is just

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.220
like every goodbye ain't gone.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.620
And he doesn't need
to see Jerome either

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.440
because he knows spirits,
the afterlife, the presence

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.280
of good souls, are
always with us.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.160
But Sarah's tradition,
she didn't have

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.660
that cultural spirit
of tradition.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.030
She was left without it.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:43.610
So Jerome has to teach her, no,
if you live your life believing

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.120
that you can bear witness,
that you can honor the dead,

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.960
you will live a better life.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.670
So she needs to learn that.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.980
And that's a way in which
African American heritage,

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:59.330
Hispanic American heritage, all
infuse her as a young white girl

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.370
to make the world
a better place.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.570
I think that's pretty cool.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:04.870
Don't you, Mary?

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.170
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.470
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker
Rhodes: I do too.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.770
Good.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.370
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker
Rhodes: Thank you.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.670
Yes sir, oh is it sir or a girl?

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.750
I was looking, it's
a girl, I was looking

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.980
at the guy behind you.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:23.600
&gt;&gt; What gave you the
idea to become a writer?

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.760
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker Rhodes: You
know I always wrote stories

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.660
because my grandmother was
always telling me stories.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.140
But it wasn't until I
was a junior in college

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.560
when I saw my first book
written by a black woman author.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.650
And it was like, wow,
black women write books?

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:39.950
I didn't know that.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.280
I didn't know black men wrote
books or the people from Africa

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.870
or Chile or all over
the world wrote books.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:51.930
But once I discovered that,
once I could see my culture

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.690
in a book I switched
my major to English

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.700
and I started writing
seriously and professionally.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.720
And in particular I fell
in love with Louisiana

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.690
which has all kinds
of wonderful ghosts.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:10.550
&gt;&gt; Because I wanted to tell
you that I write books too.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.890
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker Rhodes:
You write books too?

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.670
I am so proud of you.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.820
Never doubt for a moment
that because you're young

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.060
that you can't do great work.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.490
I know a lot of young writers
who have been published.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.790
There's also a market,

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.810
children's market,
for young writers.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.090
And they're also online in
print magazines that look

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.770
for young people's writing.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.030
And with my own kids, they went
to a high school for writing

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.110
and there're actually,
did you know scholarships

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.970
to college for writing stories?

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.100
So you get a teacher, your
parents, or if you ever want

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.530
to you can email me, there
are a lot of opportunities.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.680
So if you want to go out there
and publish a book I'm going

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.270
to be the first one
in line to buy it.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.570
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.870
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker Rhodes: Ok?

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.170
Ok, thank you.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.940
[applause]

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.030
&gt;&gt; What inspired
you to write Sugar?

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.330
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker Rhodes:
Sugar, I have been going

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:12.200
to China every year for about
five years teaching the Chinese

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.360
how to do creative writing.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.030
And a friend of mine sent me a
book saying that in Louisiana

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.410
and Mississippi during
reconstruction they brought

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.840
in Chinese workers to
work the plantations.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.070
So a lot of African Americans
newly free, they went north,

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.960
so they had a labor shortage.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.720
But these Chinese were
treated sometimes as bad

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.900
as if they were slaves.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.360
They were treated
just horrifically.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.520
And so in my story
Sugar is the young woman

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.250
who brings together
the Chinese workers

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.400
with the remaining
African workers.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.990
She also is the one that reaches

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.710
out to the former
master's white son.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.540
And she brings them all
together in a community of love,

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.690
in a community of freedom.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.500
One of the things that I
hadn't really sort of impacted

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.160
or known well was that America
historically has had many

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.390
different times or
different immigrant groups

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.210
at first might have been welcome

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.470
but at other times
was pushed out.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.100
So this enabled me
to tell a story

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.420
where the Chinese
were not allowed

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.590
to become American citizens.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.880
We had the Chinese
Exclusion Act.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.900
And it seemed to me appropriate

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.390
to have a newly freed slave
girl whose filled with the power

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.270
of civil rights wanting
to be there and be friends

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.890
and advocate for
the Chinese as well.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.240
So it was just a happy accident.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.120
Anything else?

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.610
Yes?

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:44.440
&gt;&gt; How old were you when
you started writing?

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.190
&gt;&gt; Jewell Parker Rhodes:
Probably about seven years old.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.830
And during high school
I wrote a lot

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.960
of poetry and it was terrible.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.950
When I was in high school
I had a big afro, this big.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.610
And I used to wear
Dashiki's and love beads

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.260
and write really bad poetry.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.310
It wasn't until I was in
college that I had the chance

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.240
to open a cookbook that told
me about a voodoo queen,

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.020
that told me about the magic
and mystery of New Orleans,

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.560
that I began to just
write from my imagination.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.180
And it's been a lovely
journey ever since.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:22.470
But writing for youth, writing
for you, absolutely the best.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.490
Thank you.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.410
[applause] Any other questions?

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.720
I've got perhaps maybe two
minutes before I say goodbye

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.630
to all of you.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.100
And I want to encourage
all of you young people,

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.360
you know when people say I want
to be a writer, how do I do it?

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.900
Well the very first
thing you do is read

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.720
and read and read some more.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.870
Because as you're reading you're
learning about styles and ideas

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.130
and plots and things
that you like.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.300
And they all go inside you.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.600
And one day when you start

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.780
to write a story you will
actually start drawing

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.760
that out of you.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.330
Secondly, never ever believe

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.520
that your experience
isn't worthy of a book.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.280
Everything about you,
everything you do,

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.540
everything you will do
can be written in a book

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.540
and shared with someone else.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.210
It's an act of love, an
act of communication.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.840
And did you guys know
I'm a grandmother?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.120
I have Claire, Claire
is two years old.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.770
So you know who Claire
is buying books from?

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.250
Maybe all of you guys.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.980
We need you.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.000
We need diverse books.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.150
We need all stories.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:43.990
So grow up, read and write
and make the world better.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.410
Thank you very much.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:46.710
Thank you.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:47.940
