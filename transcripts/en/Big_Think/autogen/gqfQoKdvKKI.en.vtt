principles where we have established
what are the values the main ballast

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380
what are the values the main ballast
 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.240

candidate to read it through carefully
 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.600
candidate to read it through carefully
and then we have a discussion about

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610
and then we have a discussion about
 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.170
and then we have a discussion about
those values and if this value scheme is

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180
those values and if this value scheme is
 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.990
those values and if this value scheme is
fitting with each other then we have the

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000
fitting with each other then we have the
 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.840
fitting with each other then we have the
sound pace for a long term relationship

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850
sound pace for a long term relationship
 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.700
sound pace for a long term relationship
and as those values are being

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710
and as those values are being
 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.640
and as those values are being
incorporated the creating shared value

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650
incorporated the creating shared value
 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.490
incorporated the creating shared value
of sustainability compliance which is

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500
of sustainability compliance which is
 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.670
of sustainability compliance which is

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680
basically our pyramid where compliance
 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.010
basically our pyramid where compliance
is at the base this is a minimum minimum

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020
is at the base this is a minimum minimum
 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.900
is at the base this is a minimum minimum

whatever we are doing the resources we
are using it has to be sustainable in

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280
are using it has to be sustainable in
 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.190
are using it has to be sustainable in
the long term and to top of it the

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200
the long term and to top of it the
 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.840

creating shared value which I just

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850
creating shared value which I just
 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.420
creating shared value which I just
mentioned water nutrition and Rural

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830
Development if this set of values is in
 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.410
Development if this set of values is in
line with the candidates thinking we

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420
line with the candidates thinking we
 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.750
line with the candidates thinking we
have a good fit if it's not in line it's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760
have a good fit if it's not in line it's
 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.700
have a good fit if it's not in line it's
better we don't even start to work

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710
better we don't even start to work
 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.630
better we don't even start to work
together so I think it is very helpful

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
together so I think it is very helpful
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.420
together so I think it is very helpful
that we get a certain type of people who

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430
that we get a certain type of people who
 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.660
that we get a certain type of people who
are joining us and which are then

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670

afterwards willing to stay with us now
 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.510
afterwards willing to stay with us now
one of the reason why the average age of

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
one of the reason why the average age of
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.149

point eight years so I mean an enormous
 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.919
point eight years so I mean an enormous
amount and this is because the values

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929
amount and this is because the values
 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.790
amount and this is because the values
are working well together
