00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.230
- [Instructor] I think we're
ready now to tackle some more

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.650
or even more complicated examples.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.600
So let's draw something crazy here.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.270
So let's see, let me draw a chain,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.010
let me draw it like that.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.480
And so, like we've done
in all of the examples,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.980
you wanna find the longest chain.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.813
We could count from here,

00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:23.050
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.440
or maybe it's one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.480
No, or maybe it's one,
two, three, four, five,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.240
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.890
That is our longest chain.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.260
Let me make that in green.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.943
So our longest chain here is in green.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.440
So this backbone has 10 carbons in it.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.690
The prefix for 10 is dec,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.480
it is a alkane,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.370
since it has all single bonds.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.320
So we can write decane for the backbone.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.910
And then it has a group right here,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.620
it has a group right here.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.250
And this group consists
of one, two carbons

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.610
attached to the backbone.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.550
The prefix for to carbons is eth,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.500
so this is an ethyl group.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.640
The yl is 'cause it's a group

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.320
attached to the main alkane chain.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.033
So we call this ethyl decane.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.750
But we have to specify where
the ethyl group is attached

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.940
and we wanna give it as
low of a number as possible

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.230
so we start counting on
the side closest to it.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.050
So it's one, two, three, four, five.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.320
So this is 5-ethyl decane.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.300
Now let's complicate
this a little bit more.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.703
So let me just copy and paste this.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.010
Copy

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.510
and then paste.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.310
So I have pasted it there.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.880
And let me complicate this
molecule a little bit more.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.060
Let me add another ethyl group to it.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.540
Let me add another ethyl group to it.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.870
So let's say it is,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.270
we have another ethyl group over there.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.720
Now, what is this going to be?

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.070
Well, the longest chain

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.190
is still going to be that thing in green,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.353
so it's still going to be a decane.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.070
It's still going to be a decane.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.550
But now we have two ethyl groups,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.840
one on the five carbon,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.570
one, two, three, four, five,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.140
and then one on the six carbon.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.010
And then one on the six carbon.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.290
So what we write here is,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.170
you might be tempted to write
5-ethyl, 6-ethyl decane,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.410
which really wouldn't be wrong,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.243
but it would just be maybe

00:02:26.243 --> 00:02:28.280
more letters than you wanna write.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.630
Instead, you write,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.490
instead you write,

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.713
five comma six, diethyl,

00:02:35.503 --> 00:02:36.336
diethyl

00:02:39.357 --> 00:02:40.607
diethyl decane.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.920
The five, six tells us the two carbons

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.890
on the main backbone that the
ethyl groups are attached to

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.870
and the di says that we have two ethanes,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.030
two ethyl groups, I should
say, not ethane groups.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.160
Two ethyl groups, one over here,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.570
and one right over here.
