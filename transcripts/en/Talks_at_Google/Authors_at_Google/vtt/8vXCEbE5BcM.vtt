00:00:01.547 --> 00:00:03.880
MALE SPEAKER: I'm delighted
to welcome Professor Richard

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.284
Shell from the Wharton
School of Business

00:00:06.284 --> 00:00:07.950
at the University of
Pennsylvania, which

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.230
is where I graduated from.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.250
And I had the pleasure,
privilege, and honor

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.580
of having professor Shell
as my negotiations professor

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.570
many years back.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.195
And back then, at
the end of the class,

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:21.050
he gave us a little wallet
size card for a negotiations

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.560
framework, and for
all these years

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.940
I've carried the card with me
in my wallet every single day

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.890
and pulled it out
multiple times.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.750
And I've told them that that
framework alone on that card

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.450
has repaid more than the
cost of my MBA education.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.100
Now Professor Shell
has been teaching

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.880
at Wharton for 28
years, and he's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.640
Professor of Legal Studies,
Ethics and Management--

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.910
and negotiations is one of
the things he's famed for,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.380
both as a lecturer,
author and teacher.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.460
But along these 28 years,
he's met many, many students

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.650
like me-- and there's many
of you in the audience--

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.250
and he would have
career discussions,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.810
life discussions with them.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.700
And the thing that
intrigued him-- especially

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.630
in the last few years-- is
how do each of these people

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.450
define success?

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.250
What exactly is success?

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.280
How do we pursue it?

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.210
What price are we
willing to pay?

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390
How do we know when
we've attained it,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.680
and how will we get there?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.840
What is the journey that
takes you to success?

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.400
And that's what led him
to research and write

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.680
this book called "Springboard:
Launching Your Personal Search

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.640
for Success."

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.080
And the word "your"
is key to it,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.880
because when you
read the book you'll

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.300
realize ultimately
what success is,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.970
how you get there is each
person's individual journey.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.337
And this is what Professor Shell
will be talking to us about.

00:01:41.337 --> 00:01:43.420
With that, please help me
welcome Professor Shell.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.054
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.054 --> 00:01:46.762
G. RICHARD SHELL:
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:47.850
Thank you very much.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.520
Thank you.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.635
And thank you for turning out.

00:01:51.635 --> 00:01:53.690
The subject of
success is something

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.510
that I've been
puzzled by, probably

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.630
since I was in mid-college.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.340
And then over the years,
as my life evolves,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.479
it became a period
of crisis to decide

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.800
what that really meant to me.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.540
And then as I joined
the faculty of Wharton,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.215
a period of time when I
could actually reflect on it

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:19.340
and do research on it and
create a course about it.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.450
So I actually have a course
now called "The Success Course"

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.950
that's at Wharton, and
it's a semester-long trip

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.450
that every student gets to take.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.890
And they have to write
a final paper, when

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.170
the final paper of
that course is my--

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.920
and then fill in the year--
2014, the area of success,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.240
and how I plan to achieve it.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.420
And my goal for that
paper is for people

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.450
to read it 10 years after
they graduate, and look back

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.660
and think to themselves
well, that's interesting.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.940
That isn't how it worked at all.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.340
But it gives you not
so much the destination

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.140
that you're going to
travel as the way--

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.270
the beginning of the way--
to think about how you're

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.020
going to assess that journey.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.270
And that's what I want to
talk about for a few minutes

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.530
this afternoon.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.000
You've got a little assessment,
the "Six Lives Exercise."

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.460
And that's something that's
in chapter one of the book,

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.090
and it's the exercise we use
in the first day of that class

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.610
to help people begin to think
about how they're implicitly

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.064
measuring success.

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:20.980
So I'm going to talk for
a bit, and then we're

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.420
going to get-- and see--
what kind of answers

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.150
you gave to this assessment, and
see if there's some differences

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.660
or similarities in the way
Googlers think about success

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.250
when asked to measure it across
their whole life, not just

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.760
a single domain.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.890
So we did that.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.390
And I think the
motivating question here

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.840
is at different stages of
your life-- it's always

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.840
the case, right after you
graduate from college,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.720
that you have to
ask, what's next?

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.510
But it can also be the case
after your MBA program.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.750
You have to ask, what's next?

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.760
Or after you've finished
a project at Google

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.030
and you're given the opportunity
to ask, what's next, or decide

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.779
that it's time to go from
Google to someplace else.

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.320
And then you get to
ask, what's next?

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.590
Or your spouse is relocated,
and so you have to make changes.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.830
Or something happens in your
life that reframes who you are

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.680
and what you're trying
to do, and then you

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.120
have to confront that question.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.110
So it is a question that comes
up multiple times in a life.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.640
And I think that the way I've
tried to organize this book,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.600
and the course that I teach,
is to go to two subjects.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.947
One is, what do you think
the meaning of success

00:04:33.947 --> 00:04:35.890
is for yourself?

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.210
And then, second,
having had some thoughts

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.920
on that subject, what are
the individual capabilities,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.420
talents, passions, experiences
that you can uniquely

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.020
bring to achieving that
definition for yourself?

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.140
Because a lot of how to
succeed books really say

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.710
there's one path for
everybody-- set goals, network.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.310
There's a book for every tool.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.770
But I think it's the
case that each of you

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.710
has vastly different
aptitudes and capabilities,

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.090
and the journey
inside to discover

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.850
how best to achieve your
goals using your own abilities

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.590
is every bit as interesting
as defining the goal itself.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.950
So one motivating
question to think

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.790
about that gives you a sense of
when you're missing something--

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.150
have you ever tried really
hard to achieve something,

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.420
achieved it, and then
fell oddly empty,

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.420
almost a sense of
who was doing that?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.470
Why did I do that?

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.590
I think when you get
that sort of sense,

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.770
you're basically-- it's
a message that you've

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.080
been achieving
someone else's goal.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.650
It was a goal that
you thought you

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.430
were trying to achieve
for your parents.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.138
It was a goal you
thought you were trying

00:05:53.138 --> 00:05:57.380
to achieve to show your brother
or your sister who is the best.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.700
It was a goal that
you wanted to achieve

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.250
to be someone in your
high school class

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.450
or be someone in
your neighborhood.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.740
And so it's very important to
realize, a lot of the goals

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.130
that we implicitly are motivated
by come from outside ourselves.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.580
They are culturally induced,
media induced, family induced.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.130
And one chance to check
on how you're doing,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.940
whether you're moving more
from the outside in or more

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.730
from the inside out, is how
much genuine satisfaction

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.970
are you getting when you
actually get something, achieve

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.960
something, do something that
you've been striving to achieve

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.810
and exerting some
effort on, to the extent

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.760
that the satisfaction is there?

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.200
And it's not just
the satisfaction

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.790
that someone said oh, good job,
but the inner satisfaction.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.260
That's a sign that
you're on a path

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.090
that you've defined
for yourself.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.310
So in a sense you're
looking for other people

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.569
to congratulate you on it.

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:56.860
And when you just are home
at night after achieving it,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.860
you're lying in bed and
you don't really feel it,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.170
then you're-- got a little
work to do would be my advice

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.350
at that point.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.370
So this subject came to
be very important to me

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.100
personally early on.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.910
As I mentioned, my
early 20s was a kind

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.810
of period of crisis for
me, and that gave me

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.520
a sense of how
important this can

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.990
be for someone in their 20s.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.780
I was raised in a
military family.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.650
My dad was a general
in the Marines.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.890
His father was a career
military officer.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.380
My mother's father was a
career military officer.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.570
My sister married a
career military officer.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.630
And so there was
almost no doubt when

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.900
I went to college what
I was going to do.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.310
And I was going to be a
career military officer.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.070
And I never even
gave it much thought.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.790
It was just the path.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.600
So I went to college on a
full military scholarship.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.070
I was all set to go.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.860
Six years after graduation
I'd be either a Marine

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.710
or a naval officer.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.460
That was my only real choice.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.040
And everything
was going on great

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.770
until the sophomore
year in college

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.550
when, without asking
for it, I suddenly

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.500
had to confront
that wake-up call.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.665
And for me, it was an
escalation of the Vietnam War.

00:08:15.665 --> 00:08:18.206
My college years were right in
the middle of the Vietnam War.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:22.830
The Tet Offensive had occurred
during my sophomore year.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.900
Campuses all over
the United States

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:30.220
exploded-- tremendous rethinking
of what that war was about,

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.390
what our role in the world was.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.559
And for me, really for
the first time in my life,

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.770
I was called to
answer the question

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:41.480
what would I be doing
as a military officer

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.860
after graduation?

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.030
And that answer came
back pretty quickly

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.040
that I would be going to
kill Vietnamese people,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.100
with whom I had no quarrel.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.980
And that set me on a different
path to thinking who I was

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.850
and what I ought to be doing.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.670
It took a couple of years
to get on the journey

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.930
that I ended up on.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:10.190
It was difficult, because
I had to make a phone

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.840
call to my father and tell
him that I was dropping

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.550
the military
scholarship and I was

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.590
going to become a war
resistor and a pacifist.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.690
That was a night
that I remember.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:26.240
I had written a little speech to
tell him what I planned to do,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.820
and his response was
very interesting.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.740
After I had read
my little speech,

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:39.100
there was a bit of a silence,
and then he said, are you sure?

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.630
Which was not what I
expected him to say.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.250
And I was of course
completely unsure.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.070
I had no idea that I was
doing the right thing.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.700
You can't walk away
from everything

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.890
your family has
stood for generations

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.480
in a couple of
months and be sure

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.262
that you're doing
the right thing.

00:09:59.262 --> 00:10:00.970
But I had to be sure
with him that night,

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.380
and so I said yes, I'm sure.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:09.050
So that moment, basically,
was the wake-up call for me,

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.370
because up to that point
I'd been on a journey

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.390
that other people had created
for me, and after that point

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.230
I had to create my own.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.880
And I had to create
it from scratch.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.270
I don't recommend that,
because when you go that far

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.640
away from your family values,
your culture, what you've

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.560
been raised in, making
it all up from scratch

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.370
is a very difficult thing.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.600
And in my case, it took
probably about 12 years

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.330
of time between that
moment and then the final

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.220
coming home again and
reuniting with my family

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.140
and embracing them.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.590
We reconciled.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.440
But there were periods when
I wasn't speaking with them.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.610
The introduction of the
book tells a longer story

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.270
about a journey I
took around the world

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.030
to try to sort things out.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:06.130
And suffice it to say that
when you give yourself

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.330
a one-way ticket to
someplace far away,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.510
and you make a pledge to
yourself that you're not

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.970
going to come back
until you figure it out,

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.290
it's a different
kind of trip than one

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:21.980
that you're taking to go see
if you can find the Taj Majal.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.650
For me it was an inward journey.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.480
I spent a lot of time in
monasteries in Sri Lanka

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.220
and in South Korea.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.700
I was even invited to
become a monk in South Korea

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.670
at a Zen monastery, which caused
me to divide the decision.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.270
It was either
meditation hall or home.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.380
And by that time I'd actually
come together with myself

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.330
enough to realize that
I was ready to go home.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.090
And so then I did go
home, and ended up

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.820
living in my parents'
basement for a while

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.040
at ages older than many of you.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.300
So if you're still not
completely sure what

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.800
you want to do, hang in there.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.350
There's hope.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.670
And if you end up living
in your parents' basement,

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.060
that's OK, too.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.560
So I sorted it out.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.010
I went to law school--
started at Wharton in 1986,

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.180
and I've been there ever since.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.860
And I think the reason
that this subject gives me

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.750
such passion is because I
realize that a lot of people

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.200
are unsure about
what they want to do.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.240
But the culture that we're
in, especially the confidence

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.060
culture-- whether it's at
school or at an organization--

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.717
everybody seems to think
they've got it figured out.

00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:33.300
And they look at
other people and they

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.530
go, well, they've all
got it figured out.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.770
So my doubts must
be sort of abnormal,

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.670
and so I'll just sort
of keep them a secret.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.350
And I wrote the book to help
people break the secret.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.880
It's OK not to know.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.380
It's OK to be uncertain.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.250
In fact, that
uncertainty is probably

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.250
the source and the
seed of the best things

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.810
that you will ever do.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.580
And so each chapter has got
assessments in it like the one

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.120
we just did, and
gives you a chance

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.850
to think deeply about your
family, your culture, the place

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:11.360
you want to go, the places
that you have gone and maybe

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.990
didn't quite understand
why you went there.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.710
So that's why the book.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.890
I think it's fair to say that
elite education does very

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.510
little to help people
with this question.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.890
A lot of academic work
is basically analytical.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.120
Even if it's about the
humanities, it's analytical.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.530
And I like to quote
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.830
He had a conversation with his
friend Henry David Thoreau.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.980
Emerson said,
Harvard teaches most

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.520
of the branches of learning.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.660
And his friend Thoreau
said yes, indeed--

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.660
all the branches and
none of the roots.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.560
And I think my work
has been to try

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.380
to-- let's get back
to some of the roots.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.100
Let's get back to some
of the primary ideas,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.880
and let's get back to help
students find their own voice.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.500
A lot of writing in college
is designed to basically teach

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.640
you write in the third
person-- some objective reality

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.370
out there.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.280
But I think it's very
important for people

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.550
to learn to write
in the first person

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.010
and find their voice,
speak from the heart,

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:16.621
In The Iliad, the two teams--
the Trojans and the Greeks--

00:14:16.621 --> 00:14:18.120
have leaders, and
every now and then

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.078
there's a great moment
where one of the leaders

00:14:20.078 --> 00:14:23.090
gives a speech to their
troops to rally them

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.450
to the next battle.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.380
And there's a trope in the
way that Homer wrote it.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.050
And every time one
of the speakers

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.720
begins a speech
to his own people

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.970
he says, hear me, Achaeans.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.230
Hear what my heart has to say.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.150
And I think that
notion that when

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.490
you speak you should speak
what your heart has to say,

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.100
is something that
isn't that easy.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.850
And it's something that
is well worth working on.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.166
So the book is really
designed to help people.

00:14:53.166 --> 00:14:55.290
And the programs we've been
working on at Wharton--

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.290
we have about half
the MBA students now

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.320
are engaged in a voluntary,
eight-week program where they

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.470
learn to talk about
their own goals,

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.970
they use the book
and other readings

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.840
to motivate themselves,
to think about the future

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.550
and themselves in a
more open-minded way.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.220
And we've found that it's
been very, very helpful

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.990
and very powerful for them.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.560
One quick matrix, if you
think about your career--

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.600
just narrowly, not all of
life, but just your career--

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.610
this is an interesting
diagnostic test

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.340
you can take periodically.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.040
If you had achievement on
one side and satisfaction

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.830
on the other, and you had to
put a dot in one of these nine

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.840
cells, where would you put it?

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.020
Now I've done this
exercise with people

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.930
who are senior executives in our
five-week advanced management

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.920
program who are in
their 40s and 50s,

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.030
and you'd be amazed at
people-- even the most

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:58.210
accomplished people, apparently,
in business life-- how often,

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.890
when you get them to be
honest, the dots end up

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.790
pretty high on the
achievement side-- not too

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.370
many people picking low
achievement at the Advanced

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:11.760
Management program at Wharton--
but medium to low sometimes

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.680
on the satisfaction side.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.520
And we create a good
enough learning community

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.600
so that people can
be honest about that.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.450
I'll just share two
quick stories with you.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.200
There was one fellow
who was in a program

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.110
that we were teaching a couple--
about two years ago now,

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.840
and he put his little
dot up there where

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.900
low satisfaction and
high achievement.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.090
He said he was the head
of the North American

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.120
division of a major
Fortune 500 company,

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.610
and had achieved, as he saw it,
far beyond any level of status

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.532
that he ever could have
dreamed of for himself.

00:16:43.532 --> 00:16:45.490
So he put himself in the
high achievement cell.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.210
And I said why low satisfaction?

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.870
And he said well, for the last
three promotions that I've

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.430
gotten, each one has taken
me further and further away

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.200
from what I love to do the most.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.290
And that's a trap
in corporate life.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.700
You get promoted
and then you stop

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.660
doing the thing
that you really love

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.650
to do, and get to do the
things that they'll pay more

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.569
to do and give you a
better title to do,

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.359
but isn't anything
that's feeds your soul.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:15.819
So his particular
passion was logistics,

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.640
which I thought was interesting.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.579
He loved to get
factories to run on time.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.240
He loved to get efficiency done.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.410
And so as he got promoted,
he was more and more

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.230
engaged with corporate
politics and the kind of issues

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.000
that attack you when
you're at the top

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.700
of some large bureaucracy.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.300
So he had a couple
of weeks to think

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.070
about how he could
re-craft his job

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.080
and get himself back closer
to what he really loved to do.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.100
The other person-- there
was two of them-- who

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.150
put his dot in that
cell was 35 years old.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:48.670
He just won an award for
best lawyer in Argentina.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:54.670
He was a top lawyer in Argentina
for his group of lawyers.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.602
And I said, well, that's
great-- that was obviously

00:17:57.602 --> 00:17:58.310
high achievement.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.480
Why low satisfaction?

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.160
He said, well, I hate law.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.630
And so, good to
realize that at 35.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.380
I think his future is bright.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.466
Once you recognize
that you're basically

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:13.840
been getting paid
to do something

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.810
you do well but have
no excitement with.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.330
And that's another trap.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.350
People will pay
you a lot of money

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.220
to do something you're
good at, but that may not

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.592
be the thing that
you love to do.

00:18:25.592 --> 00:18:27.800
And I think you have to have
those three things going

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.570
together if you want to
really begin to get down

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.810
on some real inner
satisfaction, and that

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.520
is something other people
recognize enough to pay you

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.650
for, something you're
good at, and something

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.560
that you're excited about.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.200
So those three things
together I think

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.070
are a pretty good sweet spot.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.670
So when you look at
success you end up

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.700
with two dimensions-- outer
dimension, achievement,

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.840
inner dimension, happiness.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.000
If you ask most
people what success is

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.810
and they haven't
thought about it much,

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.351
they'll answer,
well, it's happiness.

00:18:57.351 --> 00:18:58.490
I want to be happy.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.380
That's successful.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.230
But I want to push
that notion just a bit,

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.360
because it turns out to be
a little more complicated

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.970
than that.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.440
Achievement-- the problem
with measuring success

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.390
and achievement is
it's always relative.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.360
I don't care what
college you went to.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.060
There was probably someone who
got a higher award, a better

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.910
GPA or whatever it was
that you were striving for,

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.390
and so you always
felt that sense

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.140
of pushing yourself
a little bit.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.160
One of my favorite quotes in
the book is from H.L. Mencken:

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.430
Wealth is any
income that is more

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:35.340
than the income of one's
wife's sister's husband.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.970
So if you're measuring
success in money,

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.150
pretty clearly
you're going to find

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.560
people who have more of it.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.230
And I think that's a trap
that people get into.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.110
Hungry ghost-- anybody
here ever studied Buddhism?

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.848
Know what a hungry ghost is?

00:19:52.848 --> 00:19:56.150
[INAUDIBLE] of course has.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.990
A hungry ghost is
a spiritual being

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.740
who was very greedy
and avaricious

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.070
in their regular life.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:09.340
They're reborn as a being with
a body the size of an elephant

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.390
and a head the size of a pin.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.984
And they spend the afterlife
of eternity eating, eating,

00:20:15.984 --> 00:20:18.930
eating, eating and never
feeling the least bit

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.570
satisfied because
they can never fill

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.790
that giant body with
that tiny mouth.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.110
Now hungry ghosts
are all around us.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.890
There are hungry
ghosts for attention

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.660
who can never get
enough attention.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.120
There are hungry
ghosts for status

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.160
who can never get enough power.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.660
There are hungry
ghosts for wealth

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.317
who can never get enough money.

00:20:38.317 --> 00:20:40.900
And every day they wake up, and
their little cup is half empty

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.040
again, and they have to spend
all day getting attention,

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.240
wealth, status, whatever it is
that they feel they're lacking.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.190
And of course that's
sort of a trap.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.830
If you live your life that way
it's a pretty sad circumstance,

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.812
but there are people like that.

00:20:55.812 --> 00:20:57.520
Sometimes you need to
pick the right pond

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.280
if you're going to have a life
that you consider relatively

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.100
achieved.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.880
If you pick only the biggest
ponds with the most competitive

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.280
environment, it's pretty easy
to find yourself discouraged

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.970
and depressed after
a little while.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:12.580
We do that to our
students, of course.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.720
Those of you who
went to Penn-- there

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.100
are a whole group up here--
you probably remember this.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.050
When you are admitted
to a top college,

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.630
they bring you in on
the first day or two,

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.660
and they have everybody
there and they celebrate

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.100
how wonderful you are and
how much you've achieved.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.790
But then they do
a terrible thing.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.870
They say, OK, how many of
you were valedictorians

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.050
of your high school class?

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:34.160
Raise your hand.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.700
And all these hands go up.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.890
And how many of you
got 800 on your SATs?

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:39.570
Hands go up.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.070
There's one in the
back right there.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.030
Yeah.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.880
And as soon as you
look around and realize

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.650
that what got you there won't
get you to the next place,

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.510
it's an upsetting thought,
because what are you

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.250
going to measure success as now?

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.870
And if you haven't done the
work from the inside out,

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.430
if you've only been measuring
it relative to everybody

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:03.000
around you, then you're
going to feel a little lost.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.410
And I think it's fair to say
quite a few students check out

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:07.700
after that first semester.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.520
They realize that
there's something wrong,

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.990
that they can't be the high
school student they were.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.100
Then you find them
skating and not

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.780
really giving it
that much effort

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.760
or self-handicapping
their own performance.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.330
So that could be a trap.

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.440
The OK plateau is
an interesting place

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.750
to be-- not my term,
another author,

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.700
but-- that's sort of a place
where everything's working OK.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.490
The problem with
the OK plateau is

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.510
you have to take a risk
to move in any direction,

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:39.530
and people sometimes get
comfortable on the OK plateau

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.560
and so they stop taking risks.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.610
And once you're
on the OK plateau

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.180
and you stop taking
risks, where do you stay?

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.800
Right there on the OK plateau.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.640
So you need to keep that
quality of energy, excitement,

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.940
willingness to take
risks if you're

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.080
going to really let the
achievement thing work.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.434
And then I think
there's a real trap

00:23:02.434 --> 00:23:04.850
that I think everybody needs
to address on the achievement

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.040
side, and that is
what's your metaphor?

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.970
There's a lot of metaphors
around for success.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.580
The most common one is
this-- success is a ladder.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.370
And of course, the
problem with a latter

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.410
is that you get to
the top and then what?

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.860
You have to have what-- have
another letter, I guess.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.820
But it's a pretty
limiting metaphor.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.860
It's all about status.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.050
It's only about career.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:31.130
It doesn't really give
you much inner energy.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:36.160
One that I like is this--
an image of success

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.420
might be the ripples coming
out from an impact on a pond.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.630
And the question there is
how many people have you

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.420
influenced in a positive way?

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.760
And you measure
success that way,

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.780
rather than according
to some place

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.460
you are on a set of rungs.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.360
But whether you like either one
of those, my challenge to you

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.120
do is if you want to understand
success for yourself,

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.650
you have to understand
your own metaphor.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.410
And so that's a little homework.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.930
How would you conceptualize
success for yourself?

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.610
What image would work for you?

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:10.850
All right-- happiness.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.962
If you're going to say
that success is happiness,

00:24:12.962 --> 00:24:14.420
then you'd better
define happiness.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.810
And many people-- when you
actually scratch them on that--

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.030
don't have a whole
lot of definition.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.440
And I think the danger is if
you just say it's happiness,

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.229
and you don't have a
definition for happiness, then

00:24:26.229 --> 00:24:27.020
what have you done?

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.270
You just shifted an
uncertain word over

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.350
to another uncertain
word, and you really

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.610
haven't gained a
whole lot of insight.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.250
The research on
happiness-- and Penn

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.320
is a great center for
research on happiness.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.010
We have the Positive
Psychology Center,

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.940
and they've done a
lot of work on this.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.020
Basically, there are three ways
that people look at happiness.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.180
One is a lot of
positive mood states.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.590
The problem with that
is we know from research

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.250
that most people have
a genetic set point,

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.950
and they're not
going to go too much

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.120
higher than a standard deviation
above that or below that

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.680
no matter what happens.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.280
And it seems unfair to define
success by just whether you

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.790
got a good happiness
gene or not.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.570
And then, of course,
there's the problem

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.130
Dan Gilbert at Harvard
discovered, which is we're

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.750
terrible predictors
of what's going

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.650
to put us in a
positive mood state.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.112
You can say, well, I'll be
happy when I get married.

00:25:15.112 --> 00:25:16.820
But you have the
wedding, and the wedding

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.778
doesn't make you happy.

00:25:17.778 --> 00:25:18.820
Now what?

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:22.850
You could say, I'd be
miserable if I lost my job.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.170
But then you lose your
job, and actually that's

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.160
the door that opens that gets
you to exactly the thing you

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.120
needed to do, and you're
not at all unhappy about it.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.704
So running your life based
on predictions about what's

00:25:33.704 --> 00:25:35.120
going to make you
happy or unhappy

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.450
turns out to be a
pretty flawed compass.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.950
Retrospective accounts
of your life--

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.640
you're dying, you're on
your death bed, someone says

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.540
were you happy?

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.250
Is that what it's all about?

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.230
You say yes, it was
a successful life.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.749
You say no, it was
an unsuccessful life.

00:25:51.749 --> 00:25:53.290
So what if you get
run over by a car.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.010
You don't have time
for anybody to ask.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:58.350
Does that mean you didn't
really-- doesn't count?

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.430
The problem with
retrospective accounts

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.800
is, I could give you your
favorite flavored cookie

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.300
and you would retrospectively
say you were happier.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.730
I can give you a bitter pill
and retrospectively you say, not

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.490
so happy.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.890
So we can manipulate
your moods about the past

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.000
just like we can manipulate
your moods in the present.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.550
There is a form of
happiness that I

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.970
think is really powerful,
and I would definitely

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.717
associate with the word success.

00:26:24.717 --> 00:26:26.550
There are a lot of
different words for this.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:32.640
Aristotle called it eudaimonia--
flourishing, thriving, joy.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.380
There's a Hebrew term, simcha,
which normally means happiness,

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.510
like you're happy
with your friends.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.130
But a rabbi that
one of my students

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.720
discovered defined it this
way-- simcha, he said,

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.600
is the feeling that
comes when you're

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.104
doing what you should be doing.

00:26:50.104 --> 00:26:51.520
The feeling that
comes when you're

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.440
doing what you should be doing.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.260
Now that might not
be doing something

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.320
that's just a positive
mood state thing.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.750
That could be sitting
with someone who's ill

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.410
or visiting someone
in the hospital

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:08.550
or going out of your way to
perform a favor for a friend

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.030
that's actually
requires some sacrifice.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:18.250
So this simcha idea--
very, very powerful,

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.850
but hard to predict
when you're going

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.840
to get it-- could come as you're
walking across the Googleplex

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.510
just at sunset and something
strikes you about nature;

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:33.700
could come when you're just
about to drift off to sleep

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.600
and you have a
memory of your mother

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.730
or your father that
was a wonderful time.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.260
It's a gift.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.130
Hawthorne once said that
happiness of this kind

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.470
is like a butterfly.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.760
If you try to catch
it, it's hard.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.120
But if you sit still,
sometimes they'll

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.090
come and rest on your shoulder.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.130
So this kind of
happiness is worthy,

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.630
but it may not be
the kind of thing

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.890
you can pursue the way Jefferson
said we should pursue it.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.809
So it's not so simple,
this happiness thing.

00:28:04.809 --> 00:28:06.350
I'll give you one
definition and then

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:09.440
we'll look at your
Six Lives Exercise.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.800
I was at a Wharton seminar on
happiness, as it turns out.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.320
And it was a global study
of economic incomes and well

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:17.960
being.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.630
And there were about
12 of us there,

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.520
and they were doing
a regression analysis

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.353
across all these different
countries and all

00:28:23.353 --> 00:28:24.350
these surveys.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.730
And as the seminar
began, this guy

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.010
walked into the classroom
who was obviously

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:30.110
a member of the public.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.730
He was dressed in a flannel
shirt and a very working man

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:37.050
looking guy, probably
working on a crew outside.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:39.350
And we welcome the
public to our seminars,

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.370
but we always wonder
what they'll say.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.800
So we sort of hold our
breath sometimes when

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.170
someone comes in from the
outside to an academic setting.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.940
So he came down and sat next
to me at the end of the table,

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.630
and I noticed his hands were
working man's hands-- very

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.560
interesting looking guy.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.470
And he listened very politely
to the whole presentation,

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.210
and then there was a
call for questions.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.980
And somebody asked about
the butane dataset,

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.310
and then he raised his hand.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:11.720
He said, excuse me, and the
presenter said, well, yes sir.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.750
He said, I'm just a
member of the public

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.790
and I'm not really an
expert like you are,

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.880
but you're talking
about happiness

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.000
and you're talking about money.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.470
He said, I don't see
really what those two

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.670
things have to do
with each other.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.940
He said, as far as I
can tell, happiness

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.950
is just three things-- good
health, meaningful work,

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.460
and love.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.024
You have that, you're happy.

00:29:41.024 --> 00:29:45.270
And there was this dead silence.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:48.810
And the presenter
said thank you.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.680
And then someone else
asked another question

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.210
about another dataset, and
the conversation went along,

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.350
and he shifted out the back.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.310
So I was sitting there and
I was thinking, my gosh.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:04.540
Wharton has just been visited
by a wise angel who told us

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.730
the meaning of life
and nobody listened.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:09.600
Very interesting.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.370
But the challenge I
would have for you

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.426
is this: the wise
angel-- I ended up

00:30:13.426 --> 00:30:14.550
calling him the wise angel.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.758
I talk about him in the book.

00:30:15.758 --> 00:30:19.020
But the wise angel had to
find happiness for himself.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.570
I don't know that that's the
right definition of happiness.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.740
I think you can still
be happy and your health

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.400
couldn't may be not the best.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.210
You can be happy and have
work that you get a paycheck,

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.170
and you're living
your meaningful life

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.230
outside of work.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.015
You can have-- love
can come and go,

00:30:34.015 --> 00:30:36.140
and I think there are
moments when you can be happy

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.730
as you're searching for love,
even if you haven't found it.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:43.070
But he had an idea for his own
life of what that word meant,

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:44.800
and my challenge to
you is while you're

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.350
looking for the metaphor
for achievement,

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.350
find a definition of happiness
that really sums it up for you.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.640
And don't just
imagine that there's

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.560
some intuitive thing out there.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.370
There's some
concrete things that

00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:00.040
bring you happiness,
whatever you mean by it,

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.420
and I think it's important
to think about those as you

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.140
think about success.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.000
All right.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.400
So now I just want
to quickly give you

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.910
a chance to reveal your
own concepts of success.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.930
We did this little
Six Lives Exercise.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.920
There are six
different people that

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.540
were profiled very
briefly in the story.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.450
I know that we've got
a remote audience.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:24.230
I hope they got a chance
to do this on the website.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.580
But I just want to survey
the number one and number six

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.330
choices for each of these.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:33.444
And let's just see what
came up for people.

00:31:33.444 --> 00:31:35.360
And do we have-- is
someone, you've got a mic?

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:35.859
Excellent.

00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:37.870
So you might have a
chance to comment.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.700
So how many people ranked
the wealthy investor

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.030
as number one, the
number one life?

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:44.910
One, two, three, four.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:45.410
OK.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.280
How many people number six
for the wealthy investor?

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.520
All right, another four.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.510
So maybe you could give
this gentleman the mic here.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.410
You picked the wealthy
investor number one.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:57.850
What was your thought as
you ranked him number one?

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.391
AUDIENCE: I think the idea that
he's taking bets that are big

00:32:00.391 --> 00:32:01.932
and going after
them, and he's having

00:32:01.932 --> 00:32:03.910
an impact on the
world that he defines

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:05.122
in a way that's positive.

00:32:05.122 --> 00:32:07.080
He's got a lot of people
he's interacting with,

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.470
and he's-- seems like he has the
chance to get his opinion out

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.210
there and make an impact
that others respect and are

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:13.752
listening to.

00:32:13.752 --> 00:32:15.418
G. RICHARD SHELL:
[INAUDIBLE] appealing.

00:32:15.418 --> 00:32:17.400
So he seems to be
having a lot of impact

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.360
and he seems to have a lot
of options, a lot of variety

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.320
in that life, and be
very appealing for that.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.400
Who ranked that number six?

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.360
This gentleman here.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.480
You could pass the
mic over to him.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.360
Why last?

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.140
AUDIENCE: He sold his business
and became a libertarian.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.270
He's given everything away.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.850
He doesn't empathize
with people.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.240
He doesn't-- there's
no one there anymore.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.120
He's just got money.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.410
G. RICHARD SHELL: So there is
a sense of everything's alone.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:46.750
There's no marriage partner.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.340
There's no significant other.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.440
He's hang gliding, he's doing
all these individual things,

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.980
but not-- and impacting the
world in a political way,

00:32:54.980 --> 00:33:00.070
but in a political way that's
consistent with 100% autonomy.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.321
So that doesn't appeal to you.

00:33:01.321 --> 00:33:03.736
A lot of people don't pick
that one because there's really

00:33:03.736 --> 00:33:05.580
no family story behind
that one, and there

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:06.970
is for most of the others.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.750
OK-- banker.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.500
Who ranked the
banker number one?

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.520
Banker for number one.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.290
Anybody?

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.420
OK.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.240
I Hold your thought
for just a second.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.980
Banker for number six.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.120
Banker for number six.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.070
OK.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:22.361
What appealed to you
about the banker?

00:33:22.361 --> 00:33:23.860
AUDIENCE: I think
it seemed like she

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.732
has a nice work-life
balance, so she's

00:33:25.732 --> 00:33:27.190
pretty successful
in her work life,

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.540
but she also has a
family-- or a daughter

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.075
that she can
dedicate herself to.

00:33:31.075 --> 00:33:33.450
And she's not married, but
she seems pretty OK with that,

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.646
because she puts her
energy into her daughter.

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:36.520
G. RICHARD SHELL: OK.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.140
So it's a lot of loyalty,
a lot of commitment,

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.500
and definitely another
person in her life

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.110
that's very, very important.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.796
One of the things
that people often

00:33:44.796 --> 00:33:46.170
find appealing
about that life is

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.860
that she's defending
her value of success,

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.560
and her friends are saying
you should abandon it.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.290
We don't think your
life is meaningful.

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:55.350
But her point of
view is, yes it is.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:56.480
It's the life I've chosen.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:56.860
AUDIENCE: Decision.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:57.210
G. RICHARD SHELL: Yeah.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:59.090
And there's a lot of
courage behind that.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.590
OK.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.130
Number six?

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:04.040
AUDIENCE: I think for me
family is extremely important--

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.150
or, sorry, banker.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:10.156
The idea of just having love
in your life is important,

00:34:10.156 --> 00:34:11.530
and having a
daughter is awesome.

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.659
But I think dating other
people or finding love,

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:16.260
and having someone
else define love

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.130
for you is something that
really tears me apart,

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:23.309
and that really is something
that's terrorizing Jane.

00:34:23.309 --> 00:34:25.100
She doesn't date a lot
of different people.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.060
And I think the
other part of it is

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.139
that she has a
daughter who she's

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.460
devoted her entire life to.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.050
But I'm basically assuming that
this daughter may or may not

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.520
appreciate everything
that she does,

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.560
and appreciation is
also huge for me.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.420
And so I feel like when
you devote yourself

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.697
to someone else,
there's never this--

00:34:44.697 --> 00:34:45.780
G. RICHARD SHELL: An echo.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:46.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.949
An echo, essentially.

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:47.330
G. RICHARD SHELL: OK.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.860
AUDIENCE: So those
are my two points.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.068
G. RICHARD SHELL: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:50.068 --> 00:34:54.030
So the fact that there's no
intimate partner in that life

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.370
can very definitely affect
people's sense of happiness

00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:58.230
for that one.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:01.610
And then-- it's a child
with a severe disability.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:04.680
If you don't happen
to have experience

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.910
of such a child
in your own world,

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.140
that feels very
one-sided, and it

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.590
could feel like you're
sort of give, give, give,

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.510
but not a lot of get.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.266
People who know families with
children of that type, who

00:35:16.266 --> 00:35:17.640
have had that kind
of challenges,

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:22.440
often report to me that
that's actually incorrect,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.150
and it's not something
that you miss at all.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.910
It's actually a tremendously
warm sense of reciprocity.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.020
So a lot of what we do
when we pick these lives

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.170
is interpolate
from our experience

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:36.350
into something that's
filling in the blanks.

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:37.310
And so it's incomplete.

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:39.200
But I would point
this out to you--

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.170
your choices are going to
be informed by nothing more

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.070
profound than those implicit
assumptions about what

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.170
will make you happy
or not, and so they're

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:50.650
worth questioning and
looking at carefully.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.360
OK.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.270
Teacher.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.480
Who voted for the
teacher number one?

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.010
Anybody?

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:57.470
We got one-- one, one, two.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.970
OK.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.481
Teacher number six?

00:35:59.481 --> 00:36:01.230
AUDIENCE: So the teacher
to me was the one

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:04.300
who seemed like she was creating
the most personal human value

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.140
for other people.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.960
She was really helping others
grow in a way that would really

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.140
affect their lives more so
than any of the others to me.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.015
G. RICHARD SHELL: OK.

00:36:13.015 --> 00:36:15.350
So that life
definitely has a sense

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:18.720
of that ripple effect,
impacting other people--

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.230
and to excellence, to helping
them become fulfilled.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.670
And that none of the other
lives had quite the same degree

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:26.630
of intimate
connection like that.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:27.600
Why number six?

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.496
Who had six over here?

00:36:29.496 --> 00:36:30.870
AUDIENCE: I put
her as number six

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:34.030
mostly because I
think it's great

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:35.700
if she can impact all
these other lives,

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.491
but if you can't keep
your family together,

00:36:37.491 --> 00:36:42.010
then-- I feel like
the last line there

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:44.110
is just indicative of
much greater problems

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.525
happening at home.

00:36:45.525 --> 00:36:46.262
And so--

00:36:46.262 --> 00:36:48.470
G. RICHARD SHELL: The fact
that she's lost connection

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.350
with one of her
children, it does

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:51.970
affect a lot of
people, who see that

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:55.920
as a huge black hole in
their happiness side,

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.810
and interpret, maybe,
a kind of preoccupation

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.480
with helping others succeed, but
not paying the same attention

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.980
to her own kids, and there's
a price being paid there.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:07.940
I will say this.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:11.000
Again, we interpret these
stories within our own life

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.340
story, and when I ranked the
teacher number one-- of course,

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:20.020
I am a teacher, but I guess
that's-- but I am the child who

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.580
was alienated, but I came home.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.420
And so I know that
story ends well,

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.560
so I don't have as
much fear of it.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:32.450
OK, interesting-- both
valid points of view.

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.900
The nonprofit leader-- number
one for nonprofit leader?

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.630
Got one here.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:37.170
OK.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.450
Number six for nonprofit leader?

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:40.170
OK.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:42.570
AUDIENCE: I like that he's
had multiple experiences

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.290
and has found his
way to happiness.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:48.050
So he started off as an
investment banker or something

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:51.140
and figured out what that
lifestyle was and determined

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.070
for himself that that's
not what he meant.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.560
I also think there's a
financial aspect of that,

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.510
that means he's financially
secure enough to not do that

00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:59.090
anymore.

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:02.640
And third, I guess
he has a strong core

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.490
family, a strong
commitment to his family,

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.656
and is finally getting to
something that he's really

00:38:06.656 --> 00:38:07.380
passionate about.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.046
So I feel like he's
just taken this path

00:38:09.046 --> 00:38:11.740
to figure out what he wants
to do, is in, I assume,

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.870
a comfortable enough
financial situation to do it,

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.690
and is teaching his family
the same kind of values

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:17.770
that he believes in.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:18.270
G. RICHARD SHELL: Interesting.

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.436
So there's a-- you can just
hold that for a second--

00:38:20.436 --> 00:38:22.270
so there's a life
where, essentially,

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.032
the person's already
in the next chapter.

00:38:24.032 --> 00:38:26.490
They're taking the skills that
they learned in chapter one.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.840
They're applying them
differently in chapter two.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.360
The second chapter has
got a little more purpose,

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.359
at a spiritual dimension
or social purpose,

00:38:34.359 --> 00:38:35.900
than the first
chapter does, and that

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.990
seems to be working for them.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:39.220
Why number six?

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:45.060
AUDIENCE: I feel that he
was a nonprofit executive,

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.510
but before that he
was an executive,

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:51.190
had great success from the
outside and realized that.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.316
So for me that was a
failure for him initially.

00:38:54.316 --> 00:38:55.940
He realized that that
was a good thing,

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.940
then he came down to doing
what he thought he liked.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:03.460
But I think that by forcing
his children to go over there,

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.910
he is again making the
same mistake-- that he

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:09.050
did the same mistake in
his own life of choosing

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:12.490
the wrong part, probably
because of outside influence,

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:15.290
and he is making that
influence happen to his kids.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.540
G. RICHARD SHELL: Interesting.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:20.030
So it is often the
case that people

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.380
have this feeling that
he's dragging these five

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:26.490
children to what will be a
family disaster in Africa.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.800
I mean, the movie
begins when they

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.440
get there and doesn't
work out so well.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.960
I think-- I had a very
interesting experience

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.770
with someone who voted number
six for this life in Boston.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.940
I was doing a Boston Club
talk for the Wharton School,

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.880
and a woman ranked this life
number six, and I said why,

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.740
and she said, my parents were
evangelical missionaries,

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.800
and they dragged us
everywhere, and they never

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.030
paid attention to us.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.330
And so, for her,
that fantasy was

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:58.280
realized in not working out.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.020
So for me, I'd moved every
year when I was a kid.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.000
My dad was in the
military, and moving around

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.870
was just sort of normal to me.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.500
So I think kids
sometimes do adjust.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.380
It just depends
on how you see it.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.080
But I think that
inside-outside thing

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.770
was an interesting
comment on that one.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:13.160
So did we get to them all?

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.980
I guess we have the stone mason.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:16.610
And the what?

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:17.780
AUDIENCE: Tennis player?

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.410
G. RICHARD SHELL:
The tennis player.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:19.784
Let's do the tennis
player first.

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:21.950
Quick-- tennis
player number one?

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:22.920
OK.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.650
If we can get the mic back
here to this young lady

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:27.960
in the second from the back row?

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.860
Pass that on back.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.591
And tennis player number six?

00:40:30.591 --> 00:40:31.090
Anybody?

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.230
Tennis player number six?

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.970
OK.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:34.720
AUDIENCE: I think
tennis player number one

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.990
because she had seemed
to achieve success

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:41.540
in the three main areas.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:47.180
She had excelled in an art
or sport-- something where

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.380
she became the top
of her field and had,

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.500
along with that work,
professional success.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.550
She had given back to the
community by doing a non-profit

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:01.240
and she also had succeeded
in having a family.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.500
And I feel like the negative
thing that was mentioned there

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.050
in terms of her family
and work balance

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:12.100
is something that is constantly
a struggle for almost everyone.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:15.250
I don't know when you
would not have that.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:16.756
So yeah, that's
why I ranked her.

00:41:16.756 --> 00:41:17.756
G. RICHARD SHELL: Great.

00:41:17.756 --> 00:41:18.255
OK.

00:41:18.255 --> 00:41:21.780
So a trifecta for
the tennis pro.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.780
Number six?

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.450
AUDIENCE: She describes
her life as a tough life,

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.720
and that just
sounds so sad to me.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.830
For someone to have all of
this and then to describe

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:32.600
their life as tough
is like, wow, you're

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.880
not doing the thing
that you want to do.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.217
And then she goes on
to say that she doesn't

00:41:38.217 --> 00:41:40.050
get to spend as much
time with her children,

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:41.591
and children is
incredibly important.

00:41:41.591 --> 00:41:44.180
The fact that she's adopted
and all those kind of things,

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.640
I feel like she's
doing something

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.620
different than what she
actually wants to do.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.340
G. RICHARD SHELL: Interesting.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.090
So it doesn't sound to you as
much like a life she's chosen.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:54.750
A lot of people see
that life and they

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:57.480
see the father teaching the
child tennis at the age of five

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.850
without a whole lot of
options on the child's side.

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:03.160
And that she's still
executing on the talent

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.700
that she was taught,
but maybe not the talent

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.990
that she would feel
the most agency with.

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:12.150
So that's another
point of view on it.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.750
Now, finally, stone mason.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:15.460
Number one for the stone mason?

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.860
OK.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:17.360
All right.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.580
So hand the mic back to
this young lady back here.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.850
And number six for
the stone mason?

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:24.350
OK.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.210
We've got one in the front.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:25.835
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:27.980
I thought the stone mason
sounded like he had just

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.480
found a lot of meaning
through what he was pursuing,

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:35.350
both from his family and having
this hands-on profession.

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:36.820
And I think-- at
least for me, who

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.970
works in a very
data-driven, totally

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:44.680
not hands-on profession--
that is a very romantic idea,

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.650
to create things
with their hands.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.210
G. RICHARD SHELL:
Very appealing.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:50.190
A lot-- see, the
stone mason actually

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:53.020
gets to touch
everything that he makes

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:56.390
and see the result of everything
he makes, not part of a machine

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:59.130
making a big thing-- someone
making the whole thing.

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:02.350
So the crafts person--
very, very appealing.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:04.620
And of course the family
side of the stone mason story

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.330
is totally integrated, right?

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:07.559
I mean, you've got children.

00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:09.100
He's building homes
for the children,

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.710
and that feels [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:12.100
Well, let me give--
number six is

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.766
going to get a chance
here in the front.

00:43:13.766 --> 00:43:15.870
So that's an appealing
life for that reason.

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:16.892
Why number six?

00:43:16.892 --> 00:43:18.350
AUDIENCE: I think
it was because he

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:20.250
doesn't have a lot
of broad impact.

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:23.380
So I think he's done stuff for
his family, which is awesome,

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.400
but didn't seem
like he had impact

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.026
in his community or
the world at large.

00:43:27.026 --> 00:43:28.983
G. RICHARD SHELL: He's
not even on "Stone Mason

00:43:28.983 --> 00:43:30.911
Weekly" as a cover
story, you know?

00:43:30.911 --> 00:43:31.660
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:32.390
Exactly.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:34.980
And that he had trouble
with money as well.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.570
I think when you
have a larger family

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.210
and having trouble
with money, there

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.655
could be other problems
there that maybe just

00:43:40.655 --> 00:43:41.530
haven't come out yet.

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:41.930
G. RICHARD SHELL: Yeah.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.550
So financial
security is certainly

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:46.370
a value, and something
that most people think

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:48.890
about when they think
about happiness together.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:49.740
You had a comment?

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:53.290
I think, even though he didn't
make the most amount of money

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:56.299
out of everyone on this list,
he had the most amount of pride.

00:43:56.299 --> 00:43:58.840
And I thought that that was the
immediate word that jumped up

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.690
to me after reading this is
it's the most authentic story.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.610
It reminded me of the wise
angel who crashed your meeting.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:07.884
And so that life's about
good health, meaningful work,

00:44:07.884 --> 00:44:10.050
and that's exactly what
this guy's legacy was about.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.008
G. RICHARD SHELL: Yeah.

00:44:11.008 --> 00:44:13.690
So meaningful work is
an interesting concept.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:15.672
My time is up, so I'm
going to wrap it up.

00:44:15.672 --> 00:44:17.130
But I think it's
something-- I have

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.490
a chapter on meaningful work--
and I think you guys at Google

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:24.212
seem to have an elevated
value on the notion

00:44:24.212 --> 00:44:25.670
of meaningful work,
and integration

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:27.809
between work and life.

00:44:27.809 --> 00:44:29.600
Looking just-- I've
never been here before,

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.280
but looking around your campus,
sensing the different things

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.710
that people are valuing it's
just everywhere in evidence--

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:39.360
but I think it's important to
realize that meaningful work is

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.510
not about the work.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:45.620
Meaningful work is about the
meaning you bring to the work.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.290
And there are people
here, I'm sure,

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.860
who are not enjoying
meaningful work,

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.600
but who look like they are.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.270
And the opposite is also true.

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.600
There may be people who
are on the security force

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.910
or helping with valet
parking or doing things

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:01.250
that you think aren't
all that meaningful.

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:04.700
But they may bring
meaning to those jobs

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:08.250
in a way that is
very, very authentic.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:11.490
I like to say that the people
who find meaningful work

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:15.220
are a legion of the
secretly successful.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:17.340
They are not people
that you read about.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.440
They're not people that
you get stories about.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.190
They're people who've found
success for themselves

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:28.030
in the meaning of what they do,
in the relationships they have,

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:30.790
in their ability to
love and be loved.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:37.760
And it's not so clear that the
obvious things that we value

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.790
bring those.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:40.420
I think it's something
that everybody

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.982
brings to the work they do.

00:45:41.982 --> 00:45:43.690
So I'll leave you with
that happy thought

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.337
that you are in control of the
meaning in your work, which

00:45:46.337 --> 00:45:47.920
means you can make
it more meaningful.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.544
But you can also recognize that
what you thought was meaningful

00:45:50.544 --> 00:45:52.500
isn't and make a change.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.000
Thanks very much
for your attention.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.850
[APPLAUSE]
