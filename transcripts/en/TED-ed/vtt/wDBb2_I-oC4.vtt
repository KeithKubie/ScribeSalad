00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:10.718
Why are most manhole covers round?

00:00:10.718 --> 00:00:15.049
Sure, it makes them easy to roll
and slide into place in any alignment

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.785
but there's another more compelling reason

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:23.130
involving a peculiar geometric property
of circles and other shapes.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.859
Imagine a square 
separating two parallel lines.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.905
As it rotates, the lines first push apart,
then come back together.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:33.579
But try this with a circle

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.042
and the lines stay 
exactly the same distance apart,

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:39.037
the diameter of the circle.

00:00:39.037 --> 00:00:41.612
This makes the circle unlike the square,

00:00:41.612 --> 00:00:46.688
a mathematical shape 
called a curve of constant width.

00:00:46.688 --> 00:00:50.220
Another shape with this property
is the Reuleaux triangle.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.309
To create one, 
start with an equilateral triangle,

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.779
then make one of the vertices the center
of a circle that touches the other two.

00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:03.586
Draw two more circles in the same way,
centered on the other two vertices,

00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:07.704
and there it is, in the space 
where they all overlap.

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:11.464
Because Reuleaux triangles can rotate
between parallel lines

00:01:11.464 --> 00:01:13.583
without changing their distance,

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:18.335
they can work as wheels,
provided a little creative engineering.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:23.167
And if you rotate one while rolling
its midpoint in a nearly circular path,

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:28.010
its perimeter traces out a square
with rounded corners,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.512
allowing triangular drill bits
to carve out square holes.

00:01:32.512 --> 00:01:34.986
Any polygon with an odd number of sides

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:38.518
can be used to generate 
a curve of constant width

00:01:38.518 --> 00:01:41.215
using the same method we applied earlier,

00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:44.807
though there are many others
that aren't made in this way.

00:01:44.807 --> 00:01:49.792
For example, if you roll any 
curve of constant width around another,

00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:51.656
you'll make a third one.

00:01:51.656 --> 00:01:55.997
This collection of pointy curves
fascinates mathematicians.

00:01:55.997 --> 00:01:57.827
They've given us Barbier's theorem,

00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:01.230
which says that the perimeter 
of any curve of constant width,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.630
not just a circle,
equals pi times the diameter.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.677
Another theorem tells us that if you had
a bunch of curves of constant width

00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:11.537
with the same width,

00:02:11.537 --> 00:02:13.762
they would all have the same perimeter,

00:02:13.762 --> 00:02:17.646
but the Reuleaux triangle 
would have the smallest area.

00:02:17.646 --> 00:02:20.826
The circle, which is effectively 
a Reuleaux polygon

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:24.356
with an infinite number of sides,
has the largest.

00:02:24.356 --> 00:02:28.795
In three dimensions, we can make 
surfaces of constant width,

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:30.686
like the Reuleaux tetrahedron,

00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:32.715
formed by taking a tetrahedron,

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:37.953
expanding a sphere from each vertex
until it touches the opposite vertices,

00:02:37.953 --> 00:02:42.970
and throwing everything away
except the region where they overlap.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.672
Surfaces of constant width

00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:49.039
maintain a constant distance 
between two parallel planes.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.377
So you could throw a bunch 
of Reuleaux tetrahedra on the floor,

00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:57.614
and slide a board across them
as smoothly as if they were marbles.

00:02:57.614 --> 00:03:00.443
Now back to manhole covers.

00:03:00.443 --> 00:03:02.748
A square manhole cover's short edge

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:07.311
could line up with the wider part 
of the hole and fall right in.

00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:12.105
But a curve of constant width
won't fall in any orientation.

00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:14.803
Usually they're circular, 
but keep your eyes open,

00:03:14.803 --> 00:03:19.073
and you just might come across 
a Reuleaux triangle manhole.
