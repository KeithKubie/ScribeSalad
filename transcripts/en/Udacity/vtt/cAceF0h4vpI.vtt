00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.250
So what are the steps involved
in these types of projects?

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.689
Before you jump in and
write a fancy algorithm,

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.119
you'll want to spend some time
getting familiar with your data.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.300
The process begins with
a question you want to answer or

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.260
a problem you want to solve.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.690
This might be something like,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.290
what are the characteristics of
students who pass their projects?

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.150
Or how can I better stock my store with
the products people most want to buy?

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.860
The next step of the process
is data wrangling and

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.240
this really has two parts,
data acquisition and data cleaning.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.990
First, you need to acquire the data
that you need to answer your question or

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.790
solve your problem.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.410
Then it's time to begin
investigating the data and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.950
cleaning up any problems that you find.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.830
The third phase is data exploration.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.280
During this phase, you spend some
time getting familiar with your data,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.350
building your intuition about it and
finding patterns.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.080
Once you're familiar with your data,
you'll usually want to draw some

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.310
conclusions about it or
maybe make some predictions.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.190
&gt;From one of our examples previously,
Netflix's movie recommendation systems

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.310
needs to predict which
movies its users will like.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.060
Also the Facebook paper we saw concluded
that users are less likely to click

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.680
certain articles, specifically one's
written from a different ideological

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.950
perspective than the user has.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.120
This phase usually involves statistics
or machine learning that are beyond

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.300
the scope of this course, but
there are additional Udacity courses

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.810
you can take on these topics,
if you're interested learning more.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.420
And finally, you'll need to communicate
your findings to other people.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.140
Your findings are only as useful as
your ability to communicate them.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.540
Even if your end goal is to
build some sort of system,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.150
like a movie recommender or
a news feed ranking algorithm,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.060
you'll usually need to share what you've
built and how it works with your team.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.710
There are a variety of formats
this communication can take.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.622
You might write a blog post,
a paper, an email,

00:01:49.622 --> 00:01:56.420
a PowerPoint presentation, or
just have an in-person conversation.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.900
Data visualization is a common
technique that's almost always useful

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.660
when communicating findings about data.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.410
Now, this process doesn't
actually follow a straight line.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.639
Especially the data wrangling phase and
to the data exploration phase

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.660
are very intertwined because you can't
really clean any problems with the data

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.210
before you take a look to
see what problems there are.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.840
And even when you think you're done
wrangling and you're ready to just

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.070
explore, you'll keep finding more
problems and have to go back.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.080
Throughout the process, you may
need to return to your question and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.550
refine it as you become more
familiar with the data set.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.040
And sometimes data acquisition actually
comes before you pose a question.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.760
If a new, exciting data set is released,
you might acquire the data first,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.230
take a look and see what's there, and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.930
then think of some questions
you could answer with the data.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.380
That's what we'll be
doing in this lesson.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.900
However, this should give you an idea of
the high level steps that are involved

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.300
when you're doing data analysis.
