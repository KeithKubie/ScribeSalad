00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:06.816
&gt;&gt;Randy Nelson: One of the
things that we do at Pixar

00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.796
and I know some things
about Pixar uhm..

00:00:09.906 --> 00:00:13.446
is we use improv as a mechanism
of helping with collaboration.

00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:17.716
And in that, two core principles
of improv have always guided us.

00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:21.306
The first is, accept every offer.

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:25.866
So if an improv, improviser
says to you, "Gee it's funny.

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.326
It's raining a lot in here today."

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:28.706
You don't go "Raining in here?"

00:00:28.986 --> 00:00:30.646
You say, "Well that's why
they gave us umbrellas."

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:31.636
It's an offer.

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:32.766
You don't know where it's gonna go.

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:35.836
But the guarantee you have,
is that if you don't accept

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.536
that offer, it goes nowhere.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.406
So you've got a sure thing
on one hand, dead end,

00:00:41.616 --> 00:00:43.006
or you've got a possibility
on the other.

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.316
And the other principle is
make your partner look good.

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:48.196
What a great thing.

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:51.646
So you know on a team, that
anything anybody says to you,

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:53.836
you're gonna get a
chance to plus that.

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:56.536
You're gonna get a chance to
have that be on the table.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:59.466
And they're gonna try and make you
look good, not make you look bad.

00:01:00.106 --> 00:01:02.496
At Pixar, what we mean
by plussing is this.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.016
You take a piece of work.

00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:06.116
You take something that you're
working on collaboratively.

00:01:06.376 --> 00:01:08.696
And when it's given to
you, you don't judge it.

00:01:09.296 --> 00:01:10.906
You don't go, "Ooh
this is pretty good.

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:12.506
Here's what I'm going to
do to make it better."

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:14.636
Or, "This isn't so good, here
is how I'm gonna fix it."

00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:16.756
You say, "Here's where I'm starting.

00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:18.456
What can I do with this?

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:19.746
How do I plus this?

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.936
How do I accept the offer and
make my partner look good?"

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:26.806
So at Pixar, we want people
who are good at something,

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:29.036
not just a little good
at it, really good at it.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.416
And depth is a great thing.

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:33.996
It's in a sense, where
everybody hires.

00:01:33.996 --> 00:01:35.356
It's the resume based hire.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:37.676
You want somebody who
really knows that skill.

00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.526
There's a problem with that.

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:41.776
Most of the interesting
jobs out there fall

00:01:41.776 --> 00:01:43.886
into this category
whether it's true or not,

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:46.716
of being innovative jobs
in innovative companies.

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.866
If you're doing something that's
never been done before or it's hard

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.966
to imagine how you can find
somebody's resume that shows

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:56.346
that they're not only able
to do it, but deep in it.

00:01:56.436 --> 00:01:59.266
NASA had this exact
problem when they wanted

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:01.576
to hire the first man
to walk on the moon.

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:04.216
Should have been a person, okay.

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:05.706
Times are changing.

00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:09.596
So their first search was
this depth based search.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:12.076
And what they found was there
were far too many people

00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:15.126
who were deep, who were very good.

00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:17.806
They couldn't use that as a filter

00:02:17.806 --> 00:02:21.036
and they realized what they
wanted was not merely people

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:23.196
who were successful and in fact maybe

00:02:23.196 --> 00:02:26.666
that was exactly what they couldn't
afford in their depth based search.

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:30.176
They needed to find people
who had failed and recovered.

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:33.756
Those who had failed and hadn't
recovered were not applying.

00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:35.766
They weren't around anymore.

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:37.936
We're talking about test
pilots for the most part.

00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:41.756
So that filters out one group.

00:02:41.756 --> 00:02:41.823
&gt;&gt;Audience: [laughter]

00:02:41.823 --> 00:02:45.956
&gt;&gt;Randy Nelson: So that
ended up being the way

00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:49.956
that the astronaut core was chosen,
was they were looking for people

00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:54.706
who had not simply avoided failure,
but rather those who had seen failure

00:02:54.706 --> 00:02:56.996
and had figured out how
to turn it into something.

00:02:57.366 --> 00:03:01.056
The core skill of innovators is error
recovery, not failure avoidance.

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:05.606
So in the depth based hire, we need
something that allows us to look

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:10.356
across that success in their depth
to see something about their ability

00:03:10.386 --> 00:03:12.526
in terms of resiliency
and adaptability

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:15.606
to actually solve a real problem
that's never been solved before.

00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:17.056
So what do we do?

00:03:17.376 --> 00:03:20.026
Well of course we look at their
depth in terms of their resume.

00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:24.226
But we also try and find some
parallel that's a predictor

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:25.956
of success in that way.

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:28.086
And what we've recognized is,

00:03:28.726 --> 00:03:32.986
mastery in anything is a really
good predictor of mastery

00:03:32.986 --> 00:03:34.046
in the thing you want done.

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:38.216
If you take a young person who
is the best skateboard person

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:40.486
that you've ever seen
or the best glass blower

00:03:40.976 --> 00:03:44.606
or really good playing spoons,
you're going to find something

00:03:44.606 --> 00:03:47.416
about that personality
if they're truly a master

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:51.636
that has set their mind in a way
that you can use in your enterprise,

00:03:51.636 --> 00:03:54.486
whether you're an educator
or a business person or both.

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:59.966
That sense of I'm gonna get to the
top of that mountain, separates them

00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:02.456
from all of the other
candidates almost instantly.

00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:07.026
And you know, in the high pace of
what we do in school and in business,

00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:10.306
there's very little chance that
someone's going to achieve mastery

00:04:10.306 --> 00:04:14.546
on the job if they didn't get there
before coming to your workplace.

00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:18.126
So you got to have it in
the can, not just I wanna

00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:20.386
or I wish I or maybe I could.

00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:21.706
But I've done that.

00:04:22.516 --> 00:04:25.696
It's one of the great things
about the proof of a portfolio

00:04:25.886 --> 00:04:27.776
versus the promise of a resume.

00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:28.846
That's one.

00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:30.366
Two, breadth.

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:33.006
Oh my gosh, we certainly
don't want one trick ponies.

00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:34.866
We certainly don't want narrowness

00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:37.946
that can sometimes be the
thing that you get with depth.

00:04:37.946 --> 00:04:42.166
What we've gotta find, is
people who are extremely broad.

00:04:42.576 --> 00:04:46.306
And the predictor there, we want
somebody who is more interested

00:04:46.446 --> 00:04:47.426
than they are interesting.

00:04:48.286 --> 00:04:51.066
Yeah, anybody can have a pink
Mohawk and enough piercings

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:53.496
so that wind blows, you whistle
without pursing your lips.

00:04:53.496 --> 00:04:55.316
&gt;&gt;Audience: [laughter]

00:04:55.316 --> 00:04:57.196
&gt;&gt;Randy Nelson: That's
interesting and that's easy to get.

00:04:57.486 --> 00:04:58.956
Interested is tough.

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:02.146
That's a real skill and I'm
sure all of you have that sense,

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:05.776
somebody in your life who you just
always think of when you think,

00:05:05.956 --> 00:05:07.476
that's the person I want to talk to.

00:05:07.696 --> 00:05:09.546
Why? Because they're so bright?

00:05:09.636 --> 00:05:10.436
Yeah they're bright.

00:05:10.436 --> 00:05:13.056
But what they do is they amplify me.

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:14.286
They give me what I need.

00:05:14.546 --> 00:05:16.636
I say, I've got a problem
and they lean in.

00:05:17.956 --> 00:05:19.556
They don't say, "Oh
yeah, I got problems too.

00:05:19.926 --> 00:05:21.856
I bet my problems are more
interesting than your problems."

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.726
No. They want to know
what you want to know.

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:26.836
They want to know what's
bothering you.

00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:33.756
That notion of breadth also leads to
point number three, communication.

00:05:34.286 --> 00:05:37.136
Depth, breadth, communication.

00:05:37.846 --> 00:05:40.466
Communication involves translation.

00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:44.796
If you are a technician and you're
trying to speak to an artist,

00:05:45.286 --> 00:05:48.946
if you just emit tech, well we
all know what happens, you know.

00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:51.556
There's a lot of eye-rolling and then
we'll try and figure it out later,

00:05:51.556 --> 00:05:52.656
get somebody to translate that.

00:05:52.656 --> 00:05:55.596
If you know enough art as
a technician to be able

00:05:55.596 --> 00:05:58.816
to do the translation at the
sending in, so it doesn't have

00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:00.416
to be translated at
the receiving end,

00:06:00.706 --> 00:06:02.766
you may actually be communicating.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.326
Communication isn't something
that the emitter can measure.

00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:08.496
I can't say I'm communicating well.

00:06:08.946 --> 00:06:10.086
They turn the mic on.

00:06:10.086 --> 00:06:12.776
I think you can hear me.

00:06:12.776 --> 00:06:14.366
But you can say, I understand.

00:06:15.176 --> 00:06:18.426
So nobody can declare
themselves as being articulate,

00:06:18.426 --> 00:06:20.356
but a listener can say,
I think I got that.

00:06:20.456 --> 00:06:21.296
I understand what you mean.

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:26.156
So people who are interested
are much more willing to work

00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:29.776
on the communication as a
destination, not as a source.

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:33.326
And breadth, a broad range
of experience in the world,

00:06:33.486 --> 00:06:34.616
is the thing that fuels that.

00:06:35.446 --> 00:06:38.906
If I've studied art, even though
I am primarily a programmer,

00:06:39.336 --> 00:06:40.546
I've got an edge.

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:44.976
I'm gonna be able much more readily,
to be able to talk to the artist

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:46.466
and understand what their issues are.

00:06:46.846 --> 00:06:51.616
And out of that naturally comes
a rekindling of my interest

00:06:51.696 --> 00:06:55.446
in the things that they're passionate
about, depth, breadth, communication.

00:06:55.786 --> 00:06:58.536
The most important of these
four, is collaboration.

00:06:59.216 --> 00:07:01.936
People always say, yeah
collaboration is a great thing.

00:07:01.936 --> 00:07:03.576
We want lots of that stuff.

00:07:03.576 --> 00:07:04.516
Well what do you mean by that?

00:07:05.326 --> 00:07:09.446
Well it's a really
cooperative kind of a thing.

00:07:10.136 --> 00:07:11.676
Well what's the difference?

00:07:11.986 --> 00:07:15.796
Well it's like cooperation on
steroids, that's collaboration.

00:07:16.006 --> 00:07:16.866
It's really, really.

00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:18.826
Now they've got to
mean different things.

00:07:19.026 --> 00:07:23.016
Cooperation for us at Pixar is
that thing that is a definition

00:07:23.016 --> 00:07:26.416
of a protocol that allows you
not to get in each other's way.

00:07:26.636 --> 00:07:29.736
Think of an assembly line as the
quintessential cooperative activity.

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:33.556
The guy that puts the fender on at
Station 1, has to do a good job.

00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:36.246
And the lady that puts the
headlight on in Station 2,

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:39.036
well the guy's job
on Station 1 matters.

00:07:39.556 --> 00:07:42.976
But in a sense, a cooperative
enterprise could in some way be done

00:07:43.176 --> 00:07:46.266
as long as you had enough time or
other resources, by a single person.

00:07:47.016 --> 00:07:50.086
I put the fender on and then I walk
down here and I put the headlight on.

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:52.376
There's nothing about
the way job one is done

00:07:52.846 --> 00:07:55.106
that makes the person
doing job two better.

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:58.426
They can prevent job two from being
done as well as it could be done,

00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:01.936
but there's nothing in the
process that's optimizing that.

00:08:02.606 --> 00:08:04.346
Collaboration has to
mean something different.

00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:06.866
It can't be a synonym
for cooperation.

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:09.756
Collaboration for Pixar
means amplification.

00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:13.316
The amplification you get by
connecting up a bunch of human beings

00:08:13.836 --> 00:08:16.516
who are listening to each
other, interested in each other,

00:08:16.516 --> 00:08:18.886
bring separate depth to the problem,

00:08:19.236 --> 00:08:22.326
bring breadth that gives them
interest in the entire solution,

00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:26.506
allows them to communicate on
multiple different levels, verbally,

00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:32.096
in writing, in feeling, in acting, in
pictures; and in all of those ways,

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:36.266
finding the most articulate way
to get a high fidelity notion

00:08:36.426 --> 00:08:38.156
across to a broad range of people

00:08:38.416 --> 00:08:40.566
so they can each pull
on the right lever.

00:08:40.736 --> 00:08:43.026
And the most amazing
things about school,

00:08:43.406 --> 00:08:46.216
is that we have this
untapped resource in a sense.

00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:48.126
Our students are the solution.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:49.566
They're also the problem.

00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:54.386
But there is an opportunity there
if we can find ways of invigorating

00:08:54.386 --> 00:08:56.216
that leadership on our campuses,

00:08:56.766 --> 00:09:00.156
that some of the problems
may get well on their own.

00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:02.676
And then we can focus on
those things that you know are

00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:04.806
on the table, that
you have to handle.

00:09:06.406 --> 00:09:08.546
