00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:01.878
- [Voiceover] We're now
ready to start the study

00:00:01.878 --> 00:00:04.734
of circuit analysis and to design circuits

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:06.755
and analyze circuits, one
of the things we need to do

00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:08.983
is have something to build circuits with

00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:10.957
and that's what we're gonna
talk about in this video.

00:00:10.957 --> 00:00:14.138
The idea is we're gonna
have three circuit elements.

00:00:14.138 --> 00:00:16.344
These circuit elements
are called resistor,

00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:22.458
capacitor,

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.369
i-tor,

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.713
and inductor.

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:40.050
Okay, these are the three passive

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.592
or two-element components

00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:44.592
or circuit elements that
we're gonna use to design

00:00:44.592 --> 00:00:46.647
a lot of different kinds of circuits.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:49.874
First, I want to introduce a
symbol for each one of these

00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:52.707
so we can talk about it
and making drawings of it

00:00:52.707 --> 00:00:54.854
and first is gonna be the resistor.

00:00:57.614 --> 00:00:59.131
Resistor symbol looks like this.

00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:01.604
It's a zigzag line like that

00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:05.284
representing current going
through and being resisted

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:06.771
having to do some work.

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:09.372
Another symbol for
resistor looks like this

00:01:09.372 --> 00:01:11.101
used in other parts of the world

00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:13.121
besides the United States and Japan.

00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:14.700
That's what a resistor looks like

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.080
and the symbol we use is R.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.739
Now for the capacitor,

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:22.502
capacitor symbol is
actually a capacitor's built

00:01:22.502 --> 00:01:25.884
from two conductors or metal objects

00:01:25.884 --> 00:01:27.589
that are placed close together

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:30.145
and most capacitors sort of look like that

00:01:30.145 --> 00:01:31.782
when they're actually built

00:01:31.782 --> 00:01:34.230
and the symbol for capacitor is a C.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.309
And finally for the inductor,

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.175
we'll do inductors like this.

00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:42.809
An inductor is actually
built from a coil of wire

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:44.702
and so when we draw an inductor symbol,

00:01:44.702 --> 00:01:48.009
we draw a little coil of wire like that

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.143
and the symbol is L which is a little odd.

00:01:52.143 --> 00:01:55.267
It could be called i but the symbol for i

00:01:55.267 --> 00:01:57.670
was already taken by current

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.770
which is from the French for intensity

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.732
and we couldn't use C for current

00:02:02.732 --> 00:02:05.053
because the C is used here

00:02:05.053 --> 00:02:07.898
so it's a little quirk
of our nomenclature.

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:08.741
All right.

00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:12.827
Each of these components has an equation

00:02:12.827 --> 00:02:13.919
that goes along with it

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.264
that relates the voltage to the current.

00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:17.506
Now, I'm gonna go back here.

00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:19.990
I'm gonna label the voltages
and currents on here

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.990
in a very important convention
for drawing circuits.

00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:26.411
Let's do that.

00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:28.989
When we talk about the
voltage on a component,

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.111
we can label it however
we want, plus-minus V,

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:37.105
and we draw the current going in.

00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:39.043
I'll just label a little i there

00:02:39.043 --> 00:02:40.634
and we'll do it on all these.

00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:43.851
The current goes into
the positive terminal.

00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:49.711
The current goes into
the positive terminal

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.777
so that's a V on the capacitor

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:56.433
and finally,

00:03:01.323 --> 00:03:02.987
and the current goes in

00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:05.448
and we're gonna be very
consistent about this

00:03:05.448 --> 00:03:07.723
and that's gonna keep
us from making mistakes.

00:03:07.723 --> 00:03:09.941
All right, so let's go
back to our resistor

00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:11.822
and we're gonna do the
equation for a resistor.

00:03:11.822 --> 00:03:15.432
What is the I-V equation for a resistor?

00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:18.509
I-V equation means what
relates current to voltage

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.911
and for a resistor, it's V

00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:26.211
equals i times R

00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:29.604
so the voltage across the resistor

00:03:29.604 --> 00:03:33.795
is equal to the current
through the resistor

00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:37.313
times this constant of proportionality

00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:38.872
that we call the resistance.

00:03:38.872 --> 00:03:40.659
This has a very important name.

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.512
This is called Ohm's law

00:03:45.512 --> 00:03:47.683
and you're gonna use this a lot

00:03:49.123 --> 00:03:51.198
so that's Ohm's law right there.

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.404
This is Ohm's law.

00:03:56.394 --> 00:03:59.622
Now for the IV relationship
for the capacitor,

00:03:59.622 --> 00:04:02.127
the capacitor has that
property that the current

00:04:02.127 --> 00:04:06.388
through the capacitor is
proportional to the rate of change

00:04:06.388 --> 00:04:09.348
of the voltage, not to the
voltage but to the rate of change

00:04:09.348 --> 00:04:14.348
of the voltage and the way we
write that is current equals,

00:04:15.827 --> 00:04:18.441
C is the proportionality constant,

00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:22.087
and we write dv, dt

00:04:23.616 --> 00:04:25.583
so this is the rate of change of voltage

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:27.243
with respect to time.

00:04:27.243 --> 00:04:29.681
We multiply that by this
property of this device

00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:33.745
called capacitance and
that gives us the current.

00:04:33.745 --> 00:04:35.882
This doesn't have a special name

00:04:35.882 --> 00:04:38.900
but I'm gonna refer to it
as the capacitor equation

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.689
so now we have two equations.

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.290
Let's do the third equation
which is for the inductor.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.657
The inductor has the property
very similar to the capacitor.

00:04:47.657 --> 00:04:50.570
It has the property
that the voltage across

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.179
is proportional to the time
rate of change of the current

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:57.119
flowing through the inductor

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:00.462
so this is a similar but opposite
of how a capacitor works.

00:05:00.462 --> 00:05:04.583
The voltage is proportional
to the time rate of change

00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:06.882
of current and the way we write that

00:05:06.882 --> 00:05:11.192
is voltage equals L,

00:05:12.502 --> 00:05:16.190
di, dt.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.736
The voltage is proportional.

00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:24.371
The proportionality
constant is the inductants.

00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:26.392
The inductance of the inductor

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:30.409
and this is the time rate
of change of voltage,

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:34.480
OH sorry, the time rate
of change of current

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.721
flowing through the inductor

00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:39.487
so this gives us our three equations.

00:05:39.487 --> 00:05:40.624
Here they are.

00:05:40.624 --> 00:05:42.307
These are three element equations

00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:45.686
and we're gonna use these all the time,

00:05:45.686 --> 00:05:47.788
right there, those three equations.

00:05:49.108 --> 00:05:50.381
One final point I wanna make

00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:53.760
is for both these equations of components,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.336
these are ideal, ideal components.

00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:05.800
That means these things are
mathematical perfect things

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.554
that we have in our minds
that we're gonna try to build

00:06:08.554 --> 00:06:10.853
in the real world but we'll come close.

00:06:10.853 --> 00:06:12.131
We'll come very close.

00:06:12.131 --> 00:06:14.267
We now have a wonderful set of equations:

00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:16.148
V equals iR,

00:06:16.148 --> 00:06:18.365
i equals C, dv, dt.

00:06:18.365 --> 00:06:21.071
v equals L, di, dt.

00:06:21.071 --> 00:06:23.334
These are gonna be like
poetry for you pretty soon

00:06:23.334 --> 00:06:26.109
and these ideal equations will produce

00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:28.628
all kinds of really cool circuits for us.
