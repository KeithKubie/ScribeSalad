00:00:00.491 --> 00:00:01.507
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.507 --> 00:00:04.189
So if you've ever written
a list of items or actions

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:06.720
you know that we use commas
to separate the elements

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.805
of that list.

00:00:07.805 --> 00:00:11.250
Sometimes, though, our
lists get a bit complicated

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.553
and we have something
called a complex list.

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:15.354
And when that's the
case instead of commas,

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:17.415
we use semicolons.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:19.174
Let's look at an example.

00:00:19.174 --> 00:00:21.775
I've lived in quite a few
places across the country,

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:24.200
so if I want to list a
few of them I can say

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.083
"I've lived in New York, New York;

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:29.433
"San Francisco, California;

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:31.608
"and Knoxville, Tennessee."

00:00:31.608 --> 00:00:32.990
The items in this list are

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.453
New York, New York;

00:00:34.453 --> 00:00:35.394
San Francisco, California;

00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:36.993
and Knoxville, Tennessee.

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:39.785
You can see that they're
separated with these semicolons.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:42.893
What makes this list complex
is the fact that all of the

00:00:42.893 --> 00:00:45.627
items in it have commas in them.

00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:48.066
Cities and states need to
be separated with commas,

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.725
so if our list had commas
in it as well, that would

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:52.229
get kind of confusing.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:53.622
It would end up looking like

00:00:53.622 --> 00:00:55.306
"New York comma New York comma

00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:57.214
"San Francisco comma California comma

00:00:57.214 --> 00:00:59.208
"and Knoxville comma Tennessee."

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:02.297
This has a pretty high chance
of being misunderstood.

00:01:02.297 --> 00:01:04.551
It could look like I'm
saying I lived in New York,

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:07.801
a place called New York, San Francisco,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.417
just California in general,

00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:12.069
and Knoxville, Tennessee.

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:14.885
That's just a lot of
commas and a lot of chances

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:16.612
for misinterpretation.

00:01:16.612 --> 00:01:18.730
So this is not what we want.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.293
Another sort of complex
list is when we have a list

00:01:21.293 --> 00:01:23.337
inside of another list.

00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:26.872
This looks something like
"I need to buy a textbook,

00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:29.899
"a workbook, and a dictionary for Spanish;

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.982
"a calculator for math;
and a map for geography."

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.665
Because we have semicolons
here separating elements

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:39.348
of the list instead of
commas, we can tell that

00:01:39.348 --> 00:01:42.092
the textbook, the workbook,
and the dictionary are

00:01:42.092 --> 00:01:44.226
all for Spanish class.

00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:47.030
To get the same information
across without using semicolons

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.087
we'd have to say something
like "I need to buy a textbook

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:53.369
"for Spanish comma a
workbook for Spanish comma

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.180
"a dictionary for Spanish
comma a calculator for math

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.155
"comma and a map for geography."

00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:02.074
That sentence is way
longer than it needs to be.

00:02:02.074 --> 00:02:04.442
We can condense it down to
this much shorter sentence here

00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:07.693
by using semicolons in the place
of the regular list commas.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:10.773
Because the semicolon is playing
a special role in the case

00:02:10.773 --> 00:02:13.971
of the complex list,
sometimes it's referred to as

00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:15.879
a super-comma.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.136
It's essentially acting
as a comma, but removing

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:20.328
some of the confusion
that might occur if we had

00:02:20.328 --> 00:02:22.861
so many commas in one sentence.

00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:25.021
That's semicolons in complex lists.

00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:27.482
When we have a list
inside of another list,

00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:30.623
or elements in a list that
already have commas in them,

00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:33.415
we use semicolons to
separate all the elements

00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:35.914
to make sure the sentence is extra clear.

00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:37.267
You can learn anything.

00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:38.100
Paige out.
