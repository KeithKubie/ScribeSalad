00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.260
In this class, we'll cover
these examples and many more.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.110
Each week will be composed of
two lectures, a recitation,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.960
and homework assignments.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.900
Each lecture is focused on a
different real-world example.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.340
We will teach analytics methods
in the statistical software

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.230
R. In the recitations,
we will present

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.160
another example of the
methodology and more practice

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.720
in R. In a homework
assignment, we'll

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.720
provide additional
problems and datasets.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.180
Midway through
the class, we will

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.240
run an analytics competition.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.510
We'll challenge you
to build a model

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.080
and get the best
accuracy possible.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.870
At the end of the
class, we'll test you

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.730
on all of the methods used.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.970
The questions will be
real-world problems.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.950
Let me comment on the
overall goal of the class.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.720
This class aims to make you
comfortable using analytics

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.050
in your career and your life.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.660
You will know how to
work with real data,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.310
and will have learned many
different methodologies,

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.970
and how to use them using
R. In the end of the day,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.820
we want to convince you
that analytics provides

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.360
an edge to your
career and your life.
