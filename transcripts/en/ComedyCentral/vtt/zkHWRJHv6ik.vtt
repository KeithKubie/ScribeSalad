00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.569
 (hip-hop beat)

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:07.340 line:0%
 - A big portion of 406
 where I'm not in it

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:09.909 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 and it's like a day
 of directing Ilana.

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:11.477
Which was such a pleasure 'cause

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.912
 not having directed,

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.181 align:start position:0%
 you get the full experience
 when you're not in it.

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:16.516 align:start size:88% position:13%
 When you're directing
 and you're in it,

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.518 align:start size:88% position:13%
you're like, constantly
putting this hat,

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.086
 and you're like, these hats,

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.654 align:start position:0%
  and you're like putting
  them on top of each other.

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.056
For me,

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.325 align:start position:0%
 it's about setting
 everything up and planning.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:29.595 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And so I can be in
 the scene as an actor

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:31.864
 as much as possible,
 but then you're...

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:33.666
You are watching

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.069
 your other actors in the scene

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.336
as the director.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:38.838 size:84% position:42%
  It was fun but it
  was like a lot.

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.706
 - You're gonna be a hit here.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.707 size:84% position:42%
  - Thanks.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.344
- That Margot's a mighty witch.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.814 align:start position:0%
  - It's so exciting
  working with these women.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.817 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 I'm Jane Curtin and
 I'm playing Margot.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.752
- Like, insane.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:54.921
 She's an absolute joy.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.189 size:84% position:42%
  So funny.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.325
 - I studied her as a
 kid and a comedy nerd.

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:01.594 align:start position:0%
  - [Abbi] She kept throwing
  in surprising improv.

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:02.862
- She's amazing.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:04.097
 - [Abbi] My mom is an artist

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.998
 and Jane's character Margot,

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:07.867 align:start size:88% position:13%
 her table's all my
 mom's actual artwork,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.735
 so my mom really liked that.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.204
 - There's a feeling on the set

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.473 align:start size:88% position:13%
 that you feel free,
 you feel safe.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.141
 So it's a pleasure being here.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:16.342 size:84% position:42%
  - Margot!

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:17.143 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Can you watch my
 stuff for a second?

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:18.244
 I got money to spend.

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:19.645 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Money is a
 mind-control technique

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:23.783 align:start position:0%
 that quantifies the
 progress of the patriarchy!

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:26.152
 Yeah, I'll watch your stuff.
