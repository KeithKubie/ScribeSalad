00:00:00.324 --> 00:00:01.740
- [Voiceover] So we've
already been able to explore

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.934
a lot with our little thought experiment

00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:06.559
where I am floating in space.

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:09.240
I'm at the center of
my frame of reference,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.923
and right at time equals zero

00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:12.455
in my frame of reference,

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:16.994
a friend comes in a
spaceship passing me by

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:18.817
with a velocity v,

00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:20.454
I'll say the magnitude is v,

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:22.694
and it's going in the
positive x direction.

00:00:22.694 --> 00:00:23.346
We're just going to focus,

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:24.646
and we have been focusing,

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:27.444
just on the x dimension for simplicity.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:31.228
And we've thought about reconciling space

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:33.027
and time in my frame of reference

00:00:33.027 --> 00:00:35.128
relative to her frame of reference.

00:00:35.128 --> 00:00:36.220
The conundrum that we've faced

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.926
in previous videos is how do we reconcile

00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:40.109
that the speed of light is always

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.580
going to be the same in
every frame of reference?

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.586
And to reconcile them, we
had to essentially come

00:00:46.586 --> 00:00:49.329
up with the idea of spacetime.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.546
I should say it even faster, spacetime.

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:54.866
Spacetime, let me write it out, spacetime.

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.652
And the first time I
heard about spacetime,

00:00:57.652 --> 00:00:58.976
I assumed that people were just talking

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:01.936
about space and time as independent things

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:05.429
and just plotting your
point in space and time.

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:07.613
But when people talk about spacetime,

00:01:07.613 --> 00:01:09.772
they're really talking about
this continuum of one thing,

00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:11.571
and we're just talking
about different directions

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:12.860
in spacetime.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.766
They could have called
this something else.

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.647
They could have called this spime,

00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:19.733
or tace, or stace,

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:22.009
or a lot of different things.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.146
But this is spacetime,

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:25.411
and it's this idea that
it's this continuum.

00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:28.998
And when we started to
make spacetime diagrams,

00:01:28.998 --> 00:01:31.842
we realized in order
for the speed of light

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:34.698
to be absolute, that time and space

00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:36.090
weren't as independent of each other

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.110
as we thought, and they
weren't as absolute

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.213
as we thought.

00:01:39.213 --> 00:01:41.291
And we constructed these Minkowsky

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:43.291
spacetime diagrams for each

00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:44.788
of our frames of reference.

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:45.868
So my frame of reference,

00:01:45.868 --> 00:01:47.075
the spacetime diagram,

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:48.155
is here in white,

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:50.674
and for my friend's frame of reference,

00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:52.729
her spacetime diagram is here

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:53.948
in this blue color.

00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:57.732
The angle formed between these axes,

00:01:57.732 --> 00:01:59.474
between the x and the x prime axis

00:01:59.474 --> 00:02:02.956
and the ct and the ct prime axis,

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.570
this angle alpha here,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.032
this is going to be dependent on her

00:02:07.032 --> 00:02:10.446
relative velocity in
my frame of reference.

00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:13.825
So if her velocity is v,

00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:15.183
or the magnitude of her velocity is v

00:02:15.183 --> 00:02:16.483
in my frame of reference,

00:02:16.483 --> 00:02:17.760
this angle we've already seen

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.200
is going to be the inverse tangent

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.706
or the arctangent of the ratio

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:24.109
between her relative velocity

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.549
and the speed of light.

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.130
So this is going to be
equal to the inverse tangent

00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:31.677
of v over c.

00:02:31.677 --> 00:02:33.430
So the faster she goes,

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.430
these two things are going
to start squeezing together,

00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:40.248
and if somehow she were
to approach the speed

00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:43.906
of light, they would both
approach a 45 degree angle

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:46.263
and actually start to coincide

00:02:46.263 --> 00:02:48.190
if they were actually able to approach

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.676
the speed of light.

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:51.474
And that's all interesting already,

00:02:51.474 --> 00:02:54.005
this idea that space and time are not

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.125
as independent, that it's all a continuum

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.360
called spacetime, but some
of you have probably said,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.275
well, I want to deal with some more

00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:01.993
tangible numbers here.

00:03:01.993 --> 00:03:06.824
For example, if this event right over here

00:03:06.824 --> 00:03:09.273
in spacetime, we can think about it

00:03:09.273 --> 00:03:10.562
from my frame of reference,

00:03:10.562 --> 00:03:11.363
and we can think about it

00:03:11.363 --> 00:03:12.883
from her frame of reference.

00:03:12.883 --> 00:03:14.403
In my frame of reference,

00:03:14.403 --> 00:03:16.892
I would view the coordinates here.

00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:20.009
This coordinate would be x,

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:22.226
and this coordinate right over here

00:03:22.226 --> 00:03:23.642
would be ct.

00:03:23.642 --> 00:03:25.222
We had a whole video on why we think

00:03:25.222 --> 00:03:26.906
of time in terms of ct.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.971
The units here literally would be meters.

00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:31.850
We could think of it as
light-meters if we like.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.825
So that would be the coordinates

00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:34.532
in my frame of reference.

00:03:34.532 --> 00:03:35.484
Well, what would be the coordinates

00:03:35.484 --> 00:03:37.167
in her frame of reference?

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:39.593
Well, we've already
thought about how to read

00:03:39.593 --> 00:03:42.112
these Minkowski spacetime diagrams.

00:03:42.112 --> 00:03:43.843
To find her x prime coordinate,

00:03:43.843 --> 00:03:48.243
we would just go parallel
to the ct prime axis.

00:03:48.243 --> 00:03:50.169
So that would be the x prime coordinate

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.492
in her frame of reference.

00:03:51.492 --> 00:03:53.245
And to figure out the ct prime coordinate,

00:03:53.245 --> 00:03:56.504
we would just go parallel
to the x prime axis.

00:03:56.504 --> 00:04:01.504
So this would be the ct prime coordinate.

00:04:02.732 --> 00:04:05.473
Now how do you actually go in between,

00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:08.096
transform, from x to x prime

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:11.195
and from ct to ct prime?

00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:13.331
And to do that, we're going to introduce

00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:17.505
in this video the Lorentz transformations.

00:04:23.954 --> 00:04:25.812
And what they do is they allow us to do

00:04:25.812 --> 00:04:27.936
exactly what we just needed to do.

00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:32.614
They'll allow us to go from x, ct

00:04:32.614 --> 00:04:36.581
to x prime

00:04:37.704 --> 00:04:40.484
and ct prime.

00:04:40.484 --> 00:04:41.756
And to help us think about it,

00:04:41.756 --> 00:04:43.739
I'm going to introduce some variables,

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:45.509
and hopefully it will show the symmetry

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:46.894
of the Lorentz transformations.

00:04:46.894 --> 00:04:48.635
You might see them written in other ways

00:04:48.635 --> 00:04:51.027
in other sources, and we'll reconcile all

00:04:51.027 --> 00:04:52.768
of those in the future.

00:04:52.768 --> 00:04:54.126
But the Lorentz transformations,

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:56.332
we'll start with what we
call the Lorentz factor

00:04:56.332 --> 00:04:57.354
because this shows up a lot

00:04:57.354 --> 00:04:58.247
in the transformation.

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:00.267
So I'll just define this ahead of time.

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:04.726
So the Lorentz factor,
denoted by the Greek letter

00:05:04.726 --> 00:05:06.468
gamma, lowercase gamma,

00:05:06.468 --> 00:05:10.669
it is equal to one over the square root

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.669
of one minus v squared over c squared.

00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:19.387
Now sometimes you might
even see it written like,

00:05:19.387 --> 00:05:22.046
well, I'll write it another way.

00:05:22.046 --> 00:05:25.656
Sometimes you might see
it written as gamma,

00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:27.303
let me do it in that same color,

00:05:27.303 --> 00:05:29.022
same reddish color,

00:05:29.022 --> 00:05:32.528
gamma is equal to one over the square root

00:05:32.528 --> 00:05:34.850
of one minus beta squared.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.462
You might say, well, what is beta?

00:05:36.462 --> 00:05:38.970
Well, beta is another
variable that shows up

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.721
a lot when we're thinking
about special relativity.

00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:46.160
And beta is just the ratio

00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:50.085
between the relative velocity,

00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:52.267
her relative velocity in
my frame of reference,

00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:53.741
and the speed of light.

00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:54.542
It shows up a lot,

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:55.900
even this angle alpha here,

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.997
we could have said this
is the inverse tangent

00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:01.864
of beta.

00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:04.539
This becomes a little bit
simpler when you write

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.397
the Lorentz factor.

00:06:06.397 --> 00:06:08.383
And when we look at the
actual transformation

00:06:08.383 --> 00:06:10.181
between the coordinates,
we'll see that beta

00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:11.517
becomes useful again, at least the way

00:06:11.517 --> 00:06:12.898
I like to write it.

00:06:12.898 --> 00:06:15.939
So if we want to think about what x prime

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.260
is going to be, so we can write

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.453
x prime is going to be equal

00:06:22.453 --> 00:06:25.953
to the Lorentz factor,

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.187
let me do it in that red color,

00:06:29.187 --> 00:06:32.989
is going to be equal to the Lorentz factor

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:36.145
times x

00:06:37.937 --> 00:06:40.852
minus, and now we're going to say

00:06:40.852 --> 00:06:45.618
beta times ct,

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.760
and ct prime

00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:57.313
is going to be equal to
the Lorentz factor gamma,

00:06:57.313 --> 00:06:59.606
let me do that same color again,

00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:01.772
switching colors is sometimes difficult,

00:07:01.772 --> 00:07:04.105
gamma times, and we'll see it's just

00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:05.730
the other way around.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.730
It is going to be c,

00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:12.323
let me do it in that green color,

00:07:12.323 --> 00:07:14.234
ct

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.187
minus, you might even guess what I'm

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:21.391
about to write based on the symmetry

00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:22.552
that we see here,

00:07:22.552 --> 00:07:27.552
ct minus beta times x.

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:29.866
And I really want you to appreciate this

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:34.788
because it really shows
that space and time

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.145
are really just different directions

00:07:37.145 --> 00:07:39.361
in the spacetime and
there's a nice symmetry

00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:40.244
to them right over here.

00:07:40.244 --> 00:07:45.244
Notice we have an x and we have an x.

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:49.890
We have a ct and we have a ct.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.132
So when we're thinking about x prime,

00:07:52.132 --> 00:07:56.009
it's x minus beta times ct,

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:58.714
and we're scaling it
by the Lorentz factor,

00:07:58.714 --> 00:08:00.745
and then when we're thinking about time,

00:08:00.745 --> 00:08:01.711
well we do it the other way around.

00:08:01.711 --> 00:08:03.174
We're still scaled by the Lorentz factor,

00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:07.225
but now it is ct minus beta times x.

00:08:07.225 --> 00:08:09.292
Now this might all seem like Greek to you,

00:08:09.292 --> 00:08:11.091
and we actually are using Greek letters,

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:11.731
but in the next video,

00:08:11.731 --> 00:08:14.285
I'll actually use some
sample numbers here,

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.604
and you'll see that evaluating these

00:08:16.604 --> 00:08:19.711
is just a little bit of
straightforward algebra.
