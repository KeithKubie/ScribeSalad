00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.819
- [Voiceover] If six is less than

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.106
the absolute value of x minus three,

00:00:04.106 --> 00:00:05.742
which is less than seven,

00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:07.868
and x is equal to zero,

00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:12.868
what is one possible value
of the absolute value of x?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.202
So let's just rewrite this
first compound inequality,

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:17.527
then we'll think about this constrained

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:19.256
of x being less than zero.

00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:21.578
So they're telling us that six is less

00:00:21.578 --> 00:00:25.003
than the absolute value of x minus three,

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.661
which is less than seven.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.181
So let's just think about what it means

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:30.796
to take the absolute value.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.757
An absolute value of an expression,

00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:34.383
or of a number could be viewed as,

00:00:34.383 --> 00:00:37.227
well, how far is that
number away from zero?

00:00:37.227 --> 00:00:39.305
For example, we've seen this before,

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:43.437
negative five is five away from zero.

00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:46.526
Five is five away from zero.

00:00:46.526 --> 00:00:48.024
So if you think about it that way,

00:00:48.024 --> 00:00:49.045
now let's draw a number line,

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:51.784
and visualize where
would x minus three sit?

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:53.108
Where are all the possible places

00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:54.524
where x minus three could sit?

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:55.966
I'm going to try and draw a pretty big

00:00:55.966 --> 00:01:00.117
number line so we can
visualize it reasonably well.

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:03.890
So let's say that this
right over here is zero,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.071
this is positive six,

00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:11.247
this is positive seven.

00:01:11.247 --> 00:01:14.924
This is negative six,

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:17.444
and this is negative seven.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:20.090
So if x minus three sits in this interval

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.504
between six and seven,
and not equaling those,

00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:25.489
because these are not less than or equal,

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:27.254
these are just less than signs.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:30.376
So if x minus three is in this interval

00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:34.195
between six and seven, so if x minus three

00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:36.970
is there, then the absolute value

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.095
of x minus three is going to be between

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:42.170
six and seven away from zero.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.073
But the other place where
x minus three could be,

00:01:45.073 --> 00:01:47.233
is in this interval,

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:49.973
between negative six and negative seven.

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:53.199
X minus three could also be there,

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:55.592
because anything here,
if you take any value

00:01:55.592 --> 00:01:57.077
in that interval right over there,

00:01:57.077 --> 00:02:00.514
its absolute value,
its distance from zero,

00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:03.833
it's between six and seven away from zero.

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:07.990
Notice something over here would be,

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.195
so for example, negative 6.2,

00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:14.259
that is between six and
seven away from zero.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.069
So this is the absolute value,

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.378
this distance to the left,

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:21.271
if we're thinking about this area,

00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:24.150
and it's the distance
to the right of zero,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.495
if we're thinking about
things in this interval.

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:28.119
So what are the two situations?

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:30.696
Well, this blue situation is just

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:34.447
six is less than x minus three,

00:02:34.447 --> 00:02:36.141
which is less than seven.

00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:38.499
We're essentially assuming
that x minus three

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.820
is positive, but then there's a case

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.979
where x minus three could be negative.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:47.956
And in that case, we have negative seven,

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:52.956
is going to be less than x minus three,

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:56.539
which is going to be
less than negative six.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.327
So these are the two cases

00:02:58.327 --> 00:03:01.160
and to figure out what x would
be in each of these cases,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.388
we could add three to all three parts

00:03:03.388 --> 00:03:05.107
of this inequality.

00:03:05.107 --> 00:03:08.021
So, if you add three to six,

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.960
you get nine is less than...

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.642
Add three here, that's the whole point,

00:03:11.642 --> 00:03:13.768
the three and the
negative three cancel out,

00:03:13.768 --> 00:03:16.379
is less than x, and then,

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.130
less than seven plus three is 10.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.848
So that's one possibility.

00:03:21.848 --> 00:03:23.727
The other possibility over here,

00:03:23.727 --> 00:03:25.481
if you add three to
all the different parts

00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.699
of this compound inequality,

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.565
negative seven plus
three is negative four,

00:03:30.565 --> 00:03:32.841
is less than x minus three, plus three,

00:03:32.841 --> 00:03:36.139
is x, which is less than negative six

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.785
plus three, is negative three.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:41.502
Now, so, if this was our only constraint,

00:03:41.502 --> 00:03:44.091
this is what we would know about x,

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.539
that either this is true, or this is true,

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.398
but then they tell us another constraint.

00:03:48.398 --> 00:03:53.243
They tell us that x is less than...

00:03:53.243 --> 00:03:56.074
x is less than zero.

00:03:56.074 --> 00:03:58.956
So x can't be greater than nine,

00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:00.917
so we can rule out this case,

00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:02.995
which pretty much rules out that case,

00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:04.586
and makes us focus on this case,

00:04:04.586 --> 00:04:07.324
x has to be less than zero.

00:04:07.324 --> 00:04:10.541
So what's one possible value
of the absolute value of x?

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:12.514
Well, you can pick any x in this interval

00:04:12.514 --> 00:04:14.894
between negative three and negative four.

00:04:14.894 --> 00:04:17.983
You could say, well, x could be equal

00:04:17.983 --> 00:04:20.919
to negative 3.1, you could say x

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.542
is equal to negative 3.01,

00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:27.560
you could say x is equal to negative 3.56,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.482
you could say x is equal to negative 3.99.

00:04:32.482 --> 00:04:35.523
All of these x's are in this interval,

00:04:35.523 --> 00:04:37.301
so one possible value?

00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:41.212
Well, we could just say x
is equal to negative 3.5,

00:04:41.212 --> 00:04:43.081
you take the absolute value of x,

00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:45.856
so then, the absolute value of x

00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:49.757
would be equal to positive 3.5,

00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:52.339
and we are done.
