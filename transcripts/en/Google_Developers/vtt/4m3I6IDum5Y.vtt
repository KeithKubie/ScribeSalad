00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.381
Hi, everybody.

00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:03.130
As [INAUDIBLE] said,
I'm Michael Silliski.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.300
I'm a product management
director here on Google Play,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.500
and I'd like to kick
off the day by sharing

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.990
a few thoughts with you
about the state of Play,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.310
and the amazing momentum that
we've been seeing with Android,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.730
with Play, and with you guys--
the app developers-- recently.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.315
I'd also like to highlight a
few key trends that I think

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:23.690
we've really been
focused and are

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.520
really relevant to
you guys, and then

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.775
point out a few things I think
you'll see throughout the day.

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:30.650
So let's get started.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.660
As I think you guys
all know, Android

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.250
has become an incredibly
popular platform.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.280
And as somebody who's been
at Google since we launched

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.470
the G1 back in 2008, it's
incredible to see over

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.360
just six short years how
we've gone from a few thousand

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.090
devices to now
Android accounting

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.130
for three out of every four
smartphones in the world.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.630
More recently, we've
seen amazing momentum

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.580
on tablets with
Android now counting

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.250
for three out of every five
tablets in use in the world.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.670
And Android's not just popular.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.070
It's also become
increasingly powerful.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.060
At this point,
over 85% of devices

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210
are running Android
4.0 or above.

00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:19.820
But as you guys know,
the Android opportunity

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.170
is not just about market share.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.840
It's about the
aggregate impact, and we

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.360
crossed an amazing
milestone this year.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.240
We now have over one billion
active Android devices

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.110
in the world.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.825
A number that I find
just staggering.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.702
And that growth has continued to
increase in velocity over time,

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.660
and it's projected to
continue into the future.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.340
Taking a regional
view here at Europe,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.960
the Middle East, in
Africa-- EMEA forecasts

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.890
are for smartphone sales
to double over five years.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.957
As you can see, Android
is the blue on the top.

00:01:57.957 --> 00:01:59.790
And so Android's capturing
the vast majority

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.210
of those increased
sales going forward,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.530
and the same is true for tablets
with tablet sales continuing

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.350
to increase and Android
capturing the lion's share.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.560
But as you guys know, the
Android platform story

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.080
is not a regional story.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.880
Android has really become
a truly global platform.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.890
We now have 60
device manufacturers

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.520
selling Android devices
all over the world.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.810
We have partnerships with
329 mobile operators,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.730
and they're distributing
devices in over 190

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.450
different countries.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.610
And I think that's one
of the first themes

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.550
that I wanted to talk
to you guys about, which

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.091
is the increased
internationalization

00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:43.980
of Android.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.490
And particularly
a focus that we've

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.940
had recently both on
Android and on Play

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.140
around emerging markets.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.660
Despite all of that
growth, only one

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.850
out of four people in the
world today have a smartphone.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.310
And we at Google
are focused on how

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.250
we can bring the next five
billion people online.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.170
And one key effort to
do that is Android One.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.310
Android One's an effort to
bring high quality devices

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.030
to emerging markets,
like India, Indonesia--

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.000
like the Philippines
and South Asia.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.670
And with Android
One, we're trying

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.940
to make devices that
have fast processors,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.270
smooth interactions,
and we've actually

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.470
partnered with device
manufacturers and silicon chip

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.662
makers to create
reference designs

00:03:35.662 --> 00:03:39.010
to allow these to not only
be high quality devices-- not

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.250
only powerful devices, but
also affordable devices.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.892
And devices that
have features that

00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:46.850
are particularly relevant
in the local markets.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.130
For example, in
India-- FM radios.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.120
They're not only high quality
and affordable devices,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.828
but they're also
devices that will always

00:03:55.828 --> 00:03:57.400
run the latest
version of Android,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.774
which you guys
know is important.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.240
Here on Play, we build
the distribution layer

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.290
and the commerce layer
on top of Android.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.330
And so, the Android
platform expansion

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.810
into emerging markets through
Android One and other efforts

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.690
is a tremendous
opportunity for us.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.660
And we have really been
prioritizing making sure

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.016
that users and all those
different countries can pay.

00:04:22.016 --> 00:04:24.390
Whether it's your paid apps,
whether it's in-app billing,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.980
whether it's
subscriptions-- we want

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.521
to make sure that
all of those people

00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:31.580
have a seamless and [INAUDIBLE]
way to engage with your apps

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.600
and services.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.260
And so we spent a ton of time
over the past couple of years

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.360
making sure that all these
markets are payments enabled.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.170
Earlier this year
we launched Paypal,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.900
and we have Paypal live
in 12 different markets.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.940
Another way to pay
in a wide region.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.400
We've seen increased popularity
of direct carrier billing,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.911
and we've been focused on
expanding that internationally

00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:52.410
as well.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.290
We now have direct
carrier billing

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.779
in over 25 different markets,
and that covers about half

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:00.820
of the Android user base.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.244
We've also been
working really hard

00:05:05.244 --> 00:05:06.910
to get our gift cards
program rolled out

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.970
in as many markets as possible.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.650
And in under two
years, we're now

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.260
at 18 different markets
with gift cards.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.310
And I'm really happy to be able
to say that all of that work

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.010
seems to be paying
off for developers.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.380
We've paid out over $5
billion to developers

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.100
through Google Play.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.650
It's become a really
big opportunity,

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.760
and it continues to
grow year over year.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.700
We paid out more than
2 and 1/2 times as much

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.950
last year as we did
the year before,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.970
and we're looking forward to
increased growth in the future.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.510
So looking forward
a little bit, we're

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.060
around the corner from
the Android L release.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.290
And I wanted to highlight
a couple of trends

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.790
with L that I think
are particularly

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.750
relevant to you guys.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.130
One is material design.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.560
So with material design,
we challenged ourselves

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.411
to come up with a new
visual look for Android that

00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:05.660
would synthesize the classic
principles of good design

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.340
with the possibilities
that technology affords us.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.890
And so material design
brings a new look and feel,

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.400
new principles of motion, and
better animation to Android.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.670
It is really beautiful.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.449
It's a joy to use.

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:18.990
I think you guys
will really like it.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.156
And I think now is a great
time-- with the L preview

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:22.822
out there-- to go
look at how you

00:06:22.822 --> 00:06:24.530
can bring material
design into your apps.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.125
Another major trend of
L is expanding Android--

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.060
as [INAUDIBLE] said--
from phones and tablets

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.247
into a new wave of
device types, and I

00:06:38.247 --> 00:06:39.830
think we're just on
the brink of this.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.050
TVs, and wearables, and auto.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.510
So with Android TV,
we're bringing Android

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.750
into the living room with
big screen apps, and games,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.760
and content.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.130
And not just a streaming
service, but also

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.790
platform on which you can
build incredibly rich,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.191
visually stunning games.

00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.190
And we think it's something
that has mass market

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.060
potential with a
variety of form factors

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.110
and multiple manufacturers.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.580
And best of all
for you guys, it's

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.590
less work because it's a
simple incremental expansion

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.032
pure Android app.

00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:13.490
Second platform I
wanted to mention

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.450
is Android Wear, which brings
Android onto your watch.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.330
With devices like
this Moto 360 which

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.530
went on sale just this week.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.000
This is a really
beautiful device.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.610
There's a range of
devices out there now.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.620
And I can tell you
that it's really

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.350
transformed the way that I
interact with apps and services

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.212
that I've used over
a period of years.

00:07:32.212 --> 00:07:33.753
Which I think for
every app developer

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:37.270
is an opportunity to think about
how you can bring your apps

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.919
and services onto the wrist.

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:40.710
So Android Wear organizes
your information.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.900
It surfaces to you without
you even having to ask,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.730
and so whether it's
messaging, or appointments,

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:53.310
or weather notifications--
who knows what in the future.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.750
But I hope you
guys will dream up

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.600
the use cases that make
this a medical device.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.130
And then lastly,
Android Auto, which

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.336
brings Android into the car.

00:08:04.336 --> 00:08:06.210
Android Auto was designed
with safety in mind

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.190
with a simple and
intuitive interface.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.620
With integrated
steering wheel control.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.380
With integrated voice control.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.510
And you can connect
your phone to get

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.230
your contacts and your messages
and your music all on the car

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.420
without having to take
your eyes off the road.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.260
And I'm really
excited about this.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:28.590
Particularly with over two
dozen auto industry partners.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.150
So I think as we look
from this transition

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.940
from phones and tablets to
TV, and wearables, and auto,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.289
this big opportunity both
for us and for you guys.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.200
Because Android and Play
provide the platform,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.789
but you guys are
going to provide

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.414
the apps and the
services that actually

00:08:45.414 --> 00:08:48.340
make these devices
useful and worthwhile.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.320
So an expansion of types
of apps that you can build.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.330
A new design language.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.850
A new range of devices.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.590
New markets around the world.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.222
So how do you take
advantage of it?

00:09:05.222 --> 00:09:07.430
So we're going to talk about
that throughout the day,

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.440
but I wanted to kick
off by highlighting

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.040
five key points there are things
that we think about ourselves

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.560
every day as we're
building apps.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.380
And I think you guys want
to think about as well.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.850
So first as I mentioned, get
ready for L platform release.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.040
L is one of the biggest
releases we've ever done.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.690
It not only brings
a new UI paradigm.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.090
It brings a new runtime,
enhancer notifications,

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.460
and over 5,000 APIs which means
new capabilities for you guys.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.210
Things that you can
use to build new types

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.050
of apps that haven't
existed before.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.420
Second, capitalize on these
new device opportunities.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.379
We're on the verge of
the next wave of devices,

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:47.044
and right now is a
time when it's really

00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:48.110
a Greenfield opportunity.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.635
The L preview
release is out there,

00:09:49.635 --> 00:09:51.010
and so it's a
great time to start

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:54.740
thinking about how you can
define what a device like this,

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.590
or what having the Android
platform on your tablet,

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.970
your wrist, and your TV means.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.659
What kind of services
can exist over

00:10:02.659 --> 00:10:04.450
the next few years that
don't exists today.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.910
Third, it's a great
time to go global.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.360
There's over a billion devices
in use around the world,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.900
and whether we're sitting
in California or in London

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.909
or in Tokyo, our
users are everywhere.

00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:23.200
And as we work to bring those
next five billion devices

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.140
online with efforts
like Android One,

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.890
I think you're going
to see that it's only

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.910
going to become
more international.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.870
And so the opportunity
is there to think

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.800
about the local unique
needs of your users

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.790
whether they're in India,
or Brazil, or Indonesia.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.650
Fourth, if you're
building games,

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.100
integrate Google
Play Games services.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.272
Google Play Games services
has grown in a short time

00:10:49.272 --> 00:10:50.980
to become the fastest
growing mobile game

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.530
network of all time.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.170
We've added over 100 million
new users in the last six months

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.020
alone.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.657
So it's an opportunity
to get a lot

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.240
of the features and
the infrastructure

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.030
that you would otherwise
have to build for yourself,

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.770
and it's an
opportunity to increase

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:09.230
your visibility both through the
Games network and to the store.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.320
And we hear consistently
from developers

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.680
that integrating Games
services and using features

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.150
like achievements, leaderboards,
quests, gifts, multiplayer.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.210
The whole range of services
helps them increase engagement

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.134
with their users, retain
their users for longer,

00:11:23.134 --> 00:11:24.550
and extend the
life of their game.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.070
And fifth, critical
for us and for you

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.829
guys-- our relentless
focus on quality.

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:32.870
You guys know your users.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.703
You know that quality
is important for them.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.790
It also really impacts how
well your apps monetize.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.860
So for every additional star you
get in your rating in the Play

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.370
Store, we see a
multiplier effect

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.110
on revenues to developers.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.780
So I encourage you to
maximize your marketing money,

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.780
and make sure that you're
engaging and retaining

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.707
those users.

00:11:54.707 --> 00:11:56.290
And so finally, I
just want to mention

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.480
that Google's here to help.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.080
Throughout the whole
life cycle, we really

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.900
honestly spend all
of our time every day

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.277
thinking about
how we can improve

00:12:07.277 --> 00:12:09.860
the tools and the services that
we make available to you guys,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.200
and how we can make your lives
better as app developers.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.640
Whether it's in the store,
whether it's making payments

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.780
easier for users, whether
it's making devices

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.790
available in more places to
more different types of users.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.180
Whether it's building out the
developer console providing

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.774
tools like A/B testing to you,
this is what we do every day.

00:12:25.774 --> 00:12:27.940
And so I'm really looking
forward to meeting as many

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.300
of you as possible,
hearing your feedback,

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:35.510
hearing your questions, hearing
your ideas, and thank you.
