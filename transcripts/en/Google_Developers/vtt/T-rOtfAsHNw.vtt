SCOTT ROWE: CSS properties are
some of the most ubiquitous

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.200
artifacts in web development.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.540
You can't really develop
anything for the web without

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.000
editing its CSS properties.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.690
There are some 500 CSS
properties, though the most

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.700
commonly used of these narrow
down to a few hundred.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.160
And it is these most commonly
used properties that we aim to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.160
document for the beta release
of Web Platform Docs.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.280
And we're excited to have
third parties like Adobe

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.370
Brackets and Chrome Dev Tools
using this information in

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.580
their products.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.080
This video serves to supplement
the information

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.250
you'll find on the CSS property
project pages.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.520
In other words, yes, you'll
still need to read the Web

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.620
Platform Wednesday Doc and the
CSS Property Editing Guide to

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.870
be prepared to contribute
to this project.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.580
Once you're ready to start,
visit the Web Platform

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.630
Wednesday page to choose
some properties and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.840
tasks to work on.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.560
Every Wednesday at 11 o'clock AM
Pacific time, seven o'clock

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.760
PM UTC, we gather on the free
node IRC channel #webplatform

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.200
to go over the list
of properties

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.720
designated for the week.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.720
You can either post to the
channel with the properties

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.050
and tasks you want to work on,
or you can send an email to

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.300
public-webplatform @w3.org.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.050
You'll be contacted by a
coordinator who will help you

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.460
work on the project.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.470
But you don't have
to wait until

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.830
Wednesday to get involved.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.000
Send an email any time.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.680
Wherever possible, choose a
group of related properties,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.720
so you can take advantage of any
cut and paste shortcuts.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.940
For example, Rob Simpson has
signed up to work on several

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.640
text decoration properties.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.340
He sent an email to
public-webplatform@w3.org, and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.160
coordinator Julie edited the
table to sign him up.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.830
You won't need to
edit this table.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.630
Just stay in contact with the
coordinator as you work, and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.010
the coordinator will update
all the record keeping.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.190
Often you'll have a group of
related properties that

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.560
includes a shorthand property.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.479
Think of the shorthand property
as the master

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.690
property of the group.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.200
For example, the text decoration
property is the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.980
shorthand property for the text
decoration color, text

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.060
decoration line, and text
decoration style CSS

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.100
properties.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.260
Once the coordinator has
signed you up for the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.860
property, click on the link
in the table and open the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.010
Properties page.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.220
If the link is red or the page
does not exist, contact the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.310
coordinator.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.160
If your group of articles
includes a shorthand property,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.590
work on the page for the
shorthand property first.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.490
You'll need to refer to
the w3 specifications.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.810
Pull up the specs cited in the
fourth column of the table,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.596
then search the page for the
property you were working on.

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:48.920
Ah, they moved it to
a different spec.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.810
This sort of thing happens
a lot with specs.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.910
They're constantly changing.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.400
Also be sure you're referring
to the most up to date spec.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.780
At the top of the specification
page, there are

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.870
listed all of the pertinent
versions.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.420
Use the latest editor's
draft spec.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.020
In page search is your
best friend.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.010
Notice that the shorthand
property is described after

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.390
its component properties.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.440
This is typical.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.350
Note also that the specs contain
a lot of superfluous

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.580
information.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.180
This is because they are
intended primarily for browser

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.430
developers who are implementing
the standard, not

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.780
necessarily for application
developers and designers using

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.620
the standard.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.410
Your job is to distill from all
of this information just

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.620
what a developer or designer
needs to use the property in

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.850
an application.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.850
We'll go over how to include
this information in your dock

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.830
a little bit later
in the video.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.340
However, not all the information
about the property

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.050
may be found in the spec.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.240
Review other documentation
sources for more information

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.840
and to get familiar
with the property.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.320
As you find information in other
sources, be careful to

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.640
use it only in a manner that
does not violate any

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.950
copyrights or license
restrictions.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.260
Don't plagiarize.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.440
In Web Platform Docs, we
always provide content

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.300
attribution when information
is drawn

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.870
from external sources.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.200
See the Editor's Guide for more
information about license

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.440
and copyright issues and
external attribution.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.010
We'll go over external
attribution in greater detail

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.750
later in this video.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.400
While CSS properties are the
focus of Web Platform

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.490
Wednesdays, you can sign up to
work on specific tasks for CSS

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.580
property pages, or you can sign
up for all tasks on a

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.610
given page.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.720
The tasks are documenting basic
facts, explanatory text,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.580
creating examples, links, and
reviewing complete articles.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.810
The basic facts include the
values in the overview table,

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.620
the syntax, and the
property values.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.250
You can copy and paste these
values and descriptions from

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.500
the specs as they are.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.490
The spec says for the animatable
value, see

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.330
individual properties.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.560
Usually if all of the longhand
properties are animatable, the

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.620
associated shorthand property
is animatable too.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.870
You should always test it.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.720
Ask the coordinator if you need
help testing properties

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.970
for animation.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.540
For the CSS object model
property, this is usually the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.940
same name as the property with
the hyphens removed and the

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.390
words combined with camelCase,
as shown here.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.920
By the way, you can ignore
the percentages field.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.350
Notice that the border style
value none has a link to more

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.100
information about background
image here in the W3C spec.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.340
Be sure to pull all that
information into your

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.670
documentation.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.310
In this example, that the image
layer counts, but is not

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.840
drawn when the value is none,
and include a link to the

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.190
related WPD page, in this
example, the background image

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.970
CSS property page.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.350
In other words, be sure to
include all relevant

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.455
supplementary information in
the value descriptions.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.130
Notice also that we use code
formatting to style the text

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.620
for other property
values described.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.110
In the hidden property value
description, the words none

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.700
and hidden are formatted as
code to set them off from

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.910
ordinary text.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.860
Once you have all the values
documented, the syntax section

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.935
displays them as code syntax
automatically.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.880
The explanatory text in the
summary, usage, and note

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.630
sections is where you
will contribute to

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.830
your original content.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.450
You will contribute your
original content gleaned from

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.090
your research in the specs and
related documentation.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.950
Here, it is really important
that you contribute only

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:52.950
original content.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.145
No cutting and pasting verbatim
from other sources.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.710
The article summary should
briefly describe the property.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.490
If the property is a shorthand
property, the summary should

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.630
say so and link to all of the
properties associated with the

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:08.880
shorthand property.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.060
The usage section provides
guidelines for using the

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.000
property and any little gotchas
not obvious in the

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.290
descriptions.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.040
Notes describe considerations
for how the property works,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.750
usually beyond the
user's control.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.090
Don't worry about the important
notes section.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.660
This is just an artifact from
the initial content import.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.270
Now for the funnest part,
the examples.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.670
Keep these super simple.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.790
Save the complex, fancy examples
for a tutorial

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.510
another day.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.140
Your example should demonstrate

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.490
this property only.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.140
Don't introduce other properties
or make the example

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.880
dependent upon the knowledge
of other properties.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.210
Also, the example should
be self explanatory.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.970
To create an example, start
with a new codelet at

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.220
code.webplatform.org.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.630
First, I save as new to
create a new codelet.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.250
This will assign a file
name to the codelet.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.940
Then I replace the dummy
content with my own.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.200
You should test your example in
all of the major browsers.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.000
Watch out for deviations
from the spec

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.360
when you run the example.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.500
It turns out that dotted lines
in Chrome are composed of

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.970
square dots instead of round
ones, as they are in Firefox.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.950
I'll go back and adjust the
description accordingly.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.280
We want to catch and document
these little deviances and

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.990
details wherever we find them.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.950
In this example, I've
set up an element to

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.890
demonstrate each value.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.230
However, you can also set up
your examples to be more

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.669
interactive.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:44.840
In this example, the values for
the property are provided

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.960
in the comments, so a
user can just plug

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.920
them in and play around.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.860
But that's about as complicated
as you should make

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.560
your example.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.630
Don't get carried away with
creating drop-down menus for

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.590
all the values, or otherwise
building a playground up here.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.750
That will only clutter the code
and distract the user.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.200
Once you have a nice working
example, copy the pertinent

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.140
code back into the page
for the property you

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.260
were working on.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.350
Notice I'm only including the
CSS code, not the HTML, here

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.800
in the CSS property
documentation.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.800
Also, copy the URL from the
codelet example to the live

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.670
example URL field, which will be
the value for the View Live

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.220
Example link in the
published doc.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.300
To create a link to the W3C
specification, under related

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.502
specifications, copy and paste
the title of the specification

00:09:32.502 --> 00:09:36.690
into the name field, the URL
for the spec into the URL

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.220
field, and the status level
into the status field.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.740
Some properties belong to more
than one specification, so be

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.580
sure to include references
to each specification.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.600
You can skip the compatibility
sections.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.020
We're replacing these
with automated data.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.480
In the see also section,
skip topic clusters.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.380
These two are getting
an overhaul.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.550
In the manual links field,
include cross references to

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.480
related CSS properties and other
internal resources, such

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.180
as tutorials from the
CSS tutorials page.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.040
In the external links field,
include any references to

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.170
relevant external content.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.520
In the topic section, check
the box for CSS.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.330
Don't check any other boxes.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.590
In the external attribution
section, leave any checked

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.100
boxes the way they are.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.580
And if any of the content you
contributed came from an

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.610
external source, check the box
for that source and include

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.340
the link to the source
in the link field.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.660
That's it for the
edits for now.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.070
Remember, you can always come
back later and edit some more

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.930
in case you remember something
you've forgotten.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.230
If you are not the reviewer, be
sure the needs review check

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.440
box in the high level issue
section is checked.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.320
If you are the reviewer, make
any corrections or additions

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.970
to the content as needed.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.250
Once your review is complete,
uncheck the needs

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.340
review check box.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.620
If any other high level issues
check boxes are checked,

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.040
please resolve the issue and
uncheck the box or note the

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.370
issue for your report back to
the coordinator for Web

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.480
Platform Wednesdays.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.850
When you're all done editing
a page, under edit details,

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.760
enter a summary of the
work you've performed

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.780
and click save page.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.000
If you're working on CSS
properties as part of Web

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.470
Platform Wednesday, be sure to
note how much time you spent

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.260
on any particular property and
report that back to the

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.340
coordinator.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.910
Also note any issues or concerns
you have with the

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.400
content and report that
back as well.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:45.580
Also please, please, please
tweet, post, or otherwise

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.400
communicate through social media
channels like Facebook

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.910
and G+ and Twitter.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.800
We want to get the word out.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.300
And that completes
the exercise.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.830

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.930

Platform Docs and the greater

web successful.
