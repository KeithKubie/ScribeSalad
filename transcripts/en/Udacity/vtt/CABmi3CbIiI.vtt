00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
But the way I solve it, let's first figure out what the units of energy were.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If an E=mc², another energy has units of M x speed--speed is m/s, so L/T,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and since that's squared, we can put a square on both of these.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, I don't know why we're telling this too many denominators, so I'm going to write

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Energy has units of M¹L²T⁻². Well, this whole term must also have units of energy.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So what I've rewritten is ħ² over something with mass and length squared,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
because M stands for mass and x is some distance.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And you know that mass have units of energy, so if move this mass up here

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and this L² up there to tell me that ħ² has units of M² L⁴ and T⁻².

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, let's take the square root, these expos all get reduced by half and I have my answer--1, 2 and -1.

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you got that, I'm very impressed.
