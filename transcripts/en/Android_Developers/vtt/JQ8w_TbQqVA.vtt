00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.590
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: Hello.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.560
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.620
It's always fun to have
mid-afternoon sessions

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.563
in a hot tent.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.090
My name is Sridhar Ramaswamy.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.820
I lead the Ads and
Commerce teams at Google.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.390
And here with me is
Pali Bhat, the product

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.680
lead for Payments at Google.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.620
And we're really
excited to be talking

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.800
to you about all the latest
and greatest in Android Pay.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.730
I want to start by addressing
the elephant in the room.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.080
There are tons of pays
that are out there.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.660
And all of you want to
know, who's winning?

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.520
Is there a winner?

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.370
But the sad answer
is, no, not really.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.240
There is no winner.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.930
Legacy payment methods like
the credit card and cash

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.280
are still the dominant
payment methods

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.120
that are being used out there.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.360
Even the most avid
technology enthusiasts

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.530
among us is
hesitant, are scared,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.640
to leave our credit
cards and cash behind.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.380
And the natural question
is, what's holding us back?

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.160
We thought a lot about this.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.990
And we think there are
three big reasons for this.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.540
The first of course,
is a big one--

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.952
is that all the mobile payment
methods are kind of limited.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.350
Some work for the physical
contactless terminals.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.270
Some work with all terminals.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.841
You know, sometimes it works
in-app but not in-- not

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:49.590
on the mobile web.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.760
And we're going to
talk a lot about that.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.230
It's the unpredictability of
whether your mobile payment

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.260
method is going to work,
that makes you want to say,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.920
no, I can't rely on
it 100% of the time.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.330
We think the second
big reason is

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.240
that a lot of the payment
schemes that are out there

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.560
are kind of uncompelling.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.160
You're talking about an
activity that all of us

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.800
do many times a
week, that we have

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.920
done the same way
for many, many years.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.530
And so if you're going
to go ask humanity

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.630
to change the way that they
think about payments, what's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.980
the value-add?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.190
They're kind of uncompelling.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.910
And this is something we really
do want to address as well.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.990
And we actually think that
the uncompelling nature

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.530
of the payment solution comes
about because most payment

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.270
solutions are kind of closed.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.090
They have a few key pieces of
functionality, and that's it.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.340
What makes our
smartphones great,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.260
whether it's Android or iOS, is
not just the operating system.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.177
We like aspects of our phones
that come directly from Google.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:00.260
But the fact of the matter
is what we really love,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.530
are our apps.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.080
It's a great functionality
that comes on.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.210
Is that animation
the developers like

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.310
you have provided on
the core platform.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.080
There is no comparable
thing that's

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.210
going on in mobile payments.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.690
We think that's kind
of a big blocker.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.810
So what do we want to do?

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.115
Today we're going to be talking
to you about all the things

00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:30.250
that we at Android
Pay and Google

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:38.300
are doing to make mobile
payments better for merchants

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.490
and retailers, for
financial institutions,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.060
but most of all for
consumers, like you and me.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.060
We think payments should
work everywhere they're

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.880
expected to work.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.061
They should work in a
simple and secure way.

00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:56.810
And we think mobile
payments would be more

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.700
like a mobile payment passport
than just a mobile wallet.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.440
And what you will
hear from us today,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.390
is our efforts at really
making this happen.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.990
So we want Android Pay
therefore to be everywhere

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.054
where you and I expect
it to be present.

00:04:13.054 --> 00:04:14.720
So we're going to
talk a lot about that,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.000
starting with how
are we going to have

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.589
Android Pay work on mobile web.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.290
It works fine in mobile apps.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:33.630
We're also going to be talking
to you about how-- I can

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.480
hear some sound from behind.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.568
Can others hear it?

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.950
So we're also going to be
talking to you about how

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.880
Android Pay can work in other
areas, like public transit.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.410
We have a nifty demo
coming up over there.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.270
And also in things like ATMs.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.440
Wherever you expect to
use payment credentials,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.445
we think Android Pay
should be usable there.

00:04:57.445 --> 00:04:59.070
And we'll show you
through all of this,

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.720
how we are building a set
of consistent and simple

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.090
experiences that all
users will know and love.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.530
But one that will also come
with the security that is

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.760
the promise of mobile payments.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.470
And finally, we also
want to share with you

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.690
what we are doing to drive
innovation in the ecosystem--

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.840
whether it is with retailers,
or with financial institutions

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.570
like banks.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.840
Of: course the first
part being everywhere

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.360
is being geographically
everywhere.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.580
So we're very
pleased to announce

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.190
the expansion of Android
Pay outside the US

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.940
to an international
location, which

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.114
is we went live in
the UK earlier today.

00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:46.026
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.160
Pali was there last
weekend, set up

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.310
[INAUDIBLE] running transactions
with his Android phone.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.560
You know, checking things
out for himself to make sure

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.420
that everything was fine.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.840
We have worked
with top partners.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.110
You see some of them here--
HSBC, Lloyd's Bank-- to make

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.000
sure that there is a lot of
acceptance for Android Pay,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.240
and of course with lots of apps,
and lots of physical locations.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.090
And this is only the beginning.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.090
So I'm also pleased to announce
that we'll be launching Android

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.080
Pay very soon, over
the next few months,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.440
in Singapore and in Australia.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.440
We want, I know, our ambition
is to be there everywhere

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.725
Android is.

00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:36.100
So we're going to be launching
in Singapore and Australia

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.390
soon, with many more countries
following soon after.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.680
They're all in the works.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.800
So we are pleased
with how much we

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.760
will be able to expand
Android Pay through the world.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.620
Let's switch gears now
and talk a little bit

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.230
about what we have
done with Android Pay

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.150
in-app, inside apps.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.930
We launched the Android
Pay in-app API in December.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.430
And we've been working with
a lot of app developers

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.110
to make Android Pay be
accepted within their apps.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.810
And we are pleased
with the results.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.780
Top apps-- Uber, Airbnb,
Jet.com, Instacart,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.380
and many others-- some
of which are listed here.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.390
All support in-app
payments with Android Pay.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.630
And the first question you're
going to ask is like, so what?

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.010
Does this make a difference?

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.970
We thought we'd show that
with one of the apps that's

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.940
adopted Android Pay, Fancy.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.160
Fancy is a really
cool app in that you

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.740
discover crowd-curated things.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.590
This morning I was
browsing through stuff.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.450
You know, if you can't tell,
I drink a lot of coffee.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.300
And I found this really
neat espresso mug

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.720
that you could get from Fancy
that a lot of other people

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.160
have liked.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.720
Fancy adopted Android Pay in-app
and saw some pretty stunning

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.220
results.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.640
For users that use
Android Pay within Fancy,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.130
they found that their
conversion rate was twice

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.350
that of other payment methods,
I don't know how you folks think

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.950
about conversion rates,
but for something

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.180
like Adwords Signup, in which
a lot of Google's fortune

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.460
is dependent on, a 1%
increase in conversion rate

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.090
is cause for major celebration.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.210
And so getting a 2x
increase in conversion rate,

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.680
on what turns out to be a
substantial volume-- 20%

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.590
of Fancy's transactions
flow through Android Pay--

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.140
is a big, big deal for Fancy.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.080
And it's a big, big deal
for a lot of the apps

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.039
that have adopted Android Pay.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.789
We're really pleased
with the results

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.420
that we've seen with
these and with other apps.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.252
I'm now handing it over to Pali.

00:08:49.252 --> 00:08:50.710
He's going to show
us a quick demo,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.390
and also walk us through
some of the details of how

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.520
things are working.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.923
PALI BHAT: Yeah, thanks Sridhar.

00:08:56.923 --> 00:08:58.506
Could we switch to
WolfVision, please?

00:09:02.031 --> 00:09:02.530
Awesome.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.390
So I'm going to open
up my Nexus 5X device,

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.330
and I want to show you
Android Pay working inside one

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.190
of my favorite apps, Airbnb.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.120
I love traveling and I
have a seven-year-old,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.740
so we need to make trips
to Disneyland very,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.710
very frequently-- as
some of you might know.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.990
So I'm going to try and
book something for a trip

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.500
to Disneyland soon.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.670
So let's see here.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:33.880
I think I'd saved a
search here for Disney.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.270
And by the way, this is
actually the production app,

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.463
so I want to make sure that
it's actually still available.

00:09:39.463 --> 00:09:40.796
So let's check for availability.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.270
Selecting here, it looks
like all of next week

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.680
is available still,
which is very nice.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.180
Sridhar, I hope you
don't mind this.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.880
He's a very good manager.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.706
So the whole week--
who'll beat that?

00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:03.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:10.250
So let me just save this and
try to instant book this.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.160
And the cool thing about this is
a really beautiful experience,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.000
right?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.510
The one place where it
actually isn't all that great,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.860
is payments.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.180
So if you go in and try
to buy something, and book

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.550
a reservation,
typically it means

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.700
you have to try and like type in
your credit card details, etc.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.890
So we worked with Airbnb
to make this much better.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.810
So I'm going to try
to add a payment.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.810
This is where I usually
get a screen that says,

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.290
enter your credit
card information.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.700
Right?

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.420
And if you have Android
Pay set up on your device,

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.220
you literally have
to do nothing else.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.053
Just pick Android Pay.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.900
That simple.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.520
Shows you the chooser
with Android Pay,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.430
and shows you my Discover
Card, on there already.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.365
And I have to do this
confirm with my fingerprint.

00:10:59.365 --> 00:11:00.760
OK?

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.180
And you can see that Android
Pay is already selected here.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.670
And the next time I come in
I don't even have to do this.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.300
Right?

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.450
You automatically can
check out, and you're done.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.140
So really, really
sweet experience.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.735
I personally love it.

00:11:20.735 --> 00:11:23.980
OK, so, let me switch
back to the presentation

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.757
if you don't mind.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.265
So whenever I'm
presenting with Sridhar,

00:11:32.265 --> 00:11:34.140
I'm always wondering
where do I stand, right?

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.290
Because standing here
seems like a bad deal.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.500
Maybe I should stand here.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.060
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: There you go.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.510
PALI BHAT: So, what I wanted
to share with you is of course,

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.770
we've got this amazing
integration with Airbnb.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.570
We've done the same kind
of integration with Uber.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.550
All of these top apps, right?

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.520
But how can every
single developer

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.420
take advantage of Android Pay?

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.000
We want to make it
really, really simple.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.782
So we worked with a number
of top payment processors.

00:12:04.782 --> 00:12:06.240
I mean, you can
just see this list.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.910
It's everybody from
Braintree to Stripe to Adyen.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.930
we've got CyberSource-- everyone
integrated into Android Pay.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.640
So that adding in Android
Pay if you're a developer,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.760
is really, really simple.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.670
In fact, if you're an integrator
with Braintree or Stripe,

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.310
literally less than
10 lines of code

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.820
that you can drop in
into your Android app

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.090
and enable Android
Pay for your users.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.650
So that's very, very awesome.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.150
We've also done more.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.770
We've opened up our API--
the Android Pay in-app

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.350
API-- to all Android Developers
selling physical goods

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.440
or services.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.230
So you can go to
this URL and start

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.940
integrating right away,
regardless of who your payment

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.340
processor is.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.170
So it's very exciting for us.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.420
But this is not the whole
story with mobile checkouts.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.870
Tell us more, I'll hand
it back to Sridhar.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.050
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
Thank you, Pali.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.920
It's really cool
that in-app payments

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.171
have been-- did we rush past?

00:13:13.171 --> 00:13:14.670
PALI BHAT: Ah, I
might have actually

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.915
just gone right past one thing.

00:13:16.915 --> 00:13:18.290
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
Can you press,

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:19.654
can I press back on this?

00:13:19.654 --> 00:13:20.320
PALI BHAT: Yeah.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.524
Can you go back one slide?

00:13:21.524 --> 00:13:23.190
Because I just want
to show you one more

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.557
cool thing which we snuck
in at the last minute.

00:13:25.557 --> 00:13:26.890
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: There you go.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.010
PALI BHAT: And
here's the cool part.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.920
You must have heard
during the keynote

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.870
earlier this morning about
Android Instant Apps.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:40.370
What Android Instand Apps are
is this really cool technology

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.080
that lets you stream
an app to your phone.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.470
So don't worry about
installing anything.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.530
You just stream the app
by clicking on a link.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.090
And you get the full
native experience

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.000
on your device, which
is like, really awesome.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.664
Now that full native experience
wouldn't be as awesome

00:13:58.664 --> 00:14:01.080
if you had to start typing in
all your credit card details

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.820
to complete your payment.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.360
So what we did is work
with the Android team

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.220
to enable Android Pay
with an Instant Apps.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.310
So I want to share with you a
little bit of this experience.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:18.940
Maybe I want to like, touch
this, and you'll see B&amp;H Photo.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:25.360
I do a search for
a camera and you

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.480
can see that the link
literally streams the B&amp;H Photo

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.100
app to my phone.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.510
I can pick my camera,
check out, and then you

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.560
get the exact same
experience I showed you

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.150
within an installed app.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.650
Right?

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.140
So absolutely cool.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.710
And gives you a complete
experience right in place,

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.430
and it's streamed to your phone.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.820
This is something that we're
very, very excited about

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.480
and we expect more
and more developers

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.900
to take advantage of this--
to reach more users who have

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.460
chosen not to install your app.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.810
But you can still get to
them using an instant app.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.630
Give them the same
great experience.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.380
The user doesn't have
to do anything else.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.010
If Android Pay is set up on
the device, it will just work.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:09.550
Right?

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.290
So again, something
that we're very, very--

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.748
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
And the camera's

00:15:12.748 --> 00:15:15.200
going to show up at your
place by drone, instantly?

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.980
PALI BHAT: That would
be actually very cool.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.440
But we will talk about how
things can show up soon.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.330
Here you go.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.142
So Sridhar will show us
more about mobile checkouts.

00:15:25.142 --> 00:15:26.850
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: So
it's cool that they

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:30.650
can solve the problem of in-app
checkouts-- make it easier,

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:33.450
make it streamlined,
make it secure.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.770
But the fact of the
matter is, a lot of us

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.080
spend a lot of
time on mobile web.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.280
The time spent is skews
more towards mobile apps.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.900
The fact of the
matter is, something

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:52.130
like half of all transactions
happen on mobile web.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.120
But mobile web does not
have any of the support

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.390
that in-apps have had.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.790
It's a different
programming model.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.560
And the result is
that you and I are

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.679
stuck with really long payment
forms, and it's really long,

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:07.720
you know, details forms,
that we have to fill out

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.511
very slowly on tiny keyboards.

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:10.760
And it doesn't work that well.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.890
We give up pretty often.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.580
Conversion rates are pretty low.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.360
So we took a baby step last year
and were stunned by the results

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.100
that we saw.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:27.450
We did something that we call
Chrome Payments Autofill.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.719
It's a small idea.

00:16:29.719 --> 00:16:32.260
Take your Google credentials,
your Google payment credentials

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.760
that you put into Android Pay,
that you have put into Google

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.200
Play, and have it be
available for form fill-out

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.000
on mobile web.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.660
Again, for users that actually
used Payment Autofill,

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.620
you know for check
out, the merchants

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.260
saw a 25% increase
in conversion rate.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.864
Again, a staggering
number where wins

00:16:56.864 --> 00:17:02.680
come in half, and quarter,
and single digit percentages.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.980
And while this is cool, the
larger problem still remains.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.450
You still have to fill
out other details,

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.240
go through a longish
checkout forms.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.280
Of course that dreaded
user ID and password.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.040
I don't know about
you, but I have

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.079
a ton of passwords stored in
the Password Manager on Chrome.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.569
I have a spreadsheet full
of user IDs and passwords

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.400
that like I have to figure
out what to do with-- it just

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.930
keeps growing longer.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:34.430
And we really need to be able
to do a whole lot better.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.720
So what if I were to tell
you that you as a merchant

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.400
will be able to create an
experience for your consumer

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.090
that's going to be
simple and secure using

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.920
tokenized credentials, and
really make these long checkout

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.640
forms and the crazy drop-offs
a thing of the past.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.975
And what if you,
as a consumer, also

00:17:53.975 --> 00:17:55.770
were able to see
all your mobile web

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.810
transactions at the
same place, along

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.560
with your in-store and
in-app transactions-- the way

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.680
you can do with
Android Pay today.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.190
We think that would
be pretty cool.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.930
And so we are thrilled
to announce something

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:12.210
we call PaymentRequest
working with the Chrome theme.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.110
And standardizing across all
browsers, to really simplify

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.450
mobile checkout.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.550
It provides developers,
and retailers obviously,

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.550
the simple tools that
they need to create

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:30.490
a great mobile payment
experience on mobile web.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.710
And this way, users have
a consistent experience

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.265
regardless of whether they
transact inside an app

00:18:36.265 --> 00:18:37.990
or on the mobile web.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.909
And Pali is going to show us
more about how this works.

00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:41.700
PALI BHAT: Awesome.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.110
If you can switch to
the Wolf Vision, again.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.960
This is an API we're very
excited about, because it's

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.440
an open standardized API.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.560
I'm going to show how it
works within a website.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.760
So open up a website in
Chrome, and it turns out

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.050
to be a little store that
we built for ourselves so we

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.300
can order branded gear.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.100
And as you can tell, I love
like wearing branded t-shirts,

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.099
with Android Pay
on them usually.

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:09.390
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: Always gray?

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.850
PALI BHAT: Always gray,
unfortunately yes.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.150
I'm very bland in
my taste of color.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.675
So I'm going to go in and
shop for some t-shirts.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.560
As you can tell, we have
some cool YouTube t-shirts.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.887
we also have just
plain Google t-shirts.

00:19:30.887 --> 00:19:32.470
But because I'm
boring, I'm just going

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.570
to pick Android Pay again.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.440
It's going to pick an
Android Pay t-shirt,

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.452
I'm going to add it to cart.

00:19:40.452 --> 00:19:41.820
OK?

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.990
And as I add it to
cart, this is usually

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.870
like the portion
of the experience

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.580
that you dread when you're
on a mobile website.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.590
And I've tried
checking out before,

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:56.610
and it literally is multiple
pages, filling out everything

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.100
from your billing
address, shipping address,

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.120
including your credit
card information.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.090
Chrome Autofill really
helps you with that.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:08.970
But what PaymentRequest does,
is help you skip all of this

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:13.270
and get that same experience
that you saw with in-apps.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.680
So what I'm going to do
now is actually show you

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.382
the checkout experience.

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:18.590
So I'm going to hit checkout.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.580
Did you notice how
quickly that came up?

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.720
So that's the full
native experience

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:30.890
showing up in a website with
Android Pay just working.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:31.540
OK?

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.420
So I'm going to hit "Pay."

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.070
And again, I have to
confirm with my fingerprint.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.570
OK?

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.220
And you can see my Bank
of America MasterCard

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.910
there, that I'm going
to use for my purchase.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.590
And it's just that simple.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.400
OK?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.240
I'm done.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.550
And notice, I also got a
notification right away

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:57.120
from the store, which I
can open up and actually

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.530
see within my Bank of America.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:05.410
Right under the Bank of America
card, in the Android Pay app,

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.702
you see all of the transactions
that I've made as well.

00:21:07.702 --> 00:21:09.784
And you see some of the
transactions that are made

00:21:09.784 --> 00:21:10.352
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:12.172
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:14.692 --> 00:21:16.150
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
We should notice

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.110
that Pali did the
same thing here

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.290
that he did for the
in-app checkout.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.620
He just unlocked the phone.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.960
No pins, nothing else.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.650
It just works
seamlessly, which is

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.890
what is cool about this
vision that we're driving.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.890
PALI BHAT: So it's
very exciting for us.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:34.950
But of course, these APIs always
require one critical thing

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.830
for them to be successful--
and that's all of you.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.330
Right?

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:43.040
And we want to make sure that we
have a set of partners testing

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.470
this API with us, and testing
the experience with us,

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.420
so we could really
make it magical.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.670
So I'm very pleased
to announce that we

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.330
have a really awesome
set of partners

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.780
already signed up to
beta test PaymentRequest.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.880
And we also have folks
like Shopify and Jet.com

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.860
adding in Android Pay into
this experience as well.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.120
So very, very exciting for us.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:13.360
So with that, I'm going to
switch gears a little bit,

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.060
and talk about a
critical use case

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.010
for playing with the phone.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.150
And this is transit.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.340
Transit is something that
users in major cities,

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:28.820
like London, do at
least twice a day,

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.340
and sometimes many
more times a day.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.750
So if there's ever anything
that both meets and exceeds

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.630
the toothbrush test, if
you will, it's transit.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:40.130
Right?

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:45.040
So we're very, very excited
to showcase the Android Pay

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.900
experience for transit.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.210
And we've done
that in partnership

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:54.190
with one of the leaders in
contactless payments, Transport

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.210
for London.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:56.510
OK?

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:00.820
Now if you don't know,
Transport for London

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.040
completes 13 million
journeys daily

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:09.370
for Londoners across
tube, rail, and bus.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.530
So it's absolutely huge volumes.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.610
Now what if you could actually
create an experience that

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.650
was just a little bit
faster and more convenient

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.580
for all of these
Londoners taking TFL?

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.590
And so we want to show you what
we worked on with the TFL team.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.940
And it's been an
incredible partnership.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.510
To demonstrate it, I'm going
to direct your attention

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.030
to the left there--
to some TFL gates

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.040
that we've actually
got from London.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.020
It's absolutely cool.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.850
These are the real deal.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.090
And what I'm going
to demonstrate to you

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:52.650
is an experience--
is an experience that

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:58.820
has the exact same thing that
Londoners are using daily.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.830
Right?

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.700
Now the only thing
we've done here

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.180
that's a little
bit more custom, is

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.730
we've showcased an
experience that's

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.389
going to be rolling out
over the next few months.

00:24:10.389 --> 00:24:11.930
And by the end of
the year, we should

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:15.010
have it, which shows you
are truly amazing experience

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.670
in terms of how the receipts
show up with Android Pay

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.150
and want to demonstrate
that to you as well.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.650
So we're very
excited to do this.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.090
But without further
ado, I'm going

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.390
to enter through
one station and then

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:30.910
exit through the other station.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.270
And so you should
be able to see me

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:37.350
entering through the Paddington
Station, I think this is.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:40.730
So if you, [INAUDIBLE], if you
can just focus on the phone

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.430
here so folks can see it.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:44.780
OK, great.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.730
And so I'm going to-- no need
to open my app, nothing else.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:53.340
Literally all I need to
do, tap, and I've just

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.620
paid with my Lloyd's MasterCard.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.360
Absolutely incredible.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:04.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.010
PALI BHAT: Now I think you saw
how fast that experience was.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:10.840
And I personally experienced
this when I was in London.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.770
So I'm going to tap again.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:15.170
It's that simple.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.660
And it truly is faster
than the experience

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.410
that you actually can get
using other forms of payment.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.300
So we're very
excited about this.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.483
And I'm going to show you
the rest of the experience

00:25:26.483 --> 00:25:28.482
on the Wolf Vision, if
you don't mind switching.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:38.340
So the first thing that I'm
going to call your attention to

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.640
is what the receipts show up as.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.810
So I'm going to go to my
Lloyd's Bank MasterCard.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:48.870
Notice that I actually got
two notifications here-- one

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.710
for entering in the
Paddington Station

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:53.080
and other for
exiting in Victoria.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.080
OK?

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.930
Really Cool and I'm going
to just go into one of those

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.030
and it shows you exactly
where my journey was.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.930
So we're very,
very excited to be

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.420
working with TFL to
bring this to Londoners

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.290
who are using Android Pay.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.100
That's the first thing.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:16.930
The second cool feature is today
when you forget to tap out,

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.510
unfortunately what has to
happen is-- and by the way just

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:24.180
to confirm what
I mean, tap out--

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.700
as you enter your journey
you have to tap in,

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.210
as I just demonstrated.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.790
But as you exit, you
have to usually tap out.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:35.080
Sometimes folks who are in
a hurry, forget to tap out.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.260
And they might get charged the
maximum amount for the day.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.520
Now we've solved the problem
for both users and for TFL.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.929
And you can see that I had
taken them a bunch of rides

00:26:47.929 --> 00:26:49.387
while I was there
over the weekend.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.050
And I forgot to tap out
for one of them on purpose.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:00.834
And I got a notification
from Android Pay,

00:27:00.834 --> 00:27:02.500
and I don't know
whether you can see it.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.880
Oh, it is a little white.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.200
So I'm going to try to
tilt it a little bit.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.860
Can you see that now?

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.440
perfect so I have
a notification that

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.010
reminds me to tap out and
complete my journey so I

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.470
can avoid the maximum fare.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.850
It's really awesome for users,
and really awesome for TFL

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:20.850
as well.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.190
So very, very exciting.

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:24.948
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:30.124 --> 00:27:31.540
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
For those of us

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.831
that have had a Hillary
Clinton moment in New York City

00:27:33.831 --> 00:27:37.270
subways, this is
a welcome change.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.580
PALI BHAT: So I've set
up Android Pay right when

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.940
we launched last September.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.580
And I've had my Bank of America
Visa card in Android Pay.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.000
I'm a Bank of America customer.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.590
And I've had my Bank of America
Visa debit card in Android Pay

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:59.740
and I have used it for
all kinds of purchases.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.930
The one thing I've
never been able to do

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.860
with my Bank of
America Visa debit card

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.840
is get cash at an ATM.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.360
But that's changed.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.000
Because we've partnered
with Bank of America.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.160
And to tell us more
is Michelle Moore,

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.280
the Head of Digital
Banking at Bank of America.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.757
Michelle.

00:28:19.757 --> 00:28:20.840
MICHELLE MOORE: Thank you.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.270
Thank you, Pali.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.630
We're really excited
to be here today.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.470
And excited to be a
partner with Android Pay.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.490
Bank of America is
committed to our clients

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:35.740
to make their financial lives
simple, easy, and secure.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.730
And to do just that,
we've heard your feedback.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.560
And we have built, with
Android Pay, the ability

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.550
to withdraw cash at an ATM.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.410
And you can actually
do it live today

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:52.382
across 650 ATMs in the Silicon
Valley and San Francisco area.

00:28:52.382 --> 00:28:53.768
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:01.470
By the end of this month,
we'll be live on 2,400 ATMs.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.710
And by the end of
this year, 5,000 ATMs.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.630
So why don't we take a
walk over to the ATM,

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:08.800
and see this in action?

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.687
PALI BHAT: Awesome.

00:29:09.687 --> 00:29:10.770
Look forward to seeing it.

00:29:14.097 --> 00:29:16.180
MICHELLE MOORE: So I figured
I would take out $20,

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.877
and maybe you can buy me one
of these Android Pay shirts.

00:29:19.877 --> 00:29:21.710
PALI BHAT: Only cost
like 9 bucks, Michelle,

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:22.480
so we'll send you two.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.771
MICHELLE MOORE: We'll have two.

00:29:23.771 --> 00:29:26.440
Thank you.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.490
OK.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:31.130
It's as easy as holding the
phone next to the reader.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.960
It's read the Android Pay.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.360
It's asking me for my pin
number like it normally

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.220
should for security purposes.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.100
So I'll enter in my pin.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.940
$20-- you'll buy
me two t-shirts.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.840
Excellent.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.940
Just what I always wanted.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.120
And here we go.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.037
Live now.

00:29:55.254 --> 00:29:56.727
Here you go.

00:29:56.727 --> 00:29:58.691
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.390
It's that simple.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.850
No more reason to carry around
your debit card or your credit

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:07.350
card.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.160
PALI BHAT: But Michelle,
it's only 16 bucks.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.185
MICHELLE MOORE: You
can keep the change.

00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:13.310
PALI BHAT: Well, thank you.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.970
MICHELLE MOORE: Awesome.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:14.690
PALI BHAT: It's a pleasure.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:14.960
MICHELLE MOORE: Thank you.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.170
PALI BHAT: So we're
super excited.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.420
Thank you for the partnership.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:21.240
And I look forward to using
this at an ATM really close by.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.300
And if you guys are in the San
Francisco area for a little bit

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.810
longer, take advantage of this.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:30.251
Go try it out at an at a
Bank of America ATM near you.

00:30:30.251 --> 00:30:30.750
OK.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.040
MICHELLE MOORE: Right.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.610
Thank you.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:32.901
PALI BHAT: Thank you, Michelle.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.820
So you saw a couple of the use
cases for using Android Pay.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.850
New use cases-- you saw of
course, the journey on TFL,

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.812
and you saw the cash withdrawals
at the Bank of America ATM.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.070
So now, I want to talk
to you about one more

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.210
feature that we're building
in partnership with all

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.950
of our merchants.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.780
And that's the ability
to save money as well.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.320
We already save you time.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.230
And it's convenient.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.830
But what if you could
save your money too?

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.890
And to do that, what I
want to showcase with you

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.130
is the experience that
we've built with Walgreens.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.160
It's available to
all our merchant

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.360
partners, using
an open API again.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.860
But we're really
thrilled about what

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.720
we've built with Walgreens.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:35.410
So let me grab one
of these phones here,

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:40.389
and we can go back
to the Wolf Vision.

00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:41.680
Let me grab both of the phones.

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:45.950
Because I'm going to
show you two different

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:49.700
experiences, and we're
very excited about it.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.250
Can we cut to the Wolf
Vision if you don't mind?

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.193
OK wonderful.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:01.440
So we have-- we
have the phone up.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.550
And before I actually
dive into the demo,

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:06.740
I just want to ask
you a question.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.500
How many of you have signed
up for a loyalty card

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.450
but forgot to use it
when you're in the store?

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.440
It's quite a few of us, right?

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.620
And so we figured we'd
work with the Walgreens

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.220
to help you save the
card to Android Pay

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.690
so we can automatically
use it at checkout.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.010
So that we can
remember it for you,

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:32.220
and you never have to lose
any more points again.

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.530
Now there's two ways to do this.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.420
The first way of course is
if I'm an existing member.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.780
You remember I told you
had a seven-year-old kid?

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.230
Means I'm a frequent
Walgreen's customer.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.730
OK?

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.220
I go there all the time.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.620
And I've signed up for
Balance Awards, which

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.710
is an amazing loyalty program.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:53.830
And so if you're an
existing user like me,

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:58.080
Walgreens can just send
you an e-mail, or an sms,

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.510
or even have a
button on their site

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:04.270
that lets you just save the
Balance Rewards card to Android

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.020
Pay with just one touch.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:10.110
So let me just show it
to you within an e-mail.

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:15.600
So I got an e-mail
from Walgreens,

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.090
and they're giving me an offer
to save this Balance Reward

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.190
card to Android Pay.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.330
And I'm just going to
do that by touching it.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:30.646
And it's that simple.

00:33:30.646 --> 00:33:31.410
OK?

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:35.258
Balance Rewards card
saved to Android Pay.

00:33:35.258 --> 00:33:36.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:45.880
And it's telling you that all I
need to do to use this, is tap

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.960
and I'm set.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.770
OK?

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.150
Very, very exciting.

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:53.402
But then what if you're
not a member already?

00:33:53.402 --> 00:33:55.610
So we decided to build an
amazing experience for that

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:56.110
as well.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:07.380
So I'm going to show you an
experience with an Android Pay.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.100
OK?

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:09.650
Sorry.

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:12.860
Let me get this up.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:18.260
Turns out that I've paid at
Walgreens with my AmEx card

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.670
with an Android Pay.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:24.420
And I have a receipt from
Walgreens already in this app.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.659
So we open up the receipt.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:31.530
It shows me an amazingly
helpful receipt

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:35.040
which has the map, the
exact location where

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.070
I made this purchase.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:39.420
And a personalized
message from Walgreens

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:43.225
that lets me sign up for
the Balance Rewards card.

00:34:43.225 --> 00:34:46.570
So I'm going to
touch "Signup here."

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.949
And notice that all my
information is already

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:50.530
filled OK?

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.090
So no typing at all.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:58.160
I'm going to transfer and share
this information to Walgreens.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:58.970
OK?

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:00.780
Everything is filled in again.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.603
All I have to do is
type in a password,

00:35:03.603 --> 00:35:04.686
which I'm going to do now.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.070
Submit.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:16.630
Save And I'm a new
Balance Rewards member.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:17.895
So very, very cool.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.110
And again, it's as
simple as tapping

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.200
on a Walgreen's terminal in
order to use this Balance

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.610
Rewards card.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.520
So we've made the experience
really, really simple.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.100
And it's available to
all merchants as well.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.447
But let's go and try to
complete this purchase here

00:35:39.447 --> 00:35:41.280
and show you what the
experience looks like.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.640
So we have here a terminal.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.880
Can we switch this?

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.910
We have here a terminal.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:50.850
This is an actual
Walgreens terminal.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.350
OK?

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.610
And we're going to
show you what it's

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:59.390
like to make a purchase of one
of these, really nice, like,

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.640
almonds.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.360
OK?

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.400
Turns out it
normally costs $5.99.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.030
Vinnie, can you just focus
in a little bit closer on it

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.918
so that maybe you can
actually see the charge?

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:16.719
OK.

00:36:16.719 --> 00:36:17.760
So I think you notice it.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.259
Right?

00:36:18.259 --> 00:36:23.190
It's $5.99 except that that's
just the regular price.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.680
If you have a
Balance Rewards card,

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.860
you get a price break on
this, which is very cool.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.570
Helps you save money.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:30.500
OK?

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.010
So what I'm going
to do is show you

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:36.600
how easy it is to use
your Balance Rewards

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.640
card with Android Pay.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.960
So look at my phone.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.550
Again, I don't need
to open the app.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.716
There's a consistent theme--
I don't have to open up

00:36:43.716 --> 00:36:45.959
Android Pay to use it, etc.

00:36:45.959 --> 00:36:46.875
I'm just going to tap.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.740
I've transferred my
Balance Rewards card.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.200
That's simple.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.750
And I've got a price break.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.020
And the new price is $3.99.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.690
And to complete this
purchase, all I have to do

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:07.530
is tap again, transfer my
AmEx, and the purchase is done.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.794
OK?

00:37:08.794 --> 00:37:10.702
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.390
We are very excited
about this experience.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:22.304
So look forward to seeing
more merchants integrate

00:37:22.304 --> 00:37:23.720
to this experience
so that you can

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.480
engage your customers better,
and your customers get

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.510
to save money.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.160
So with that, I want to
hand over to Sridhar.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.618
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
Thank you, Pali.

00:37:34.618 --> 00:37:37.650
These are some
amazing demos, again.

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.350
Of course, we wanted to make
sure that we did something

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:44.120
for small- and medium-sized
merchants as well.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.540
So we worked with Square to make
available for a limited time

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:54.210
to qualified retailers,
a free contactless reader

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.340
as well as discounted payment
processing on all Android Pay

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.230
transactions.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:01.950
We want to make sure that all
merchants get benefit then

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:06.390
consumers use
Android Pay to pay.

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:08.640
I want to touch on something
really, really important.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.060
It is the last portion of our
talk, but it's super critical.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.550
It hits many of the points
that I talked about earlier.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.710
It's clear that financial
institutions-- the ones

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:23.470
that we have our credit,
debit, all these relationships

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:27.490
with-- need to
play an active role

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:31.081
in moving the mobile
payment ecosystem forward.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:37.930
And when we envisioned
Android Pay,

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:41.780
we created APIs that
these banks could

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.970
use to bring the
payment experience

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.410
right within their app.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:49.620
Why is this a big deal?

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:53.120
Because there's a lot of
detail to implementing

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.090
a great payments experience.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.570
And they could integrate
it right into their app,

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:03.150
saving themselves a lot of
implementation headaches,

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.410
security headaches,
and of course time--

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:09.400
which is the most
important currency.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:14.950
And they do that, then they're
free to innovate on what else

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:17.980
they offer their consumers.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.420
These banks are often the
ones that know us best.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.640
They're the ones that are
observing our transactions.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.264
You know, they're the ones that
we have our relationships with.

00:39:25.264 --> 00:39:27.420
We think this will drive
a lot of innovation

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:33.540
in how mobile payments are
brought out to consumers.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:37.110
So we're very pleased
that a number of banks

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:41.040
both in the US and
abroad, are working

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:47.180
with us to integrate Android
Pay directly into their app.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.170
We think this will
drive more innovation

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.310
and provide more
flexibility for consumers.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.060
We think of this as a
win-win for Android,

00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:00.920
Android Pay and for
you know, these banks

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.763
and of course consumers as well.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:09.450
And with that, now
I want to thank

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:13.640
all of you, our
developer partners,

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.610
in bringing this
Android story forward.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:19.120
Without us working
together, there's

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.820
not going to be a
lot of innovation.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:24.640
And so we really look to
working with you to improve

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.310
the way mobile payments work.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:30.470
So for us to get past the
which-pay-is-doing-what

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:34.260
and more, to mobile payments
just work in a way that is

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:39.621
expected, and convenient
for all of us.

00:40:39.621 --> 00:40:41.370
So thanks to all of
you who are helping us

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.710
realize this vision
of Android Pay being

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:51.510
everywhere-- in mobile apps, in
physical stores, in mobile web

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:53.300
as well.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.940
So Pali and I have
barely touched

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.840
on the surface of topics
that can literally

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.290
take days of discussion.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.390
We're going to be having
lots of breakout sessions

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:03.490
over the next two days
and I think one right

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:03.870
after this session.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:04.610
PALI BHAT: The one
right after this.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.200
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: Right here.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.030
And so please attend those.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.370
Please ask us lots of questions.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:12.920
They'll be folks from
the payments team in all

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.360
of these breakout sessions.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.560
We look forward to
talking with you,

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.870
and really helping bring
this vision of Android

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.470
Pay to the larger world.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:24.300
And with that, thank
you all for coming.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.500
[APPLAUSE]
