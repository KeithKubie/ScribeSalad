00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.490
In the last video,
we tried to come up

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.120
with a somewhat rigorous
definition of what a limit is,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.520
where we say when you
say that the limit of f

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.090
of x as x approaches C is
equal L, you're really saying--

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.740
and this is the somewhat
rigorous definition--

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.540
that you can get f
of x as close as you

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.870
want to L by making x
sufficiently close to C.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.120
So let's see if we can put
a little bit of meat on it.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.280
So instead of saying
as close as you want,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.285
let's call that some
positive number epsilon.

00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:32.210
So I'm just going to use the
Greek letter epsilon right over

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.860
there.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.600
So it really turns into a game.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.920
So this is the game.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:54.450
You tell me how close you
want f of x to be to L.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.050
And you do this by giving me
a positive number that we call

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.810
epsilon, which is really
how close you want

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:10.220
f of x to be to L. So you give
a positive number epsilon.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.780
And epsilon is how
close do you want to be?

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.540
How close?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.260
So for example, if
epsilon is 0.01,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.870
that says that you want f of x
to be within 0.01 of epsilon.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.790
And so what I then
do is I say well, OK.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.530
You've given me that epsilon.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:39.130
I'm going to find you another
positive number which we'll

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.750
call delta-- the lowercase
delta, the Greek letter

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:56.210
delta-- such that where
if x is within delta of C,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:10.129
then f of x will be within
epsilon of our limit.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.420
So let's see if these are
really saying the same thing.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.400
In this yellow definition
right over here,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.520
we said you can
get f of x as close

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.400
as you want to L by making
x sufficiently close to C.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.042
This second definition,
which I kind of

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:26.190
made as a little bit more of a
game, is doing the same thing.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.126
Someone is saying how close
they want f of x to be to L

00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:33.710
and the burden is then to
find a delta where as long

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.240
as x is within delta
of C, then f of x

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.460
will be within
epsilon of the limit.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.380
So that is doing it.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.190
It's saying look, if we are
constraining x in such a way

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.210
that if x is in that
range to C, then

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.825
f of x will be as
close as you want.

00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:51.450
So let's make this
a little bit clearer

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.690
by diagramming right over here.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.210
You show up and you
say well, I want

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.690
f of x to be within
epsilon of our limit.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.600
This point right over here
is our limit plus epsilon.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:17.510
And this right over here might
be our limit minus epsilon.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.010
And you say, OK, sure.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.380
I think I can get your f of x
within this range of our limit.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.430
And I can do that by
defining a range around C.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.150
And I could visually
look at this boundary.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
But I could even go
narrower than that boundary.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.570
I could go right over here.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.590
Says OK, I meet your challenge.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.940
I will find another
number delta.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.010
So this right over
here is C plus delta.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.170
This right over here
is C minus-- let

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.770
me write this down--
is C minus delta.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.020
So I'll find you some
delta so that if you

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.415
take any x in the range
C minus delta to C

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:03.350
plus delta-- and maybe
the function's not even

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.350
defined at C, so
we think of ones

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.350
that maybe aren't C, but
are getting very close.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.370
If you find any x in
that range, f of those

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.459
x's are going to be as close
as you want to your limit.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.686
They're going to be within
the range L plus epsilon or L

00:04:22.686 --> 00:04:24.850
minus epsilon.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.390
So what's another
way of saying this?

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.350
Another way of saying this
is you give me an epsilon,

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.160
then I will find you a delta.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.670
So let me write this in a
little bit more math notation.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.310
So I'll write the
same exact statements

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.771
with a little bit
more math here.

00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:41.020
But it's the exact same thing.

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:45.980
Let me write it this way.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:55.480
Given an epsilon
greater than 0-- so

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.800
that's kind of the
first part of the game--

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:06.330
we can find a delta
greater than 0, such

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.540
that if x is within delta of C.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.304
So what's another way of saying
that x is within delta of C?

00:05:17.304 --> 00:05:18.720
Well, one way you
could say, well,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.010
what's the distance
between x and C

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.030
is going to be less than delta.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.240
This statement is true for any
x that's within delta of C.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.810
The difference between the two
is going to be less than delta.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.290
So that if you pick an x that
is in this range between C

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.820
minus delta and C
plus delta, and these

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.480
are the x's that satisfy
that right over here, then--

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.440
and I'll do this in
a new color-- then

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.920
the distance between your
f of x and your limit--

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.920
and this is just the
distance between the f of x

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.450
and the limit, it's going
to be less than epsilon.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.770
So all this is saying is, if
the limit truly does exist,

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.990
it truly is L, is if you give
me any positive number epsilon,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.580
it could be super, super small
one, we can find a delta.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.970
So we can define
a range around C

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.220
so that if we take
any x value that

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.770
is within delta of C,
that's all this statement

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.570
is saying that the
distance between x and C

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.830
is less than delta.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.330
So it's within delta
of C. So that's

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.080
these points right over here.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.440
That f of those
x's, the function

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.150
evaluated at those x's is
going to be within the range

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.970
that you are specifying.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.130
It's going to be within
epsilon of our limit.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.810
The f of x, the difference
between f of x, and your limit

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.840
will be less than epsilon.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.490
Your f of x is going to
sit some place over there.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.840
So that's all the epsilon-delta
definition is telling us.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.660
In the next video, we will
prove that a limit exists

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.710
by using this
definition of limits.
