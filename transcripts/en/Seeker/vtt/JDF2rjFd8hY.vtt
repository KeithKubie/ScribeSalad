00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.800
2/3 of people in
the United States

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.820
know that we only
use 10% of our brain.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.990
And by "know," I mean are
crazy, horribly, mistaken.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.079
Anthony here for D News, and
according to a brain health

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.620
survey from the Michael J. Fox
Foundation, 65% of Americans

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.752
think that we only use 10% of
our brains on a daily basis.

00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:24.960
It's definitely something
I've heard in my life over,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.850
over and over again.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.575
Wait a minute.

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:28.120
Were those people insulting me?

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.840
Here's the deal.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.660
That is false.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.530
It is crazy false.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.790
There's not a part of your
brain that you do not use.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.720
There is no dormant part
with psychic abilities

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.580
or the potential to
instantly memorize

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.820
anything you see hidden
behind some cranial roadblock

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.410
up there.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.810
The human brain is an
incredibly complex organ.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.410
And all its little bits
are highly specialized,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.460
some of them in ways that we are
just beginning to understand.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.030
The myth probably started
through a misquote

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.130
of the findings of a
study guide in the 1890s

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.030
by William James
and Boris Sidis,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.700
where they attempted to raise
a child prodigy in a way that

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.820
would actually accelerate
his intelligence.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.410
After raising the
kid to an IQ of 250,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.140
James said people
only meet a fraction

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.040
of their full mental potential.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.950
He just meant we don't challenge
ourselves enough mentally.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.600
It's also possible
that the myth came

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.750
from early neurological research
in the 19th or 20th century.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.440
As scientists started digging
around in all those brains,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.260
it seemed like there were bits
that didn't change anything

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.880
if they were damaged or removed.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.780
And now, we know
that some areas just

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.184
have very subtle and
specialized functions,

00:01:29.184 --> 00:01:31.600
stuff you might not be able
to tell is missing right away.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.100
I mean, there's a
part of our brain

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.320
that is just dedicated to
making electrical sockets look

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.200
like faces.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.440
We also know that the brain
can rearrange and reassign

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.360
functions to a
new part of itself

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.840
if an old one is damaged.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.930
But it's easy to see
how early data could

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.330
have made it seem otherwise.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.020
We've got way better brain
data now, thanks to stuff

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.990
like fMRIs and
PET scans that can

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.680
show what the whole brain
is up to at any time

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.360
down to these tiny
electrodes that

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.420
can monitor the activity
of a single cell.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.160
And they all show
the same thing.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.720
Your whole brain is always
worrying and humming

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.330
with activity.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.300
Certain sections work harder
than others at certain times.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.039
But except for people with
actual localized brain damage,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.627
nothing is completely dark.

00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:13.210
There are some other
things that point

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.460
to the myth being wrong too.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.770
I mean, our brain uses 20%
of our body's total energy.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.740
Why would it need so much
if it was mostly dormant?

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.320
Also, unused brain cells
actually degenerate.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.720
And autopsies of human
brains don't ever

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.000
show large-scale
degeneration that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.980
wasn't caused by
an actual disease.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.560
So no, you are not a
pill or a technique

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.770
away from being a
psychically-powered warrior.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.650
But the real unmangled
quote from William James

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.690
is still true.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.170
Most of us don't meet
our mental potential.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.210
So now that you know that you
can access all 100 billion

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.380
of those neurons of yours at any
given time, go out and do it.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.802
I'm going to learn
French this afternoon.

00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:52.260
I wonder which part
of the brain is

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.320
responsible for unhealthy
levels of optimism.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.020
Hey, what do you want to
know about the human brain?

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.978
Let us know down below.

00:02:56.978 --> 00:02:59.470
And we'll answer some of those
questions in future videos.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.822
