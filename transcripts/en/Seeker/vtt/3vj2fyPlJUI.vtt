00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.740
How do these massive oceans of snow and ice
stay on a mountain in the first place?

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:15.230
When an avalanche starts, is there anything
we can do?

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.420
The power of nature is devastating, as pictures
and video of the recent earthquake and avalanche

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.390
in Nepal illustrate, but avalanches don't
just happen during earthquakes, and, in fact,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.789
are far more common than you think; but not
for the reasons you may think.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.540
An avalanche is a falling mass of snow, ice,
and rock that tumbles rapidly down a mountainside.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.840
They can be dangerous, and deadly.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.550
These massive clouds of rock and frozen water
can reach 80 miles per hour (129 kph), sweeping

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.110
trees, buildings and even massive steam trains
out of the way.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.600
Dry snow avalanches can reach speeds of more
than 200 miles per hour (322 kph).

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.989
Avalanches are formed because of the physics
inherent in the natural process of snowpack.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.920
Mountains alter how air flows over the surface
of the planet.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.390
When moist air hits a mountain it must either
go around, or up and over -- but to do either

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.390
it must CHANGE.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.430
If it goes up, the air cools, and moisture
condenses into rain or snow.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.490
As the tallest mountain in the world, Everest
collects a lot of cold wind and precipitation

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.050
as the air moves around and over it -- and
as the snow falls, it creates the conditions

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.330
for an avalanche.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.941
Snow crystals, as you'd know if you're a subscriber
to DNews -- if you aren't come join us! -- come

00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:23.370
in a few shapes.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.800
Most are six pointed water crystals, which
lock together nicely.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.390
When snow comes in contact with super-cooled
air, like it can on mountains, the snowflakes

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.260
form rime or, like, a frost on the edges -- sometimes
forming a gravel-like snow called graupel.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.670
Different snow falls in different conditions,
forming specific layers on the mountainside.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.740
The danger in an avalanche, aside from the
speed, is the sheer volume and mass of the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.740
speeding snow.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.740
In April of 2014, a MASSIVE formation weighing
31 and-a-half million pounds sloughed off

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.670
an Everest glacier, killing 16 sherpas.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.970
And stories like this are relatively common
in many mountain-ranges across our planet.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.020
Plus, once the snow stops falling, it sets
up like concrete and the weight compresses

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.970
the snowpack, meaning death often occurs from
injury or suffocation, aside from hypothermia.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.310
Cartoons made me believe sound causes avalanches,
but while 90 percent of avalanches are caused

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.880
by a victim or a member of the victim's party,
it's not due to sound.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.900
Avalanches are ACTUALLY caused simply by weight
of the snow thanks to gravity.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.550
The snow is in three layers, the oldest most
packed-in snow on the bottom is compressed

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.430
and solid -- that's called the bed surface.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.780
The middle layer is a weak layer of snow which
initiates the slide -- called the weak layer;

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.700
or failure layer; and then on top is the slab.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.150
Slabs are new snow, or compressed and compacted
chunks of snow and ice which break off and

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.760
begin the avalanche.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.960
When a slab sits on a failure layer, at JUST
the right slope -- between 35 and 45 degrees

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.920
-- the slab will break off.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.940
Slabs range from 10 centimeters to several
meters thick.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.350
This also means that avalanches are more common
after a new, heavy snow -- which can add a

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.150
lot of weight to an already-loose slab.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.970
Though that is not the whole story in Nepal
-- where a 7.8 magnitude earthquake shook

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.040
the snow off the mountain.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.510
And for more background on the geology of
that region and why Nepal is prone to earthquakes,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.180
watch this DNews episode from Julia:

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:34.030
Ultimately, avalanches and earthquakes are
going to happen and once they do, there's

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.630
nothing to stop them.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.010
But the more we understand them, perhaps the
better prepared we can be when these disasters

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.660
strike again.
