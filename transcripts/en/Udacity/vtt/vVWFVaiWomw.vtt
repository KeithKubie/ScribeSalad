00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.170
Now that you know a few design principles, and

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.310
how to compose graphics, let's go through a few different narrative

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.390
structures that you can use to walk your viewers through your visualization.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.970
&gt;&gt; In addition to narrative structures,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.150
I'll teach you about the data collection process and data processing.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.580
I'll also show you some examples of bias, and

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.269
what you should avoid when creating graphics.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.720
&gt;&gt; In all the visualizations we've created and encountered in this class,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.560
one thing that was absent, was any idea of context or narrative.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.610
Often when you're reading a newspaper, a blog post, or

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.730
an article, there's some story that connects all the pieces together.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.540
Think of narrative as the invisible string that ties the frames of

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.650
a movie together, or the binding of a book that glues the pages together.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.460
Let's walk through how journalists approach this problem and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.560
create stories of their own.
