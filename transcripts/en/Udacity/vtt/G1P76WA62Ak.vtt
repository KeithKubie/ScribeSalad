00:00:00.286 --> 00:00:03.490
So now, let's just talk to you about Indexes, and

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.350
how every query needs to have an Index. So let's see

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.950
what happens, if you deploy an application to app spot, that

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.970
requires a new index. So what we're going to do, is

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.920
update our Filter Playground Method. You may have called this method

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.150
something else, but this is the method where you've been adding

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.260
your hardwired filters. Anyway, we're going to update it to filter

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.700
for another thing. So for example, let's filter it for conferences

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.400
in June. So we just filter on month equals six, because

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.590
the month is recorded by an integer and six is June.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.130
After you've added this filter, go ahead and deploy your application

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.490
directly to app spot. In this case, do not run the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.590
query on local host first. I know I've been telling you

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.840
always run it on local host first, but now I want

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.890
you to see what happens if you don't. So, don't run

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.160
it on local host, just run it directly on app spot.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.120
Try running your query in the API's explorer. What happens?
