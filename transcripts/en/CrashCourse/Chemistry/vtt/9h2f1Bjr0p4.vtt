00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.159
I want you to think, just for a second about
breathing.

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.370
But don't just think about the fact that you
are breathing.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.610
Think about all the variables that have to be just so in order to create the air -- and to make the air breathable.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.799
So you need oxygen in the air but also if
the air was just oxygen, you would die.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.380
The oxygen has to be mixed with nitrogen and
other gases,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.360
and the whole concoction has to be at the right pressure and temperature in order to deliver

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.200
the amount of O2 that you need.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.810
The air that you are breathing is a solution.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.380
Also, not to belabor the point, but you are also kind of a solution as well, albeit a sentient one.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.460
A solution, you'll recall back when we were
doing my dirty laundry,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.890
is a mixture in which the particles of a solute
are dissolved in the particles of a solvent.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.870
So, what's the solvent in air?
Well, whatever there's more of.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.520
So, nitrogen is the solvent and oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, and a bunch of other gases are dissolved in it.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.980
All solutions have the qualities that they
do because of the same 3 properties;

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
Molecular Structure, Pressure,
and Temperature

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.489
These are the factors that effect a substances
solubility,

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.609
the amount of solute that will dissolve per
volume of solvent.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.600
Whether we're talking about the air that we
breathe, the water that fish breathe,

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.580
the bubbles in Coca-Cola, or the toxin in
the tissues of the Japanese puffer fish,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.860
what usually matters most about a solution
is how much solute is in it.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:22.580
[Theme Music]

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.320
Often, in the lab we use placeholders like 'dilute' and 'concentrated' when talking about solutions.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.700
But those are vague terms, and we should generally
be as precise as possible.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520
Here are a few ways to do that.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.480
We could describe a solution by its molarity -- the number of moles of solute per liter of solution;

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.720
its molality -- the number of moles of solute
per kilogram of solvent; or its mass percent.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.720
The mass percent of a solution is the mass of the solute divided by the mass of the solution all multiplied by 100.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.140
So, when a can of your average soft drink has about 33 grams of sugar and a total mass of 355 grams:

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.420
divide the mass of the solute by the mass
of the whole thing times 100

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.240
and the mass percent of sugar in the solution
is 9.2%.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.980
Easy-peasy there, but the more interesting
question here is ‘why?’

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.580
Why can you even dissolve so much sugar in a can of soda and what about all that carbon dioxide gas?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.079
What’s happening here?

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.820
How does the stuff go in the stuff and where does it go and what’s actually happening at the molecular level?

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.489
Well, the first thing to keep in mind is that
not every solvent can dissolve every solute.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.489
Gas molecules don’t interact that strongly, so gases pretty much always dissolve in each other.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.450
But, liquid solvents have a ton of molecular
interaction.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.030
So the structure of the individual molecules
determines whether a substance will dissolve

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.610
and how well it will dissolve.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.860
Polarity is, of course, the biggest bit of
this.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.239
For a substance to dissolve, it needs to interact
favorably with the solvent.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.820
This only happens if they have similar polarities which allows them to form cool, in-solution structures,

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.090
spacing the solute particles out evenly.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.630
Topic change! Say you’re on a first date,
at a sushi restaurant,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.300
and you wanna be all cool and nonchalant and
“I’ll tangle if death if death wants me to.”

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.940
So you order the puffer fish, otherwise known
as Fugu.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.200
Fugu contains a poison called tetrodotoxin,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.439
and even in the hands of chefs who know what they’re doing, it makes your lips go numb just to taste a bit.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.760
If the chef makes a mistake and you eat the
wrong part of the fish,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.100
the tetrodotoxin will mess with your nervous system and cause paralysis, suffocation, maybe some death.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.120
Why? Well, in part because of its polarity.
And yours.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.640
Tetrodotoxin is covered on its surface with
polar alcohol and Amin groups.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.639
So, it dissolves easily in polar solvents
like water.

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.269
And who’s made mostly of water?

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.870
So, if you watch Crash Course Biology, you
know all about sodium channels,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.430
the tunnels on the outside of nerve cells
that allow them to communicate with each other.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.690
Well, tetrodotoxin is really good at binding
to those channels,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.410
messing up your nervous system, and killing
you.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.630
Because it’s so polar, and your body’s
just one big aqueous solution,

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.330
tetrodotoxin has free reign to just jump on
every sodium pump you got.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.620
Now, onto the next attribute that affects
solubility.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.819
Let’s assume you’ve survived your first
course of your meal and you order a soda-pop.

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.120
To get all those bubbles that make carbonated
beverages so refreshing and tingly,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.780
carbon dioxide must be dissolved in the water.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.040
But how do you shove a gas into a liquid?

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.579
A gas gets dissolved into a solution the same
way David Bowie and Freddy Mercury collaborate.

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.479
[sings] Under pressure.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.640
What? As previously noted, I am old!

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.980
It’s not just the pressure outside of the solvent, it’s the partial pressure of the solute.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.220
Quick review: partial pressure is the portion of pressure caused by the gas we’re interested in.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.200
In this case, carbon dioxide.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.010
Gas molecules, as long as they have kinetic
energy, are going to want to escape the solution,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.500
so they will be creating an upward pressure
on the surrounding gas.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.360
In order to keep the CO2 dissolved,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.560
the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and
the gas outside the solution has to be equal to,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.240
or higher than the pressure of the carbon dioxide molecules pushing their way out of the solution.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.450
That’s why soda bottles are nice and taut
when you squeeze them.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.600
That little bit of gas up there is pressurized
carbon dioxide.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.260
And, also why, when you open the can a huge rush of carbon dioxide molecules bubble out of the soda.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.400
Because the normal partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere isn’t enough to keep it from escaping.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.250
So, to get the carbon dioxide in there,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.150
all you need to do is dramatically increase
the pressure of CO2 outside the liquid.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.900
And this is what’s done in soda manufacturing
plants.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.760
In fact, if you have a SodaStream, you can
do it right in your own home.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.430
Now it’s easy to calculate this change in
pressure thanks to William Henry,

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.640
a friend of John Dalton of Dalton’s Law
of Partial Pressures.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.920
According to Henry’s Law, the concentration of a dissolved gas equals the partial pressure above the solution

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.370
multiplied by a constant that expresses the
solubility of the gas in that solution.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.440
And we can use Henry’s Law to figure out how much carbon dioxide is dissolved in our can of soda.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:45.700
The pressure of CO2 in a can is 5.0 atmospheres and you can look up the solubility of CO2 in an aqueous solution.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.220
3.4 times 10 to the negative 2 moles per liter
atmosphere.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.680
So the concentration of dissolved CO2 in 0.17
moles per liter.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.830
Now, there are 355 milliliters or 0.355 liters
of cola in a can.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.170
How much volume would that CO2 take up at
normal atmospheric conditions?

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:08.580
Whip out your trusty ideal gas law and we
find that atmospheric pressure and 298 kelvins,
or room temperature,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.620
0.060 moles of carbon dioxide will expand
to about 1 and a half liters.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.540
That’s a lot of burps, something else to
keep in mind on date night.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.580
Finally, in addition to polarity an pressure, it’s temperature that affects solubility in the most complicated,

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.280
and therefore interesting ways.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.520
When we’re dealing with solid solutes and
liquid solvents,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.000
their total solubility generally goes up as
temperature increases.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.160
This is a fact that you already know if you’ve tried to put a bunch of sugar into your iced coffee.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.790
The solubility of gases, on the other hand,
is the exact opposite

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:44.170
because colder molecules have less kinetic energy and are less likely to escape the surface of the liquid.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.870
So, the upward pressure they exert is lower
than it would be in a hot liquid.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.480
That’s why it’s safer and cleaner to open a can of soda-pop when it’s cold rather than when it’s hot.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.120
While this phenomenon might result in a bit
of mess in your house,

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.020
it’s a much bigger deal for fish, who need
oxygen dissolved in water to, like, breathe.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:06.040
At 4 degrees Celsius the solubility of oxygen in water is about double that of what it is at 25 degrees Celsius.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.139
Trout, here in Montana, are highly evolved
to that nice, oxygen rich water.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.410
But summer heat waves can cause the amount
of oxygen in the water to drop dramatically,

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.630
and cold-water fish can get pretty unhappy.
Also, a little dead.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.889
Fortunately for Fugu, it’s a tropical fish,
so it’s perfectly evolved for 25 degree water.

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:28.669
And unfortunately for all of us, that brings us the end of this episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:30.840
If you’ve been paying attention today you
learned:

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.410
that solutions can be described in terms of
molarity, molality, or mass percent;

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:41.040
that polar solvents tend to dissolve polar solutes, and nonpolar solvents tend to dissolve nonpolar solutes;

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.080
you also learned about Henry’s Law which
states that the concentration of dissolved gas

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.270
equals the partial pressure of that gas above
the solution multiplied by a constant;

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.970
and that there are a lot of burps in every
single can of coke.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.620
