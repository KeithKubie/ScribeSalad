00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.380
So let's review
the situation that

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.850
has been emerging in Greece.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.860
And then dig a little bit
deeper as to their options.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.100
So as we saw on the
last video, Greece

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.440
was spending a lot more
than it was bringing it

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.300
in tax revenues.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.010
So it was running
these deficits.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.560
And year after year, these
deficits we're piling up.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.420
And the national
debt was increasing.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.850
And to make matters
worse, Greece actually

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.740
tried to cover this up for
many years with some accounting

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.390
shenanigans because there were
some European Central Bank

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.800
rules about how much
debt you could take on.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.370
And so it was trying to not
trigger those rules while still

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.750
being able to take on more
debt so that it could fund

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.990
this spending right over here.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.340
But then, in the last few
years, it became clear.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.350
The shenanigans were cleared up.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.280
And when they were
cleared up, one, it

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.950
made people realize,
wow, that was

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.320
kind of shady what they did.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.340
But on top of that, they
had a much larger government

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.300
public debt burden
than people thought.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.870
And the combination of
the two-- the combination

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.650
that this country was
actively trying to not make

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.610
its obligations to be
transparent to the markets,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.600
and on top of that, that
this debt burden was so huge,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.930
it made people wary of whether
the country would actually

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200
be able to fulfill
its obligations.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.380
So trust.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.170
Investor trust.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.360
When I talk about
investors, I'm talking

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.080
about the people who would
invest in Greek bonds.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.000
So, essentially, the
lenders to Greece.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.550
Their trust went down and
they expected higher interest.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.260
So they expected higher interest
from the Greek government.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.570
And that made things worse.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.680
Now, not only did
they have to keep

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.200
spending on all of their
entitlements, but now the cost

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.550
of funding that existing
debt that they already

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.860
and any new debt that they
had to do to keep spending

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.920
at that rate, the cost of
that debt itself went up.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.870
And that only added fuel to
this ballooning debt problem.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.650
Now the last video, we
explored a couple of options.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.400
In particular, we said,
what about austerity?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.572
What about the situation
where you just really,

00:02:11.572 --> 00:02:13.530
mainly, you could try to
increase your revenues

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.460
or slash spending.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.790
But people really try to
focus on the spending side.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.490
What if we really
just try to slash

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.790
the spending in a
very severe way?

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.054
Really just cut
straight to the bone?

00:02:23.054 --> 00:02:24.470
Well, there's a
couple of problems

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.700
there we thought about.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.020
One problem was that
it's not popular at all.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.542
It's not popular at all.

00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:33.000
And then the bigger
problem was, is

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.380
you're already in a recession.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.930
You're already in a recession.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.875
And this could make the
recession more severe.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300
And frankly, it was not popular.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.510
It's never popular.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.450
But it became-- even as
we move now in 2012--

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.500
it's even less popular
because Greece has already

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.570
gone through a couple of
rounds of this austerity.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.070
This is not a new problem.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.500
They've been bailed
out in small ways.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.350
And I'll talk more
about what a bailout is.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.004
But as part of that
package, the people

00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:06.670
who've been billing
them out says, look,

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.910
if we're going to
give you something.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.120
If we're going to use some
of our own taxpayer money

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.800
to help you out, you've
got to cut your spending.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.500
But what's happened in every
round of austerity so far,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.190
is that helped slow the
economy even further.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.747
That recession kept
deepening and deepening.

00:03:20.747 --> 00:03:22.330
And it's comments
sense that it would.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.650
If the government stop
spending in a big way,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.172
it slows down an
already slow economy.

00:03:28.172 --> 00:03:29.630
Now, the other
thing that you might

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.700
be saying, why doesn't Greece
just stop paying its debt?

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.010
Why doesn't it just
default on its debt?

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.877
So why doesn't it just default?

00:03:39.877 --> 00:03:40.960
Say, hey, we're a country.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.251
I'm sorry, investors, that
you had to take a loss here.

00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:44.960
But we're just not
paying any more.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.910
Well, the problem is,
it has a situation where

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.190
it's spending more
than it's bringing in.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.850
And its obligations
are all in the Euro.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.670
It does not have
its own currency.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.027
And so, if they were to default
on their debt-- obviously,

00:04:00.027 --> 00:04:02.110
the people who lent the
money will be very upset--

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.651
and there's no way
that they're going

00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:05.430
to lend more money to Greece.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.830
And if they don't lend
more money to Greece--

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.511
if they don't lend
more Euros to Greece,

00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:12.260
Greece is not going
to be able to continue

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.880
spending Euros the way it has.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.572
It's promising all of
the pension, retirees,

00:04:17.572 --> 00:04:19.620
the unemployed
insurance-- it's paying

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.089
all those obligations in Euros.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.672
And if they default,
they're not going

00:04:22.672 --> 00:04:25.320
to be able to borrow more
Euros to do those obligations.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.410
And, once again, it'll be a
very fast and violent austerity

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.730
because there wouldn't even
be the money to fund that.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.570
You would have this
very drastic, almost,

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.390
shut down of the government.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.260
So this right over here
is not a good option.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.410
Now to start exploring
the third option,

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.750
and this is the option
that it seems likely

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.050
that Greece might have
to go in, let's think

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.900
about what Greece
could have done

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.590
if it had monetary independence.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.000
If it had its own currency.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.310
So just remember, this is
completely hypothetical.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.600
Greece did have its own
currency, the Drachma,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.270
before it joined the Euro.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.890
But let's think
about what it could

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.610
have done in this
situation, if it actually

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.240
did have its own currency.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.700
It's not cut and dry here
because Greece was actually

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.250
able to, and historically,
borrowed very cheap rates

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.470
because it was part
of this Eurozone.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.970
But let's just think
about it, if it

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.540
was in this situation,
what it could have done

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.050
if it had its own central bank.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.497
So this is some of the
stats from our last video.

00:05:24.497 --> 00:05:26.330
And if it had its own
central bank-- and let

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.330
me make this very clear.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.700
This is all hypothetical.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.460
Greece does not have its
own central bank right now.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.790
All of the Eurozone
countries-- the Euro

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.520
is printed by the
European Central Bank.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.640
It's not by any one country.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.050
But, hypothetically,
let's say that Greece

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.420
does have a central bank.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.620
So Greek Central Bank
that prints it's own--

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.700
let's call it the New Drachma.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.890
And so that Greek Central Bank,
in this type of a situation,

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.610
could just start
printing Drachma.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.330
And, essentially,
use that Drachma

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.160
to buy government bonds.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.870
So it could buy
government bonds.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.140
So it's, essentially,
printing that money.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.640
And when it buys
government bonds,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.710
its lending it to
the government.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.930
It lends to the government.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.130
And so the government could
spend on entitlements.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.500
Government could spend on all
of its various obligations.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.094
Now that might seem
very convenient.

00:06:21.094 --> 00:06:22.760
Essentially, one part
of the government,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.060
or something pseudo associated
with the government,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.060
prints money, essentially lends
it to the government, funds

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.960
its obligation.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.793
But the immediate thing
you might say, well,

00:06:30.793 --> 00:06:33.370
if you just print currency
like this Willy-nilly,

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.033
won't this right over
here lead to inflation?

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.630
And the simple answer
is, it probably will.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.980
But that actually
might be the solution

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.230
if you're in a conundrum
like what Greece is in.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.090
First of all, inflation
might not be so bad.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.966
Right now, the country's
in a deep recession.

00:06:53.966 --> 00:06:55.423
So there's all this
extra capacity.

00:06:55.423 --> 00:06:57.880
So you might even have a
little bit of a price cushion.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.750
And, just in general,
the inflation rates

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.130
aren't alter dramatic.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.050
They're not super low, but
they're not super high either.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.609
So you might have to worry about
a hyper-inflationary situation.

00:07:09.609 --> 00:07:11.400
But on top of that,
the government probably

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.960
wants a respectable
amount of inflation.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.640
It might not want
100%, 1000% inflation.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.650
But it might like 10, 20,
or 30% year inflation.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.820
And to think about that,
think about the idea,

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.530
in this hypothetical Greece,
all of its obligations

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.910
would not be in
Euro, its obligations

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.950
would be in the Drachma.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.242
And so you can imagine a world.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.908
So let's think of a
hypothetical Greece.

00:07:32.908 --> 00:07:34.860
And I'm going to use
hypothetical numbers just

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.890
to make things more simple
to understand or to do

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:38.649
in our heads.

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:40.190
Let's take this
hypothetical Greece--

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.260
it could be Greece or
really any country.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:51.530
And let's say it has a
GDP of-- let's call it

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.540
100 of its currency.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.420
Let's say 100
Drachma as its GDP.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:06.380
And let's say it has
entitlement obligations--

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.380
and this is all on an annual
basis-- of, let's say,

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.432
10 billion of its
currency, of its Drachma.

00:08:12.432 --> 00:08:13.890
This isn't the
situation in Greece.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.680
All of its obligations
are in Euros.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.510
But let's just think
about the situation.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.480
And let's say that
on top of that,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.950
it has debt obligations--
so the total debt.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.030
The total value of debt.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.920
Let's say that it was-- I don't
know-- another 150 billion

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.084
of its currency.

00:08:32.084 --> 00:08:33.500
If you were to
inflate-- let's say

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.480
you inflate over
a couple of years.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.190
So inflation occurs.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.320
And let's say you have 100%
inflation over a few years.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.470
But in real terms, your
GDP doesn't change.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.690
This is really just more
of a thought experiment.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.010
So then, in real terms,
if you have 100% inflation

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.100
but you're producing
the same amount,

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.499
the nominal value of your
GDP will now be 200 billion.

00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:57.290
It's the same amount
of goods and services,

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.500
but everything now
costs twice as much.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.210
So you would value
it at 200 billion.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.530
If you're inflation adjusted, it
would still be at 100 billion.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.530
The good thing--
and it's very seldom

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.250
the use inflation
in a good context--

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.500
but what would be good about
Greece in this situation,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.490
is that these
entitlement obligations,

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.310
they would still be 10 billion.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.810
You're still going
to say, I'm still

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:17.750
going to pay you 10 billion.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.833
Even though that 10 billion
is going to buy people

00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:21.126
half is much.

00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:23.500
That is much easier to do
politically than telling people

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.090
overnight that I'm going to
reduce your pension by half.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.710
That's political suicide.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.700
But to inflate away
the obligations,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.950
nominally it looks like
you're paying the same thing.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.170
But just buying less.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.250
It's a little bit
more viable to do.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.650
And the same thing is true
of your debt obligations.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.990
Your debt obligations
won't adjust to inflation.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.050
And so you would
still owe 150 billion.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.100
But as a percentage
of GDP, you've

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.480
now halved how big that debt is.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.410
You've halved how big the
entitlement obligations are.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.422
So that's actually
a viable solution.

00:09:54.422 --> 00:09:55.880
And in this
hypothetical situation,

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.700
it's probably the best
solution for government

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.800
to, essentially, inflate
away its obligations.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.770
So I'll leave you with that.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.540
Something for you
to think about.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.000
And then we could think about
what could Greece actually

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.350
do in this direction.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.150
But more importantly,
let's think about--

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.440
and you could start
to think about-- why

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.740
is the whole world so scared?

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.700
All of this is Greece.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.360
It's a relatively small country.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.820
Why is the whole
Eurozone so scared?

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.410
Why are people thinking about
bailing out Greece in some way

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.880
to prevent all of this
craziness from happening?

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.680
And what are the repercussions
in the larger, global market?

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.230
But I'll leave you
there and leave

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.790
you to think about
all this stuff.
