00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.871
Every year, about 1,000 new words are
added to the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:14.031
Where do they come from,

00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:17.627
and how do they make it 
into our everyday lives?

00:00:17.627 --> 00:00:22.482
With over 170,000 words currently in use
in the English language,

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:25.970
it might seem we already have plenty.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.779
Yet, as our world changes,

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.111
new ideas and inventions spring forth,

00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:31.781
and science progresses,

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:36.331
our existing words leave gaps
in what we want to express

00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.071
and we fill those gaps 
in several ingenious,

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:40.057
practical,

00:00:40.057 --> 00:00:43.851
and occasionally peculiar ways.

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:47.502
One way is to absorb a word
from another language.

00:00:47.502 --> 00:00:50.721
English has borrowed so many words
over its history

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:56.509
that nearly half of its vocabulary 
comes directly from other languages.

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:59.728
Sometimes, this is simply because
the thing the word describes

00:00:59.728 --> 00:01:02.238
was borrowed itself.

00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:05.651
Rome and France brought legal
and religious concepts,

00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:08.891
like altar and jury, to Medieval England,

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:11.582
while trade brought crops and cuisine,

00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:12.882
like Arabic coffee,

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:14.413
Italian spaghetti,

00:01:14.413 --> 00:01:16.933
and Indian curry.

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.970
But sometimes, another language 
has just the right word

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.753
for a complex idea or emotion,

00:01:22.753 --> 00:01:23.963
like naïveté

00:01:23.963 --> 00:01:25.103
machismo,

00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:27.179
or schadenfreude.

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.433
Scientists also use classical languages
to name new concepts.

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:36.454
Clone, for example, was derived from
the Ancient Greek word for twig

00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:41.013
to describe creating a new plant
from a piece of the old.

00:01:41.013 --> 00:01:44.704
And today, the process works both ways,

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:49.883
with English lending words like software
to languages all over the world.

00:01:49.883 --> 00:01:54.025
Another popular way 
to fill a vocabulary gap

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:59.334
is by combining existing words that each
convey part of the new concept.

00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:03.365
This can be done by combining two
whole words into a compound word,

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:04.545
like airport

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:06.226
or starfish,

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:10.854
or by clipping and blending parts of words
together, like spork,

00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:11.644
brunch,

00:02:11.644 --> 00:02:13.503
or internet.

00:02:13.503 --> 00:02:15.885
And unlike borrowings 
from other languages,

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:20.594
these can often be understood
the first time you hear them.

00:02:20.594 --> 00:02:24.116
And sometimes a new word isn't new at all.

00:02:24.116 --> 00:02:28.195
Obsolete words gain new life by adopting
new meanings.

00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:33.455
Villain originally meant a peasant farmer,
but in a twist of aristocratic snobbery

00:02:33.455 --> 00:02:38.056
came to mean someone not bound
by the knightly code of chivalry

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:41.326
and, therefore, a bad person.

00:02:41.326 --> 00:02:44.107
A geek went from 
being a carnival performer

00:02:44.107 --> 00:02:45.836
to any strange person

00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:49.796
to a specific type of awkward genius.

00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:54.009
And other times, words come to mean
their opposite through irony,

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:55.087
metaphor,

00:02:55.087 --> 00:02:57.528
or misuse,

00:02:57.528 --> 00:03:04.208
like when sick or wicked are used
to describe something literally amazing.

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:06.935
But if words can be formed 
in all these ways,

00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:10.737
why do some become mainstream
while others fall out of use

00:03:10.737 --> 00:03:14.488
or never catch on in the first place?

00:03:14.488 --> 00:03:16.238
Sometimes, the answer is simple,

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:20.367
as when scientists or companies 
give an official name to a new discovery

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.448
or technology.

00:03:22.448 --> 00:03:28.049
And some countries have language academies
to make the decisions.

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.178
But for the most part, official sources
like dictionaries

00:03:31.178 --> 00:03:34.097
only document current usage.

00:03:34.097 --> 00:03:38.629
New words don't originate from above,
but from ordinary people

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.688
spreading words that 
hit the right combination

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:44.950
of useful and catchy.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.420
Take the word meme,

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.978
coined in the 1970s 
by sociobiologist Richard Dawkins

00:03:50.978 --> 00:03:54.539
from the Ancient Greek for imitation.

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:58.869
He used it to describe how ideas
and symbols propagate through a culture

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:02.181
like genes through a population.

00:04:02.181 --> 00:04:03.720
With the advent of the Internet,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.919
the process became directly observable
in how jokes and images

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.324
were popularized at lightning speed.

00:04:11.324 --> 00:04:16.104
And soon, the word came to refer
to a certain kind of image.

00:04:16.104 --> 00:04:19.832
So meme not only describes how words
become part of language,

00:04:19.832 --> 00:04:23.382
the word is a meme itself.

00:04:23.382 --> 00:04:27.791
And there's a word for this phenomenon
of words that describe themselves:

00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:29.983
autological.

00:04:29.983 --> 00:04:32.555
Not all new words are created equal.

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:34.557
Some stick around for millennia,

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:36.881
some adapt to changing times,

00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:39.487
and others die off.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.252
Some relay information,

00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:42.690
some interpret it,

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.762
but the way these words are created

00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:47.769
and the journey they take to become
part of our speech

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:52.063
tells us a lot about our world
and how we communicate within it.
