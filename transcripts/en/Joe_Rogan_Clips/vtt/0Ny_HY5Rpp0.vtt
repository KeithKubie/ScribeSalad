1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.990
That's like may six.
I think,
you know,
if,

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.040
if Ben asking can really hang with Jordan Burroughs still,
dude,
I,
yeah,

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.940
cause everybody who rolls with them.
I've never,
uh,
never even clenched with them.

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.820
But everybody who's done everything with him,

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.260
like the closest I came to a clinches like that hug you do when you hug a dude

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.330
over under a little bit just to feel it out.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.920
But they say that it's like he's got four arms.
They say,
dude,
it's ridiculous.

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.250
I've heard Jean Thomas was telling me,
Dean Thomas to St Dude,
it's ridiculous.

9
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.700
Like it doesn't even make sense.
Molly waps world champions.
We all know.
Yeah,

10
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:38.520
just rag dolls people.
That's how good his wrestling is.
I mean,

11
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:42.510
if you see that fight,
we,
Robby Lauer the fucking bombs,

12
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:46.260
that guy tooks fucked up in the fact that he still figured out a way to get

13
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:48.870
ahold of Robbie Lawler's neck.
Did.

14
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:51.780
He still figured out a way to get him into that head like once and Robbie knew

15
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:53.730
he wanted to clench with him.
He couldn't keep them off.

16
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.240
I was sweating in that pike cause you and I hyped him up so much.
I was like,

17
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.130
oh please don't get it starts in the first round.

18
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.330
It's still super controversial ending to me what you had her bond.
Would he say?

19
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.340
Well Herb said that first of all,
herb dean is the shit.

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.990
Nice guy.
Couldn't be nicer.
Great Guy.
But I love his perspective.

21
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:16.530
So laid back and knee,
his ego is so healthy.

22
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.800
Like when he talks about things like you don't see any,

23
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.820
it's very reasoned like a wavy thing,

24
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.720
but he's just like chilled out and he's like very self deprecating and chilled

25
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.700
out about it.
But he had a very good point.
He was like,

26
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.580
that's not just a manipulation of the neck.

27
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.860
Like in terms of like cutting off the carotid artery,

28
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.630
cause like this is a manipulation of the spine.
It's like a,

29
00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:40.410
a bit of a neck crank and he's thinking about that.
He was talking about like,

30
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:44.280
you look how he's got a hold of the head and how is he goes real.

31
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:48.190
What I'm concerned with is if someone's going unconscious for from some nerve

32
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.430
shit.
Oh,
wow.
Yeah.
Like from a neck crank,

33
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.290
like apparently he had seen a guy who had gotten neck crank like that.

34
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:58.890
And then afterwards the guy couldn't walk.
He like couldn't move it came back.

35
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.090
But for moments,
but for moments he couldn't move.
He,

36
00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:05.040
he's the shit we don't even think about.
I'm like,
exactly.
Yeah,
exactly.

37
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.200
That's why he's herb dean.
He's the gold standard.
He's the gold standards.

38
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.500
Big John McCarthy and him and big John doesn't do it anymore.

39
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.410
So it's hurtful a term to him.
Uno.
And um,

40
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.330
just that when you think about an aspirin says what he says is that,

41
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.820
see that's nasty dude.
That looks terrible.

42
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.200
That's nasty with the way he's holding onto the head like that and cranking your

43
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:29.370
neck.
I like that.
They're not very bad position.
I like the UFC went.
Oh,
all right.

44
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:34.290
We're good.
Yeah,
I dig that.
I get it.
I want to see it again.
I like,
I,
I disagree.

45
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.140
I think that,
um,
I I agree with herb stoppage and uh,

46
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.041
I see the,

47
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:45.810
that the arm went limp but then the thumb came up but then as soon as he let go,

48
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:50.370
Robbie jumped up.
Uzman had me convinced that Robbie was never out.

49
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.090
But herb had me convinced that it was too dangerous for him to allow to continue

50
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:59.070
once the arm dropped in that weird way.
Do you side with her?

51
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.320
You have to side with her?
Yeah.
In that situation,

52
00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:04.660
the expert you have to side with herb cause he's right because that is a special

53
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:07.060
circumstance.
See I looked at it in terms of,

54
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.180
and I didn't even consider this when I was talking to man that I looked at it in

55
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:14.230
terms of it's just a choke.
Yeah.
Her blue.
No it's a neck crank.
Me Too.

56
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.750
So,
but still I'd love to see it again.
I'd like to see Max.

57
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.930
So if they both win cause asking Mazda doll,

58
00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:26.410
I know that doesn't get your dick hard.
Aspirin,

59
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.810
Mazda dolls one and then let's say asking when's that,

60
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:32.660
which is tough fight to win.
It's a tough one to say.
Woodley and lawless,

61
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.080
a lot of ones that then they find it's even bigger.
