00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:31.829
For those who don’t know, a “bear” market,
or when someone is being “bearish” in

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.300
this context, is marked by investors being
very conservative and pessimistic, resulting

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.290
in a declining market generally marked by
the mass selling off of stock.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.320
A “bull” market is simply the opposite
of that, with investors being aggressive and

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.280
positive, with stock prices rising as a result
of this optimism.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.920
This “bull” and “bear” terminology
first popped up in the 18th century in England.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.110
There are a couple different possible sources
for the “bear” part of this tandem, but

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.830
the leading theory is that it derived from
an old 16th century proverb: “selling the

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.840
bear’s skin before one has caught the bear”
or alternatively, “Don’t sell the bear’s

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.060
skin before you’ve killed him,” equivalent
to, “Don’t count your eggs before they’re

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.060
hatched.”

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.409
By the early 18th century, when people in
the stock world would sell something they

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.360
didn’t yet own (in hopes of turning a profit
by eventually being able to buy the thing

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.869
at a cheaper rate than they sold it, before
delivery was due), this gave rise to the saying

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.079
that they “sold the bearskin” and the
people themselves were called “bearskin

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.079
jobbers”.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:34.469
One of the earliest references of this comes
from an issue of The Tatler, April 26, 1709:

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.799
Forasmuch as it is very hard to keep land
in repair without ready cash, I do, out of

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.729
my personal estate, bestow the bear-skin,
which I have frequently lent to several societies

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.159
about this town, to supply their necessities;
I say, I give also the said bear-skin as an

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.810
immediate fund to the said citizens forever…

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.920
In a later edition, June 23, 1709, it goes
on to state:

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.770
I fear the word Bear is hardly to be understood
among the polite people; but I take the meaning

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.179
to be, that one who insures a real value upon
an imaginary thing, is said to sell a Bear,

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.209
and is the same thing as a promise among courtiers,
or a vow between lovers…

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.950
Yet another early instance of the term is
in Daniel Defoe’s The Anatomy of Change

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.290
Alley, published in 1719, around the time
the term was popularized to something of the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.390
same type of definition we use today:

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.849
Those who buy Exchange Alley Bargains are
styled buyers of Bear-skins.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.620
The use of the word “bear” in this way
was popularized thanks to one of the early

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.489
market bubbles known as the South Sea Bubble.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.209
While it was a long and incredibly complex
market scheme that led to the bubble, the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.910
gist of it was that the South Sea Company,
formed in 1711, was granted by Britain a monopoly

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.090
on all trade to South America and would be
given an annual sum (6% interest plus expenses)

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.090
from the government.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.860
In exchange, the new company agreed to take
over large portions of the government’s

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.860
debt.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.820
(In fact, this was primarily how the company
actually made money throughout its century

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.260
and a half it was in business, simply by dealing
in government debt.)

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.189
Thanks to this deal and an amazing amount
of government corruption, insider trading,

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.829
and other unscrupulous practices by certain
shareholders who knew well that the company’s

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.310
trade business had little hope of ever being
profitable, the burgeoning company’s stock

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.989
soared.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.799
At its peak, based on the stock price, the
company was worth about £200 million (by

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.769
purchasing power, today this would be about
£24 billion or $37 billion; by average earnings,

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.610
it would be £350 billion or $537 billion).

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.840
Besides the fact that they didn’t even have
their first trading shipment until 1717, 6

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.910
years after the trading company first formed,
one of the problems was that having an exclusive

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.160
monopoly on trading to South America from
the British government at the time wasn’t

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.140
saying much as most of the region was almost
entirely held by Spain, who Britain was at

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.140
war with.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.436
Nevertheless, amid rampant and widely published
rumors (deftly planted by certain stock holders

00:03:55.436 --> 00:03:58.370
to jack up the price) of the vast wealth from
gold and other resources in those regions

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.360
and the potential promise of soon securing
trade rights from Spain, the stock prices

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.829
soared, even though the company itself wasn’t
really doing any actual trading and their

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.359
main asset, the monopoly on trade to Middle
and South America, was essentially worthless,

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.859
as the core stock holders knew well.

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.390
Spain did eventually grant the South Sea Company
rights to trade in the regions held by Spain,

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.840
but only one ship load per year total was
allowed in exchange for a percentage of the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.840
profits.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.090
Needless to say, the inability to do any actual
real volume of trading and the fact that war

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.830
once again broke out in 1718 between Spain
and Britain causing much of the company’s

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.699
scant physical assets to be seized by Spain,
the market crash that followed wasn’t pretty.

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.169
As to the “bull” name for rising markets,
in this case we have to do a little more speculation

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.759
as the documented evidence just isn’t there.

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.160
The leading theory is that it came about as
a direct result of the term “bear”.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.250
Specifically, the first known instance of
the market term “bull” popped up in 1714,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.410
shortly after the “bear” term popped up.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.560
At the time, it was something of a common
practice to bear and bull-bait.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.970
Essentially, with bear baiting, they’d chain
a bear (or bears) up in an arena, and then

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.169
set some other animals to attack the bear(s)
(usually dogs) as a form of entertainment

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.460
for spectators seated in the arena.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.550
While bears were one of the more popular animals
to use in these games, bulls were also commonly

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.550
used.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.960
More rarely, other animals were used such
as in one instance where an ape was tied to

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.520
a pony’s back and dogs were set on them.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.669
According to one spectator, the spectacle
of the dogs tearing the pony to shreds while

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.860
the ape screamed and desperately tried to
stay on the pony’s back, out of reach of

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.090
the snapping jaws of the dogs, was “very
laughable”…

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.110
In any event, the popularity of bear and bull
baiting, along with perhaps the association

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.470
with bulls charging, is thought to have probably
been why “bull” was chosen as something

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.440
of the antithesis of a “bear”, shortly
after “bear” first popped up in the stock

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.440
sense.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.360
But, of course, we can’t be at all sure
on this one as there wasn’t the more lengthy

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.810
documented progression of definition as with
the “bear” term.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.850
A common myth often put forth as to the origin
of “bull” and “bear” market terminology

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.190
is that it comes from the last names of two
prominent banking businesses, the Bulteels

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.740
and the Barings, the former supposedly tending
to be extremely aggressive in their investments

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.979
and the latter supposedly being much more
conservative.

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.449
While both the Barings bank and the Bulteel
bank did in fact exist, there are a couple

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:17.450
problems here.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.550
The first is that the only Bulteel bank around
this era wasn’t prominent at all, certainly

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.639
not enough to spawn such a term.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.440
Second, and more importantly, is that both
the Barings bank and the Bulteel bank were

00:06:28.440 --> 00:07:42.219
founded well after “bull” and “bear”
were already common stock market terms.
