00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
There's something very special about VR.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.310
It gives you a sense of presence,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.755
it gives you a sense of immersion that you can't really find anywhere else.

00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:13.860
And that gives you

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.940
that emotional connection that I think is very special about that medium.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.365
Working in VR is a new pencil,

00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:29.735
it is a new way of getting your creativity and your ideas across.

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:33.570
Unreal Engine is absolutely game into technology.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.650
But the world I think of tomorrow,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.560
the world even of today I think is evolving very quickly

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.440
because many industries have gravitated towards Unreal Engine.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.170
The way that these courses are structured is that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.990
they will take you through the very first portions

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.660
of jumping in and learning how to approach Unreal Engine as a toolset,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.334
they will take you through a series of projects,

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:01.680
you will build those projects and those will give

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.815
you ideas about how you approach your own work.

00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:11.690
I strongly encourage everyone to learn everything they can jump and take this course,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.040
the demand is out there.
