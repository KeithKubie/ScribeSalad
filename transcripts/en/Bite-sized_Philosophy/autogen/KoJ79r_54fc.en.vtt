00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.640
Alright, so what does The Frame look like?

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.200
Well, I think it looks something like this - and this is,
as far as I can tell, this is the barebones...

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.120
This is the barebones of a variety of things.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.820
It's a barebone story.
It's a barebone conceptual framework.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.940
It's a barebone "Dasein",
to speak in Heideggerian terms.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.360
It's like, it's the barebones World, that you live in.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.680
You're always in one of these worlds,
there's no getting out of them.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.400
You can move from one to another,
but you're always in a world like this.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.000
And so, this is the world that you're in.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.040
You're somewhere,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.220
cause you have to be somewhere.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.240
Now, you might not know, where that is.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.380
Which means, that to [be] somewhere that you are, is chaotic.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.600
In which case, you need to go over your past,
in great detail, and figure out where you are.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200
It's like you're lost, right? You- you're lost,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.760
and the problem with being lost is:
when you're lost, you don't know where to go,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.660
and the problem with not knowing where to go, is:
there's a million places, that you could go,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.400
and a million places, is too many places for you to go, without dying.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.140
So, being lost is not good.
So you need to know where you are.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.560
One of the things that we built online, my partners and I,
is this program called "Past Authoring",

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.000
that helps people lay out, the-
the narrative of their past.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.220
To identify... to break their life down into six stages - "epochs", we call them,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.020
and then to identify the... emotionally significant moments in each epoch,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.400
and to write them out:
what happened negatively, what happened positively.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.620
What the consequences were,
what you derived from it,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.960
perhaps what you could have done differently,
perhaps what you learned from it, all of that.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.640
So that you could narrow in, zero in, on determining
precisely, where it is that you are right now.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.980
And people are often loathed to do that,
cause they actually don't wanna know.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.840
Cause they'd rather be spread out,
in a sort of half-blind manner, in the fog,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.600
hoping, that the place that they're at, is better than it really is, and deluding themselves by remaining vague,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.500
than to figure out: "I'm right here, right now, with these specific problems".

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.240
But it's actually better to do that!

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.580
Because if you have a set of specific problems,
and you've really narrowed them down,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.860
and really specified them - then you can probably start fixing them.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.940
And you can start fixing them in microwaves, bit by bit.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.940
But, there's no way you can do that without
knowing where you are, it's impossible.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.560
And you can kinda tell, if you don't know where you are.
It's quite straightforward:

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.380
[inhale]

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.780
If you are haunted by reveries of the past,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.100
for events, that are older than approximately 18 months,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.960
if they continue to come up in your mind, over and over,
in your dreams, over and over,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.220
you haven't extracted the world
out from your past experiences.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.040
The potential is still trapped in the past.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.020
And to confront the potential,
means to confront the Dragon of the Past,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.480
and of course, that's terrifying.
And it can seriously be terrifying.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.680
So for example, maybe you're vague,
and ill-informed, and ill-defined,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.280
because you were abused very badly, when you
were a child. 4 years old, something like that.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.320
And maybe you were abused by a family member
 - cause that's generally who does the abusing!

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.240
And so, that just makes it worse.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.740
And then, what that means, is that...
[sniff] you've got a implicit...

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.180
You've had an implicit encounter with malevolent evil,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.880
that- No, you've had a direct encounter with malevolent evil,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.340
but you have an implicit hypothesis of malevolent evil that's plaguing you.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.140
It's still there - it's trapped in the memories, right?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.660
It's- it's trapped in the representational structure.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.160
And as an adult, you're now faced with
the necessity of articulating that fully,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.760
before you have any chance whatsoever of freeing yourself from it.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.200
And so, that's no joke. Lots of times people have to
go into the past, that's what the psychoanalysts do.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.480
And say "look, here, something came along,
just bloody well knocked me over,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.740
and it isn't even that I repressed it".
Which- which I think, was...

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.940
Well, we won't talk about Freud's errors, because Freud
was a genius, so we'll just leave him alone. But...

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.220
But sometimes it's not repression. It's just, that terrible things happen to people at such a young age,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.340
that there isn't a bloody chance in hell, that they can figure out why they happened, or what to do with them. Or what they mean.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.280
And then you can carry that with you.
And you carry with you...

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.000
It's like, your, your...

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.100
Your body encounters the world in stages,
and it happens very rapidly.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.540
Well, it can extend over years, but
the initial stages happen very rapidly.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.560
So for example,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.060
[inhale]

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.920
if you're walking down the road, and you hear
a large noise be- a loud noise behind you,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.200
you'll go like this! That's a predator defence response,
by the way. You crouch down.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.580
And that's to stop something from jumping on
your back, and getting at your neck too easily.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.040
That's like, few me- few hundred miliseconds.
(snaps fingers) It's really fast, or even faster than that.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.660
And it better be, because - something like a snake, let's say, can nail you just right now, so you better be fast.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.580
But it's low resolution, it's like... danger snakes, something like that, or danger predatory cat, it's that fast.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.360
And then, you can unravel that,
and categorize it, but that takes time.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.100
You do that with emotion, and then you do it with cognition, and you can do that with long-term thinking, you know?

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.080
Because, maybe you've encountered someone
specifically malevolent and predatory at work.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.740
It happens to people a lot, who's operating as a... as a destructive bully.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.060
And who seems to have no positive function whatsoever,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.640
and is only living that out. And then you,
you know, you don't know what to do about it.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.240
So you- you're in prey mode, and I don't mean this
[pray] kind of mode, although that would help too,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.900
But, I mean, you're acting like a prey animal.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.740
And then you have this terribly complex thing to decompose, which is: "What the hell is up with this person?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.040
Why are they making my life miserable?

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.580
What is it about me, that allows them to make my life miserable?"

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.680
That's a nasty little road to walk down.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.320
And you're stuck with having to-
you're stuck with having to decompose it.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.480
Maybe you can't!

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.720
Maybe, formulating an explicit philosophy of good and evil,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.040
to deal with something malevolent in your environment,
actually just happens to be beyond you!

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.260
And that could easily be.
It's certainly the case for people who are young.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.700
And it's the case for plenty of adults as well,
it's no simple thing to ma- to manage.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.120
It's something too, that often soldiers, who have
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have do to,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.980
because they've encountered terrible things.
They've either done them, or who ran into them.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.060
And they need to update their moral model of the world,
or they end up in something, close enough...

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.880
closely approximating Hell.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.680
[a sip of water]

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.300
[closes bottle]

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.260
Anyways, so you need to know where you are.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.560
That's what this is: "Where are you?"

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.020
So you're navigating! You're a navigator,
you're a sailor on an ocean, man.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.900
That's what- that's what you are! You are a mobile
creature, you go from point A to point B all the time.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.200
You're not sitting there glued to a rock,
like some brainless, you know, sea creature.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.900
There's a funny little creature called a 'hydra', very simple little creature.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.680
In its juvenile stage it has a brain, cause it swims around,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.600
but then, when it turns into an adult, it latches
itself to a rock, and promptly digests its brain.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.820
Cause if you're just sitting on a rock, and you're not moving, you don't need a brain!

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.180
So... but that's not our issue, right?
We're- we're zipping around in the world.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.160
And so, we're navigating agents, and so:
to navigate, there's two things you need to know.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.940
The first is: where the hell are you - exactly, precisely. Right?

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.340
Razor-sharp.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.900
What's good about you and what's bad about you.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.560
By your own... by your own reckoning. You don't have to...

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.460
You can ask other people, but this is a game you play yourself.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.460
It's like, as far as I'm concerned...

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.080
I'm taking stock.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.580
What is it that's okay about me,
and what needs some work?

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.500
And you gotta watch to not be too self-critical when you're doing that too,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.140
cause that can just be another kind of flaw.
