1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,350
Wait, wait, wait. Don't
let me just hit record.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,300
Okay. And now, what were you saying
spontaneously a moment ago? Hey,

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,350
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.
This is radio lab and today bliss.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,300
And in our last segment we met a guy who
dreamt of a perfect world where words

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,780
can never muck things up. Got a little
carried away. So let's forget about Drey.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,410
Forget about him.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,070
Now we're going to look for perfection
right here in the physical world. Okay,

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,890
so, so, so this story,

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,280
and we're going to do it with the perfect
person Latif Nasser, it begins with a,

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,570
with a birthday present.
It's February 9th,

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,370
1886 miles outside the tiny town of
Jericho, Vermont. And we're on a farm,

12
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:44,790
a family farm, a the Bentley family farm,

13
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:49,791
and the scrawny 15 year old kid named
Wilson gets a microscope from his mother.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,000
So it's February and it's
Vermont. And so naturally,

15
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,790
the first thing this kid does
is he grabs a handful of snow,

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,250
picks out a single flake and he
puts it under the microscope.

17
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,290
And what he sees

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,460
is, is, is the most beautiful thing
he's ever seen. It is ethereal and,

19
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:12,730
and, and perfect. He, he
calls them masterpieces as,

20
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,990
as if they're these, you know,

21
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:18,700
great works of art because him that in
his 15 year old diary, looking back,

22
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:21,900
he talked about that moment and
what he was thinking when he,

23
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,970
when he sort of first saw it
and, but obviously, you know,

24
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:27,670
within minutes or maybe even seconds,

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,390
these masterpieces just disappeared

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,720
without leaving any evidence that
they, that they ever existed.

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,660
They just sort of evaporate.
Huh. And as he remembers it, he,

28
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:43,530
he sort of decides then in there that
he's going to dedicate his whole life to,

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,040
to documenting these masterpieces.

30
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,250
Otherwise no one will ever
know they even existed.

31
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,180
He's going to spend his whole
life documenting snowflakes. Yeah.

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,320
It's a good life jet
and it pays well. Right.

33
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,940
That's exactly what his father said.
His father thought he was, you know,

34
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,970
he was just lazy and didn't want to do
the farming chores as far as his milk,

35
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:08,150
the goats. And he goes, now the
beauty, the beauty. Right, right.

36
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:10,940
And apparently he was a real, he
was really good at digging potatoes,

37
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,640
but he just sort of was so busy futzing
around with his microscope that he,

38
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,740
you know, I don't like this kid. I don't
like them to friends. Your work ethic,

39
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,100
it does so fucked up his neck.

40
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,520
So he takes his microscope and he moves
it to this unheated woodshed behind the

41
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,190
house. Um, and he starts sketching

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,570
these snowflakes, right?
And while he's sketching,

43
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,870
he can't even breathe because he was
worried that his breath would melt his

44
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,960
specimen. So he's sort of
holding his breath and, and,

45
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,540
and drawing these, you know,

46
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,780
these extremely complex crystals
that can take you maybe, you know,

47
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,260
maybe an hour to draw, but, but depending
on the temperature of the humidity,

48
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:54,740
the size of the crystal he had
at most, he had five minutes

49
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,850
at the end of that, he, he looks at
the mall and, and he's not satisfied.

50
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,520
He just felt like he
wasn't doing it justice.

51
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,430
You know what he calls
these miracles of beauty.

52
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,110
So Bentley persuades his mother who
persuaded his father to buy him a camera.

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,420
Why is that great? Wait, wait, wait.
1880. We're in February, 1880. I have,

54
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,870
we entered into, in the era of
picture taking, just, just barely,

55
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,390
and for a farming family,
this was like a lot of money,

56
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,120
but they buy it for him and he gets it.

57
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,880
Any sort of Jerry rigs to the microscope.

58
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,280
And at age 19,

59
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,370
Wilson Bentley is the first person ever
in history to photograph a snowflake.

60
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,010
Okay. I'm going to cue the snowflake
celebrations are secure, right.

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:43,860
[inaudible]

62
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,690
from then on, basically for the
next 46 winters until he died,

63
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,310
every, every snowfall,

64
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:54,750
every blizzard is a Bentley would stand
in the doorway of his little shack, uh,

65
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,130
holding out a wooden tray,
uh, with, with thick mittens.

66
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:01,710
Cause you would wear these, they're
almost like oven mitts to, to,

67
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:02,880
to make sure that his,

68
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,680
none of his body heat would kind of leak
out and inadvertently melt any of the

69
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:11,730
snow. So He'd sort of stand there and
sort of give it a once over with his eye.

70
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:13,920
If nothing was promising.
He, he basically had a,

71
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,700
a Turkey feather and he would sort of
just wipe it clean with this Turkey

72
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:21,210
feather until he did find something
you liked. And then he would,

73
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,200
he would take this tiny little wooden
rod and he would just certain really

74
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:29,310
delicately tap the center of the
crystal and like really, really,

75
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,390
really gently lifted off and
then transfer it onto the,

76
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,480
onto a glass slide so that he could put
it under the microscope and he could

77
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,900
photograph it. Over
the course of his life.

78
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,730
He'd basically photographed about
5,000 snow crystals for his whole life.

79
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:47,820
He was just a farmer doing
this kind of as a hobby. Uh,

80
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:52,140
but he sold copies of these photos for
5 cents a pop to places like Harvard and

81
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:55,800
the British Museum and the US
weather bureau, research journals,

82
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:59,220
magazines like nature and
national geographic. And I mean,

83
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,890
you've already seen the photos like you,
you've gotten them on a Christmas card,

84
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,580
they're on your like ugly Christmas
sweater in your closet somewhere. Um,

85
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,780
remember throwing a shirt with them
on right now. Yeah. Um, they're,

86
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,380
they're, they're, they're everywhere.

87
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,750
They're beautiful, symmetrical,
really clean. And Complex.

88
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,190
A lot of the greatest scientists who
ever lived like Descartes and Kepler and

89
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:22,610
Hook,

90
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,610
they all tried to sketch and draw and
kind of capture the essence of snowflakes,

91
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:32,771
but none of them could do it as well as
this one obsessive loaner from Jericho,

92
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:37,070
Vermont, whose photos were perceived to
be kind of more faithful to nature than,

93
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,510
than, than anybody else's.
But that was until, um,

94
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,410
this

95
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,790
other guy came on the scene,
this German guy Q, the other guy.

96
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,000
Germanic theme music. Yes. Hey, yes.

97
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,010
See she got through,

98
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,680
he was a German meteorologist named
Gustaf Hellman who stuff? Hell man.

99
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,260
Not of the mayonnaise
fame. I don't believe,

100
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,740
I haven't even thought of that
actually. Like it's a helmet. Is this,

101
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,440
is he a contemporary of
Bentley? Yeah, he is.

102
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,500
And he's working on his own book about
weather and so he hires a kind of a micro

103
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:19,430
photographer who's another German guy
named Richard Newhouse when Mike is a very

104
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:21,610
teeny photographer who he
kept on his desk. Yeah,

105
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,730
he's a microscopic himself and he
just takes normal size photographs.

106
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,030
Anyhow,

107
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,580
he hires this guy and they take a
bunch of photos using basically similar

108
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,130
technology camera and a
microscope essentially.

109
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,660
But what they find is totally different.

110
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,420
They do not find the, the,

111
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,060
the elegance and metrical ideal
snow crystals that Bentley found.

112
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,290
The crystals they found were like flawed,

113
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,900
lopsided, usually like broken.
And the way I think of it,

114
00:06:56,901 --> 00:07:01,490
it was like a Martian who had only ever
seen like glossy fashion magazines had

115
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:05,600
just been given some like random family
photo album and it was like, Oh wow,

116
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,260
this is, they're not so pretty. Like
these are kind of ugly, you know,

117
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,630
these humans, humans
are not all symmetrical.

118
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,130
These Germans day, they basically called
them out. They, they basically stopped.

119
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,240
Bentley was a fraud.

120
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,900
There was a particular way that
Bentley prepared his photographs.

121
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,260
What he would do is he would use a,

122
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,120
a pen knife to scrape the
negative around the snow crystal,

123
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,690
which is what gave it that kind of Nice
black background because he thought it

124
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:36,020
would kind of put it in maybe
starker relief. Um, and,

125
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,100
and the German guys said that's it's,

126
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,660
it's misleading that it kind of
mutilates the snowflakes, um, away.

127
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,680
So he's photographing these snowflakes
and then significantly messing with the

128
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,600
photograph. Exactly right. Exactly right.

129
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,160
So here's a quote from the photographer
who said, quote, in many images,

130
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:58,490
Bentley did not limit himself
to improving the outlines.

131
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,660
He let his knife play deep inside the
heart of the crystals so that fully

132
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,010
arbitrary figures emerged.
So He's, Oh, I don't know.

133
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:10,790
That doesn't seem so no longer a
candidate, is it? Well, that's,

134
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,820
that's the question. So then, but
then, so they basically lob this,

135
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:16,280
and this is kind of going
into these journals,

136
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,280
but Bentley basically
launches a counter attack.

137
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,220
And what he says is that in
fact those guys are wrong,

138
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,610
that not correcting
your photographs was an,

139
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,680
he used this word like perverts to him.

140
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,060
Why wouldn't you remove specks of
dust or other imperfections? Why,

141
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,090
why photograph of a broken snowflake
when you can photograph a complete one?

142
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,520
So this is a quote from Bentley. He said,

143
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,760
a true scientist wishes above all to
have his photographs as true to nature as

144
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:46,814
possible.

145
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,500
And if retouching will help in this
respect than it is fully justified.

146
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,560
So he thought his retouched snowflakes
were truer than the normal ones.

147
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,590
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

148
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,980
The scientist is supposed to be
kind of this very experienced,

149
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,720
almost like a sage who is seen every
different variation on a snowflake,

150
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,250
but can sort of bring that
all together in one drawing,

151
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,940
one sketch, one photograph,
and that's the true snowflake.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So if I brought him a slightly
gloppy snowflake and said,

153
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,461
look,

154
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:25,260
this is what fell on my nose and this
is a true snowflake because it actually

155
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:29,220
fell from the sky and it's, you
know, it was an an enhanced,

156
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,960
yeah, he would say that. He would say,
Robert, you're, you're an amateur.

157
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:38,490
Like this is, this is not good work.
You know, this is an aberration.

158
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,540
This is an abnormality.

159
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:43,080
Why would you choose to kind of highlight
an abnormality as opposed to kind of

160
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:47,760
this, this true ideal snowflake,
you know, and does that one exist?

161
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,220
I mean, that's the key question for me.

162
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:53,100
Like does the ideal
snowflake exist in nature?

163
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,710
You think there are such
things I exquisitely beautiful.

164
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,690
I would like to think that there are no,

165
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:01,140
so I think if my facts are right,

166
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,000
the world's snowflake expert is
actually in, in Pasadena, California.

167
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,970
All right. Check, check,
check, check, check in.

168
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,160
Can Sunny Southern California.
Yeah, I'm wearing a tee shirt.

169
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,220
I have sunscreen lathered and I am going
to talk to the world authority on snow.

170
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,240
How are you? His name is Ken Lee Breck.
He's a professor of physics at cal tech.

171
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,100
He is in a way,

172
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:36,910
he's like the modern day Wilson Bentley
because he takes a ton of of snowflake

173
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,170
pictures taken about 10,000 now and uh,

174
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,570
and he actually makes snowflakes.
Oh yeah. Artificially. Okay.

175
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,510
Wow. So this is a giant tank. This
is a nitrogen here. Nevermind that.

176
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,860
And to get to your question about
the ideal snowflake, a few things.

177
00:10:56,861 --> 00:11:01,000
So number one, they're a
bajillion different kinds,

178
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:05,520
dendritic crystal stellar
Denverites needles and columns
and hollow columns and,

179
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,140
and a sector plates. That's one thing.

180
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,880
The second thing is that snowflakes are
never static. They're never one thing.

181
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,610
So at every single moment
as it falls to the earth,

182
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,440
it's either growing or shrinking.

183
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,490
Depending on the kind of
trajectory through the
different pockets of weather as

184
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:22,450
it's moving down.

185
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,300
So there is no real platonic ideal
form of a snowflake because it's,

186
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,760
it's, it's so influx. I mean,

187
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,740
there's no such thing
as a perfect snowflake,

188
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,270
but that doesn't stop Kenley Brag
from, from looking, you know,

189
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:39,700
I tried up in Tahoe and Japan, Vermont,

190
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:44,110
Michigan travels all over the world
looking for Bentley's perfect flakes.

191
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,220
Alaska. I've been to Alaska, Sweden, but
my favorite spot is northern Ontario,

192
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,670
a little town called
Cochran population 5,487.

193
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,430
So where do you go and do
you just, just anywhere.

194
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:57,510
They're just falling all over the
place. Mostly it's the, it's the, uh,

195
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,460
parking lot of my, my, my hotel. He
says there's a lot of waiting involved.

196
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,840
You'd only really snow as
well about once a week.

197
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,530
Even then things have to be goldilocks
perfect. If the clouds are too high,

198
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,130
then they evaporate a little on
the way down. They look for pretty,

199
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,760
or if the clouds are too light
or too heavy, that's bad too.

200
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,880
And a lot of times the temperature is
wrong if you want those Christmas card

201
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,820
supermodels, snowflakes, uh, eat.

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,710
But you need to have exactly minus
15 that's five degrees Fahrenheit.

203
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,130
You need to have high humidity,

204
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,480
not so much wind so that they'll putter
down slowly and have more time to grow.

205
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,860
But every once in awhile, I mean
when the conditions are right, yeah,

206
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,790
you've got side all hopeful and
dissipating and it's like, oh crap,

207
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,130
there's nothing garbage
out here. So you're back.

208
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,580
Go back inside and read some more email
and you'll come back a half an hour

209
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,420
later, nope, still lousy and
you half hour later, nope,

210
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,530
still allows it and you know,

211
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:53,170
you do this for hours and then all
of a sudden they'll get really good.

212
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,140
And then,

213
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,820
and then just out there and frantically
trying to collect as many as I can.

214
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,210
Well one of the things I like to
think about this is, you know,

215
00:13:02,211 --> 00:13:07,211
here I am with my little piece of
cardboard in the middle of a continent.

216
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,370
It is snowing all the time.

217
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,880
And so I am catching some incredibly
small number of these things.

218
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:17,510
For a brief period and getting
some really cool pictures.

219
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:18,960
And so you kind of wonder what the,

220
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:21,440
what else is out there and
what are you missing? I mean,

221
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:26,270
imagine just all the beautiful little
works of art that are just falling down

222
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,320
totally unnoticed and then
they just disappear. I mean,

223
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:33,260
stuff that is far prettier than,
you know, the pictures I have,

224
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,700
cause they're out there, you know,

225
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,120
they're out there statistically
they're out there. And so, you know,

226
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:42,490
there's just an awful lot of really
gorgeous things such, it just started.

227
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,981
Like you say,

228
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:46,670
they're just totally a femoral and
you'll never see them and they're falling

229
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,170
constantly. So you sort of want to
just stop the world and you know,

230
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,063
go look at them.

231
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:10,470
[inaudible] [inaudible]

232
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,830
thanks to lots of Nasser and to Ken leap,

235
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,210
this is Matt and newly
Dawson from Asheville,

236
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:28,090
North Carolina and bliss is this sound.

237
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,050
That's the sound of my seven month year
old daughter reacting to my puppy dog

238
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,010
waking her feet. Hi, my name is Igor
and I'm calling from Nova Sod Serbia.

239
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,600
Bless this. Indiana Jones, all free parts.

240
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,630
The radio lab,

241
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:49,631
this is Steve Strogatz
bliss is the taste of HACCP.

242
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:54,260
Pastrami at Deli in the lower
east side of New York City.

243
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,660
We live, we're five hours away from New
York and don't get there very often.

244
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,220
So I spend a lot of time in between
visits, thinking about that first taste,

245
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,400
hot pastrami. So for me,

246
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,710
that's plus I get to think about some
kind of almost unattainable perfection,

247
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,550
except that it is attainable.
I just show up in there it is.

248
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,610
This is Mary Roach and I'm in Oakland,
California. And I have a list of lists.

249
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,690
My list list number one, uh,
laughing uncontrollably. Number two,

250
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,700
zero gravity that were for the
first 10 seconds in a hot hot pack.

251
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:34,580
Number nine, a raw waster,

252
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,640
very fresh that no larger than
