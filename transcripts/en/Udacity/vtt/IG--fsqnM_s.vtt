00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.228
We now have the triangle's geometry defined. An object in 3D graphics needs both

00:00:05.228 --> 00:00:09.512
geometry, and a material. So this the glue code that you need to actually

00:00:09.512 --> 00:00:14.536
display the thing on the screen. You add a material, and we'll talk about this

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:19.778
next unit. And you put the geometry and the material together into what's called

00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:24.266
a mesh in 3JSm, and then you add that mesh to the scene. In the exercise you

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:27.980
won't be doing this part. You'll be filling in a function that creates the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.862
square. The function you'll be implementing is called draw square and takes a

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:36.260
lower left hand coordinate and upper right hand coordinate. What you'll return

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.143
from this function is a geometry object which then the program will draw.
