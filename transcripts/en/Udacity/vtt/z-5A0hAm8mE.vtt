00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.340
It's hard to write a constructor function that is robust against this

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.480
kind of misuse.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.575
And we don't actually need to.

00:00:05.575 --> 00:00:10.940
Object.create sets up the prototype delegation that we need to just like new,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.810
but without running the constructor function in the process.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.870
Be careful though.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.390
Due to a long misunderstanding of JavaScript,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.930
this technique has been widely accepted and standardized on for many years.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.840
You'll see a lot of misguided documentation out there on reputable sites that

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.290
endorses this broken pattern.
