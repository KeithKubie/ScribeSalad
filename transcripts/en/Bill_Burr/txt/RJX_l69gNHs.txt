Speaker 1:          00:01          If you guys see that, I just saw a commercial, um, uh, for Kentucky Fried Chicken where the parents are all excited because the two bratty kids won't sit still at the dinner table, put the got 'em this fucking chicken and they're feeding it too. And they basically very subtly saying that there's drugs in this chicken that will make your spastic children chill the fuck out and spastic. I mean like, you know, not, not the way they mean it over there in Great Britain, you can't say that on the comedy or you can say it in a comedy club over in Scotland, but you'll have a rough, you'll have a rough go of it if you say the kid was spastic over there, that means like severely mentally challenged over here. It just means you're not going to get laid to you're 26

Speaker 2:          00:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:48          when you were in Grad school looking over a fucking cadaver, right? With some other fucking nerve narrowed. Right. And you're just sitting there going, you know, the ankle bones connected to the knee bone. Right? Has any of this made any sense? What shouldn't? It's fucking Sunday night. And I am spent and I got a whole bunch of Shit I have to do tomorrow, so I got to do it tonight. All right, I'm off my game. All right. You, you cleanse your liver and like 42 43 days or something like that. Every drunk I knows has told me that every drunk I know that does not have a medical degree has told me that if you go 42 43 days, you will cleanse your liver at least to the booze. You know? Now if you fucking, you start doing blow or a, you know, eating a bunch of trans fat fucking food or feeding your kids Kentucky Fried fucking chicken, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          01:40          What happened to parents that you got drug your kids to keep them under control. You know, you know what it is. Kids don't respect their parents, they respect them, but they don't respect like, oh my God, this, this person could ring my neck, could pick me up by my hair. Right. Could grab a paddle and fucking, you know, mostly hit my ass, but also kinda hit my lower back because I'm squirming right. That doesn't exist anymore. So now these kids is so fucking out of control, these people have to go down and Kentucky Fried Chicken. Okay. And I, I, I use the term chicken very loosely to go down and whatever that is, that's in that bucket. Okay? It doesn't have a beak. It doesn't have feet. If it's fucking, you know, chest, his breast is sticking out like the cast on fucking uh, what was, what was that show with the Italians? They're on New Jersey shore. Jersey shore. Right. My world. That's not a fucking chicken. You know, you want the chicken that looked like Mark McGuire in his rookie season. You don't want to eat the chicken that looks like Mark McGuire when he fucking played for the cardinals. You know?

Speaker 1:          03:02          Do you eat a regular fucking chicken? First of all, it's gonna look like a pigeon to you because you so used to seeing those roided up ones that they have murderer's row that you got down there at your fucking Shaws, right? Your Vaughn's, you, JC Penney's, wherever the fuck you buy your God damn chicken, you go down, you go down to any one of the main stream fucking supermarkets. Okay. And I swear to God, when you get to the chicken section, okay, if you've, if you slept for the last 30 years, like that Van Gundy guy under the bridge, whatever his fucking name is, Van Morrison, the hell's his name, Rip Van Winkle. Right. That was one of those people, one of the vans. Um, if you slept for the last 30 years and you went down, okay. And they showed you what a chicken was, you'd be like, ah. You'd be like, that ain't no chicken. Okay. It's a God damn Turkey. I know. Fucking die. No fucking Turkey when I see one. Alright. I ain't no such thing as a mad fucking chicken. Can't be done. No Sir. No Sir. Get off my property. Okay. I'm, I'm done with your witchcraft. Okay. Pass it. Get the fuck Outta here. Fuck off my property.

Speaker 3:          04:18          Um,

Speaker 1:          04:21          honey, get the gun. Um, yeah, you would think it was a fucking Turkey. And the thing is, is now it's a chicken. And I remember I watched one of those food inks, one of those fucking liberal goddamn things, you know, talking about flying carpets and electric roads and all that bullshit somewhere in there they were talking about, you know, the food supply and are poison. It is poisonous poisoning is is. Um, so I fucking went down to a farmer's fucking mock yet. And um, I said, I wanna, I wanna I want to all I want, I wanna I want an all natural fucking chicken. I can't even talk. I'm so tired. One an all natural chicken. The guy goes, these are all natural. And I said, all natural. And he goes, well, I'm like, come on, where is it? And he had to walk around the corner and sitting over there, lonely.

Speaker 1:          05:17          I swear to God, looking like a dove look like in somebody killed the fucking dog. He goes right there. That one right there is 100%, all natural. Nothing's wrong with it. And I was like, I was like, what? That's what a chicken supposed to look like. And he raised his eyebrows and he, he kind of put his lips together so they were a straight line and then he nodded, you know, that look that people do like, like, yeah, I'm in the Matrix. I realize I'm in the Matrix, but you know, I knocked the bitch up so I gotta be selling these roided up chickens now. Um, anyways, anyway, what the I'm talking about. So basically that's what these people are eating over there. Okay. They are, they are drugging up. They're kids. But I can't get mad at him because I actually did that to Charlie Murphy and Darnell Rawlings.

Speaker 1:          06:12          I've told this story before. Hey, I'll tell it against my fucking podcasts. I actually drug I the exact thing that they're doing in their Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial where they're trying to get their kids to sit still by just feeding them so full of these fucking transfats from these roided up beatless fucking checkins with their Dolly Parton breasts diseases. Right. I did that to fucking Darnell and Charlie. I was hung over and we were taken a car service from Chicago xannies up to one of those, whatever the fuck it was. Saint Charles was a three city run and one of them was St Charles. So we're getting in the fucking Limo, Don L's and ray form Charlie's and rare form. They're fucking Gavin and trash and people and me and everybody and I just don't want to hear it. I'm like, I don't want to listen to these fucking guys running that Goddamn yaps in the back of this car the whole fucking way up.

Speaker 1:          07:11          I want a nice quiet ride. This is gonna suck. And I walked outside, hung over and I walked into this Chicago where you know, almost got hit by three fat people. And um, I looked up the street and I saw it, I saw Popeye's and I was like, oh, thank God. And I fucking walked in there and I got all this fucking Popeye's chicken with biscuits and all of this shit food. And I brought it back to the car and as the car pulled up, they came out and I said, hey guys, I got itself some, I've got some food. And they went, oh, that's fucking great. You know, they were hungry or whatever. And they started showering that fucking Popeye's food. And I sat back, nibbling on drum stick, and I swear to God, 10 minutes later they were asleep. I'm not lying. They were fucking asleep, snoring the whole way up.

Speaker 1:          08:10          And I was just sitting there loving life, the whole fucking writeup. And I, you know what, I admitted to them later. They thought it was funny, but that's basically what it is. They called it the Itis, that's what they call it when you eat that shit food and then you have to go to sleep. They call it the Itis, I guess. And by they, I mean African Americans, um, they call it the fucking itis and that's what they got. They, and I learned that from Don because I don't know how that man stayed in shape, but he had the worst diet. He's one of those guys who like you stopped for gas and he comes out of the gas station with like one of those gas station hotdogs and he would eat it and then he would immediately fall asleep. And I, and I would say to Charlie, look at this guy.

Speaker 1:          08:58          Oh he's sleeping. And Chad be like, yeah man, he got the itis. Let me explain that to me and what that little bit of information it went into my evil white brain and I drug my two African American friends way back in the year 2005. Um, and that's a little chicken story for you. What time did you like dad? Everybody. So that's what the fuck they're saying right there. That's what Kentucky Fried Chicken is allegedly saying. I guess I have to say a legend. So their lawyers on retainer don't attack my fucking pop podcast as far as I can tell. I'm asking you right now, a Kentucky Fried Chicken hiding behind your fucking letters, KFC. Is that what the fuck you do? Is that what you're saying?

Speaker 1:          09:46          If you got kids who are not stimulated enough that they can't even sit down. If you haven't read yet to have run them around. You got to tie your kids out. Open the door. You send them out in the fucking yard, Gad God's side, get outside and play. That's what you do. Like a Goddamn one of those fucking Irish dogs. There was bread to have to to herd sheep. You've gotta let that fucking thing run around. Run around in circles. Guy, get out there, take a ball. You just fucking throw it out in traffic and let the dog run around. Dodgy cars that comes in, it's going to lay down. Okay? It's not going to jump all over. Company sticking its cold nose right in there. Fucking who has. That's what you gotta do with your kids. You've got to send them outside, right? But to catch a Predator and all these other fucking shows.

Speaker 1:          10:32          You know, all these shows on TV where people forget their kids are in a car with the windows rolled up and their kids are too fucking dumb to roll them down or they're too weak because they haven't gone outside and climbed a fucking tree and they stay in there and their, their brains get cooked like a boxer. You know, you know that dog boxes, they don't, they don't do well in the sun. Well will neither do fat kids if you leave the windows rolled up, you know, and they got those weak arms that all like the most tedious things they ever did was take a wrapper off of a fucking a, an ice cream sandwich. Right? You can't leave them in the car. My mother left us in the car all the fucking time. She would go to school, she was going to school during the day trying to further her education and she left five fucking kids in the car with the windows rolled up and money for Burger King.

Speaker 1:          11:23          And she would say to us, just go into the Burger. That's the only time you were to leave this car over the left, over the next three fucking hours when I'm in class and she would disappear around the corner after we said absolutely mom. And she walked away. And uh, we immediately would get out of the car, start walking up and down the streets in Boston. We'd go into fucking burger king and we, we'd have some to eat. Do you know what, what happened nowadays, if they just saw five fucking dirty face kids walking up and down, calm AV Boylston street going into a burger king, we're going to cast a fucking nanny. Someone would have filmed it and my mother would have been in, they would have taken us away.

Speaker 1:          12:06          No, but, but they did cause there was no cameras back then or video tape ones. I mean there was, but only people add them on like the news in a young Steven Spielberg. So we went in there and we fucking got some food, climbed bunk cars and fucking yelled at people and Shit. Ditto hanging on Platt parking meters and all that. Hence, we had the fucking forearm strength to roll down the windows and none of us ever had an issue in the car. And you know what? I think that's one to grow on today. You go people, I'm not saying KFC is food. I'm not, I'm just kidding. I'm not saying it's bad food. Every once in awhile. Who's kitting home every once a, we don't go. Don't worry. Great. If he could just fucking do heroin, the way you can eat McDonald's, just like every once in a while he'd just be like, you know what? Yeah, let's just fucking tie off. Not off for the rest of the fucking day. And like, the people at work understood it. Hey, where were you yesterday? Od and yeah, I've got this black tar heroin came in, you know, I hadn't done it like three months away. I figured fuck it. Oh, is that what you did? How was it? I wasn't, you know, like, like you went to Aruba, you said hot. I, it was awesome. Fucking, I don't remember shit.

Speaker 1:          13:21          But you can't, you know, you get addicted to it.
