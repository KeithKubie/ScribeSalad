00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.070
So let's think
about how we could

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.170
find the slope of
the tangent line

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.930
to this curve right
over here, so what

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.230
I have drawn in red, at
the point x equals a.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.300
And we've already seen
this with the definition

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.252
of the derivative.

00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:14.460
We could try to find a
general function that gives us

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.770
the slope of the tangent
line at any point.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.030
So let's say we have
some arbitrary point.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.960
Let me define some arbitrary
point x right over here.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.930
Then this would be the
point x comma f of x.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.730
And then we could
take some x plus h.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.890
So let's say that this
right over here is the point

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.700
x plus h.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.350
And so this point would be
x plus h, f of x plus h.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.610
We can find the slope
of the secant line that

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.860
goes between these two points.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.350
So that would be your
change in your vertical,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.000
which would be f
of x plus h minus f

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.850
of x, over the change
in the horizontal, which

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.637
would be x plus h minus x.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.680
And these two x's cancel.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.290
So this would be the
slope of this secant line.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.350
And then if we want to find the
slope of the tangent line at x,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.260
we would just take the
limit of this expression

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.550
as h approaches 0.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.810
As h approaches 0, this
point moves towards x.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.500
And that slope of the secant
line between these two

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.680
is going to approximate the
slope of the tangent line at x.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.560
And so this right over
here, this we would say

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.130
is equal to f prime of x.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.980
This is still a function of x.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.860
You give me an arbitrary x
where the derivative is defined.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.750
I'm going to plug it into this,
whatever this ends up being.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.870
It might be some nice,
clean algebraic expression.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.420
Then I'm going to
give you a number.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.430
So for example, if
you wanted to find--

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.920
you could calculate
this somehow.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.600
Or you could even
leave it in this form.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.730
And then if you
wanted f prime of a,

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.729
you would just substitute a
into your function definition.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.270
And you would say,
well, that's going

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.590
to be the limit as h approaches
0 of-- every place you see

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.340
an x, replace it with
an a. f of-- I'll

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:31.980
stay in this color for now--
blank plus h minus f of blank,

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.670
all of that over h.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.040
And I left those blanks so
I could write the a in red.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.300
Notice, every place where I
had an x before, it's now an a.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300
So this is the derivative
evaluated at a.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.500
So this is one way to find
the slope of the tangent line

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.720
when x equals a.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.310
Another way-- and
this is often used

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.130
as the alternate form
of the derivative--

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.140
would be to do it directly.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.820
So this is the point
a comma f of a.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.990
Let's just take another
arbitrary point someplace.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.270
So let's say this
is the value x.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.480
This point right over here on
the function would be x comma

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.970
f of x.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.370
And so what's the slope of the
secant line between these two

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.080
points?

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.260
Well, it would be change
in the vertical, which

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:29.980
would be f of x minus f of a,
over change in the horizontal,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.344
over x minus a.

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.260
Actually, let me do that
in that purple color.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.560
Over x minus a.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.600
Now, how could we get a better
and better approximation

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.460
for the slope of the
tangent line here?

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.645
Well, we could take the
limit as x approaches a.

00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:48.540
As x gets closer and
closer and closer to a,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.510
the secant line slope is
going to better and better

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.320
and better approximate the
slope of the tangent line,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.370
this tangent line that
I have in red here.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:04.430
So we would want to take the
limit as x approaches a here.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.370
Either way, we're doing
the exact same thing.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.760
We have an expression for
the slope of a secant line.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.790
And then we're bringing those
x values of those points

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.040
closer and closer together.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.700
So the slopes of those secant
lines better and better

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.510
and better approximate that
slope of the tangent line.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.390
And at the limit, it does become
the slope of the tangent line.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.550
That is the definition
of the derivative.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.382
So this is the more standard
definition of a derivative.

00:04:34.382 --> 00:04:36.590
It would give you your
derivative as a function of x.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.900
And then you can then input
your particular value of x.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.129
Or you could use the alternate
form of the derivative.

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.670
If you know that,
hey, look, I'm just

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.530
looking to find the
derivative exactly at a.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.772
I don't need a
general function of f.

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:50.730
Then you could do this.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.260
But they're doing
the same thing.
