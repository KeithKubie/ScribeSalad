You are listening to radiolab radiolab

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,383
from

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,533
W. N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,720
You don't take it down at one
base of bed? No, this is fine.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,360
What are we doing about the
podcast, by the way? Oh, do you?

6
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:22,200
Should we do that now? Yup. Hey,
I'm Jabil. Rod. This is radio lab.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,180
Yes, we, yes it is. No, we're doing
the introduction. Ready? Here we go.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,390
Let's do it for real.
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,320
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab podcast
and today on the podcast we want to tell

10
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:38,321
you about a guy who hears music in a way
that is just extraordinary and painful.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,380
Just thinking about this story makes
my head hurt. That's Jessica Banco.

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,680
She's a reporter and she's the one
who initially told me the story

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,810
a little while ago. I
went up to visit this guy,

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,340
Bob. Nice to see

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,190
excuse my feet here.

16
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:02,730
And he lives in a tiny town in
Michigan with his wife Linda.

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,390
And who is he? He's an
amazing piano player.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,540
The Library of Congress actually
called him a national treasure. Really?

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,740
He's had this special relationship
with music ever since. He was a boy.

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,330
Did you grow up with any other instruments
inside the house other than the piano

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,760
or was that what you started out? Well,

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,460
I am, my mother made me take
piano lessons and I hated it.

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,720
I didn't like the sound of minor keys
and the piano teachers had me playing a

24
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:41,470
recital in which there's a
Schubert minor. He piece in it.

25
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,640
So on the recital I played it in major

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,300
[inaudible]

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,740
and everyone thought that was a travesty.

28
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,540
These days though, his mean music isn't
so much Schubert. It's actually ragtime,

29
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,280
one three, four, one, two,
three, five the rhythms.

30
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,570
So the thing about ragtime
is that oftentimes the player
is actually playing two

31
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,850
different rhythms at the same
time. One with the left hand,

32
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,043
one with the right hand, right.

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,080
Then you put the rhythms
of three in there, right?

34
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,603
No.

35
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,610
The thing about Bob is he can
do this like times a thousand.

36
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,150
What does that even mean?
Well, let me back up.

37
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,840
I first heard about Bob from a
neurologist named Kirsten Betterman,

38
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,860
Kristen Betterman, who's now at Penn State
University. First time I heard about,

39
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:41,280
but Milan was who friends first and heard
about Bob from a colleague who'd seen

40
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:44,580
him play for an audience, so
I might just take a tune like

41
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,280
he was actually playing multiple
rhythms with his two different hands and

42
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:53,850
switching back and forth between different
pieces of music and carrying on a

43
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:56,370
conversation so you
should at the same time,

44
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,010
well let's say it's not true.

45
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,880
You can look up videos of Bob on youtube
and you can see him performing and

46
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:04,900
throwing out jokes,

47
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,110
but at times you'll see him carry on a
full conversation while playing from the

48
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:11,830
perspective of a neurologist.

49
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,540
This is actually really hard because
the part of your brain that should be

50
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,470
engaged in playing a piece of music that
complicated should also be engaged in

51
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:24,280
having a conversation. The talking part
and the playing part of the same part,

52
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,850
the same part in most of us for
most people, that sort of thing.

53
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,570
Playing a complex piece of
music and having a conversation
would would interfere

54
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,060
with one another. Yes. That's
what you usually would think.

55
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:37,690
Unless you're highly skilled and you
play maybe one piece of music at a time

56
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,430
that you've done multiple times,

57
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:42,640
but even then it would be
very difficult to this degree.

58
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,840
So Kirsten got in touch with Bob and she
started asking him some questions about

59
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:51,730
the way you would perceive music and how
in the course of chatting with him and

60
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,880
talking about how he perceives music and
all of this, he happened to say to her,

61
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,440
but I could hear, uh,

62
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,530
an entire symphony in my hand and I didn't
think that was too big a deal cause I

63
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,070
always listened to two of them at once.

64
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,630
He told her I only have to focus on the
one mentally that I want to hear at a

65
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:14,500
given time. And then that's a piece
I play. But I hear them all ongoing.

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,060
Did he just say he can hear two different
symphonies in his head at the same

67
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,280
time? We thought this
was very unusual. Yeah.

68
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,460
But I mean are we talking the full
symphonies or just the melodies?

69
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,910
Every instrument. Every
instrument. And he can focus in and

70
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,900
turn one of them up, one of them down
and they both run the same old tediously.

71
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,390
Huh. So then, um,

72
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,590
she pushed to the envelope and
asked me if I can, I hear three,

73
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,220
three pieces of music as well.
I don't know. Never tried. Yeah.

74
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,090
But he was like, yeah, I
think I could do three.

75
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,160
When we challenged them a
little bit, actually you said,

76
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,490
I can't do four if you asked me, but I
wouldn't go any further than that. Nope.

77
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,940
That's total just for
symphonies at the same time.

78
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,050
[inaudible]

79
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,020
that's just nothing but, but noise.
Absolute cacophony. You know, the,

80
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:08,550
the four pieces of music that just,
wow. I said nobody can do this.

81
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,170
[inaudible] was really critical.
Yeah. Cause it's not true.

82
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,180
We had to think about how to test this.

83
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,970
Let me tell you about how the experiment
worked and then tell me if you think

84
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:17,050
it's true. All right.

85
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,290
We came up with the behavioral test and
so the first thing Kirsten had to do was

86
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,830
find to control someone to compare Bob
to, right. So she found a conductor,

87
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,310
Peter Perri, who was the former
conductor of the Winston Salem symphony,

88
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,480
who is himself an accomplished musician.
Before the test, she sent him in Bob,

89
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:38,390
four pieces of music. We had
a Schubert's and funny, yeah,

90
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,070
we have rounds. Yeah.

91
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,193
Two

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,583
[inaudible]

93
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,360
and finally one from Mendelson

94
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:00,480
[inaudible].

95
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,080
So you have to keep in mind these four
symphonies are in different keys and

96
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:08,580
different tempos, very different.
And the themes and instrumentations.

97
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,860
And the challenge for them was to
learn these before pieces of music.

98
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,080
Completely memorize them
for different tunes.

99
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:20,100
And they only gave me a couple of days
to listen to them and then play them in

100
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:20,670
their mind.

101
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,360
And we would then ask them where in a
restorative piece they would be after an

102
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:28,560
arbitrary time. I'm not really
following. Okay, so here's what they did.

103
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,530
They put these guys in the
scanner and they said to them,

104
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,720
I want you to play the music in your
mind. Play the music in your mind,

105
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,410
close your eyes and imagine the music.
So no music is playing out loud,

106
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,110
no music playing just inside
their head. Are they imagining it?

107
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:47,760
However they want or know exactly
what they had heard on the CD.

108
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,940
So same as is coming in
and out. Yep. Same Tempo.

109
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,900
So if it was a Vivace on the CD
Vivace in their head. Exactly.

110
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,250
And why were they doing this again? Well,

111
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,890
they wanted to see if these
guys could track via memory,

112
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,520
these really complicated pieces of music.
So they put the guys in the scanner,

113
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,040
they're laying there and on
a screen in front of them,

114
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:09,310
the word start flashes and at that moment
they start playing the first piece of

115
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,210
music back in their head.

116
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,473
[inaudible]

117
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,320
in the control room. They're tracking the
music themselves to follow the timing.

118
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,860
The researchers, yeah. Oh, so while
Bob and the student are imagining it,

119
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,740
they're actually keeping track
of where the real CD is. Exactly.

120
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,230
[inaudible]

121
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,430
they let it go for awhile.

122
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:37,630
[inaudible]

123
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,630
and at an arbitrary moment they
say stop and then they say,

124
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,770
sing to me exactly where you are in the
music. Like the note, the exact phrase,

125
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,670
they go back, they compare
the timing to the CD, right.

126
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,700
To find out if these guys can
really recreate inside their heads.

127
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,850
Exactly what they'd heard. And um,

128
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,380
so I will conduct our control or is able
to listen to one piece of music at a

129
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:06,440
time and wants to really ride on
target with the right answer on.

130
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:08,370
Timing was in a second. Boom.

131
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,530
So this conductors imagined symphony
was only a second off from the real one.

132
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,570
Yup. Same with Bob. So Bob's within
a Notre too bad now. Round two,

133
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,550
the multisite on task, as we called it,

134
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,430
they told them both to start
that first piece of music again.

135
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,300
[inaudible]

136
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,420
and then a little bit later they
said start the second piece of music

137
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,013
in your head

138
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,023
simultaneous

139
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,580
[inaudible] [inaudible]

140
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,930
all right. I've already
like, come on. It's crazy.

141
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,740
Like this is wishlist slipped in the
fantasy and that's what happened for the

142
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:54,790
conductor. He couldn't do it. He
couldn't do two simultaneously. Yeah,

143
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,190
of course. Couldn't do
it. It's impossible.

144
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,340
Almost little chance. He said this
is an overwhelming impossible task.

145
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,630
His brain just shut down.

146
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,650
Well, like he died or something.

147
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:05,860
He stopped even being able to
track the first piece of music. Ah,

148
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,310
he just got confused now where Yoda, Bob,

149
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,110
they put me into the MRI and the, they
asked me stare tune one in your head.

150
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,213
So I did.

151
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,183
[inaudible]

152
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:27,430
then roughly 10, 15 seconds later,
I got a message on the screen.

153
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,820
It said continue
listening to one start two

154
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,330
and then 15 seconds later
continued listening to tunes
one and two starts three

155
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,690
[inaudible] the same thing is true for

156
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:08,860
[inaudible] [inaudible]

157
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,170
then on the screen it's in Stanhope

158
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,490
and then Kirsten came in a little, um,

159
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,000
I could hear her talking to me
from somewhere and she says, Bam,

160
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,470
tell us where are you?

161
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,290
Where are you in tune one fatal
right now? What do you hear?

162
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,360
So I told her and um, I
didn't, I described, um,

163
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,060
what the piece was playing at that point.

164
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,610
Does that Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

165
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,830
And the same thing with tuna,

166
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,533
three and four.

167
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,110
She announced that I was exactly
right into the note in each one of the

168
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:49,944
symphonies,

169
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,233
Jess

170
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,190
telling me something that's
just not really, you know,

171
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,080
I've got a lot of intentions. Just
my common sense right now is yelling,

172
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,600
three-year-old. It really, it really
is mind boggling to think about. Mixed.

173
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:05,660
My brain hurt. But you know, we
proved to you. Yeah, you can do it.

174
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,040
When Kirsten gave you the different
pieces of music to listen to,

175
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,983
Huh?

176
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,440
Did any of them clash? [inaudible]

177
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,233
no.

178
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,020
No. They don't clash it. They're
all just playing different pieces.

179
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,610
There's nothing chaotic about it.

180
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,140
All right. So assuming this is true,

181
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,940
how does he do this? How does he
explain to himself how he does this?

182
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,630
So I think there's two things going on
here. The first has to do with emotion,

183
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,590
emotion,

184
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,600
FAPAs using different brain
areas. I think in his case,

185
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:40,360
probably more more emotional brain center.

186
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah. Motion deepens the way that we
experience things, make stronger memories.

187
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,500
And Bob has a really strong emotional
relationship with music. With the wheel.

188
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,890
Yeah. But it's a little bit beyond
the whole minor keys make me feel sad.

189
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,100
He has really specific emotions associated
with individual keys on the scale.

190
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,340
Huh? I'm gonna when I hear
c major, it's a very bland,

191
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,990
he is like, um, I don't
know how to describe,

192
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,210
it's like heating water, super,
something like that. But d major,

193
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,710
the break he,

194
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:19,711
that makes me want to dance even
though I can dance and every he ever,

195
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:24,700
every one of the keys of the piano had
a different emotional attachment to me.

196
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,290
So for Bob, if just the keys are
triggering different emotions. Yeah.

197
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,560
Imagine what it must be like
when you get to actual music.

198
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,380
[inaudible]

199
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,980
so you think that's something about how
he experiences the emotions of the music

200
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:43,310
makes it etch more deeply in his brain
or something? Yeah, I think he's,

201
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,860
when he's got these four
pieces of music going,

202
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,270
he's not thinking hard about
tracking each one of them.

203
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,530
He's already in them.

204
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:54,740
He feels them inside his body and you
can feel more with them one feeling at a

205
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:58,940
time. So that's one idea.

206
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:06,370
The second idea has to do actually more
with image and space really listened to

207
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:10,760
the two different pieces. So Bob often
closes his eyes when he's talking.

208
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:12,260
You don't hear. It just helps him focus.

209
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:17,261
So I asked him if he could try playing
back two pieces of music right now.

210
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,340
And I asked him, when you hear
these two symphonies in your head,

211
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,540
what are you seeing?

212
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,220
I can picture, um,

213
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,910
two symphony orchestra
sitting side by side.

214
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,820
He actually sees the literal
orchestras in his head.

215
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,820
Yeah. And I see them as silhouettes.

216
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,160
There's no conductor
in front of either one.

217
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,940
There's a brownish hue
out in front of them.

218
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:47,941
Like it's just a floor that's more the
color of the deep brown of a Valium and

219
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:53,890
in back of them. And there's a
semi-circle. It's bluish in color.

220
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,560
Then when I listen to them,

221
00:13:56,561 --> 00:14:00,430
I'm going to listen to Brahms second
symphony over in the left side,

222
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,380
[inaudible]

223
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,370
and uh, over in the, uh,
right side. Don't turn in.

224
00:14:07,371 --> 00:14:11,360
The emperor can share the
third movement of NATO.

225
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,270
And so I'm listening to that. No,
these are in two different keys.

226
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,630
Emperors and e flat. Brahms is d.

227
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:22,250
So now if I want to pay
particular attention, oh,

228
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,560
let's say I'm going to
listen to the emperor here.

229
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:28,740
I'm going to go into the major. I
just sped it up. Yeah, I can. I can.

230
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,460
They can speed the thing out and
they'd go to some of their part in it.

231
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:35,610
I can jump backwards. Let's see,
just a minute. I can hear it. An F,

232
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:37,420
I can put it into any here. One,

233
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,250
two but I'm going to rar forward in this
third movement of the emperor here and

234
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,750
I'm listening to the a e major variation
on the piano, which is just like a,

235
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,150
or it's just racking and this
a beautiful, he made your part

236
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,920
pivoting around to the Flint and going
up and down from there and the piano.

237
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,250
Wow. Wow.

238
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,820
So his crazy towns may have something to
do with this movie making thing that he

239
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:07,780
does in his head. Yeah, but it's not
just a movie. It's like a three d movie.

240
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,990
He can use it to find out where a
specific instrument is. How do you mean?

241
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,520
In his mind's eye,

242
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:18,521
he can fly out over these orchestras
and actually look down on the individual

243
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:19,730
instrument he wants to see.

244
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,640
When I'm looking down and I see
the piano out in front of them,

245
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,470
he can zoom in and see them
playing their instrument.

246
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,131
Okay,

247
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:31,430
now I'm up there in the air listening
to this thing over and over on my left

248
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,230
side. They can still hear this
brown is going along at Brahms.

249
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:37,390
I can only see the
silhouettes from the front,

250
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,120
whereas the gathering
of the emperor for here,

251
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:44,290
I can see full color and every person's
face in it and plus here the lines that

252
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,950
they're playing

253
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,800
and as he's flying out
over these orchestras,

254
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,460
the instruments actually get louder
and softer depending on where he is.

255
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,160
Like if he goes behind
orchestra number one,

256
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,580
I can hear the bass, which can much
louder than let's see and yeah.

257
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,090
Then if I go over to the left
side, I'm hearing the violins

258
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,950
and he says he can float right above
the players and actually see [inaudible]

259
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,450
what they're doing. They can
see every raincoat in the,

260
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,910
in the pleaded shirts of their tech CEOs

261
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,423
[inaudible]

262
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,380
and they can see the deep brownish
orange color of the violas.

263
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,120
And I can hear the deep sound,
beautiful sound of that low viola

264
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:23,800
[inaudible]

265
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,800
and I can hear every little Rhett
Rosin scratch a cross their bows

266
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:33,780
[inaudible]

267
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,230
God listening to music for this guy
must be like, like an acid trip.

268
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,470
The way that he's describing
it, I think it is.

269
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,060
And when he listens to recorded music,

270
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:46,500
it's so much diminished from what he
feels when he's imagining it. Huh.

271
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:51,000
So he doesn't listen to cds. He cannot
stand listening to cds Dow. Wow. Yeah.

272
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,050
He's a real example of the
extremes of the human mind.

273
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,570
So what does he do with these crazy
towns? I mean, is he a, is he like a,

274
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,710
a, a billionaire? Nope. First of all,

275
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,510
ragtime is not exactly the most popular
form of music in the United States at

276
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:13,170
this point. Um, but it's what he
likes to play and he plays, you know,

277
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,000
250 shows a year.

278
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,870
But a lot of them are at
stark societies or churches.

279
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,520
Oh, Linda and I, we've had a small
motor home. It's an airport bus,

280
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:26,340
one of those little 15 passenger buses.

281
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,720
It's got a hot shower and a
bathroom and I'm bad too of course.

282
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,781
So you know,

283
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:36,010
he travels around and his little motor
home with his wife when he can and

284
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:40,030
without her when he can't and sleeps in
Walmart parking lots is working on an

285
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:41,320
opera, which is mostly done.

286
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,830
And he writes it in his head while
he's driving and then he sits down in a

287
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:51,060
McDonald's and writes it out
on paper. And uh, you know,

288
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,950
that's pretty much what he does with this

289
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,000
[inaudible]

290
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,550
thanks to reporter Jess
Banco for that great story.

291
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,600
And also to producer Mark Phillips
for making it sound so good.

292
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,420
But why should we share the
information that we just did?

293
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:28,890
Why not do the outro in a way that Bob
