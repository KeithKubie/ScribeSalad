00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.180
There are urban legends surrounding every
walk of life and the world of movies is no

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.180
different.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.799
Some are rebuffed - like the supposed "ghost
child" on the set of Three Men and a Baby

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.070
turning out to be a cardboard cut-out of Ted
Danson - while others remain a mystery.In

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.520
some cases, mysterious events happening on
and around movie sets have led people to believe

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.430
that the sets in question were actually cursed.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.891
Strange occurrences, freak accidents and even,
in some cases, the deaths of crew and cast

00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:37.289
members, have resulted in such conclusions.It's
an often tragic topic, but it's certainly

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.380
an interesting one - and it's what this video
is all about.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.890
Here are ten movies with shockingly cursed
sets.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.399
The Passion of the Christ
Movies that deal with religion are notorious

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.190
for having cursed sets and none dealt with
the subject more controversially than Mel

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.090
Gibson's The Passion of the Christ - and it
was the movie's star Jim Caviezel, who played

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.350
Jesus, that suffered the supposed curse most
severely in this case.Caviezel was struck

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.390
by lightning during filming, as was assistant
director Jan Michelini on two occasions.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.900
But Caviezel also obtained lacerations during
whipping scenes, dislocated his shoulder while

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.639
performing the crucifixion scenes, suffered
with hypothermia, and contracted both a lung

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:17.030
infection and pneumonia.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.749
He also suffered painful skin infections from
the makeup that was used to depict his gruesome

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.360
injuries in the movie.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.840
Poor guy!

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.100
Poltergeist
1982's Poltergeist was notorious for its supposedly

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.110
cursed set.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.260
Some people believe that "the Poltergeist
curse" was caused by the fact that real skeletons

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.680
were used during filming but, regardless of
what caused it, there's no doubt that the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.009
events surrounding the movie - and indeed
the entire franchise - were both creepy and

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.249
absolutely tragic.In the six year period between
the three films, cast members claimed to be

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.420
haunted by ghosts in their own homes and four
of the main actors died.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.749
Most infamously and tragically, young Heather
O'Rourke died four months before the third

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.079
film was released thanks to a botched operation.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.069
Additionally, Dominique Dunne was murdered
by her boyfriend soon after the first film

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.359
was released, Julian Beck died of stomach
cancer whilst filming the second film, and

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.869
Will Sampson died soon after filming it due
to kidney transplant complications.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.319
And remember that creepy clown toy in the
first movie?

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.920
Due to a malfunction in the prop's mechanics,
it really did choke young actor Oliver Robbins

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.470
- though he did survive the incident.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.660
Rosemary's Baby
Rosemary's Baby is one of the most disturbing

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.590
and iconic horror movies of all time, and
a supposed curse on the movie's set led to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.310
some horrific things happening to the cast
and crew.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.510
The movie's producer even claimed that “The
story of Rosemary’s Baby was happening in

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.510
real life.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.720
Witches, all of them, were casting their spell,
and I was becoming one of the principal players.”Director

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.280
Roman Polanski's pregnant wife, Sharon Tate,
was murdered by Charlie Manson's clan a year

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.140
after the movie's release - with the murder
scene being one of the most sickening ever

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.140
witnessed.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.000
Producer William Castle suffered from sudden
kidney failure after receiving hate mail about

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.570
the film, and the film's composer Krzysztof
Komeda died of a sudden blood clot on his

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.710
brain - something that was eerily reminiscent
of a character in the movie itself.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.671
The Exorcist
Given the subject matter of the infamously

00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:11.940
controversial 1973 movie The Exorcist, is
it any wonder that the movie's set was said

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.940
to be cursed?

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.210
Not only did strange and terrible things happen
to the movie's cast and crew, but even audiences

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.660
were affected by the supposed curse.Where
do we even start here?

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.860
Well, the movie's set inexplicably burned
down and delayed filming for six weeks.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.580
Star Ellen Burstyn hurt her back and missed
weeks of filming whilst bedbound.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.470
Actor Jack McGowran died suddenly just one
week after he finished filming his role in

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.470
the movie.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.490
Half of the crew were struck down with sunstroke
or dysentery whilst filming on location in

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.490
Iraq.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.240
A night-watchman and a special effects expert
died during the making of the film and, ultimately,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.330
things got so bad that the director recruited
a priest to exorcise the set.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.630
During screenings of the movie, viewers blacked
out, vomited, had heart attacks, and one woman

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.880
even miscarried.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.060
The Amityville Horror
The Amityville Horror is supposedly a true

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.190
story and the original movie based on it - which
was made in 1979 - spawned a number of sequels

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.610
and a 2005 remake.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.410
It was the sets of the original and its aforementioned
reboot that were supposedly cursed.The star

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.610
of the original, James Brolin, wasn't overly
keen on the idea of starring in the movie

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.550
and only accepted the role after a strange
event occurred.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.470
He was reading the script in the early hours
of the morning when a pair of his pants suddenly

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.989
fell off a hanger, causing him to leap out
of his chair in terror.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.009
Years later, Just before filming was due to
start on the 2005 remake, a dead body washed

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.840
up on shore near the movie's set, and Ryan
Reynolds, the remake's star, has claimed that

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.969
members of the crew kept waking up at a quarter
past three each morning while filming.

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.199
This was also the time that the real murders
that influenced the story took place.

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.229
Twilight Zone: The Movie
In 1983, a movie based on The Twilight Zone

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.070
television series was released.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.990
It was in anthology form, with John Landis,
Steven Spielberg and George Miller each directing

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.460
a different segment - and the movie was believed
to be cursed.In one scene involving a helicopter,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.389
a nearby air mortar blew off the chopper’s
tail.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.530
It crashed into the river below, severing
the heads of one of the movie's stars - Victor

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.490
Morrow - and a Vietnamese child actor called
Myca Dinh Le, and crushing another Vietnamese

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.439
child actor named Renee Shin-Yi Chen to death.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.379
Both of the children had been hired illegally
by the producers.

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.410
Eerily, the film’s concept artist had included
a burnt-out helicopter in the middle of the

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.080
river in one of his sketches, foreshadowing
the details of the accident.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.719
Even more eerily, a year before his death,
Victor Morrow had taken out a $5 million life

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:30.289
insurance policy after having a premonition
that he would die in a helicopter crash.

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.650
The Crow
1994's The Crow is one of the most underrated

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.930
superhero movies of all time - people forget
just how good it was, given how low key it

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.169
was in comparison to the superhero movies
of today - but the number of horror incidents

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.349
on its set would suggest that the movie was
cursed.The first day of filming set the tone,

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.690
when a crew member's crane ran into a power
cable, resulting in him suffering burns on

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.080
90% of his body.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.930
From that point on, a construction driver
drove a screwdriver through his own hand,

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.259
a set sculptor destroyed the props room with
his car, and a storm destroyed most of the

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:01.259
set itself.

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.320
Of course, the most tragic occurence was the
death of the movie's star - Brandon Lee - who

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.529
was shot dead by accident during filming.

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.979
Rather spookily, the event mirrored a scene
from his father Bruce's movie Game of Death,

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.300
in which an actor is shot dead when gangsters
replaced a prop bullet with a real one.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.169
Bruce would die before completing that movie.

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.099
The Wizard of Oz
The Wizard of Oz was released in 1939 - long

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.490
before safety regulations even existed on
movie sets, let alone before they were anywhere

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.169
near as strict as they are today - so the
accidents that happened on the movie's set

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.439
could be put down to that, but there were
indeed quite a few accidents and many believe

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:40.029
that they must have occurred due to the set
being cursed.The original Tin Man, Buddy Ebsen,

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:44.449
was almost killed by an allergic reaction
to the aluminum powder used for his makeup,

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:46.530
resulting in him being replaced by Jack Haley.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.409
Margaret Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch,
caught on fire and refused to perform any

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:55.029
more pyrotechnic scenes thereafter, and the
little dog who played Toto broke a paw.

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:59.029
However, that strange thing appearing to swing
around in the background of one scene wasn't

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:04.659
a munchkin actor who hung himself, as some
people suggested – it was merely a bird.

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:07.229
The Omen
The Omen is another horror movie that dealt

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.629
with religion as a theme - an apparently sure-fire
way to encourage weird things to happen to

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:16.090
the people involved - and, sure enough, that's
exactly what happened during and after the

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.580
filming of this 1976 classic.There was an
animal handler on the movie's set helping

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.939
to organise the scene in which a baboon goes
into a frenzy, and he was killed by a tiger

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:25.969
the the day after that scene was filmed.

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:29.909
Then, soon after the movie was released, the
special effects director was involved in a

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:34.699
car crash that tragically killed his girlfriend
- she was decapitated in an eerily similar

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:36.789
way to one of the characters in the film.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:41.330
Even more bizarre was the fact that a sign
by the wreckage supposedly read "Ommen 66km".

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.809
But the absolute creepiest thing about the
accident was that it happened on Friday the

00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:48.470
13th of August, 1976.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.430
It's enough to send a shudder down your spine.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.909
The Matrix
Most of the movies on this list are from the

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:58.710
horror genre - which often makes the fact
that the sets were cursed even creepier - but

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.069
that's not always the case.

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:04.400
1999's The Matrix is a sci-fi classic, but
events that occurred during production led

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.830
people to believe in something called "The
Curse of the Matrix".Two cast members - Aaliyah

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.770
and Gloria Foster - died during filming (in
a plane crash and from diabetes respectively),

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.199
Keanu Reeves' real-life relationship broke
down after the birth of his stillborn child

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:22.280
during production, Reeves himself had to spend
his own money to ensure production continued

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.189
after mounting costs threatened to bring it
to a halt, a number of the special-effects

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:30.680
houses commissioned to produce individual
shots went bust - and that's not even everything,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.610
but we'd be talking all day if we tried to
cover it all.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.789

cursed movie sets.
