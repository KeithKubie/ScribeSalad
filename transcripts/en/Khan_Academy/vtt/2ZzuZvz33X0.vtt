00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.460
We're asked to solve for s.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.500
And we have s squared minus
2s minus 35 is equal to 0.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.570
Now if this is the first time
that you've seen this type of

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.140
what's essentially a quadratic
equation, you might be tempted

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.790
to try to solve for s using
traditional algebraic means,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.760
but the best way to solve this,
especially when it's

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.690
explicitly equal to 0, is to
factor the left-hand side, and

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.380
then think about the fact that
those binomials that you

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.990
factor into, that they have
to be equal to 0.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.890
So let's just do that.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.000
So how can we factor this?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.390
We've seen it in several ways.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.040
I'll show you the standard
we've been doing it, by

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.260
grouping, and then there's a
little bit of a shortcut when

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.670
you have a 1 as a coefficient
over here.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.580
So when you do something by
grouping, when you factor by

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.860
grouping, you think about two
numbers whose sum is going to

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.710
be equal to negative 2.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.436
So you think about two numbers
whose sum, a plus b, is equal

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:54.890
to negative 2 and whose product
is going to be equal

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.540
to negative 35.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.530
a times b is equal
to negative 35.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.900
So if the product is a negative
number, one has to be

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.910
positive, one has
to be negative.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.490
And so if you think about it,
ones that are about two apart,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.420
you have 5 and negative 7,
I think that'll work.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.410
5 plus negative 7 is equal
to negative 2.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.770
So to factor by grouping, you
split this middle term.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.540
We can split this into a--
let me write it this way.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.450
We have s squared, and then this
middle term right here,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.920
I'll do it in pink.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.440
This middle term right there I
can write it as plus 5s minus

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.140
7s and then we have
the minus 35.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.560
And then, of course, all
of that is equal to 0.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.430
Now, we call it factoring by
grouping because we group it.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.120
So we can group these first two
terms. And these first two

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.870
terms, they have a common
factor of s.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.900
So let's factor that out.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.090
You have s times s plus 5.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.020
That's the same thing as
s squared plus 5s.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.850
Now, in these second two terms
right here, you have a common

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.510
factor of negative 7, so
let's factor that out.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.290
So you have negative
7 times s plus 5.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.670
And, of course, all of
that is equal to 0.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.580
Now, we have two terms here,
where both of them have s plus

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.830
5 as a factor.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.240
So we can factor that out.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.320
So let's do that.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:37.930
So you have s plus 5 times
this s right here, right?

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.930
S plus 5 times s will
give you this term.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.640
And then you have minus
that 7 right there.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.580
I undistributed the s plus 5.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.940
And then this is going
to be equal to 0.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.890
Now that we've factored it, we
just have to think a little

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.390
bit about what happens
when you take the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.520
product of two numbers?

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.200
I mean, s plus 5 is a number.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.180
s minus 7 is another number.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.930
And we're saying that the
product of those two numbers

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.940
is equal to zero.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.570
If ever told you that I had
two numbers, if I told you

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.110
that I had the numbers a times
b and that they equal to 0,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.770
what do we know about either
a or b or both of them?

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.280
Well, at least one of them has
to be equal to 0, or both of

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.150
them have to be equal to 0.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.090
So, the fact that this number
times that number is equal to

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:30.820
zero tells us that either s plus
5 is equal to 0 or-- and

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.120
maybe both of them-- s minus
7 is equal to 0.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.370
I'll do that in just green.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.925
And so you have these two
equations, and actually, we

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:44.020
could say and/or.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.000
It could be or/and, either way,
and both of them could be

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.470
equal to 0.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.390
So let's see how we can
solve for this.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.020
Well, we can just subtract
5 from both sides of this

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.280
equation right there.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.150
And so you get, on the left-hand
side, you have s is

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.620
equal to negative 5.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.840
That is one solution to the
equation, or you can add 7 to

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.630
both sides of that equation, and
you get s is equal to 7.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.600
So if s is equal to negative 5,
or s is equal to 7, then we

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.019
have satisfied this equation.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.250
We can even verify it.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.890
If you make s equal to negative
5, you have positive

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.810
25 plus 10, which is minus 35.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.410
That does equal zero.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.890
If you have 7, 49 minus 14
minus 35 does equal zero.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.280
So we've solved for s.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.490
Now, I mentioned there's
an easier way to do it.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.270
And when you have something like
this, where you have 1 as

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.980
the leading coefficient,
you don't have to do

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.120
this two-step factoring.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.130
Let me just show
you an example.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:57.460
If I just have x plus a
times x plus b, what

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.570
is that equal to?

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.010
x times x is x squared,
x times b is bx.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.470
a times x is plus ax.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.590
a times b is ab.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.050
So you get x squared plus--
these two can be added-- plus

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.350
a plus bx plus ab.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.260
And that's the pattern that
we have right here.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.300
We have 1 as a leading
coefficient here, we have 1 as

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.770
a leading coefficient here.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.080
So once we have our two
numbers that add up to

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.090
negative 2, that's our a plus
b, and we have our product

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.050
that gets to negative 35, then
we can straight just factor it

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.990
into the product of
those two things.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.410
So it will be-- or the product
of the binomials, where those

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.610
will be the a's and the b's.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.110
So we figured it out.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.460
It's 5 and negative 7.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.050
5 plus negative 7
is negative 2.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.130
5 times negative 7
is negative 35.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.660
So we could have just straight
factored at this point.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.030
2, well, actually this
was the case of s.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.920
So we could have factored it
straight to the case of s plus

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.860
5 times s minus 7.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.920
We could have done that straight
away and would've

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.850
gotten to that right there.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.320
And, of course, that whole
thing was equal to zero.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.960
So that would've been a little
bit of a shortcut, but

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.520
factoring by grouping is a
completely appropriate way to

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.090
do it as well.
