00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.970
What I want to figure
out in this video is

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.600
the area under the curve
y equals 1 over x squared,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.270
with x equals 1 as
our lower boundary

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.190
and have no upper
boundary, just keep

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.110
on going forever and forever.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.960
It really is essentially
as x approaches infinity.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.140
So I want to figure out
what this entire area is.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.990
And one way that
we can denote that

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.540
is with an improper
definite integral,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.010
or an improper integral.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.520
And we would denote it as
1 is our lower boundary,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.414
but we're just going to
keep on going forever

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:33.330
as our upper boundary.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.120
So our upper
boundary is infinity.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.960
And we're taking the integral
of 1 over x squared dx.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.170
And so let me be very clear.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.170
This right over here is
an improper integral.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.190
Now how do we actually
deal with this?

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.210
Well, by definition
this is the same thing

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.460
as the limit as n
approaches infinity

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.380
of the integral from 1 to
n of 1 over x squared dx.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.270
And this is nice, because we
know how to evaluate this.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.430
This is just a definite integral
where the upper boundary is n.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.050
And then we know
how to take limits.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.750
We can figure out what the limit
is as n approaches infinity.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.680
So let's figure out if we can
actually evaluate this thing.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.186
So the second fundamental
theorem of calculus,

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.060
or the second part of
the fundamental theorem

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.685
of calculus, tells us that
this piece right over here--

00:01:30.685 --> 00:01:32.060
just let me write
the limit part.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.730
So this part I'll just rewrite.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.762
The limit as n
approaches infinity of--

00:01:37.762 --> 00:01:39.970
and we're going to use the
second fundamental theorem

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.480
of calculus.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.490
We're going to evaluate
the antiderivative of 1

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.170
over x squared or x
to the negative 2.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.920
So the antiderivative
of x to the negative 2

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.700
is negative x to the negative 1.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.040
So negative x to the negative
1 or negative 1 over x.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.885
So negative 1/x is
the antiderivative.

00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:04.950
And we're going to evaluate
at n and evaluate it at 1.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.030
So this is going to be equal
to the limit as n approaches

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.210
infinity.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.890
Let's see, if we evaluate this
thing at n, we get negative 1

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.550
over n.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.810
And from that we're
going to subtract

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.965
this thing evaluated at 1.

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:27.710
So it's negative 1 over
1, or it's negative 1.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.930
So this right over
here is negative 1.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.160
And so we're going to find the
limit as n approaches infinity

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.270
of this business.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.500
This stuff right here is
just the stuff right here.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.250
I haven't found the limit yet.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.680
So this is going to be equal
to the limit as n approaches

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.220
infinity of-- let's see,
this is positive 1--

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.340
and we can even write that minus
1 over n-- of 1 minus 1 over n.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.770
And lucky for us, this
limit actually exists.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.010
Limit as n approaches infinity,
this term right over here

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.670
is going to get closer and
closer and closer to 0.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.240
1 over infinity you can
essentially view as 0.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.720
So this right over
here is going to be

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.900
equal to 1, which
is pretty neat.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.790
We have this area that
has no right boundary.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.570
It just keeps on going forever.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.960
But we still have a
finite area, and the area

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.780
is actually exactly equal to 1.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.710
So in this case we had
an improper integral.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.950
And because we were actually
able to evaluate it and come up

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.500
with the number that this
limit actually existed,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.270
we say that this improper
integral right over here

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.500
is convergent.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.345
If for whatever reason
this was unbounded

00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:41.860
and we couldn't come up with
some type of a finite number

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.750
here, if the area
was infinite, we

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.930
would say that it is divergent.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.620
So right over here we figured
out a kind of neat thing.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.141
This area is exactly 1.
