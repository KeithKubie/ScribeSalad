00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:23.380
[ Silence ]

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.700
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: Okay.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.240
Great. This is the
fifth session of the day

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.580
as the board tells me.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.360
This is the intersection of
moral rights and other laws.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.250
As you heard earlier today, the
U.S. adapted the patchwork model

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.980
to providing moral rights upon
joining the Berne Convention.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.360
In the U.S. our mechanisms

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.130
for recognizing moral
rights come not just

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.070
from the Copyright Act itself
but also from a variety

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.060
of other federal and state
laws, as well as supplementation

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.530
from private ordering.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.190
The patchwork, though, isn't
just the source of moral rights,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.170
it's also the scope
of the rights we have

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.860
and that's what we're going
to discuss on this panel.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.740
Not just where those right come
from but how they're defined

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.730
and how their definition
is shaped by other laws.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.260
We'll look at the
interactions and instantiations

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.990
within the Copyright Act itself
such as the fair use doctrine

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.490
and VARA, the boundaries
of VARA,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.110
at free speech considerations
that exist outside of fair use

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.010
and the traditional contour of
copyright law, and at business

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.410
and contractual arrangements
that guarantee proxies

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.680
for moral rights such as you
heard earlier the creative

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.990
commons created by license.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.510
We have some amazing panelists
here to discuss these issues.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.430
On my left is professor
Sonya Bonneau

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.860
of Georgetown University
Law Center,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.100
to her left is Paul Alan did
we say earlier it was Leevy?

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.210
Yeah, not Leavy.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.380
Paul Alan Levy, an attorney

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.590
with the Public Citizen
Litigation Group,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.620
to his left is Eugene Mopsik,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.090
a retired professional
photographer

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.480
and a longtime advocate
for visual artists,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.260
then Nancy E. Wolf a partner

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.090
at the IP media entertainment
law firm Cowan, DeBaets,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.630
and on the far end
is Kate Spelman,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.980
who is here from Seattle
where she's a shareholder

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.550
at the law firm Lane Powell.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.560
So I'm going to turn this
over to the panelists

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.380
for brief remarks to
discuss various aspects

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.040
of these intersections and then
we'll have a number of questions

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.830
to discuss among ourselves
and then at the end

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.510
as you've seen we'll have
about five minutes hopefully

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.160
for audience questions.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.980
So Sonya?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.070
&gt;&gt; Sonya Bonneau: Okay.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.960
Well, I hate to bring up
VARA again but it is one

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.820
of the few moral rights
legislative acts that we have

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.670
and I just wanted to talk
about an intersection

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.890
from a policy standpoint
of VARA's place

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.340
in the Copyright Act and its --

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.050
the multiplicitous goals that it
-- under which it was enacted.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.530
And even though it's this tiny
tiny narrowly circumscribed

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.240
statute, it purported
to do a lot.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.020
A lot of the legislative history
talked about different things.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.090
One was a sense that copyright
law doesn't help the visual

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.760
artist who produces
unique objects.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.580
Everyone else works on a system
of number of copies sold whereas

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.480
for the visual artist
you sell its over.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.210
The other was what you can think

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.720
of as the true moral rights
perspective where it's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.320
about the individual's
connection

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.280
with their work although that
to the extent that's what it's

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.530
supposed to do there was
really no reason to limit it

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.840
to visual artists but
again that's part of it.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.810
You see that in the
there's a lot

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.680
of flowery rhetoric romantic
artist type rhetoric whenever

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.060
courts talk about it regardless

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.820
of whether they are actually
thinking that's important.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.360
And then there was the
cultural preservation side to it

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.520
which is what I'm
going to focus on.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.980
As Peter, you discussed earlier,
that is the one the VARA's right

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.490
against complete
destruction of a work

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:23.020
of recognized stature is
actually the one aspect of VARA

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.670
that is not required by Berne.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.120
So the U.S., despite its
hundred year resistance

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.510
to Berne went ahead
and enacted something

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.100
that goes a little bit beyond
what was required but not beyond

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.160
in a moral rights way.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.120
I think it was part
of their idea

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.890
that this could benefit the
public because it assumes

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.440
that the artist's interest,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.800
the artist who is enforcing
this right is directly aligned

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.540
with the public interest.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.480
So art preservation is good,
we can get moral rights

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.070
and we can also serve the public
interest by saving great art.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.920
The problem is within
the Copyright Act,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.730
copyright law is based on
a progress model in which,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.140
as I'm sure you all know, the
author gets a temporary monopoly

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.940
on their work so that they
can profit from the number

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.220
of copies sold and then that's
the incentive for creativity

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.720
and then it goes away and the
public gets access to the work.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:40.430
Whereas the preservation idea
is a completely different notion

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.420
of -- it preserves.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:52.090
It rewards the status quo and
it's animated by an artist

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.840
when someone wants to destroy
their work, and I'm only talking

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.450
about the destruction provision.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.990
So you've got a very
different dynamic set up,

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.470
and I think that's partly
why it hasn't worked well

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.450
and these combinations

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.760
and intersections become even
more problematic when you look

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.570
at VARA and the fact that
that's the main provision

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.520
that is invoked.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.570
I mean very little of it
the case law's attribution

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.110
because the circumscribed
set of artifacts

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.570
of unique objects is just --

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.850
it's limited to that kind of
production and reproduction.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.080
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
Thank you, Sonya.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.150
[ Laughter ]

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.400
Paul do you want to jump in
and talk about free speech?

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.720
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy: Sure.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.020
So it's awfully hard to come
out against moral rights;

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.830
the catch phrase sounds so good.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.360
And there are certainly
compelling stories told

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.280
about abuses directed at works

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.010
by certain offbeat
individuals who are authors.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.240
But if moral rights are
legislated they'll be enjoyed

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.130
equally by the mainstream
commercial titans.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.240
From a copyleft perspective,
which is mine I worry

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.440
about the impact of legislating
new rights on the public domain

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.280
and more broadly on
what might be described

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.000
as fair uses and
downstream uses.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.300
Because even and even

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.090
if the newly adopted moral
rights have fair use exceptions,

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.870
you worry about the
transaction costs of having

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.940
to defend lawsuits in
which fair use rights

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.970
or first amendment rights are
raised as a defense not to speak

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.110
of the intimidating
impact of demand letters.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.470
To the extent that the moral
rights debate really represents

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.980
a struggle between
individual authors

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.600
and what might be called the
corporate copyright exploiting

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.730
industries, my sympathies are
certainly with the individuals,

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.800
but it's hard to see
moral rights be legislated

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.750
that give rights only
against those exploiters.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.130
And moreover it seems to me
that advocates of moral rights

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.840
for individual creators
want to have it both ways.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.360
They want to make it
easy to make money

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.780
from expression using
the incentives

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.670
that copyright law fosters by
licensing works through a system

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.330
that facilitates the
use for monetary rewards

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.100
and taking advantage of the
ever-increasing remedies

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.060
that are available
to copyright owners.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.830
The ridiculous extension

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.230
of copyrighted terms
whenever Disney's rights are

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.680
about to expire.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.760
The terrifying levels of
statutory damages, advocacy,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.710
criminal enforcement programs
when federal prosecutors

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.700
so that rights owners don't have
to have the bother of enforcing

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.020
for themselves, and of course
ready awards of attorney fees.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.360
At the same time some creators
want to use moral rights

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.380
as a club to stop downstream
uses that they don't

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.690
like even though they could have
prevented many of those uses

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.070
through licensing making
the kinds of choices

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.560
that Melvin talked about but
that most creators don't want

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.870
to insert into their
contracts either

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.790
because it would make their
works much less marketable

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.630
or because they lack
the economic clout

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.810
to enforce them or
to insist on them.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.240
So ultimately despite my
sympathies it seems to me

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.240
that before we give new rights
to creators we ought to think

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.660
about cutting back on the
rights that they already have.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.710
Rather than talking
about moral rights

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.040
as a bundle moreover
we ought to be thinking

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.750
about specific moral rights.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.770
And it seems to me
the proponents need

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.570
to justify the need for
a particular moral right

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.920
to the extent -- this goes to
the question that I asked Jane

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.990
at the end of her talk.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.390
I mean most of what she
said about the right

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.820
to attribution was,
well we agreed to it

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.510
and there was a long answer
about why we agreed to it

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.260
and we can debate
whether we agreed to

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.550
and exactly what we agreed to.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.230
At the very tail end of her
answer we heard something

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.970
about the incentive to create
and so what I want to know is:

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.840
do we not have sufficient
creation?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.230
Do we need to have more
rights, moral rights in order

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.760
to create an incentive
to create?

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.130
We also talked about the
interests of consumers

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.210
but what evidence is there

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.460
that consumers care
about attribution?

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:06.530
Yes, I mean in trademark law the
reason why attribution rights

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.270
are important is because in
certain circumstances consumers

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.330
care about source.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.660
And when you're in
a circumstance

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.950
where the consumers
don't care about source,

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.280
you have relatively
little trademark rights.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.740
So what's the evidence that
we need a right of attribution

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.810
to serve real interests of
consumers who care about source?

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.580
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: So Paul
talked about negotiations

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.830
and licensing agreements.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.460
That sets up nicely.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.720
Gene, do you want to talk

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.250
about how creators
guarantee themselves

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.240
at least attribution rights,
sometimes integrity rights,

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.790
through guild agreements,
contracts

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.570
and how it's maybe a poor fit
for some types of creators?

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.350
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Well,
I'm going to start out --

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.870
I have to make an
observation first,

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.390
which is a rather strange irony
that here we are at an event

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.530
about authors attribution
and integrity and only one

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:57.790
of the images in the program has
an actual credit for a creator.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.970
We'll go on from there.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.610
And I'm going to make
some general comments

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.090
and then I'll actually make
some comments that are on topic.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.970
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
To be fair, I think some

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.470
of the credits are actually
at the end of the bios.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.950
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: All right.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.670
It appears to me
that moral right

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.520
for all practical purposes
are not on the radar

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.320
of visual artists
and photographers.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.800
It's not something that they
think about in negotiations.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.240
They have enough
trouble trying to figure

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.140
out whether their work is
published versus unpublished,

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.230
and moral rights
just don't exist

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.930
for all practical purposes,

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.730
and under VARA commercial
artists are excluded

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.850
from any real protection.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:47.060
I would say that VARA and
Berne are both examples

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.150
of an analogue solution

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.480
to what's now become
a digital problem.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.020
The works that are protected
by VARA are in fact the works

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.260
that need the least
amount of protection today

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.480
and the commercial works are
much more easily separated

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.760
from their identifying
information

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:15.590
than the limited numbers
of works of fine art.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.060
The preservation of
identifying information

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.180
such as rights holder,
contact information

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.560
and licensing history needs
to be easily associated

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.350
and maintained with images.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.190
Ultimately its attribution
is the holy grail

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.210
for photographers.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.920
Without that everything really
falls apart, there's no end,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.430
there's no means to get

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:45.110
to creating an ongoing
income stream from works.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:49.410
While it's trade practice
for editorial work

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:54.150
to customarily have
a creator credit,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.430
the truth of the matter is that
it's very difficult enforce.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:03.920
And as Alan pointed out, yeah,
the contracts are there but

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.450
and the terms are there but
the enforcement is the issue.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.670
And in some cases it's not
enforcement it's just the lack

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:16.680
of having any leverage
in negotiating.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.980
And frequently when
a photographer goes

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.490
to a publisher be
it for textbook

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:27.270
or consumer publication, the
contracts that are handed --

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.970
they're told take
it or leave it.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:30.840
This is the contract.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.600
You don't like it, you don't
work, you can go somewhere else.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.050
And unless you happen to be one
of those very rare photographers

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.840
like an Annie Leibovitz or,
you know, one of the top

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.830
of the food chain,
you're out of luck.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.760
You don't have any leverage.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:54.490
It's move on and you either
accept those terms or not.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:14:00.920
So another example I had a
discussion with Yoko at lunch;

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.900
in Getty Images contracts they
generally call for a credit

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.390
that reads the photographer's
name, Getty Images.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:14.550
If you watch CNN or almost
any other television media

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:19.020
and you look for the credit
for images that appear,

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.830
it's almost always
simply Getty Images

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.230
without the photographer's name.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.080
And why that happens
I, you know,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.330
can be any number of reasons.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.910
It's either it's too
difficult for the station

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:36.620
or they can't follow it or it's
simply that Getty doesn't want

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.380
to enforce that portion
of the agreement.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.190
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
Thanks, Gene.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.310
Nancy, do you want
to jump in there?

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.210
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: All right.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:46.650
Well, great.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.870
I'm here today with my hat

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.130
for representing a
trade association,

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.510
Digital Media Licensing
Association

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.810
which is the trade association
of stock for the libraries

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:01.190
and we had Yoko Miyashita
here who is a leading member

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.130
so now I don't need
to explain what we do.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.310
That's very helpful.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.540
And it's good to follow
up with Gene, yes.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.070
There's lots of trade practices

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.090
and in print editorial you
generally always got the credit,

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.950
the photographer name
and then the source

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.310
because that's the payment
and that was fairly standard.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.290
You know, digital
revolution has made it

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:30.190
so there's more images being
used ever, yet unfortunately

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.290
as even Yoko mentioned
often many of them are just

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.990
because someone has
chosen to right click.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.430
And it's interesting because
I do a lot of education

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.810
and copyright education
as part of my role

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.890
and most people are amazed that
there really is no attribution

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.310
and yes, you know, obviously
if we're in the business

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.400
of licensing none of
these works are subject

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.860
to any kind of moral rights.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.170
So I -- but I think attribution
goes well beyond moral rights

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.870
and if you're going
to look at a world

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:04.470
where images can be licensed and
has a future with technology,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.670
it's going to be very important
that there is attribution

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:13.200
and it exists in the form
of a persistent identifier

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.410
that can live with
an image and that

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.390
that information can
be always attainable.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.950
Metadata, unfortunately,
is not robust.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.670
It gets stripped, half the
software purposely strips it

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.340
because the internet
wants to have small files

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.940
and that means a lot of
information gets lost.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.930
Orphan works is a bigger
problem with visual images

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.740
than anything else because
they're orphaned from birth.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.250
It isn't as if, you know,
that photo libraries

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.900
and photographers want the works
out there without information,

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.360
it's just that the way
they get published online

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.050
that seems to happen.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:53.060
The industry looked at this
and that for the last probably

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:58.090
since the orphan works act and
probably that was around 2006

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:03.630
or 2008 has started to
consider technology options

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.570
which would include image
registries, as Yoko mentioned,

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:09.630
there's already reverse
image search.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:14.430
But to really make that happen
there needs to be enforcement,

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.210
whether it's through what the
Copyright Office could possibly

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:21.460
do through CMI that that
information can stay

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.150
with the image and be there.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:28.050
And even I think if we're
looking at the other laws,

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.380
I think because image
licensing had been one to one

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:37.220
and perhaps maybe overwhelming
and seemed to be too difficult

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.820
to find ownership that
unfortunately laws

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.470
in other areas have broadened.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.380
For example it seems like fair
use particularly with, you know,

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.670
art attribution expanded
to make it easier

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.940
to use images versus
other works.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.990
And then if you look at
image search which a number

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.690
of years ago you'd do an image
search you'd get a little

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.710
thumbnail and it would
drive you to the source

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.330
so you could actually go
and have an image license.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.170
Now if you look at image search,

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:08.960
you get a beautiful
large display of an image

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.820
because the money

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.540
in the internet now is
keeping you sticky on a page.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.030
That's where the
advertisers are.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.590
So there's no incentive
to drive you back

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.740
to the original creator,
there's, you know,

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.840
you can see a small line that
says do you want to just look

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.570
at the image or do you
want to see the web site.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.200
Well you have the image,
that's all you need

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.600
so you're not driven
back to the web site.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.200
So I think if there was a way
to have persistent identifiers

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.330
that stuck and you can then
introduce licensing models

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.020
where it would be
easier to license

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.480
and maybe you wouldn't have
so much of the overexpansion

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.950
of fair use like in Google Books
because it's easier, you know,

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.080
not to get permission
and not to have some kind

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.520
of licensing mechanism and you
won't have technologies being

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.050
built for the narrow
takedown notices.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:53.380
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: Great.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:53.940
Thank you.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.650
Kate?

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:55.350
&gt;&gt; Katherine C. Spelman: My part

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.600
in the choir here is the
intersection of moral rights

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.210
and real estate,
physical property.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.630
I was a student of VARA,

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.440
I thought VARA was
something I understood,

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.930
I was also a regular volunteer

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.560
at California Lawyers
For the Arts.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:16.120
And if you can imagine on
a foggy February of 1993,

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.600
I alone arrived as
the lawyer volunteer

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.400
in a very abandoned
pier warehouse

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.820
where we welcomed anyone to come
and ask copyright questions.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.080
And you can imagine that
I was a little terrified

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.310
when the door opened

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.400
and in walked three giants
really looking pretty rough

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.060
with tattoos up their neck and
I had never seen that before,

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.980
and I thought the end is near.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.030
But indeed they walked over
and they held up magazines

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:46.870
and travel guides to tell
me that they were indignant

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:51.620
that their murals which they had
carefully painted on Balmy Alley

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.890
in San Francisco's Mission
District had been reproduced

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.410
without permission and
most of all without payment

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.820
to be cover articles and
to be indeed covers of some

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:06.040
of the most famous travel
magazines travel guides

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.690
for the city of San Francisco.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.780
And they were indignant
in the sense

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:14.820
that they didn't think it was
fair and I had the pleasure

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.360
of telling them that
indeed they were well

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.120
within something called the
Visual Artists Rights Act the

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.200
VARA and we then began
working together.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.740
I had Scott Turow
had the experience

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.510
of his publisher saying, oh
that doesn't apply to you.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.330
I had a very similar
experience in that

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:36.630
when I contacted the
relevant publishers in 1993,

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.900
their first answer was what?

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.250
What's VARA?

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.210
And their second answer was when
I showed them what it was I was

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.390
at issue, they said
that's not art.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:47.770
That's vandalism.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.620
That's not art that's graffiti.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.020
That's not art I don't have
to talk to you, good bye.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.600
And I had to explain
that the people

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.750
of Balmy Alley had
made their alley,

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.320
the walls of their alley -- and
many of you I'm sure have been

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.770
to Balmy Alley and seen how
fantastic these colorful vibrant

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.640
magnificent murals are --
that indeed there was consent

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.050
and the real estate people
were all in cahoots with this

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:18.140
and we pursued what was several
very very productive settlements

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.710
for the community that
had painted these,

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.750
painted these excuse me.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:29.250
Fast forward to 2013 and I get
a call from people in Detroit

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.130
who tell me they
have a mural issue

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.160
and by now I think I've pretty
much got the rhythm of murals.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.590
I think I've figured
out VARA and murals

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.600
and I've got this square dance
and I kind of know the do si do

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.860
and I think I'm doing all
right at which point we learn

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.820
that what happened -- the
facts are so spectacular I have

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.960
to share them with you.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.890
Dan Gilbert, a Cleveland fellow
who owns the Cleveland Cavaliers

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.910
and is also revitalizing
Detroit.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.650
He has, you may know, has
brought lots of street artists

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.360
to come to Detroit and in one
instance he brought six famous

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.580
street artists to come to
Detroit to paint for each

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.660
of the parking levels of the
new parking building he had.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.800
He brought fabulous street
artists including Banksy

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.970
to Detroit to take a floor
so you'd always remember

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.430
where you parked your car.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.320
Well, Banksy finished his
day of work for Dan Gilbert,

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.460
who is very generous as a
patron in commissioning this,

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.470
and they partied all night
and it ended up that he ended

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.920
up in Hamtramck, a little town
inside of the town of Detroit,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.520
and at the Packard, the old
Packard automotive plant

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.670
which as many of you know
has been abandoned --

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.120
literally abandoned
-- for 26 years.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.440
Abandoned to the point
that no one has paid taxes,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.050
no one has done anything,
it's just no man's land.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.500
And Banksy and his team
stenciled a giant of one

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.240
of his favorite stencils
on it and a gallery owner

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.050
in Detroit noticed this
happening sent an armed guard

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:58.760
down after Banksy and his team
was done about dawn they sent

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.870
down armed guards until a
16 wheeler could be arranged

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:06.950
to come down and they cut the
Banksy stencil out of the wall

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.710
of this building, put
it on the 16 wheeler

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:13.830
and then welded a frame around
it, enjoyed for a period of time

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.490
and then put it up for sale.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:19.520
The auction was going
forward, all was going well

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.140
until the owner of the
Packard plant thought,

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.340
hey that's my plant.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.490
You took my wall.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.910
And so they raised their hands

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.510
and said you can't do
that, that's our wall.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.930
And it will amuse you to know
that the judge in the city

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.280
and county of Detroit
said, yes it is your wall

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.360
and you haven't paid
any taxes for 26 years.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.550
[Laughter] If you would like
standing to bring this dispute

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.680
in Detroit you will need to
pay back taxes, penalties

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.030
and interest and that comes to X

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.870
which was almost three
quarters of a million dollars.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.360
And he quickly said, oh I
guess I don't have a problem.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.820
And the work then was sold at
auction by the gallery company

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.910
for about $325,000,
this big piece.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.580
And when Banksy was
contacted he was like,

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.330
yeah I had a good time.

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:10.170
I knew what I was
doing, okay by me.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.700
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
So, Kate, that --

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.300
&gt;&gt; Katherine C. Spelman: So my
intersection is that of an area

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.180
of law that you don't think of
colliding with VARA excuse me.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:17.640
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
Well, yeah, I know.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.930
So that this is a good way for
us to sort of close the book

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:22.000
on the VARA discussion
at least for our panel.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.300
And that is that VARA
tries to strike a balance

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.750
between property
rights and moral rights.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.070
So here we're really talking
about personality right,

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.730
property versus personality.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:35.190
But pretty quickly after VARA
was enacted we had the Helmsley-

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.630
Spear case which, of course,

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:39.380
the court says well these
weren't absolute rights

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.250
for for creators and
we have to assume

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.380
that traditional property
values have been left,

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.760
property right values
have been left in place.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.710
And I think of the Five Points
case something similar with this

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.200
in recent years, so I'm
wondering the balance

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.080
that VARA strikes between
property and personality rights

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.930
and who are the winners
with losers in that balance?

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.720
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: Well, I
would say it's pretty obvious

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:04.570
that real estate wins over
VARA in most situations.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.750
It just seems that no
matter what the courts seem

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.100
to favor property owners.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.530
I remember when I was a
baby lawyer and first going

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.390
to federal court
I loved this arch

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.370
down in New York
this magnificent arch

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.570
and no one else seemed
to like it but me.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:19.990
So it was taken down.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.850
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
Not recognized --

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:21.800
work of recognized stature.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.170
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: It wasn't
a work of recognized stature.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:28.630
It was fabulous but, yeah, it's
there's so many ways to wiggle

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.540
out of VARA and artists
can waive it so it seems

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.100
that property owners and
the value of their property

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.780
and if it's inconvenient to
have the art in the lobby

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.210
or in the front the
property owners win.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.360
&gt;&gt; Katherine C. Spelman: That's
assuming someone owns it.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.080
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: Yes.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.510
Other than Banksy.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.060
[ Laughter ]

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:49.730
&gt;&gt; Sonya Bonneau: I
just have a quick point

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:50.000
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
Absolutely.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.150
&gt;&gt; Sonya Bonneau: Which is
that it's not surprising

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:57.610
because American law is based on
property rights and so you have

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:00.320
that dissonance whereas
attribution

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.280
as is has been obvious
throughout the day is a powerful

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.450
social norm that most people
do believe is the right thing

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:09.280
to do.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.900
So just as a moving forward
thing I think attribution has a

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.230
lot more grounding
at least in our --

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.090
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
So good segue.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.590
Jane Ginsburg in
her keynote talked

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:24.330
about maybe attribution should
be in some of these cases sort

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:27.390
of part of the first
factor in fair use.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:31.240
And that courts are
looking at, you know,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.840
was the work attributed and so
we get to the issue of fair use

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.850
and attribution in
appropriation art.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:42.640
Should Richard Prince have
to credit Cariou somewhere

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.340
on that photograph
or photographs?

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.880
Can appropriation artists,
can they still do their art

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.440
and be expected to attribute
the source of the work?

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.310
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: You would
think that, at the least,

00:26:55.310 --> 00:27:00.050
when Richard Prince took
Jim Krantz's Marlboro Man --

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.560
one of these iconic
photographs --

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.570
and basically performed copy
work on it, enlarged it,

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.850
it was then part of a
significant exhibition

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.480
at the Whitney, used
on a poster,

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.480
I think to advertise
the show at the Whitney,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.380
sold for substantial
amounts of money,

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:30.310
and he makes no identification
at all of the underlying work?

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:35.040
Nothing? I mean not
a handshake, not a --

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.460
I've contacted Jim Krantz
because he was a member

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.220
of our association
and spoke with him.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:47.800
He unfortunately he did not
own the rights to the image

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.060
because he'd shot
for a tobacco company

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.240
who insisted on work for hire.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.010
So he didn't have the
rights to the work

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:00.340
and the tobacco company really
didn't care what Prince did

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.140
with it as long as they
spelled Marlboro correctly.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.770
So there was no issue there

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.750
so Prince couldn't
bring any action,

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.750
I mean Krantz couldn't
bring any action.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.170
But you would think there would
at least be some acknowledgment

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.660
of the underlying
work at the minimum.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.130
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
I mean that goes

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:22.980
to when Paul was
talking he talked

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.180
about how he didn't really see
how this would benefit authors

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.630
and I think that raises
a question about whether

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.220
or not the moral rights
would be transferrable.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.080
If they're transferrable,
I think you run

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.440
into maybe the same
sort of problem we had

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.030
with the reversion
rights before the '76 act.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:41.580
If they're not transferrable
maybe it looks more like the --

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.670
but they are waivable so you
don't get the termination value.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:49.650
But the question there the sort
of by what Gene was saying is

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:54.470
if the owner of the copyright
doesn't have the interest

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.830
in making sure the work is
attributed to who did it,

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.600
who can step in if
not the artist?

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.530
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Go ahead.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.510
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
You don't care

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:10.050
[ Laughter ]

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:11.640
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy: This
goes to the question

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.430
of whose interests are
served by the moral rights?

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.600
If they're freely waivable,

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.320
then all you're doing you're
not providing any real right

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.430
against the people whose
use is based on permission.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.020
You know traditional copyright
exploiting industries,

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.400
you're only getting rights
against downstream users

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.600
and so then the question is --
is the benefit that's secured

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.770
by creating the right worth the
imposition on the later users?

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:45.810
I think you need to -- you
have to make an argument

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.140
for why the benefit is needed.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.420
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: I
think Nancy has the argument.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.340
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy: What?

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.550
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: I'm thinking
you're putting it in a category

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.020
where there's again winners
and losers and us and them,

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.350
but I think the impetus

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.510
for moral right it's a personal
right that doesn't attach

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.960
to a personal work, but
it's a right of an artist

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.440
to always say, you
know, that's my work.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.360
It belongs to me.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.620
I mean I still remember
doing contracts

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.800
where an illustrator worked for
like a large animation company

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.290
and they were told they
weren't even allowed

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.790
to put the work in
their portfolio.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.810
And I said you know you have
a right to say you did that.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:22.450
But if there was a persistent
attribution, you wouldn't worry

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:26.070
about the downstream users
and that right of the artist

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:29.310
to always feel attached
to say I created it.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:32.320
That when you -- an artist
creates a piece of work --

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.580
and I tried Art Students
League so I know the difference

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.310
between what I can
do and my clients.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.300
It's a part of them.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.340
They are so attached.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.310
I mean I have clients it's
almost like they're children.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.760
I had one of the artists

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:49.270
from when Prince did the
Instagram one who contacted me

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.050
and his work was shown
on art galleries as well.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.540
So I think if we look at
benefit I think the benefit

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.860
to the artist is a benefit
to the public as well.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.110
It isn't that there's a
sharp divide that somehow

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.460
if you benefit an artist
you've hurt the public

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.710
because we're all artists.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:08.250
In this community of internet
we're users, we're creators,

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.500
we're a little bit of both,

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.980
and I think making
those bright lines,

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.270
we miss having a dialogue.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.700
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy: I think
that's great but you know

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.480
when you create a right that's
enforceable in the courts,

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.620
that means you have the
potential for litigation

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.580
against an individual who
doesn't have regular contact

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.240
with lawyers, for whom if
they have to spend $15,

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.410
$20,000 to defend themselves
for something they put

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:31.650
on their Facebook page,
they've already lost.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.470
So if you -- I come back to --

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.540
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: But most
artists have never gone

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.050
to court.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:37.980
They can't.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.680
The only one who goes
to court is Prince.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.580
He sells his work for
a million dollars.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.170
I mean, what the artists
are really looking

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.590
for now is the copyright
small claims court

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.130
where something could be
resolved for the actual value

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.660
of the license where it
wouldn't be so burdensome.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.120
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: The
right holders are primarily

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.340
disenfranchised right now.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.530
They can't bring $150,
$200,000 federal copyright case.

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:03.150
You know the average
photographer is just unable

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:03.560
to do that.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.050
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy: You're saying
the right holder or the creator?

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.680
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik:
Well for me most

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.570
of my photographer friends
are still the rights holder.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.250
And the creator.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.560
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: So if I
can turn the direction a little

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.950
to where contract law seems

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.990
to be doing more
work there are well,

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.960
there's at least two areas.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:29.280
One is and we can start with
well, there's the director

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.620
who can retain final
cut authority

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:35.030
because they have the bargaining
position or you have the editor

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.880
who gets credited because it's
part of the guild agreements.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.580
The question here isn't what
is the source of the right

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:46.280
but how important are
those rights as provided

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.610
for by contracts and
guild agreements?

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:51.600
How important are
they to authors?

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.030
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Well, I mean
I'll speak as creator and author

00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:00.590
and not as an advocate
that from my standpoint

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.290
and what we you heard
earlier from creators,

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:09.060
I think you know creators
do want to be recognized

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:12.440
for the fruits of their labor
and they want to see their name,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:19.560
you know, associated with their
good works and it's just part

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.130
of the creative process I think.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.300
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: I'll speak for
the film lawyers in my office

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.270
who I get to do all their fair
use reviews but I can tell you

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.390
that credit is significant and
I think as one of those terms

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.710
that gets it's importantly
negotiated and where it is

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.760
and the placement and
the size it matters

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.440
because that's your that's your
career that's your portfolio.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.480
You're going to make your next
movie based on the success

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:54.440
of the one before and again
having the acknowledgment

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.850
for the fruit of your labor
is I think a significant moral

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:01.980
attribute but also
financial ends up being.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:02.110
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Yeah.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:05.680
Let me just say, so I don't know
how many of you watch television

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.860
in December, you know at the
end of the year I always seem

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.840
to have the TV on
when the Today --

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.240
I think it's the Today Show --

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:16.990
they do this year in photos on
the morning and they show 10,

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:21.310
15 of what they say are
the most fabulous images

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.530
from the past year.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:27.770
Invariably those images
have no attribution.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.450
They don't tell you who
the photographer was

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.940
who took these fabulous images.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.990
And as my mother would say they
all sit there and kvell and this

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:38.750
and that and what a beautiful
photograph how great it is

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:42.010
and this and that but they don't
tell you who took the picture.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:43.800
I mean it's incredible.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.810
I mean how hard is that?

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:46.650
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
Well, what role then,

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:47.690
to add to that question,

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:51.160
does private ordering
play for these authors?

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.390
I mean do they look
at copyright law

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.410
and say copyright law doesn't
have an attribution right

00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:55.380
but I know I can
get it from contact

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.800
or do they just not even think
in terms of copyright law

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.260
when it comes to
attribution or placement

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.360
and they're really
thinking in terms of deals?

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.770
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: I think
it's bargaining power and yeah

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:11.250
if you're at a certain level
you can require attribution.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:14.530
I mean if we were just
talking about photography,

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:15.880
typically if it's something

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.930
in advertising it's never
been the norm and you're no,

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.450
you know -- even I think Annie
Leibovitz won't get credit

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:23.190
in an ad.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.930
She'll get it for the cover

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:30.090
of a Conde Nast magazine
but not for an ad.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.400
&gt;&gt; Katherine C. Spelman:
I would say it's an

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.030
enfranchisement tool.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:36.160
I would say that particularly
for those who work on murals

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.070
that they get it and
they really understand it

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.370
and it became a civics class now

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.150
in the Mission District
of San Francisco.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:46.660
It's actually in
their curriculum.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.260
These kids really care about it.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.090
This is, they think it's just,

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:52.530
so they're really
enfranchised because of it.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:53.540
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: So
that's really interesting

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:56.840
because in '96 this Office
did a study looking at VARA

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.350
and the first I think
five years of it and one

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:03.540
of the things I remember from
the study was that something

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:11.150
like half of or I think half
of visual artists didn't know

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.430
that your right could
be waived --

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:15.220
rights could be waived
and something like a third

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.500
or another half had
said that when they --

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.560
when they had blanched

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.360
at the waiver provision
it killed the whole deal.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.740
Has the climate then
changed for visual artists?

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:30.560
Do they feel like they have
more bargaining power to insist

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.850
on certain terms or is it
are we in the same place?

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:36.440
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: I'd say
they have less leverage now

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.670
than they've ever had
in the marketplace

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.340
because the publishers
are scrambling

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.900
for every dollar they can
get out of the proposition

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:50.350
and the rights package that
photographers have been asked

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:54.340
to sign is significantly
expanded now

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.950
because you're asked to
give rights not only --

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.740
I mean it used to be 20,
30 years ago, you know,

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:03.860
it was a North American, one
time, first publication prints.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:09.520
Now it's you know on any
platform now known or envisioned

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.160
or what's the term they use?

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:11.680
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
Later developed.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.500
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: Later created.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.570
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Later created,

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.370
you know it's all
forward thinking and --

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.240
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
Throughout the universe.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.100
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Right,
throughout the universe.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.750
And you've got -- it leaves you,

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.750
it leaves the creator
with nothing.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.330
It leaves you with
no ancillary rights.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.210
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
Kate, is the same true

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:28.520
for muralists and sculptors?

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:28.910
&gt;&gt; Katherine C. Spelman: No.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.510
What I'm seeing is
there's this break here

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:34.170
that seems pretty clear that
those people who are dealing

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:39.830
with photography which is
digital ab initio is it's a much

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:44.580
more volatile problematic area
than what people are doing

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.250
when they are as a community
group painting on walls

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.580
or as an individual
painting on walls

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.860
or perhaps in sculpture as well.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.240
But I'm seeing is schism and
I'm wondering what the other

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.340
speakers think about this.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.400
Nancy?

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.910
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: Well,
I think with sculpture

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:03.000
in fact I was helping a UK
lawyer look at a commission

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.650
for a large sculpture agreement
for a real property owner

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.450
in Philadelphia and I
was like so surprised.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.790
I didn't see any moral
rights clause or any waiver

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.800
because I think a
real estate lawyer did

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.370
that contract and had no idea.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:19.090
I could just tell
the way it's written.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:22.160
But I think if you're doing
something for a large museum,

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.870
they've read all the cases
that deal with moral rights

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:28.170
and they know how to write
contracts that, you know,

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.540
protects the interests if
something needs to be moved

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.160
or it's not finished or altered.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.990
&gt;&gt; Sonya Bonneau: MASS MoCA did
not have a contract with Buchel.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.570
That was -- that, the
judge was incredulous.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:40.220
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: Right.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.270
So I think they've
learned from the MASS MoCA

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.740
that museums need
contracts and they learned

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:49.170
that they should ask for waiver
and I think if you don't agree,

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.040
you might not get a commission.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.660
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: So it's
not just the type of artist

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.530
but also the type of contracting
party, where the schisms are.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:59.010
I think our last question that
I'll ask before we open it

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.560
up to the audience is
that we typically think

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.880
of these probably because
Berne requires attribution

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.730
and integrity rights but
there are other moral rights.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.870
And I think there's an analogue
maybe in the digital age

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.180
to the right of withdrawal,
which is something like a right

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.530
to opt out or a right
to insist on non-use.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.950
The direction though the
fair use doctrine has moved

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.240
and the Google Books
search denial

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.080
of cert today I think
really hammers this home

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.530
that this is a question
for authors is,

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.240
how do I opt out
of these systems?

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.310
Does that seem like that should
be part of a moral rights suite?

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.310
Is this something
authors are thinking of

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:38.920
or wish could think of?

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.350
&gt;&gt; Paul Allen Levy: A
right to be forgotten.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:41.790
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
I don't want to use

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.310
that term because it's not.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.100
It's not, right?

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.660
This isn't like fully removing
your work from the marketplace

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:51.850
but it's a right to say I
don't want to be part of that

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.140
that new distribution system.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.820
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Well, I mean
the problem as Yoko pointed out,

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.610
you know, a company
like Getty is able

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:03.450
to put certain limitations
on works

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.780
and the most common ones have
to do with liquor and smoking.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:13.140
But beyond that, you know,
once once the work is out there

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.250
and the identifying
information is no longer

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:20.040
with it, you have no control.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.870
And that's when I've
listened to people talk

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.960
about contracts all day but
yeah contracts are great

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.200
but it ultimately it means
you've got to be able

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.050
to control the distribution
of the work.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:32.810
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: And
that's a clear threshold problem

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:33.880
but assume that wasn't an issue.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.860
Just assume in a
utopian universe

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.750
that you could you always
knew where your work ended up

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.730
and you knew if somebody
was using it.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:42.660
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Go ahead.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:42.810
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Yeah.

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:47.100
Well, one thing I see one
sort of bump in the road

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.550
which is I think once
something is considered

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:52.700
or would be considered
a fair use,

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.750
then it's considered
an authorized use

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:58.720
and I don't know there
there might be a conflict

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.050
between the right to have
a work removed particularly

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:06.470
if someone has added a lot
of substantial creativity

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.630
to it, to the new work.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:13.720
I think that might be difficult
if it was the work unaltered,

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.750
you know, it's always
going to be cash somewhere.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.050
I think in that way you
can compare it a little bit

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.060
to the right to be forgotten.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:23.770
In Europe where the original
article will never disappear

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.690
but the links to it go down.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:30.080
I think it's very hard
to wipe clean the web.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.310
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy: It's
awfully hard to think

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:34.320
of enforcing anything like
the right to be forgotten

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.980
in a country that has
a first amendment.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.130
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: Uh huh.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.790
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy: And I
think that's the problem

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:41.390
with the right to be withdrawn

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.640
to the extent that
it's a fair use.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.790
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: Yeah.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.190
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy: Or maybe you
don't have a fair use provision

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.140
but then you're just going

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.390
to be litigating the
first amendment issues

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:54.830
when you're asking a court to
order the removal of something.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:55.880
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: Yeah.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.940
I guess we have time for
one last follow up to that.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.850
So Paul just to follow up on
your first amendment discussion,

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.860
some of the a lot of the
patchwork comes from outside

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.600
of copyright law where the fair
use doctrine doesn't necessarily

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.070
or doesn't apply.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:13.300
What role there does
the first amendment do?

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.530
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy:
Well, you're --

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.870
certainly in the right
of publicity area you end

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:22.080
up applying the right of fair
use by analogy and to the extent

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.530
that you don't have the right
of fair use or even backing

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:27.890
up what there is, the first
amendment has very broad

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.120
application in right

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.370
of publicity cases certainly
outside the purely commercial

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:35.860
exploitation situations.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.200
But there is a first
amendment right to engage

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.110
in commercial speech and
then there's the distinction

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:44.350
between having it in an
advertisement or having it

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.650
in a product that's sold, and
yet then you have protection

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:50.250
for what's considered to
be noncommercial speech

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:53.740
in a commercially sold
work like the advertisement

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.890
in the New York Times for which
the New York Times was held

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.180
not liable.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:01.640
In New York Times v.
Sullivan, this was treated

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.240
as noncommercial speech
even though it was ad,

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.130
so the first amendment
has ample role to play

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:09.600
in these sorts of situations.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.710
&gt;&gt; Sonya Bonneau: Although I
think that's why Michael Jordan

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:15.550
was successful and he had
several lawsuits and it --

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:18.450
because commercial speech
gets less protection

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:20.080
under the first amendment.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.150
That's a big question of is
it commercial speech or not

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:28.470
and if courts get into
this classification system

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:32.150
where they have to say
what a given work is.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:34.250
Is it art, is it advertising?

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:35.060
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy: Right.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:35.380
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: Great.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.840
Well I think now we're going
to open it up to the floor

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.950
so if you have questions
just give me a little hand

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:53.940
and I can tell Donald or
someone else to bring you a mic.

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.040
Yeah, Michael Wolfe

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Wolfe: Thanks
very much for that.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:58.580
I greatly enjoyed the panel.

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.210
I'm going to preface this by
saying that my organization,

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:03.800
Authors Alliance, is in many
ways is also sympathetic

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.280
to copyleft ideas, but
we also endorse the idea

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.890
of an attribution right.

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:13.430
But all the same I do find
Paul's earlier point an

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:15.820
important one and I think
Danielle made the point before

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:20.170
him regarding the real source of
attribution controversies being

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:24.400
from downstream licensed
uses, so I wanted to sharpen

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.070
that a little bit
for the panel and see

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:29.350
if we can't all address
it and find

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:32.050
out whether there's
something else there.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:39.640
But is there -- assuming a
waivable right, is there,

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.460
is there a practical
value for authors

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.900
from a waivable attribution
right

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.750
if it's only downstream licensed
uses that is the problem?

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:50.160
And if it's not and
if there's more

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.330
than downstream licensed
uses that are the problem,

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:53.900
let's say Richard
Prince for example,

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.880
although I think he is the
exception rather than the rule,

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.360
where will there
been an instance

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:03.660
of an attribution controversy
that is not also an infringement

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:10.140
of the rights of copyright and
remediable from that avenue?

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.020
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
Any takers?

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.800
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy:
I mean certainly

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:21.360
to the extent particularly when
you're dealing outside the range

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:27.640
of form contracts with a
huge commercial enterprises

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.640
with which a creator is
dealing, a writings requirement

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.890
and an explicit writings
requirement

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:37.620
at least provides a point
of discussion and sort

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:41.450
of conscious giving
up or conscious taking

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:46.990
and I think requirements of
clear and unmistakable waiver,

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:50.490
for example, play a large
role in many areas of law

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.530
and I think they're valuable.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.740
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Just
one brief comment.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:01.920
What you commented on
the difference between

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:08.300
or the ability to remedy through
if something were a copyright

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.950
infringement that you
could in fact bring a case.

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:13.960
And I go back to my
earlier comment that by

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.020
and large that's not a remedy.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:20.540
At least not a remedy for
a photographer who makes 30

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.300
to $50,000 a year who most
probably didn't register his

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:30.650
work to begin with, there's no
remedy for those myriad of uses

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:32.830
that are being made of his work.

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:33.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Wolfe:
That's a fair point

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.990
from a procedural stand point

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:37.490
but would this would the
moral right be more accessible

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.510
to the author in that instance?

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:43.840
I suppose there will
be follow-up.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.450
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: Well, I
guess it depends what you mean

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.170
by accessible.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:49.820
If an individual
author has to try

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.110
to locate all these
downstream users,

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.270
most of the problem is it's
the impossibility of it.

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:56.570
They could be anywhere
in the world.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:57.730
How do you go after them?

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:00.000
I think that's been
a lot of the problem

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.530
with anything that goes viral.

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:05.230
I mean if you, you
know, take something

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:06.930
so you've made another
copy rather

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:09.620
than do what Getty Images
does and allow you to embed

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:14.470
where you go back to the
source, it's really, you know,

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:17.200
an impossibility to whether
it's under moral rights

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.690
or copyright infringement
really to enforce most

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:21.300
of those downstream uses.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.090
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: And
I'll just say about if

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:28.810
in fact the moral right is
waivable, I would venture

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:32.640
to guess that when it
comes down to a negotiation

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.550
with a photographer who's faced

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:37.080
with what I call
the 30 day horizon

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:41.130
which is the next billing cycle
and he's got to pay his bills

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:43.530
and worried about rent
and everything else,

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:47.340
he's going to give
up that right.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.570
No question.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:52.630
&gt;&gt; Sonya Bonneau: But if the law
gets too complicated then it can

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.610
have the chilling
effect on for lack

00:47:55.610 --> 00:48:00.100
of a better word amateur users
who are using the web just

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.010
like the big commercial players.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.180
And so we have to think

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:09.550
about how accessible the
legislation would be to use.

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:12.380
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Yeah, we're
not chasing the amateurs.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.660
&gt;&gt; Jane Ginsburg: If
it's not inappropriate,

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.360
I'd like to venture an
answer to the question,

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.200
which is one big difference is
between an infringement action

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.610
and a moral rights action is

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:26.940
if the authors doesn't have
the economic rights any more,

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.950
the author doesn't have
an infringement action

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:31.910
but the author could is still
have a moral rights action.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:33.040
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: Good point.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:33.340
&gt;&gt; Jane Ginsburg: And I'd

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:37.380
like to make another suggestion
regarding downstream uses

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.790
which may require
legislation but I have to think

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:43.240
about if you could do it
without legislation which is,

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.450
as Nancy says, nobody wants
to go after downstream users.

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:48.220
But what about the platforms?

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:54.370
Could there been a 512 type
claim based on attribution?

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:59.050
So in other words if there's
no attribution on the content

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:03.080
that has been placed
on the platform,

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.560
that would be the basis
to either have it taken

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.560
down or attribution added.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:13.450
So that might be a way
of rendering enforceable

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.740
and attribution right
which is distinct

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.960
from the economic right.

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.140
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: And if there
were persistent identifiers

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:25.130
that readily identified
the owner of a work,

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:31.920
then maybe the issue of all this
red flag knowledge would raise

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:32.670
its head again.

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.330
I mean if you knew what
was getting uploaded

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:37.890
on your platform was
not by the same name

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:39.810
as who was uploading it --

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.130
&gt;&gt; Jane Ginsburg: It
would be interesting to --

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:41.660
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: Interesting.

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:45.880
&gt;&gt; Jane Ginsburg: To construct
all of this, also I'll point

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.820
out however that the,
at least under CMI,

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.140
it's the rightsholder.

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.790
And again the rightsholder is
not necessarily the author,

00:49:55.790 --> 00:50:00.240
so you would have to have a
basis for the author to protect

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.290
that robust information.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:03.810
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: The
plus system does that.

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:05.480
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: Yeah,
the plus system is trying

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.330
to do that right now.

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:08.420
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: It recognizes
both the rights holder

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:12.250
and the creator and
licensors, licensees.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:12.740
&gt;&gt; Jane Ginsburg: Right.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:13.990
But I mean in addition

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:17.170
to the technical
basis, the legal basis.

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:17.870
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Right.

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:18.630
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
Mickey, you've got the mic?

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:19.260
&gt;&gt; Mickey Osterriecher: Yeah.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.820
Just we've been talking
about attribution rights

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:25.090
versus economic rights but
what we're seeing especially

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:27.910
with photography is
people see your name

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:31.190
and then they contact you and
say well, we don't have a budget

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:33.100
but we'll give you a credit.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.630
Do want to talk about that
kind of reverse problem?

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:40.470
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik: Yeah, that's,
you know, the attribution

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:45.410
on the one level
helps build the brand

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:49.430
and so it you know helps the
photographer become identified.

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:55.040
At the same time it certainly
doesn't pay the bills directly

00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:03.150
and there are as Mickey points
out, numerous cases I had --

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:06.610
I mean many years
ago I did photographs

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:10.250
of the lighted Ben Franklin
bridge in Philadelphia

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:13.580
and the architect calls me
up and he had the opportunity

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:17.010
to license these images
to use for his purposes

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.920
and when he found, you know,
I give him the fees for it

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.350
and he didn't want to pay.

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:24.320
He didn't want to do anything.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.500
Well, then two years
later I get a call

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:31.020
from AIA they're giving this
man some life achievement award

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.460
and they want to use
my photographs as part

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.790
of the presentation
thanking him.

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:37.970
And so I said you know
he had the opportunity

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.760
to license these images
and he turned it down.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.930
I said what do you
have in your budget

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:46.630
to use this image in
your presentation?

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:48.710
And they said well we
don't have any money

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:50.980
but we'll give you a credit.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:54.370
And I said to them look I have
to tell you I make my money

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:58.240
through licensing images and
through creating photography

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.790
and quite frankly I'm not an
architectural photographer.

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:05.020
I did these images of the bridge
just because it was something

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.400
that I happened to like,
so I did them on spec

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.380
and then sold them
to a magazine,

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:15.530
and I said that that
credit has no value to me.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:19.750
I said I'm sorry we can't
eat the portfolio piece.

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:22.350
It doesn't work.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:23.550
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
We've got time

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:25.680
for one more question I think.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.560
Yeah. Yeah.

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:36.270
&gt;&gt; I just wondered, given how
the CMI information is stripped

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:40.090
from images, do we really want
to put an affirmative duty

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:43.720
on fair users to be able
to have, to then find

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:48.390
out who the author is in order
to give them attribution?

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:53.960
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy: Certainly
from a litigation standpoint,

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:58.240
as somebody who represents
individuals I would worry

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.280
about that.

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.140
Also wondering what are the
remedies for having failed to do

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.670
that -- if it's simply
injunctive that's one thing.

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:11.010
If it's damages and attorney
fees it's very different,

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:13.730
and yet if you don't have the
monetary remedies what's the

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:16.310
disincentive to do it?

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:17.250
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: You know
if I could ask to follow-up

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:22.210
to just sharpen that question,
what though is the real harm

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:25.640
to a user and if they're going
to use somebody else's photo

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:29.060
or someone else's music
or someone else's whatever

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.380
that they either use something

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.020
that they know they can
identify the author and credit

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:35.850
that author or they
don't use the work.

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.620
Like I guess I don't --

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.950
&gt;&gt; Paul Alan Levy: So I'm
putting up a photograph

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:43.890
on my Facebook of course
Facebook requires me to sort

00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:47.360
of verify that I've
got the authority,

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.900
but I think for the small
user knowing actually how

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.590
to stick that stuff in --

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:52.880
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: Sure.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.490
Well so we -- but that can
be the reasonableness a

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:57.460
requirement, right?

00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:00.080
Similar to with broadcast
where it's not reasonable

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:04.870
to include the attribution
maybe there it's, you know,

00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:08.110
for the user who it couldn't
make sense or there's nowhere

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:09.270
to put it or what not.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:11.720
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: There is a
free web site called TinEye

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.600
and you can put the
URL with an image in

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.300
and it will find
you all the matches.

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.020
You may not get the one
that actually is the owner,

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.250
but it is really
fast and really easy.

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:23.400
So I think this question now
it might not be reasonable

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.940
but I can see a future where
this could be much easier.

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:28.060
&gt;&gt; Sonya Bonneau: There
would also be a question

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:32.830
of how the secondary user
used it and how much of it,

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:36.450
all the questions that come up
in fair use might complicate,

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:39.310
well when is the right
of attribution triggered?

00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:41.820
Is it with Blanch v.
Koons, like how much

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:45.270
of that photograph
you know can and so

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:47.840
when can you demand
an attribution right?

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:51.000
Could be complicated with remix.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:51.720
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg: Sure.

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.370
&gt;&gt; Nancy E. Wolf: Creative
Commons has an attribution right

00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:57.940
on almost all their licenses
which are noneconomic.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:58.720
&gt;&gt; Brad A. Greenberg:
The default used

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.470
to be no rights reserved but
they found that, I don't know,

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:06.970
97 percent of people opted
for the credit created by.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.650
Yeah, so I guess on that note
I think we have a ten-minute

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:10.340
break now.

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.430
If I'm wrong on that
someone correct me.

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:14.490
But 15 minute break
and then we're back

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:17.460
in here I guess at 3:30.

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:21.100

of the Library of Congress.
