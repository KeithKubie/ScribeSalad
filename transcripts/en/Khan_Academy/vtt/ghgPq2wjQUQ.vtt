00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.247
What I thought I
would attempt to do

00:00:02.247 --> 00:00:04.080
in this and the next
few videos is just give

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.720
a scaffold of American history.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.181
I'm clearly going to glaze
over a lot of the details,

00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:10.680
but hopefully it'll
give you a sense

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.490
of how everything at
least fits together,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.849
at least the major events
in American history.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.015
So you can kind of, and
when I say American history,

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:18.960
I'm talking about
United States history.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.610
And so the first real
successful settlement

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.220
in what's now the United
States was at Jamestown.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.210
That's Jamestown,
Virginia right over here.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.380
And it was 1607.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.380
It was set up as kind of
a commercial settlement

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.619
and then shortly after
that, and we always

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.060
learned this in school, you know
the pilgrims on the Mayflower,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.190
sailing the oceans
blue and all the rest.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.414
They were kind of the next major
settlement in the New World.

00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:45.830
Or I guess we should say the
next major successful English

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.300
settlement.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.966
There were obviously the Spanish
and the Portuguese were already

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.240
settling the New World
with a good bit of success

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.940
at this point, but we're talking
about the English settlements.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.420
And so the pilgrims
settled what's

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.390
now Plymouth,
Massachusetts in 1620.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.340
And obviously from 1620
until the mid-1700s,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.640
you just had a huge influx of
people migrating and cities

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.560
developing.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.072
But I'm going to fast forward
all the way to the mid-1700s.

00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:15.780
So this is actually
a huge amount of time

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.110
that I'm just not
providing any details over.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.620
Because I'm really just quite
focused on the major events

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.910
in American history.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.560
And so this is a 130-year
period where things were just

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.430
getting built out more, they
were getting more developed.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.320
And I'm going to fast
forward to 1754, because

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.390
at this period you
had essentially

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.870
the entire east coast
of what's now the US.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.654
These were the 13
colonies of the-- well,

00:01:39.654 --> 00:01:41.070
they're not the
United States yet,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.790
they're the 13 British colonies.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.350
But these are
English settlements,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.580
and then if you go a little bit
to the northwest from there,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.790
you have all the
French settlements.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.120
And obviously still in these
parts of Quebec and Canada,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.170
people speak French.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.830
But you had the
French settlements

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.579
up in this area over here.

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.120
I'm not going to go
into the details.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.244
Each of these can be a
whole series of videos,

00:02:03.244 --> 00:02:04.660
and hopefully in
the future I will

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.500
make them whole
series of videos.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.740
But you fast forward
to 1754, and you

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.900
start having the French
and the British start

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.670
getting into squabbles
over territory

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.460
where Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania is right now.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.020
In 1754.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.970
And that starts the
French and Indian War.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.037
And I want to be very clear
here because this is maybe

00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:28.620
one of the biggest
points of confusion

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.130
when people first
learn American history.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.590
Since it's called the
French and Indian War,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.750
they think it's between
the French and the Indians.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.540
But it's not.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.570
It was the French
and the Indians

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.250
against the British
and the colonists.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.170
So in this war, the
British and the colonists

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.229
were on the same side against
the French and the Indians.

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:49.770
And obviously there
were some Indians

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.250
that were also on the
side of the British,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.860
but it's called the French
and Indian War because these

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.110
were the people that the
British were fighting against.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.907
Now if anyone outside
of the United States

00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:04.490
talks about the
French and Indian War,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.550
they will not call it the
French and Indian War.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.950
They'll really just call
that the American theater

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.430
of the Seven Years' War
because it eventually

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.290
evolves into a much bigger
conflict between Great Britain

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.084
and France that's
going on in Europe,

00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:17.750
and the French and
Indian War was really

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.100
just the American theater of it.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.945
So between-- the
French and Indian

00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:26.049
War starts in 1754 based on
these disputes over Pittsburgh.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.340
But that wasn't the only thing.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.280
You had all of these
other things, all

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.690
of these other tensions
that were developing.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.820
The thing that starts the
war is never the only factor.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.960
It's always just
the tipping point.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.240
But that leads to a
bigger war in Europe.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.830
And that's the Seven Years'
War that starts in 1756.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.720
And they both end because
they're really the same war.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.590
They both end in 1763
with the Treaty of Paris.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.800
Treaty of Paris, 1763.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.620
And the big takeaway of that is
that really most of what France

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.510
had in the New World
now becomes essentially

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.630
a part of the
British Empire, now

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.170
becomes British colonies
or British territories.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.481
And even Louisiana goes
over to Spain at this point.

00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:14.980
And we'll see it
goes back to France

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.160
for a little bit
in 1800, and then

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.910
it goes back to the
United States in 1803,

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.720
but we'll see that in a second.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.560
So 1763, the British-- it
was this huge costly war--

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.896
but they were able to win.

00:04:26.896 --> 00:04:29.020
And at least from the point
of view of the British,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.590
they felt that the main
beneficiaries of this war

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.870
were the Americans.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.940
They were able to get all
this new territory, all

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.070
this new area that they
can now trade with,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.600
or they could now
potentially settle.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.700
And so the British
decide to start

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.220
taxing the Americans
to recoup some portion

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.500
of the cost of the war.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.500
So in 1765 they
pass the Stamp Act.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.160
And this wasn't a tax on stamps.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.040
What this was is
that they essentially

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.390
declared that a
whole set of paper

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.240
that had to be used
in the New World.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.740
So the stuff for
legal documents,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.400
stuff that maybe even newspaper.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.650
That that paper would have to
be produced in Great Britain,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.040
and it had to have a
special stamp on it in order

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.460
for the contracts or
whatever was on top of it,

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.380
in order for them
to be legitimate.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.000
So essentially it was a huge
tax on paper and on documents.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.910
And essentially, this is
what societies ran on.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.580
So it was just a way to extract
money from the colonists

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.000
in order to, I guess, help
pay back some of the costs

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.340
that the empire felt
that they had incurred

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.650
on behalf of the colonists.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.410
You could debate whether who
was the main beneficiary, but

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.154
regardless you could
imagine this didn't make--

00:05:44.154 --> 00:05:46.570
this whole period over here--
the colonists weren't happy.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.160
Especially because
they didn't have

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.030
any representation
in Parliament.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.127
This was done without
anybody from the colony

00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:54.960
saying, hey, wait I
don't think that's fair.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.890
Or this is fair or whatever.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.280
And so you fast forward.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.710
1773, you have the
Boston Tea Party

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.090
where you have a bunch of
people who, for whatever reason,

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.900
and there's multiple
interests here.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.830
But there was three ships
in Boston Harbor full of tea

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.450
and the tea was owned by
the East India Tea company.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.660
And they decide, in
protest, and there

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.982
was a whole series of
acts and other taxes

00:06:19.982 --> 00:06:21.940
that went back and forth,
but once again, we're

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.980
not going to go into
the details here.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.020
But in revolt they
dumped the tea.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.840
They dressed up as Indians,
as American Indians,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.930
and they dumped the
tea into Boston Harbor,

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.144
and then you could
imagine well that was

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.060
kind of a very exciting
act for the colonists,

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.497
but it didn't make the
British very happy.

00:06:38.497 --> 00:06:40.580
And then after that, they
passed the Coercive Act.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.980
They essentially did
a blockade of Boston.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.680
So things started to
get really, really,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.270
really tense in the early 1770s.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.730
And then you fast
forward to 1775,

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.084
you have essentially the first
conflicts of the American

00:06:54.084 --> 00:06:55.500
Revolutionary War,
and we're going

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.520
to do a whole series
of videos on really

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.160
the whole Revolutionary War.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.380
1776, you have the
Declaration of Independence.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.320
This is them right here
drafting the Declaration

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.120
of Independence.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.530
And that's really just
saying, hey, we've

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.400
had enough of you Great Britain!

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.540
We are now declaring ourselves
as an independent country.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.860
No more of this
colonies business.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.920
And so all the
way until 1783 you

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.880
have the American
Revolutionary War.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.090
And once again, you can do
a lot of videos on this,

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.690
but I'm just going
to go over it just

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.700
so you have a sense of
when everything happened

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.783
and when everything ended.

00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:33.790
And we can later dig
deeper into the scaffold.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.010
And it ends with
the Treaty of Paris.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:41.500
The US becomes a free
independent state.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.750
And then you fast forward.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.490
Until this point,
the US has been

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.400
governed by Congress, and the
Articles of Confederation.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.290
But the Constitution
that we have now,

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.482
it was drafted in 1787.

00:07:52.482 --> 00:07:54.940
It was ratified-- it had to
get at least nine of the states

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.130
to ratify it-- that
happened in 1788.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.960
And then it went
into effect in 1789.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.630
So it depends what you consider
the birth of the country.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.590
Well, it would definitely be
the Declaration of Independence,

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.290
but the country in
its current form,

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.020
with its current institutions,
with this current constitution,

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.130
started in 1789.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.620
And that was also the
beginning of Washington's first

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:21.240
of two terms as president,
and those ended in 1797.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.510
And then John Adams
comes into the picture.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.320
And the reason why I
put this-- obviously

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.130
this is actually the only
president that I showed--

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.713
is that it was
actually very important

00:08:28.713 --> 00:08:31.590
that he decided to step
down after two terms.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.210
He was hugely popular.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.614
If he wanted to,
he probably could

00:08:35.614 --> 00:08:37.280
have become one of
these characters that

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.850
stick around maybe
a little bit longer

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.600
than some people would want.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.376
So it was really good that he
set this example of stepping

00:08:44.376 --> 00:08:45.750
down after two
terms, and that he

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.480
wasn't this kind of
power hungry dude.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.300
You fast forward
a little bit more.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:55.144
1803, I mentioned that after
the French and Indian War what's

00:08:55.144 --> 00:08:57.310
Louisiana-- I want to be
clear when I say Louisiana.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.220
Louisiana isn't just what's
the current state of Louisiana.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.720
It's this whole
region that includes

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.530
the state of Louisiana,
but all the way up

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.850
to roughly what
the United States'

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.490
current border with Canada.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.060
And after the French
and Indian War,

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.850
all of this business
over here went to Spain.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.070
And then in 1800, it
went back to France.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.080
But then in 1803, Napoleon
had a bunch of stuff

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.600
that he-- his Naval
fleet was destroyed,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.330
he had a suffered some
defeats in the West Indies,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.250
I guess we could call it.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.444
In particular in
Haiti, and he said,

00:09:35.444 --> 00:09:36.860
well, you know I
probably won't be

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.530
able to control this
territory anyway,

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.500
so he sold it to
the United States

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.240
for what turned out to be a
very, very, very cheap price.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.625
But it was kind
of like, it's not

00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:47.250
like he could have
protected it anyway.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:47.860
The United States
might have been

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.980
able to take it from him without
him being able to do anything.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.010
So he might as well
get some money for it

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.630
so that he could fund
his battles in Europe.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.340
So in 1803, the United States
almost doubled in size.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.960
It went from these
territories that it

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:09.230
had after the American
Revolution for Independence,

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:14.070
and now it got all of this
region over here in 1803.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.750
Then you fast forward a bit.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.840
And the War of 1812,
it's an interesting one,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.040
because there weren't any
really serious outcomes from it.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.920
But what was interesting about
it, this whole time period,

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.250
even after independence,
the British

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.820
continued to harass America.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:37.980
They continued to arm Native
Americans who would maybe

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.590
revolt or cause
trouble for settlers.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.495
They would impress
American seamen--

00:10:42.495 --> 00:10:43.870
and when I say
impress, it didn't

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.703
mean that they were
doing something special.

00:10:45.703 --> 00:10:47.390
It meant that they
were-- impressment

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.560
of seamen meant that they
were taking over these boats,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.390
taking the sailors,
and forcing them

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.440
to become part of
the British military.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.966
So they were doing
a whole series

00:10:57.966 --> 00:11:00.340
of things that was really kind
of antagonizing the United

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.050
States.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.550
In 1812, the United States
declares war on Great Britain.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.240
You have the War of 1812.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.850
It ends in 1815 with the
Battle of New Orleans.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.935
But there wasn't
any real transfer

00:11:14.935 --> 00:11:17.660
of a territory or anything
like that over here.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.470
What was good, some people call
it the Second War for American

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:25.217
Independence, is it really
asserted that America was here

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:27.550
to stay, or I should say that
the United States was here

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.580
to stay.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.270
That the Revolution wasn't
just some fluke that isn't some

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.450
just fly by night country.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.530
It was able to defeat one of the
greatest empires in the world

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.320
again.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.080
So it's kind of here to stay.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.150
Now you fast forward
a little bit more.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.500
This part of what
we would call Texas,

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.120
this area right over here.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.170
It was, before 1836,
it was part of Mexico.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:56.020
But the Mexicans
actually encouraged

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.420
English-speaking
settlers-- these

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.240
would be American
English-speaking settlers

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.540
into the area-- just because
it was very sparsely settled.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.810
But these English-speaking
settlers, a lot of them

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.870
were slave owners, and then
as we kind of go up to 1836,

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.690
the state of Mexico that
this was all governed by,

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.020
they were thinking about
abolishing slavery.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.660
So you can imagine that
the settlers there, they

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.805
didn't like this idea.

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:23.870
So in 1836, you had the
War for Texas Independence,

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.600
and that's where you remember
the Alamo, and all of that.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.470
And then the first president
of Texas is Sam Houston.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.990
That's why Houston
is named Houston.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.350
And then you fast forward
all the way to 1845.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.513
And in this time period,
you have this whole talk

00:12:38.513 --> 00:12:41.350
in the United States
of Manifest Destiny,

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.710
that it's part of our
God-given destiny as Americans,

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:50.310
to one day extend our territory
all the way to the Pacific

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.810
Ocean.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.150
So people were already eyeing
a lot of the territory.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.760
Remember all of this
territory, this was Texas.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.420
And Mexico still viewed
it as their territory,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.379
even though it was being
governed independently

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:02.836
by the people who
called themselves

00:13:02.836 --> 00:13:03.990
the Republic of Texas.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.040
And you had all
of this territory

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.657
that was Mexican territory.

00:13:07.657 --> 00:13:09.490
So people were starting
to eye this and say,

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.550
wouldn't it be nice to
get a little bit of that?

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.200
So in 1845, and this
was in agreement

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.830
with the settlers in Texas,
with the Republic of Texas,

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.242
the United States annexed Texas.

00:13:21.242 --> 00:13:22.950
The settlers there
wanted this to happen,

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.490
so wasn't a forced
annexation of Texas.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.570
But Mexico was not
so happy about this

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.360
because Mexico
still viewed Texas

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.740
as part of their territory.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.040
And America, to some degree,
depends on how you view it,

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.370
it seems like they kind of
wanted to goad Mexico into war,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:44.000
so they sent military really
close to the border of Mexico,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.240
even into some territory where
Mexico might have had better

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.780
claims to it or-- I'm not
going to take sides on this,

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.010
but it seemed like there was
some instigation going on.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.520
And there's some debate about
the actual course of events.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.240
But in 1846 you have war
actually breaking out

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.540
between Mexico and
the United States.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.030
And by 1848, the United States
essentially trounces Mexico,

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.670
and most of the war actually
does go on on Mexican land.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:16.270
And because of that, Mexico
cedes over all of this area.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.270
So, California and all of
the rest of Nevada, Arizona,

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.770
what the part of New Mexico
the didn't come along,

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.300
that the United States
didn't already have.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.150
And along that same
amount of time,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.700
you both had the British
and the Americans that

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.510
were eyeing this territory,
the Oregon Territory up here

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.220
and it even included
part of Canada.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.000
And eventually they were
able to resolve it relatively

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.791
peacefully, and
what they agreed is,

00:14:40.791 --> 00:14:43.040
is that the Americans would
get all of this territory.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.920
And the British would
get everything north

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.520
of this line right over here.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.210
And that's why Vancouver
and British Columbia and all

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.340
of that, is Canada now.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:56.370
It stayed as part of the British
Empire for a little bit longer.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.130
So by 1848, the Manifest Destiny
essentially had happened.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:02.840
The United States had gotten
everything from California

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.820
all the way from the Pacific
coast to the Atlantic coast.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:12.270
And clearly I'm really just
covering the high levels,

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:16.250
30,000 level foot view
of American history here.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.530
This whole time you had
this tension developing.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.930
From the birth of the country
through the election of Abraham

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.030
Lincoln, you have this
tension over slavery.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.280
A lot of people in the
North didn't like it

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.910
on moral grounds.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.820
A lot of people in the
South didn't like it-- well,

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.750
they wanted slavery
regardless of what

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.080
they thought of it morally--
the South's economy,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.830
to a large degree,
was based on slavery.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.352
And so all of this, the
tipping point happened in 1860.

00:15:44.352 --> 00:15:49.920
Where Abraham Lincoln, who was
pretty vocal about the fact

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.460
that he did not like
slavery, that he wanted

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.770
to curb the spread
of slave states.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.470
And up to this point, you
had all of these compromises

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.260
every time a state
came into the Union.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.535
The slave states wanted it
to be another slave state.

00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:03.660
The free states wanted it
to be another free state.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.530
So you always had
this people kind

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.510
of jocking for whoever
could have the most

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.800
states on their
side of the camp.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.690
But all of this pro-slavery
and anti-slavery

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.400
hit a tipping point in 1860
when Abraham Lincoln, who

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.030
was fairly vocal about
not extending slavery,

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.360
he was elected.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.050
Then a bunch of what we now
consider southern states

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.890
seceded from the Union.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:32.287
And then in 1861
in South Carolina.

00:16:32.287 --> 00:16:34.870
South Carolina said, hey, we are
not part of the United States

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.610
anymore, but there was still a
United States military garrison

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.070
there, so they attacked it.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.990
That started the Civil War.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.140
And so during the Civil War--
it lasts until 1865-- Abraham

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.570
Lincoln makes the
Emancipation Proclamation

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.430
in 1863, which
essentially proclaims

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.900
all the slaves should be free.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.160
This lays the groundwork
for the 13th Amendment

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.620
to the Constitution.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.690
And then unfortunately,
he dies two months

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.400
before the end of the Civil War.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.510
But in 1865, the South
surrenders and so

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.099
they're not able to secede.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.920
And essentially,
we no longer have

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.560
slavery in the United States.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.130
So I'm going to leave--
and it's fascinating,

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.000
and just to give you a sense
of things, here's the map.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.890
The navy blue are the Union
states, the northern states,

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.280
the light blue are the
territory controlled

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.790
by the northern states.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.339
This orange color
are the states that

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.970
seceded from the
Union, the Confederacy.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.370
And this light orange,
these are territories

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.950
that they controlled,
but they were disputed.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.270
These yellow states right here
were members of the Union.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.700
They didn't secede
from the Union.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.390
They didn't join
the Confederacy,

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.855
but they were slave states.

00:17:45.855 --> 00:17:47.480
But probably the most
fascinating thing

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.480
about the Civil War,
other than the fact

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.080
that it ended slavery
in the United States,

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.580
that was probably
its biggest thing,

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.955
but it was also
the bloodiest war

00:17:55.955 --> 00:17:59.160
that ever happened in the
United States history.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.330
During the Civil War-- and
these are unbelievable numbers--

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:12.070
18% of white males
in the South died.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.590
18%, almost one out of every
five white males in the South,

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.530
died during the Civil War.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.450
And for the North, it
was slightly better.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.150
It was 6%.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:25.270
But still, a huge percentage
of the men in the United States

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.330
died fighting the Civil War.
