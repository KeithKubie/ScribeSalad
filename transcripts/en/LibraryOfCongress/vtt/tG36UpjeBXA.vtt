Among them are a number of
diplomats from countries

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.280

And the former Ambassador from

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.940
[ Applause ]

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.040
We are delighted to have all of you
join us for this happy occasion.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.240
I also want to welcome our most
recent Living Legend Awardee,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.360
whose award was conferred
last November.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.100
She is a vibrant force
in the musical world,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.030
the prodigiously talented
Marta Castals Istomin.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.330
[ Applause ]

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:32.730
And last, but certainly not least,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.380
I would like to recognize
the individual responsible

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.640
for this award, the man who
has played a pivotal role

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.520
in naming the Living Legends
for the last 16 years,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.820
Librarian of Congress
Emeritus James H. Billington.

[ Applause ]

00:02:47.120 --> 00:03:01.350 position:56%
Thank you also to the
distinguished novelists and scholars

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.200
who informed us so richly
about Mario Vargas Llosa's work

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.930
in this afternoon's symposium.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.200
You'll find their names
listed in your program.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.350
They've come a long way to
pay homage to this awardee.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:24.830
Let's give them a big hand.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.130
[ Applause ]

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.610
The Living Legend Award was
inaugurated 16 years ago

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.520
in the year 2000, exactly
200 years after the formation

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.890
of the Library of Congress.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.010
The then-Librarian of Congress,
James Billington, was seeking a way

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.240
to mark the Library's bicentennial
by celebrating artists, scholars,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.200
and professionals across
disciplines,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.480
individuals who had made lasting
impressions on American culture.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.730
Their fields might be science,
or literature, or medicine,

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.320
or the media, or politics, or
entertainment, or the fine arts.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.250
It didn't matter, but their
work needed to be trailblazing

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.490
in some way, transformational,
electric, enduring.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.260
And their contributions had
to say something important

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.730
about what it means to be American
and what it means for Americans

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.060
to be citizens of the world.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.970
This is why we are
gathered here tonight,

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.560
to celebrate the many
accomplishments

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.140
of a writer who's had
a profound effect

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.480
on the American reading
public, the Peruvian novelist

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.030
and essayist Mario Vargas Llosa.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.470
Ladies and gentlemen,
without further ado,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.250
we offer a brief history
of this remarkable writer.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.510
Let's roll the video, please.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.120
[ Music ]

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.350
&gt;&gt; If anything can be said
to define Mario Vargas Llosa,

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.270
it is his passion for words, a
passion that leaps exuberantly

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.310
from genre to genre, from
spoken to written works.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.730
He is best known for his
fiction, which can be spirited,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.730
whimsical, or deadly serious.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.350
His novels are well-known
for exposing human frailties

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.260
and plumbing dark chapters
of human history.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.410
But fiction is not his only domain.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.350
He has excelled in
theater, journalism,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.920
literary criticism, opinion.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.520
He has given us drama,
memoir, critical essays,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.100
social and political commentary,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.760
scholarly argument,
literary scholarship.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.020
And he has done so with
rare intellectual vigor

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.320
and a keen appreciation
of the human heart.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.390
He learned to read at the age
of five in a Catholic school

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:58.540 position:56%
in Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he and
his mother were living at the time.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.870 position:56%
It was reading, he says, that opened
the door to a life of writing.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.870
Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas
Llosa was born on March 28th,

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:17.160 position:56%
1936 in Arequipa, Peru, but he spent
his early childhood years in Bolivia

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.890
where he was raised by his mother

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.590
and his grandfather,
a Peruvian diplomat.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.550
He moved to Piura,
Peru when he was 10,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.580
and shortly thereafter his parents,

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.550
who had been divorced
before he was born,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.120 position:56%
were reunited and resettled in Lima.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.860
When Mario was 14, his father
sent him to the military academy

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.820
that became the inspiration for
his novel "The Time of the Hero."

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.670
It was there, steeped in
the rigors of military life,

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.750
that Vargas Llosa developed
the second greatest passion

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.730
of his career, a deep
regard for freedom.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Even as he was being prepared for
a military career he began working

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.780 position:56%
for local newspapers, first in Lima
at the age of 16, and then in Piura.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:14.320
In 1952 he saw his first play,
"The Flight of the Inca,"

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.650
come to life onstage in Piura.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.600
It was the beginning of a lifelong
love affair with storytelling.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.400
Convinced that his future was in
words, he decided to study law

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.980
and literature at the
University of San Marcos in Lima.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.230
While still a student he
married his first wife,

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.000
Julia Urquidi, at the age of 19.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.680
Graduating from San Marcos in
1958, he won a scholarship to study

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.370 position:56%
at Complutense University in Madrid,
where he received a Doctorate

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.790
in Philosophy and Literature.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.850
He went on to Paris, hoping to
win another scholarship there.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.490 position:56%
And when those hopes were dashed,
he began writing stories in earnest.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:05.180
To make ends meet he worked as a
reporter for Agence France-Presse

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.290
and the French National
Television Network.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.740
It was in Paris, he says, that
he began reading literature

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.200 position:56%
from other Latin American countries,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.470
and eventually met the
Chilean poet Pablo Neruda,

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:23.270 position:56%
the Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier,

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.500
and the Argentine writer
Jorge Luis Borges.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.200
In Paris, too, Vargas Llosa became
part of the historic flourishing

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.670
of literature now known as
the Latin American Boom.

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:40.270
A cadre of brilliant young
writers who inspired one another

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:45.760 position:56%
to write the landmark Latin American
masterpieces of the '60s and '70s.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:52.500
They were Gabriel Garcia Marquez,
Jose Donoso, Jorge Edwards,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:59.910
Carlos Fuentes, Julio Cortazar,
and of course, Mario Vargas Llosa.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.070
Within a few years they would all
be read in English and translated

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.930
into languages around the world.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.820 position:56%
Vargas Llosa's first published
work, a collection of short stories,

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.340
was received favorably,
but it was his first novel,

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.950 position:56%
"The Time of the Hero," published in
1963, with it's penetrating portrait

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.560
of an entrenched military
establishment in Peru,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.890
that earned him a coveted
prize in Spain,

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.470
and an immediate place among the
most celebrated young writers

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.470
of Latin America.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.080
His first marriage
dissolved at about that time,

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.280
and he married his
cousin Patricia Llosa,

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.480
by whom he would eventually
have three children,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.160
Alvaro, Gonzalo, and Morgana.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.600
His second novel, "The Green
House," about a legendary brothel

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.710 position:56%
for soldiers in the Peruvian jungle,

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.310
won him even more accolades
and readers.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.430
Every book since has been a
departure from the one before,

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.960
alternating from humorous,
even erotic flights of fancy,

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.100
to pivotal questions of history.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.370
He has given us in all more than
a dozen unforgettable novels

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.510
and a wide variety of nonfiction.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:23.880
Among these are "Conversation in
the Cathedral," "Captain Pantoja

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.540
and the Special Service," "Aunt
Julia and the Script Writer,"

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.780
"The War at the End of the World,"
"Who Killed Palomino Molero?"

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.650
"In Praise of the Stepmother,"
"Death in the Andes,"

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:42.460
"A Fish in the Water," "The
Notebooks of Don Rigoberto,"

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.620
"Letters to a Young Novelist,"
"The Feast of the Goat,"

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.750
"The Way to Paradise," "The Bad
Girl," "The Dream of the Celt,"

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.890
and most recently,
"The Discreet Hero."

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.520
For this remarkably diverse work

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:04.310
in letters he has been awarded
all the major literary prizes

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.710
in Spain and Latin America.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.910
He has been decorated
by France, Mexico, Peru,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.680
Nicaragua, The Dominican Republic.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.330
He has been accorded a
title of Spanish nobility.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.490 position:56%
He has been awarded the Nobel Prize.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:21.020
But these contributions are not
confined to the pages of his books.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.700
For many decades now this writer

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.400
and thinker has been a tireless
participant on the world stage.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.770
He has taught at a number

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.400 position:56%
of prominent universities throughout
Europe and the United States.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.060
He has participated in
theatrical works not only as writer

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.590
or director, but as actor.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.120
He had taken an active
part in world commentary,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.520
whether it be about arts,
politics, or culture.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:54.040 position:56%
He has lectured widely about the
relevance of the arts in human life.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.580
&gt;&gt; He has been President
of PEN International.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:02.410
He has run a vigorous campaign for
the Presidency of his native land

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:06.560
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa has,
in short, been a passionate,

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.420
vibrant force not only in the
realm of the imagination and ideas,

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.520
but in the larger sphere
of human affairs.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:21.910 position:56%
If the Library of Congress' Living
Legend Award is meant to honor those

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.550
who have made significant
contributions

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:34.010 position:56%
to our cultural heritage, then Mario
Vargas Llosa is eminently deserving

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.310
of this prize.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.610
There are few who have done
so much to bring luster

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:37.910
to Spanish-language
letters and enrich culture

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.710
in the 20th and 21st centuries.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.060
&gt;&gt; Luis Miguel Castilla:
I'm truly honored to be part

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.090
of this important celebration.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.310
First of all, I would like to
thank the Library of Congress

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:40.140
for generally hosting us
this evening on the occasion

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.410 position:56%
of bestowing a special
recognition upon Mario Vargas Llosa.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.850
I would also like to acknowledge
a brilliant Peruvian novelist

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.200
and journalist, Marie Arana,
who has been instrumental

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.400
in putting together
this important event.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.200
Gracias, Marie.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:02.290
[ Applause ]

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:06.530 position:56%
Indeed, this time Mario Vargas
Llosa is being given the prestigious

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.770
Living Legend Award,
which the Library

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:14.770
of Congress confers upon prominent
figures whose career have made an

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:19.750
impact in a unique and creative
way in the American community,

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:24.040
contributing to its development
and its diverse cultural heritage.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.510
Mario, who received the
Nobel Prize in literature

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:33.820
in 2010 is making history again,
this time in the United States,

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:38.100
receiving a distinction previously
conferred to artists, writers,

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.340
thinkers, social activists,
politicians,

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.750
and even sports figures, thereby
joining his name with that

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.280
of the influential economist
John Kenneth Galbraith,

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.160
and the no-less-significant
political scientist George Kennan,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.150
the accomplished photographer
Annie Leibovitz,

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.250
the brilliant guitarist B.B.
King, among many others.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.680
This is undoubtedly a unique award
honoring distinguished figures

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.030
who contributed to the
endeavors of a community

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.340
with deeply-rooted traditions
and values of its own,

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.150 position:56%
and upon which it has emerged as one

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:17.320
of the most influential
living cultures in the world.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:22.470
I am very proud as a fellow
Peruvian of Mario's accomplishments

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.130
which have contributed to
placing very high the name

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:29.340
of our country not only in the
U.S., but around the world.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.010
In this particular case,
the fact of being in one

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.070
of the most important
libraries in the world,

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.780
in the heart of Washington, and in
one of the most vibrant democracies

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.640
on the planet, demonstrates
importance

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.040 position:56%
of Mario's work while
acknowledging his personal qualities

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.460
and a lifetime struggle for
democratic values and freedom.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.560
Mario Vargas Llosa has proven

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.050
to be a great promoter
of the Peruvian culture.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.460
Through Mario's books one
can learn about a complex

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.770
and fascinating country like Peru.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.480
In his books, such as
"La Ciudad y los Perros,"

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.930
"Pantaleon y las Visitadoras," and
"La Casa Verde," among many others,

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:18.010
readers discover a mysterious
country with overlapping,

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.810
conflicting, and sometimes
contradictory realities,

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.400
representing exceptional
testimonies of the variety,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.880
wealth, and diversity of Peru.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.150
On a personal note, as many
Peruvians of my generation,

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.410
I have learned a great
deal from Mario's novels,

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:41.460
spending hours devouring his books
and learning about our own history,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.010
its richness and paradoxes.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.210
As him, I grew up in Miraflores.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:52.160
My father attended the same
Leoncio Prado military school.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.000 position:56%
The first play I ever attended was
"La Senorita de Tacna" 35 years ago.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.540
And the first time I personally
met Mario was almost five years ago

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.640
during a brilliant presentation

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.750
at the Cervantes Institute
in New York City.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.260
In all truth, I have been
captivated throughout my life

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.490
by his story telling and
his skillful capabilities

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:20.470
of enthralling his readers page
after page, transporting them

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:25.510
from the streets of Santa
Domingo in "La Fiesta del Chivo,"

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.030
to Lima's old Barrios Altos quarter

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.700
in his most recent
novel "Cinco Esquinas."

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.330
Not only has Mario's
literary work been important,

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.960
but also his outstanding
journalistic work throughout

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.260
his life.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.360
From his first articles in local
newspapers, like La Cronica

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.260
and La Industria, through
his recognized [speaking

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.760 position:56%
in foreign language] column,
published in more than 20 countries,

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.640
Mario comes across as a
keen observer of the reality

00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.450
of our times, and with a sharp
pen convinces us again and again

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.990
of the importance of freedom
and democratic values,

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:09.720 position:56%
deeply analyzing global current
affairs from his unique perspective.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.440
And as Mario once states, I
quote, "It is very difficult

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.410
for a Latin American
writer to avoid politics.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.770 position:56%
Literature is an expression of life,

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.680
and you cannot eradicate
politics from life."

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.410
Ladies and gentlemen, a few
days ago on the occasion

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:31.510
of celebrating Mario's 80th
birthday, a seminar was held

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.310
in Madrid [speaking in foreign
language] culture, ideas,

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:41.060
and freedom, during which Spain's
President Mariano Rajoy said

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.620
that Mario, I quote, "Embodies
the reaffirmation of freedom

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.030
and rejection of indifference."

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.880
Adding that, quote, "He's our
only Nobel Prize Laureate alive,

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.340
and is a hero of the freedom that
has made Latin America, Spain,

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.190
and the Hispanic community
big in the world."

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:04.340
I cannot agree more with the
remarks of President Rajoy.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.400
Mario is an example cautioning
us of the danger of falling

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.290
into the illusion of thinking
from the comfort of our homes,

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.380
that the benefits we enjoy in the
free world are already established

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.180
and everlasting, when the
truth is that it is necessary

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.860
to fight for them every day.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.570
People like Mario are
those who wage the battles.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.120
This is what I consider
the main value

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.480 position:56%
of Mario Vargas Llosa's literary
and journalistic work which cautions

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.150
and encourages never
to stop fighting

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.420
for what we believe is right
and valuable, not only in terms

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.550
of ourselves, our community,
but also of humankind at large.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.350
Muchas gracias, Mario.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:20:08.040
[ Applause ]

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.840
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, the Acting
Librarian of Congress, David Mao.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:21.020
[ Applause ]

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.840
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen, and thank you,

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.500
Ambassador Castilla, for
those wonderful remarks.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.860 position:56%
It's an honor to have you and others

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.580
from the diplomatic core
join us this evening

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.840
for this wonderful ceremony.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.990
We're very, very delighted
to have so many folks here

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.000
to help us celebrate this evening.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.660
Friends, family, all of those who
have played a part in the life

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:49.320
and career of tonight's Living
Legend Awardee, Mario Vargas Llosa.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.660
This may be the first time for many
of you to be here at the Library

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.110
of Congress, so I want
to take a few seconds

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.560
and tell you a little bit about us.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.170
We are the library that was
founded in 1800 for Congress.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:06.160
But when we were founded in 1800
we were a small reference library

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.250
for the members of Congress
-- for members of Congress,

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.150
just a few books and some maps.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.640
But over the last 216
years we have grown

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.510
to become the world's
largest library,

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.300
with more than 162 million items,

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.770
including 32 million books
in over 470 languages.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:30.350
And quite a few of them
belong to our awardee tonight.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:34.110
We also have over 60 million
manuscripts, millions of maps,

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:38.790
films, newspapers, sheet music,
photographic images and prints,

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.420
all part of our comprehensive
collection of the culture

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.160
of the world and the United States.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.290 position:56%
Now of particular note, the
Library has a magnificent collection

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.730
of Latin American and
Luso-Hispanic treasures,

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.000
and these collections are
highlighted quite often

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.350
in our exhibits, in our
publications, in our reading rooms,

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.430
and in our many free public
events like those today.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:06.070
So I hope today's program -- this
evening's program and the symposia

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.760
from this afternoon, inspires
you to come back often

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.110
to visit us again and again.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.930
Now it is my great pleasure
and privilege to award

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:21.110
to Mario Vargas Llosa the Library
of Congress Living Legend Award.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.760
The prize, as you have heard
mentioned this evening,

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.650
is one that honors those
who have contributed greatly

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.590
to the cultural life of Americans.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:33.070
And since the Library's
bicentennial in 2000,

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.690
we have conferred this award
on just select individuals

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.270
who have inspired the American
public through exemplary work.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.850
In their fields they've left
great legacies to the world.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:50.850
And certainly Mario Vargas Llosa
is one of those select individuals.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.510
As Dr. James Billington, now the
Librarian of Congress Emeritus,

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.700
put it -- and I should say that
we are very, very delighted

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.040
to have Librarian of Congress
Emeritus and Ms. Billington

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.340
with us here this evening.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.960
They worked tirelessly
together for almost 30 years

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:15.050
for this great institution, and
-- yes, thank you very much.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.350
[ Applause ]

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.930
And we're so proud that
we can continue his vision

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.800
of awarding a Living
Legend Award here tonight.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.780
So this is what Dr. Billington
said about our awardee tonight,

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:30.060 position:56%
and I quote, "He is a writer in
every sense of the word, a novelist,

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.680
a scholar, a public intellectual,
a playwright, an essayist,

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.190
a literary critic, most
importantly, a teacher.

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:43.050
And he's a brilliant champion of
the Latin American experience."

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.380
Mr. Vargas Llosa has produced a
vast amount of ground-breaking work

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.810
in the realm of letters
and literary criticism.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.360
He's a thinker who
has greatly brought

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.500
in the cultural conversation
in this hemisphere.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.050
and during a very long career he
has entertained us, delighted us,

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.160
and informed us as only
a great novelist can do.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.770
His fiction reveals a profound
understanding of the human spirit

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.170
and the human heart, and
the logic and illogic

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.840
of the Latin American character.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.010
His essays and nonfiction
work have tried

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.780 position:56%
to clarify a continent's
realities, its politics, its quirks,

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.770
and its hierarchies, its
triumphs, and its tragedies.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.260
He has brought South
American history to life

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.980
and shown us the ways that history
lives on in all of its inheritors.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:34.130
Mario Vargas Llosa is, in short, a
unique spokesman for the Americas,

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.700
a literary force whose fiction

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.820 position:56%
and nonfiction works have stimulated
readers in a multitude of languages,

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:44.000
and whose legacy is bound to last
for many generations to come.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.120
We at the Library of
Congress are very,

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.460
very proud to confer
this tribute on him.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.530
So please join me in welcoming
and celebrating Mario Vargas Llosa

00:24:52.530 --> 00:25:32.620
as we invite him to
the stage this evening

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.920
[ Applause ]

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.220
[ Applause ]

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:52.560
At this time we have a very
special part of the program.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.650
We will have an interview
of Mr. Vargas Llosa.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.670
And to do that I want to welcome
Marie Arana, wonderful author,

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.230
literary critic, and currently
the Chair of the Cultures

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.600
of the Countries of the
South here at the Library

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.830
of Congress' John W. Kluge Center.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:22.940
So please welcome Marie
Arana to the stage.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.240
[ Applause ]

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.540
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.980
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Congratulations
to Mario.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.280
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Thank you.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.300
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: This
is a very special --

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.260
well, Mario, it's a very
great pleasure for me

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.700
for a million reasons to
have you win this award.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.000
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa:
Thank you, Marie.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.780
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: It --
as a Peruvian-American,

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.340
as someone who has spent
her lifetime in books

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.890
and who has admired you and
known you for so many years --

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.190
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Absolutely.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.860
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: -- it is really
a very special moment for me,

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.700
and I'm very grateful to be here
to have this conversation with you.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.960
These last few years
have brought many reasons

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:06.150
to celebrate you, the
Nobel of course.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.450
There have been many
prizes, among them the --

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.070
a prize for the citizen
of Madrid, you know.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:17.850
And not to mention the singular
honor of being chosen as an author

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:24.020
of "La Bibliotheque de la Pleiade,"
which is a tremendous honor, who --

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.880
among whose ranks are
the distinguished authors

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:34.990
such as Andre Gide, and Milan
Kundera, and Andre Malraux.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:41.770
And so you have -- you are now
in this extraordinary rank,

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:47.420
and have been called the
most important writer

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.880 position:56%
of your generation in Latin America.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:57.070
So now you have to add to
these tributes the Library

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:58.910
of Congress Living Legend Award.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.470
And I want to ask you,
what does it mean to you?

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.680 position:56%
Could you tell us a little bit about
what it means to you, number one,

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.820 position:56%
to have the Living Legend Award, and
number two, in a more general way,

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.330
to receive this from the Library
of Congress, which you know

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.530
so well for so many years?

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:19.000
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Well, I am
deeply grateful, Marie, of course,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.050
to the Library of Congress
for honoring me

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:26.200
with this Living Legend Award.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.270
It's very generous.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:34.040
I don't think I deserve it.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:44.790
Legend is something so big, so
permanent, that I don't really feel

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:51.170
that I can become a living legend.

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:52.630
Living, yes.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:57.110
Living [laughter] --
I think I am living.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.410
But not a legend.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.760
It's just generosity of
the Library of Congress,

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.430
and of course, I am very grateful.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:08.200
I know that to receive an award
is also to receive a mandate.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:13.390
A mandate of rigor, of
responsibility in what you do,

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:19.300
in what you write, in what you
say, as a public intellectual.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:27.710
And of course what
can I say, it's --

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:36.860
that I will do my best to
not disappoint you and not

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:42.560
to be too far away
of what this medal,

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.650 position:56%
this Living Legend Award, signifies.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:51.700
You know, Marie, writing
is a solitary business.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:55.440
We -- you are a writer yourself,
so you know that in order

00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:02.540
to write we isolate
ourselves, and we cut in a way

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:08.260
with the environment,
because this is the only way

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:14.140
in which we can produce
this alternative reality

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.810
which is the literary fiction.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:27.890
And usually writers work in total
uncertainty about what is going

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.910
to happen with what
you write afterward,

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:38.100
when it becomes a book
and reach the readers.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.980
In that sense, you know, to
receive a public recognition,

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.950
as it is the case of
a literary award,

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:55.840
is something extremely
encouraging, because it means --

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:01.950
you want this to mean that what
you do, sometimes with great effort

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:08.200
and spending a lot of time
and energy in what you do,

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:13.120
is not useless, is
something that reach the mind,

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:20.000
the heart of certain people, and
maybe help these people to live.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
This is what is great
about books, you know.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.590
I learned to read when
I was five years old,

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:38.000
and I remember how life
became so rich, so intense,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:45.680
the way in which my life became
a permanent adventure, you know,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.510
something that was
extremely much more important

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:54.430
than the real life that I had.

00:31:54.430 --> 00:32:03.550 position:56%
So if this is something that we can
produce in our effort of communicate

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.470
with the readers, it's
of course the best reward

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:08.690
that a writer can receive, no?

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:09.990
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Absolutely.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.650
Well, you say something very
important about writing.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:16.730
Of course, there's no more
solitary experience in the world

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:20.030
than being a writer
and working alone,

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.390
and setting down your
thoughts alone.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:27.160
But there's also the solitary
experience of being a reader.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:31.000
And what has always been
extraordinary to me is

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.670 position:56%
that a book is an inanimate subject.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:38.530
It's -- it doesn't mean anything
until somebody picks it up,

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:42.820
and there is that bridge created
between you and the reader.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.960
So it's an extraordinary
thing to me that you point

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:54.050
out the solitary nature of
writing, which is also very true

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.130
for the reader, do you not think?

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:57.430
That it --

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:58.730
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Oh, yes.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:05.410
I think it's a great mystery for a
writer to thinking what will happen

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:09.890
when the book that you are
writing reach the readers.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:14.930
If the book reaches the readers,
because sometimes it doesn't, no?

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:21.650
Sometimes there is a
feeling of failure.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:26.190
I always think in the tragic case

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:30.310
of Giuseppe di Lampedusa,
a very great writer.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.000
I think that he wrote one
of the greatest novels

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.230
of the 20th century,
"Il Gattopardo."

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:42.870
He worked very hard in this master
work, and then when he finished --

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:49.730
he was a very cultivated man with
the -- he spoke several languages,

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.940
and he had written beautiful essays

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.960
about the English writers,
for example.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:34:01.210
And he tried to find a publisher
for his book, and seven --

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:08.250
the seven most important publishing
houses of Italy rejected his book.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:16.610
And then he died before
his book was published.

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:21.250
So I always think in his
case as the most tragic case.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.980
He wrote a master work,
a real master work,

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.280
a very great, great novel.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.440
And he couldn't find a publisher.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:34.910
And when the book was published
-- because Giorgio Bassani,

00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:39.710
an Italian writer, finally
discovered the manuscript and said,

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.930
"Well, but this is a master work.

00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:47.700
This book should be published," and
effectively the book was published.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:51.350
And the book became immediately
-- immediately a best-seller.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:56.750
And everybody recognizing "Il
Gattopardo" a real master work.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:00.980
So what a tragic case,
what sad story, no?

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.280
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yes.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.330
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: So some
writers, we are very fortunate,

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.250
you know, to be recognized.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.970
And it's difficult not to
think in all these colleagues,

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:16.880
these fellow writers, who
were not so fortunate as us.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:22.570
And sometimes, as is the case
of Giuseppe di Lampedusa,

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:30.030
were tragically rejected
because the blindness

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.730
of his contemporary people.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.040
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Absolutely.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.260
This is the important part
of being, as you said,

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.260
living is a very important
part of this award [laughter].

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:46.480
I want to talk about the
breadth of your work.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.570
What is really most remarkable
to me about your career, Mario --

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.550
and it's surely remarkable
to everyone who's sitting

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:58.190
in this audience -- is that very
fact, the breadth, the range.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:04.600
The video gave us a notion of
that range, although it did leave

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.040
out your most recent novel,
"Cinco Esquinas" because --

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.340
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa:
"Cinco Esquinas."

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.470
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: -- we didn't know
it would publish in time for this.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:15.920
But your writing spans from -- as
it says, from fiction, to drama,

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.480
to journalistic opinion,

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.540
to political commentary,
to literary criticism.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:26.340
And in fiction alone it
ranges from novels of ideas,

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.270
to picaresque novels, to
thrillers, and mysteries,

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:36.990
and novels that are set in 20th
century history in a most kind

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.330
of stark and powerful way.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:44.430
In other words, you wear
many hats as a writer.

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.640
There are many hats that you wear,
and you have learned to wear all

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:53.310
of them in sort of an
extraordinarily, masterly fashion.

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:58.620
Which of those hats would you
say represents the true Mario

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.200
Vargas Llosa?

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.500
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Oh,

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:06.580
I think all my books
represent what I am, no?

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:13.840 position:56%
Well, Borges -- Jorge Luis Borges,
said something that I think is very,

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:19.010
very real, that when
you look yourself

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:23.930
at the mirror you don't
know how is your face.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:30.100
Others know immediately and
say, "Well, you are awful.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.710
You are very handsome."

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:35.240
But you don't know.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.680
And I think that is what happens,
at least to me, with my books.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.110
I don't know the real
value of my books.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:46.670
I work very hard.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:52.470
I enjoy. I suffer sometimes
writing these books.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.760
But I never know exactly
what I have achieved,

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.710
you know, with these books.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:06.210
Even when a book has some
success and receives good reviews,

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:12.810
you are never sure if this is
exactly what the book represents,

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:17.590
because you know that the
only way would be to wait,

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:26.790
to wait if this book, these books
are able to transcend the proof

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:31.060
of time, which I think is
what definitely decides

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:35.740
if what you have done is
worthwhile or not, no?

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: There's also some --
a phenomenon that happens, I think,

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.740
when you release a book into
the world, is there not,

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:46.580
that you have actually no concept
of how it will be received?

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.270
And people will receive it
in very many different ways.

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:50.570
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Very
different ways, of course.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:51.900
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And you
hear about this, then,

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.960
from them, from the audience.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.960
How has that experience
been for you?

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:02.150
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Well, what
has happened to me several times is

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:09.840
that the book may be successful
or not, but in general the way

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:17.390
in which the book is received
is very surprising, but in many,

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:24.020
many cases the idea that I had
of the book doesn't coincide

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:30.900
with the way in which the book was
received by critics or by the --

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.720
by just readers, you know.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:39.010
And I suppose the reason is
because, the example of Borges

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:43.420
and the mirror is that you don't
really know exactly what you have

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.620
achieved when you write a book.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.160
You would like to be successful.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:55.060
You would like this book to justify
all the time that you have invested

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:59.760
and the energy that you
have invested in writing it,

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.400
but actually you never know.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.990 position:56%
And this is the great enigma, I
think, that all writers have respect

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.950
of his -- their own work.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:11.770
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:17.720
You have thought deeply,
Mario, about power.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.530
And here you are in the
heart of Washington,

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.000
which represents political
power, at least in this country.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.390
And this is something that,
judging by your works,

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:32.870
whether they be serious, or funny,
or whether they be large-scale

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:37.430
or intimate, or whether they
even be historical or set

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:41.260
in the modern day, concerns you.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.560
Power concerns you.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.590
That concern was present
in "The Green House."

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:49.610
It was present in "Conversation
in the Cathedral," to be sure.

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.020
Present in "Feast of the
Goat," "War of the Worlds."

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:56.980
We can go right through it, and it
is really in very special evidence,

00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:02.110
I think, in your most recent
novel, "Cinco Esquinas."

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:07.320
What is it that draws you to power?

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.370
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Well,
I think that literature

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:24.510
in general is something that
represents a kind of counter-power.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:34.340
It's something that the
authors not necessarily know.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:42.900
But I think every good book,
a good novel, a good play,

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:49.780
a good poem is something
that defends us readers

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:57.730
against the potential danger that
there is in all kind of power.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:08.250
I think the power is something
that potentially represents a kind

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:15.270
of danger for things like
freedom, human rights,

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:22.650
the basic rights of the individual.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:26.750 position:56%
And we are not always aware of this.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:33.170
And I think there is nothing
like literature to make you aware

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:38.560
of the dangers that the
different kind of powers

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.950
that are around us represent.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:50.530
And I think that is the most
important social function

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:57.630
of literature, to develop in
us a kind of critical attitude,

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:05.220
to critical spirit,
particularly vis-à-vis the powers

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:12.240 position:56%
that organize society and establish,
you know, the institutions

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:18.460
that rule, you know,
the life in society.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:22.420
For that reason, I think
literature is extremely important,

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.880
not only because the pleasure
that we receive from books,

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.420
from achievements and
books of literature,

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:38.040
but also because literature
develops in us a kind of [speaking

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.340
in foreign language] --
how would you say this,

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.260
[speaking in foreign
language] -- suspicious?

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:44.560
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.160
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Suspicious
about the work as it is, you know.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:55.250
That is the reason why all
the ideologies or systems

00:43:56.330 --> 00:44:06.220
that have pretended to control
life entirely are very suspicious

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:12.620
of literature and establish
systems of censorship or control,

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:17.480
because they feel,
and I think rightly,

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:25.770
that in literature they have a
kind of enemy of this appetite

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:30.300
to control everything
and to organize life

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:34.980
in such a determined way.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:42.150
I think in a free country,
in a country with laws

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:45.390
that protect the citizens,

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:50.860
this function of literature
is not perceived.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:57.240
But in any country in which
freedom has started to shrink,

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:04.580 position:56%
I think literature immediately shows
itself as something that is there

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:09.980
to defend, you know,
these basic human rights

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:16.580
and to defend the citizens
against the excessive powers

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:22.690
that can reduce our freedom and can
even transgress our human rights.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:26.010
And I think this aspect of
literature is extremely,

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.120
extremely important if we want

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:32.860
to have free societies,
democratic countries.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.060
Literature is extremely
important also

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:40.220
in this civic and political sense.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:49.890
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: That's a
wonderful way to put it, yes.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:51.190
[ Applause ]

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:55.570
I wonder to what extent you were
sensitized to the whole notion

00:45:55.570 --> 00:46:01.660
of power in your experience in the
military school, Leoncio Prado?

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:11.720 position:56%
Was there a sense then that there
was a kind of ominous power at work?

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.020
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Well, I --

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:18.480
you know, Marie, I
discovered authoritarianism

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.570
when I met my father
for the first time.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.230
I was 11 years old.

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:29.100
Until then parents were divorced.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.090
And as my maternal
family was very Catholic,

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.870
they were ashamed of this divorce.

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:40.010
And so he told me that my
father was dead, you know.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:46.260
And one day suddenly when I was
11 years old, my mother told me,

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.300
"You know that your
father is alive, no?"

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.740
And I think I haven't yet
recovered, you know [laughter].

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:57.040
From the impression that I
had when my mother told me

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.040
that my father was alive.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:06.550
So I said -- I asked to her, "And
when I'm going to meet my father?"

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:08.170
And she told me, "Right away.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:09.590
Immediately."

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.940 position:56%
We go to the hotel, and he is there.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.330
And I went to live with my father.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:17.870
My father reconciled and
-- my parents reconciled.

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:21.730
And with my father I
discovered authoritarianism.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:25.130
He was a very authoritarian
personality.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:33.080
And I remember very well how
my life changed completely

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.600 position:56%
since I went to live with my father.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:40.150
I discovered things that I didn't
know that they exist, you know.

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.020
Fear, for example.

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:46.420
I had such a fear with
this strange man,

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.280
because he was completely
strange in my life.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:55.330 position:56%
And I think that the military school
was just a continuation of the kind

00:47:55.330 --> 00:48:01.540
of authoritarianism that I had
at home because of my father.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:07.160
And I think the -- probably it was
there, during those early years

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:14.560
of my adolescence, you know, that
I started to hate dictatorships,

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.820
any kind of dictatorship.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:23.920
And this, I think, has been
something recurrent in my life,

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:33.280
in my writings, and the way in
which some authorities exercise

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:39.690
with brutality, with abuse,
without respecting, you know,

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:48.310
the most elementary forms in life
is something that I cannot resist.

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:56.140
And I think this explains,
probably, why in so many books,

00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:04.320
in so many novels, the theme of
authoritarian power is central,

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:10.780 position:56%
is something that has been repeating
itself in what I have written,

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:15.830 position:56%
because in my life this is something
that has produced in me this kind

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:24.230
of protest of rebellion, you know,
against any kind of abuse of power.

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.380
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Well, if you're
talking about power you --

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.410
and you're talking about
authoritarian power,

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:31.070
you're also talking about
corruption eventually.

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:35.240
And you're talking about -- also
about rebels against the power,

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:42.270
which is what you attribute the
great work of literature doing.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:46.370
But you've thought
deeply also about rebels.

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:51.960
And you've -- I'm talking now about
Flora Tristan, for instance who --

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.720
the Peruvian grandmother
of the artist Paul Gaugin,

00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:00.360
who was a feminist revolutionary
and a character in your novel

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:04.860
"El Paraiso en la Otra
Esquina," which was "The Way

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:06.790
to Paradise" it was in English.

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.610
And I'm thinking about
also Sir Roger Casement

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:13.910
who in a way was a
rebel in his own right,

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:16.230
the hero of "Dream of the Celt."

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:19.930
And I'm thinking, too, about
la Retaquita, who is Julieta,

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:23.250
the heroine of your most
recent book, "Cinco Esquinas."

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:28.490
And these were all people who
are after some kind of truth.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:34.190
They are trying to right
a wrong, as it were.

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:37.810
And they're bucking a
whole system to do it.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:42.450
So rebels also, aside from power,
are very much a theme in your work.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:43.830
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa:
Oh, without a doubt.

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:48.990
I -- these kind of
characters I admire very much.

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:54.290
I mean, people who are not --

00:50:54.290 --> 00:51:01.710
who don't accept the world as
it is and want to change it.

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:12.100
Usually they want to change
it in the good way, in the --

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:16.030
to reduce sufferances,
to reduce misery,

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:20.770
to defend freedom against
oppression.

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:26.810
But in certain cases there
are rebels who are --

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:31.930
who have a very wrong
idea of what they want

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:34.050
to achieve with the rebellion.

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:35.350
But it doesn't matter.

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:40.570
Even if they are wrong, and
even if they fail completely

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:45.700
in what they try to do, there is
something that I think is admirable

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:51.090
in these people who are not
conformist and that consider

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:57.320
that the world should change
in order to be a better place,

00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:00.260
at least for some people.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.390
This kind of character
I admire very much,

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:05.920
and I think that is the reason why

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.990
in my novels sometimes I
am not totally conscious

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:10.720
of what I am doing.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:14.490
But in general when I have a
perspective of what I have done,

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:19.520 position:56%
I discover that this kind of
character is recurring in my novels.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.110
Sometimes they came from history.

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:25.260
In other cases, I invented
characters.

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.530
But the attitude that
they represent,

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:31.680
rebellion against the world
as it is, I think is something

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:37.290
that I am deeply attached.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:45.590
And in a way I think that this
is also a consequence of my love

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:49.600
of books and of literature
and fiction.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:55.720
I think the books gave me
since my first readings

00:52:55.720 --> 00:53:02.680 position:56%
when I was very young this idea of
the adventure, life as an adventure.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.590
Life as an adventure to change
life for the better, no?

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:13.560
I read Alexander Dumas, the history
of the musketeers, for example,

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:19.480
and I remember the way in which
I enjoy and I identified myself,

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:23.080
you know, with the musketeers,
with d'Artagnan, with Porthos,

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:28.450
with Aramis, and afterward
when I started

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:37.020
to read more important books,
you know, Moreau, Faulkner,

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:40.730
the kind of heroes that are
[inaudible] a kind of war

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:44.800
with the world as it is were heroes

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.120
with which I identified
myself immediately.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:52.790
So it's not strange that
I have tried in my novels

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:54.280 position:56%
to produce these kind of characters.

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.770
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: To adopt
the adventure, yes.

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:57.600
And you do -- and you do, indeed.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.100
For whom do you write, Mario?

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:03.570 position:56%
For whom -- who is -- what you write
your fiction or your nonfiction,

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:05.250
do you have someone in mind?

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:06.550
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: No.

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:07.850
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Who is that person?

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:10.810
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: I don't
think I am thinking in a reader --

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:15.690
in a particular kind of reader
when I am writing a novel.

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:21.310
No, for me, to write a novel is
something, I repeat, very solitary.

00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:28.780
I secluded myself in a world
which came from memories,

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:34.620
images from the memory
which produce inventions,

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:38.010
which produce another
images, which are invented.

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:43.160
But the point of departure is
something -- it's always memory.

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:48.070
It's images that are
preserved in the memory.

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:53.700
Images that were produced by
experiences, by living experiences,

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.660
and then are always
the point of departure

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.270
for the imagination, for invention.

00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:04.160
But I don't think I have a
particular kind of reader

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:07.230
in which I am thinking
when I am writing, no.

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:08.950
What I try to do, of course --

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:12.420
and I think this is something
that many writers try to do

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:19.510
when they are writing -- I try
to divide myself in the reader

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:28.710 position:56%
that is reading what I am writing to
see if the techniques are effective

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:35.530
and can really persuade the
reader of what they say.

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:39.900
But I think this is a very
personal kind of reader,

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:45.620
and I don't think I have a
particular audience in mind

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:48.260
when I am writing a book.

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:53.700
It's different when I write an
article or I write an essay.

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:58.640
That is different, because that
you try to reach a kind of public.

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.480
But this is not the case
when I write fiction --

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.780
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: When
you write fiction.

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.080
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: -- at all.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.380
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yes, I understand.

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:09.430
Now you are, as we all
know from just listening

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:14.110
to the Ambassadors here who -- or
the list of names who have come

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:16.460
to pay you tribute
and to hear you --

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:17.990
that you're a citizen of the world.

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:23.500
You have -- you're Peruvian,
but you live in Spain.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.490
You hold Spanish citizenship.

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:27.660
You have lived in Britain.

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.960
You've lived in France.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.530
And you are read and
loved the world over.

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:35.010
I can't even count the
number of languages

00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:36.890
that you're translated into.

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:42.280
So my question to you is do
you think of yourself in terms

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:49.290
of allegiance to any kind of
nationality, any kind of culture?

00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:51.200
Where are your allegiances?

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.010
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa:
Well, as you said,

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:58.930
I think I have become
a citizen of the world.

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.060
The -- particularly the world

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:09.570
in which we live now permits
this kind of world citizenship.

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:16.510
But I think for a writer
that our basic experiences,

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:25.470
which are the major source of
his fantasy, or when he writes.

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:30.690
And I think in my case,
these basic experiences,

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:36.210
I had it when I was young,
when I was an adolescent,

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:43.520 position:56%
and probably that is the reason
why, in spite of living outside Peru

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:48.730
so many, many years, I am
always returning directly

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:54.820
or undirectly [sic] to Peruvian
themes, to Peruvian environments,

00:57:54.820 --> 00:58:01.110
to Peruvian geography, and to
Peruvian language, you know,

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:04.370
the way in which we speak
the Spanish is something

00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:12.330
that is intimately linked to the
kind of Spanish that I write.

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:17.960
And I think the reason is
because the basic experiences

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.310
that form my personality
were experiences that I had

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:24.390
in Peru when I was young, no?

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:28.660
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: There -- I think
it was Garcia Marquez who said,

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:34.770
"The writer that I became was a
fully-formed mind, in a sense,

00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:39.720
or heart," by the time
he was eight years old.

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:44.470
The idea that you -- your --
those first experiences --

00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:47.250 position:56%
and for you it was in -- you were in
Bolivia, and then you were in Piura.

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:49.670
You were moving around as a child.

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:55.650
So you have this natural, for as
long as you can remember perhaps,

00:58:55.650 --> 00:59:00.370
a kind of fluid relationship
to the world, would you say?

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:01.670
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa:
Yes, that is true.

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:09.880 position:56%
And on the other hand, I feel the
basic experiences were not literary.

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:16.520
My literary experiences are
much less universal, you know.

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:24.620
I -- for example, I remember
the way in which I was impressed

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:31.180
when I was -- I don't know --
12, 13 years old watching a play

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:35.860
by Arthur Miller, "Muerte de un
Viajante," "Death of a Salesman."

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.160
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Salesman.

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.800
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa:
And I was so impressed

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:47.550 position:56%
because it was the first play which,
like a modern novel, could change,

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:52.530
you know, time, spaces,
in a very audacious way.

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:57.440
And immediately I wrote my first
play after the experiences,

00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:02.100
the strong experiences which
was for me to see this play.

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.640
And then, for example, a
French writer, Flaubert,

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:09.230
marked me very, very
much as a writer.

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:12.930
I think I discovered the
kind of writer that I wanted

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:16.320
to be reading "Madame Bovary."

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:23.300 position:56%
I discovered that realism was
something very different of the kind

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:27.570
of realism that was at that
time in Latin America popular.

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:34.320
Not a realism that was negligible
with form, with aestheticism.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.690
No, the contrary.

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:46.760 position:56%
Flaubert could match realism and the
research of beauty, of perfection,

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:54.030
the kind in which he wore
the language to reach the --

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:56.610
les mots justes, the right word.

01:00:56.610 --> 01:01:03.140
You know? Was such that could match
perfect realism and aestheticism.

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:10.270
And so, I think I owe
enormously to foreign writers,

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:14.940
not only Latin American writers.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.920
It was the case of
Faulkner, for example.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:23.580 position:56%
I remember when I read the first
novels by Faulkner, I was entranced.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:29.800
I discovered that the novel could
be so rich if you use, you know,

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:34.880
all these techniques
that Faulkner was using

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:40.380
with such easiness in his novels.

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:46.020
I remember how important it was for
me to read, for example, Malraux,

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:56.310
the way in which Malraux described
masses of people moving, acting.

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:59.630
It was really extraordinary and --

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:06.560 position:56%
so my literary training is much more
universal, is not Latin American.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:11.440 position:56%
No. But the basic experiences, yes,
I think Latin American and Peruvian.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.740
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:14.040
Absolutely.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.550
You know, in a symposium, ED
Grossman, your translator, who,

01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:20.070
unfortunately, couldn't be here.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:25.680
But she sent her paper and her
paper was quite interesting

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.980
because she said that if
you weren't a novelist,

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.570
you would be an archeologist.

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:31.870
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa:
An archeologist?

01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:33.170
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yes.

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:40.010
Because your work is to sort of
dig and excavate history, reality.

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:44.030
And then, she said something
else very interesting

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:46.230
and I want you to react to it.

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.320
She said not only would
you be an archaeologist

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:53.690
if you were not a write, but that
you also have this extraordinary

01:02:53.690 --> 01:03:00.340
voice that has come from
Cervantes, through Faulkner,

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:03.650
and I would add Flaubert,
to the work that you do,

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:09.460
and that you're actually employing
all of these voices in what you do.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:15.220
So are -- would you be interested
in a job in archeology, perhaps?

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:19.200
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Well,
archeology in this sense, yes.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.800
But to study bones, no.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.100
I don't think so.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.400
No [laughter].

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.700
I'm sorry.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:30.540
I hope there is no
archaeologist in the audience.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.800
I am much more interested
in the living world

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.850
than the world of the past.

01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:40.170
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: There's something
else that I wanted to go back

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:43.870
to Flaubert, because there's
something very important

01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:47.130
that I think connects
you to Flaubert,

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:52.060
and that is that Flaubert
thought and wrote about the fact

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:55.300
that writing is very hard work.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:02.420
It is -- I think you said arduous
labor and if you do it right,

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:07.310
you're -- you don't just
stop with writing a sentence.

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:11.060
You -- the labor comes
actually after that point.

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:12.360
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Absolutely.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:18.310 position:56%
I think that is the example of
Flaubert, which is very encouraging.

01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:26.570
I think you discover with Flaubert
something extremely important.

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:34.960
If you are not born genius-- if
you are born a genius, no problem.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:39.630
But when you discover
that you are not a genius,

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:43.940
this can be very discouraging for a
writer, if you want to be a writer.

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:46.520 position:56%
Well, that was the case of Flaubert.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.130
Flaubert was not a genius.

01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:51.410
Flaubert started writing
very bad things.

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:57.970
You know? Imitations of the
fashionable writers of his time.

01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:02.250
But he wanted to be a
great writer and he decided

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:04.990 position:56%
that he would become a great writer.

01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:11.710
And as he was not a genius, he
decided to replace, you know,

01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:18.050
this natural force of
creativity with hard work.

01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:21.640
And this was for me
extremely important.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:31.790
As important as to discover
that realism could be a kind

01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:39.420
of literature that at the
same time was extremely formal

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:44.750
with great preoccupation for the
techniques and for the language.

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:59.070 position:56%
The way in which Flaubert built his
talent, working with such obstinacy,

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:13.470 position:56%
with such perseverance, and imposing
himself kind of seclusion, you know,

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:18.130
for months and for years,
is something extraordinary.

01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:20.880
And he became a very great,

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:25.870
great writer without
being a natural genius.

01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:32.650
And that, I think, is a great
example that Flaubert gave us

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:35.380
to the writers that we
are not born genius.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:41.850
You know? That working very
hard, being extremely self-critic

01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:51.430
of what you do, being
obsessed with the idea

01:06:51.430 --> 01:07:00.650 position:56%
of improve what you have done, you
can really produce great literature.

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.620
And I think this is a
fantastic example, you know.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.610
The case of Rimbaud, for
example, is the opposite.

01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:12.450
Rimbaud, when he was 14 years
old, was writing master works,

01:07:12.450 --> 01:07:16.570
poems which were absolutely
revolutionary and perfect.

01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:21.070
And this can be very depressing if
you don't have this natural force

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:23.650
of creativity that Rimbaud had.

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:28.560
Well, Flaubert is much more
human because he's something

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:37.190
that working very, very hard could
reach the kind of originality,

01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:44.210
creativity, that the natural born
genius that was Rimbaud produced.

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:51.640 position:56%
You know? That is why I think to
read not only the novels of Flaubert

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.920
but the correspondence of
Flaubert, particularly the letters

01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:03.430
that he wrote every day to
his lover, Louise Colet,

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:05.720 position:56%
when he was writing "Madame Bovary,"

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.110
is something absolutely
extraordinary.

01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:14.730
Because you see, reading these
letters, how he was able to build,

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:19.080 position:56%
to construct his talent, his genius.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:24.470
You know? Working very, very
hard, not accepting, you know,

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:27.400
what he has done, convinced

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:33.280
that this could be
improved, could be perfected.

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.810
You know? And I think this is
something that helped me very,

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:40.520
very much when I was
writing my first novels.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.820
You know?

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:43.120
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: The
notion that you need

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.700
to rewrite as much as you write?

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.000
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Yeah.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.300
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yes.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.120 position:56%
Now, I want to take you away from
literature a little bit and take you

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:54.180
to the Mario who is the political
commentator in "El Pais."

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:57.970
We know -- well, we're fortunate
to live, I guess I should say,

01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:01.820
as the Chinese saying
goes, in interesting times.

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.610
We've -- there's a
Peruvian election afoot.

01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:10.860
We had the first -- primera
vuelta, the first round yesterday.

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:15.440
There's a very interesting
election going on in this country

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:18.680
as well [laughter], as it happens.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.170
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Interesting
means many different things.

01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:22.470
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yes.

01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:26.350
It happens every 20 or so
years, my husband tells me.

01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:29.500
So I need to prepare
for the next one.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:33.360
But it's been very,
very extraordinary,

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:37.170
really, these two elections.

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:42.040
Tell us your thoughts about the
situation in -- first in Peru.

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:46.410
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa:
Well, it's very,

01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:53.230
very interesting what's been
happening in Peru since the end

01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:57.820
of the dictatorship of
Fujimori, year 2000.

01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:00.850
Since then, we have had
democratic governments.

01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:02.150
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right

01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:05.860
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa:
Borne out of free elections.

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:10.020
And different kind of governments.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:16.620
But because there is a very
large consensus in Peru in favor

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:21.710
of politically democracy and,
for the first time, I would say,

01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:28.000
in our history, a large consensus
about the economic policy.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.220
Market the economy, integration
with the markets of the world.

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:37.420
And all this has been produced
an extraordinary progress

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.160
in material terms.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.460
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: So living.

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.190
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Extreme
poverty has reduced dramatically.

01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:47.070
The middle classes
have been growing.

01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:53.060
Foreign investment is coming
to Peru with enthusiasm.

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:58.810
And this has produced a real,
real progress in the country.

01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:03.150
What will happen if Keiko
Fujimori wins the election?

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:07.960 position:56%
She is the daughter of the dictator,
one of the most corrupt dictators

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:11.520
that we have had, and also
cruel, not because the crimes

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.670
that were committed during
the Fujimori 10 years

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:17.170
in power were enormous.

01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:21.640
Well, it will be a catastrophe for
the country because, first of all,

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:25.870
the triumph of Keiko
Fujimori would mean a kind

01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:30.100 position:56%
of reindication of the dictatorship.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:33.440
The dictatorship would
be legitimitated, no,

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.970
by the Peruvian electorate.

01:11:36.970 --> 01:11:48.740 position:56%
Prisons where all the Fujimoristas
are paying their crimes and their --

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:55.840 position:56%
would be free and will pass
immediately to be part of the power.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:02.930
The division that this will produce
in the country will be enormous.

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:08.100
And of course, not only the
economy, but the social stability

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:13.790
that the country has enjoyed
in the 2000 will disappear.

01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:19.430
So my great hope is that in
this second round election,

01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:24.500
second election, will -- Pedro
Pablo Kuczynski will win.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:28.150
It will be difficult because
the difference is large,

01:12:28.150 --> 01:12:30.000
but I think it's possible.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:37.940
My hope is that blindness will
disappear, at least in part,

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:44.050
and Peruvians won't commit,
you know, the big, big,

01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:47.770
big mistake to elect Keiko Fujimori

01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:51.490
because I think the
consequences will be politically

01:12:51.490 --> 01:13:08.400
and also socially and
economically disastrous for Peru.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.700
[ Applause ]

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.000
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Thank you for that.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.270 position:56%
I want to take you, because we need
to wrap this up, to your reflections

01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:21.670
from your -- this grand promontory.

01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:27.730 position:56%
I mean, exactly two weeks ago today,
you celebrated your 80th birthday.

01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:29.460
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Alas.

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:37.290
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Happy birthday.

01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:38.590
[ Applause ]

01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:43.550
And a year before that, you said
-- and this is absolutely memorable

01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:45.680
and I think inspirational in a way.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:51.160
You said you didn't want
to die dead [laughter].

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.170
You want to die living.

01:13:53.170 --> 01:13:54.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: That's right.

01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:56.900
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And you wanted
to be cut down in your stride,

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.900
even as you're forging ahead,
doing what it is that you do

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:04.800 position:56%
to stay alive, which is to write,
to live, to comment, to be involved,

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:11.660
to be an involved person in this
world of ours, this great world

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:13.030
of ours that you inhabit.

01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:14.560
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: You
know, Maria, the problem is

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:20.420
that people think that if
you receive the Nobel Prize,

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:22.040 position:56%
you are already finished [laughter].

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:27.620
This is a great homage, but you
become a kind of an institute

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.530
and you won't be able
to produce anything

01:14:29.530 --> 01:14:31.550
because institutes
don't produce things.

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:49.530 position:56%
You know? And I am doing all my best
to disappoint people who believe

01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:52.000
that I have become an institute.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.300
You know?

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.600
[ Applause ]

01:14:54.600 --> 01:15:01.000
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: I'm going to repeat
exactly what you said in Spanish,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.780 position:56%
because it's really quite beautiful.

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:08.080
[ Speaking Spanish ]

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.380
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa: Absolutely.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.680
[ Speaking Spanish ]

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.980
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: This
is a living, wonderful,

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.130 position:56%
breathing philosophy of life, Mario.

01:15:14.130 --> 01:15:16.360
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa:
Thank you, Maria.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:21.430
Thank you very much.

01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:24.480
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And
we want to celebrate.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.780
[ Applause ]

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:27.080
&gt;&gt; Mario Vargas Llosa:
Thank you very much.
