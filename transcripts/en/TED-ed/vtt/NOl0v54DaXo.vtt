00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.046
Now, my subject is success,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.516
so people sometimes
call me a "motivational speaker."

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.251
But I want you to know right up front
I'm not a motivational speaker.

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:25.710
I couldn't pass the height requirement.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.656
(Laughter)

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.706
And I couldn't motivate anybody.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.673
My employees actually call me
a de-motivational speaker.

00:00:32.697 --> 00:00:33.698
(Laughter)

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:36.336
What I try to be
is an informational speaker.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.333
I went out and found out
some information about success,

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:40.976
and I'm just here to pass it on.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.006
And my story started over
ten years ago, on a plane.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.976
I was on my way
to the TED conference in California,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.976
and in the seat next to me
was a teenage girl,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.816
and she came from a really poor family,
but she wanted to get somewhere in life.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.076
And as I tapped away on my computer,
she kept asking me questions,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.496
and then out of the blue,
she asked, "Are you successful?"

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.976
I said, "No, I'm not successful."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.756
Terry Fox, my hero,
now there's a big success.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.776
He lost a leg to cancer,
then ran thousands of miles

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.416
and raised millions for cancer research.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.206
Or Bill Gates,
a guy who owns his own plane

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.416
and doesn't have to sit
next to some kid asking him questions.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.976
(Laughter)

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.576
But then I told her
about some of the stuff I'd done.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.286
I love communications,
and I've won lots of awards in marketing.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.866
I love running, and I still sometimes
win my age group,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.466
old farts over 60.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.490
(Laughter)

00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:35.546
My fastest marathon
is two hours and 43 minutes

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.406
to run the 26 miles, or 42 kilometers.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.976
I've run over 50 marathons,
in all 7 continents.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.336
This was a run my wife and I did
up the Inca trail to Machu Picchu in Peru.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.546
And to qualify for the 7 continents,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.976
we had to run a marathon in Antarctica.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.404
But when we got there,
it didn't look nice and calm like this,

00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:55.762
it looked like this.

00:01:55.786 --> 00:01:58.256
The waves were so high,
we couldn't get to shore.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.666
So we sailed 200 miles further south
to where the seas were calm

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.516
and ran the entire 26-mile marathon

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.809
on the boat.

00:02:06.413 --> 00:02:09.419
422 laps around the deck
of that little boat.

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:13.076
My wife and I have also climbed
two of the world's seven summits,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.016
the highest mountains on each continent.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.296
We climbed Aconcagua, the highest
mountain on the American continent,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.606
and Kilimanjaro,
the highest mountain in Africa.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.446
Well, to be honest, I puked my way
to the top of Kilimanjaro,

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.416
I got altitude sickness.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.476
I got no sympathy from my wife.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.350
She passed me and did a lap around the top

00:02:31.374 --> 00:02:33.405
while I was still struggling up there.

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:37.800
In spite of that, we're still together
and have been for over 35 years.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:38.825
(Applause)

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.856
I'd say that's a success these days.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.976
So I said to the girl,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.976
"Well, you know,
I guess I have had some success."

00:02:46.604 --> 00:02:49.475
And then she said,
"Okay, so are you a millionaire?"

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:50.586
(Laughter)

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.127
Now, I didn't know what to say,

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:55.126
because when I grew up,
it was bad manners to talk about money.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.836
But I figured I'd better be honest,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.737
and I said, "Yeah. I'm a millionaire.

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.395
But I don't know how it happened.

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.656
I never went after the money,
and it's not that important to me."

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.996
She said, "Maybe not to you,
but it is to me.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.842
I don't want to be poor all my life.

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:10.563
I want to get somewhere,
but it's never going to happen."

00:03:10.587 --> 00:03:12.146
I said, "Well, why not?"

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.546
She said, "Well, you know,
I'm not very smart.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.242
I'm not doing great in school."

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:20.486
I said, "So what? I'm not smart.
I barely passed high school.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.835
I had absolutely nothing going for me.

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.715
I was never voted most popular
or most likely to succeed.

00:03:27.304 --> 00:03:30.336
I started a whole new category
-- most likely to fail.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.926
But in the end, I did okay.
So if I can do it, you can do it."

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.326
And then she asked me the big question:

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.766
"Okay, so what really leads to success?"

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.456
I said, "Jeez, sorry. I don't know.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.476
I guess somehow I did it.
I don't know how I did it."

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.976
So I get off the plane
and go to the TED conference,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.236
and I'm standing in a room full
of extraordinarily successful people

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.142
in many fields -- business, science, arts,

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:57.522
health, technology, the environment --

00:03:57.546 --> 00:03:58.606
when it hit me:

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.976
Why don't I ask them
what helped them succeed,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.646
and find out what really
leads to success for everyone?

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.386
So I was all excited to get out there
and start talking to these great people,

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.976
when the self-doubt set in.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.936
I mean, why would people
want to talk to me?

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.116
I'm not a famous journalist.
I'm not even a journalist.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.236
So I was ready to stop the project
before it even began,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.976
when who comes walking
towards me but Ben Cohen,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.916
the famous co-founder
of Ben and Jerry's ice cream.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.464
I figured it was now or never.

00:04:26.488 --> 00:04:28.052
I pushed through the self-doubt,

00:04:28.076 --> 00:04:30.009
jumped out in front of him, and said,

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:31.677
"Ben, I'm working on this project.

00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:33.386
I don't even know what to ask you,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.556
but can you tell me
what helped you succeed?"

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.186
He said, "Yeah, sure, come on.
Let's go for a coffee."

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.926
And over coffee and ice cream,
Ben told me his story.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.096
Now here we are over 10 years later,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.556
and I've interviewed
over 500 successful people

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.047
face-to-face, and collected
thousands of other success stories.

00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:53.296
I wanted to find the common factors
for success in all fields,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.216
so I had to interview people
in careers ranging from A to Z.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.826
These are just the careers I interviewed
beginning with the letter A,

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.736
and in most cases more than one person.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.976
I interviewed six successful accountants,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.746
five corporate auditors,
five astronauts who had been into space,

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.906
four actors who had won
the Academy Award for Best Actor,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.566
three of the world's top astrophysicists,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.556
six of the world's leading architects

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.976
and, oh yeah, four Nobel Prize winners.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.240
Yeah, I know it doesn't start with A,
but it's kind of cool.

00:05:23.264 --> 00:05:24.321
(Laughter)

00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:26.346
And I want to say a sincere thanks

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.756
to all the great people
that I've interviewed over the years.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.566
This really is their story;
I'm just the messenger.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.976
The really big job was taking
all the interviews

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.226
and analyzing them,
word by word, line by line,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.326
and sorting them into all the factors
that people said helped them succeed.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.756
And then you start to see the big factors
that are common to most people's success.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.726
Altogether, I analyzed
and sorted millions of words.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.976
Do you know how much work that is?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.866
That's all I do, day and night --
sort and analyze.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.547
I'll tell you, if I ever get my hands
on that kid on the plane --

00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:00.572
(Laughter)

00:06:00.596 --> 00:06:02.449
Actually, if I do, I'll thank her.

00:06:02.473 --> 00:06:05.925
Because I've never had so much fun
and met so many interesting people.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.306
And now, I can answer her question.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.216
I discovered the 8 traits
successful people have in common,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.216
or the 8 to be great:

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.896
Love what you do; work really hard;

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.976
focus on one thing, not everything;

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.616
keep pushing yourself;
come up with good ideas;

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.766
keep improving yourself and what you do;

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.786
serve others something of value, because
success isn't just about me, me, me;

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.226
and persist, because
there's no overnight success.

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:35.466
Why did I pick these?

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.726
Because when I added up
all the comments in my interviews,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.976
more people said
those 8 things helped them

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.382
than anything else.

00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:45.866
The eight traits are really
the heart of success, the foundation,

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.976
and then on top we build
the specific skills

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.076
that we need for our particular
field or career.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.189
Technical skills, analytical skills,
people skills, creative skills --

00:06:56.213 --> 00:06:58.340
lots of other skills we can add on top,

00:06:58.364 --> 00:06:59.976
depending on our field.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.976
But no matter what field we're in,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.976
these eight traits will be
at the heart of our success.

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:09.325
(Applause)
