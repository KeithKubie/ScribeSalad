00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:04.070
It's now time for Nut Chuggers.

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:06.039
Nut Chuggers.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:11.110
There is a growing health crisis
in our parks,

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:12.779
our woods,
and even our backyards.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:15.749
I'm talking about fat squirrels.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:22.588
Look at him!

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:25.792
Like this guy from Imgur user
theInventorArtist.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.728
Uh, it's time to lay off
the acorn-dogs, chubster.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.330
Now, honestly...

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:33.466
Did you get a vision
of a tiny little bun

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:34.734
-with little nuts in it?
-CUMMINGS: Yes, yes.

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.736
(chewing sounds)

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.206
-That's so hot! -"I eat
to cover my feelings up."

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.543
Uh, now, due to milder winters
caused by global warming,

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.545
there is an excess of nuts
and berries,

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.680
so these little guys
are just stuffing their faces

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:49.215
all year long.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:50.883
Oh, they don't know
when to quit.

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.752
And the nature photographers
can't seem to get enough

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:54.087
of these BBSs.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.290
Big, beautiful squirrels. Uh...

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.159
"Hey, you guys,
real squirrels have curves."

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:02.829
Uh...

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.964
But clearly these chubsters
don't know

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:06.699
what global warming is,
so, comedians,

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:08.234
I'm gonna show you
some squirrel fatties

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.503
and then you're gonna help them
explain to their wives

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:12.572
why they're packing
on the pounds, all right?

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.575
-First one, this little hairy
and homely guy. -(bell dings)

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.510
-Whitney Cummings.
-GUBLER: That's cute.

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:20.513
I'm sorry, honey. I just love
having nuts in my mouth.

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:22.048
All right, points.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.383
Next one, hey,
help this chunky guy out.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.385
-(bell dings) -Help this
chunky guy out. Nick Swardson.

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:29.322
Sorry, I wanted to be a squirrel
for Halloween.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.656
Sincerely, Chris Christie.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.392
Oh, (bleep). Points.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.728
-Next up, uh, Nick.
-(bell dings)

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.898
I'm hotboxing, man.
It's hibernation.

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:40.166
All right, points.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.135
Points.

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:48.474
Next up, this chipper mechanic.

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:50.877
-(bell dings)
-This chipper mechanic. Whitney.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.678
If you don't like me
at my worst,

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:54.080
you don't deserve me at my best.

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:56.849
Yes. All right.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.852
-Finally, this-this gluttonous
grey gobbler. -(bell dings)

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:00.987
Gray Gubler.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.456
Perfect. Thank you.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.525
I eat because I'm sad,

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.660
and I'm... and I'm sad

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:10.396
because I just ate
my entire (bleep) family.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.229
Yeah, all right. Points.
Points to Matthew.
