00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.930
Problem number 32.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.160
A scale drawing of a horse
is shown below.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.460
That's the horse.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.490
I'm probably not helping
you much at this point.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.340
What is the actual height of the
horse in inches, from the

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.590
hoof to the top of the head?

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.170
Well, they made a little
scale for us.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.080
This distance right
here is 8 inches.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.720
And then they measure this
scale multiple times.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.660
So how many times are we
going this distance?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.280
We go 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.990
So the horse is 9 times this
distance, which is 8 inches.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.700
Which is equal to 72 inches.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.150
So that's how tall the
horse is in reality.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.870
Which is what?

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.250
It's like 6 feet tall.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.540
33.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.690
A shipping company has 25
offices that shipped 60,000

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.000
packages last week.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.830
The offices were open 6 days and
used 80,000 kilowatt-hours

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.910
of electricity.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.440
Which pieces of information
given above are necessary to

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.850
find the average number
of packages shipped

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.510
per day last week?

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.360
So let's think about it.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.040
They didn't ask us anything
about electricity.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.870
So we definitely don't need
that information.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.640
And they're saying the average
number of packages shipped per

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.460
day last week.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.590
They're not saying per day
per office last week.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.260
So we don't need to know
how many offices.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.440
We just need to know that 60,000
packages were shipped

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.950
last week, and the offices
were open 6 days.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.840
So they operated for 6 days.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690
So we could figure
out the answer.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.170
The answer is obviously
10,000.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.100
But they're not asking
us that.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.120
They're asking us, what
information do we need?

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.000
We need the total number of
packages shipped last week,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.490
and we need the number of days
that the office was open.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.460
So what choices are that?

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.280
The number of offices-- no, we
don't need the number of

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.260
offices, because they didn't
ask us per office.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.070
The number of packages and the
amount of electricity?

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.240
No.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.970
This has nothing to do
with electricity.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.270
The number of packages and
the number of days

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.100
open during the week?

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.970
Yeah, that's what we used.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.780
The number of packages and
the number of days

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.970
open during the week.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.850
The number of days open during
the week and the amount of

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.330
electricity?

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.760
No, this had nothing to do
with the electricity.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.370
So our choice is C.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.600
Problem 34.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.790
A landscaper estimates that
landscaping a new park will

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.280
take 1 person 48 hours.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.730
If 4 people work on the job,
and they each work 6-hour

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.430
days, how many days are needed
to complete the job?

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.745
If 1 person takes 48 hours,
4 people are going

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:46.630
to take 1/4 as long.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:55.070
So 48 divided by 4 is going
to be equal to 12 hours.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.990
If 4 people are each working
12 hours, that's the same

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.900
thing as 1 person working 48
hours, assuming that you could

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.730
divide the job up in that way.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.960
So these 4 people are going to
take 12 hours, all working

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.560
simultaneously, and they each
worked 6-hour days.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.300
So they're going to work a total
of 12 hours, because

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.130
there's 4 of them, so they can
take 1/4 of the time, but they

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.520
can only do 6 hours per day.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.070
So it's going to take them 2
days to work their 12 hours.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.600
It's going to take 2 days
to complete the job.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.250
And that's all we have
on that page.
