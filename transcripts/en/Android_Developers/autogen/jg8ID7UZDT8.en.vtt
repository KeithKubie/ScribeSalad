little later about how to make that

00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839
little later about how to make that
 

00:14:44.839 --> 00:14:46.600
little later about how to make that
easier but let's remember that this is

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:46.610
easier but let's remember that this is
 

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.280
easier but let's remember that this is
not the way to go if you want your users

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.290
not the way to go if you want your users
 

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:53.410
not the way to go if you want your users
to stay engaged tell me so that's not so

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:53.420
to stay engaged tell me so that's not so
 

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.639
to stay engaged tell me so that's not so
what we've got here out on the front

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:54.649
what we've got here out on the front
 

00:14:54.649 --> 00:14:56.559
what we've got here out on the front
page is against our this dashboard

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:56.569
page is against our this dashboard
 

00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:58.900
page is against our this dashboard
pattern that you can see this it seems

00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:58.910
pattern that you can see this it seems
 

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.460
pattern that you can see this it seems
like an odd fit for this up well it's

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:00.470
like an odd fit for this up well it's
 

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.689
like an odd fit for this up well it's
kind of cool because you get this you

00:15:01.689 --> 00:15:01.699
kind of cool because you get this you
 

00:15:01.699 --> 00:15:03.579
kind of cool because you get this you
know a little like moving background

00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:03.589
know a little like moving background
 

00:15:03.589 --> 00:15:06.550
know a little like moving background
behind there it's it's pretty but it's a

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560
behind there it's it's pretty but it's a
 

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.199
behind there it's it's pretty but it's a
complete waste of space and it's a waste

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:08.209
complete waste of space and it's a waste
 

00:15:08.209 --> 00:15:10.689
complete waste of space and it's a waste
of my time if I want to categorize my

00:15:10.689 --> 00:15:10.699
of my time if I want to categorize my
 

00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:13.629
of my time if I want to categorize my
list that's great but I'm not really

00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:13.639
list that's great but I'm not really
 

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:16.090
list that's great but I'm not really
sure that these three categories are the

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:16.100
sure that these three categories are the
 

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.300
sure that these three categories are the
way that I would do it even if it were I

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:19.310
way that I would do it even if it were I
 

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.460
way that I would do it even if it were I
think I'd prefer to swipe between them

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:21.470
think I'd prefer to swipe between them
 

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.230
think I'd prefer to swipe between them
or have some other way of choosing them

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240
or have some other way of choosing them
 

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.639
or have some other way of choosing them
rather than that desk or even though the

00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:24.649
rather than that desk or even though the
 

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:26.019
rather than that desk or even though the
dashboard is pretty and as you can see

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:26.029
dashboard is pretty and as you can see
 

00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:27.160
dashboard is pretty and as you can see
as we're going through each of these

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:27.170
as we're going through each of these
 

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.689
as we're going through each of these
lists they look identical they just have

00:15:28.689 --> 00:15:28.699
lists they look identical they just have
 

00:15:28.699 --> 00:15:30.249
lists they look identical they just have
a different heading and so I really just

00:15:30.249 --> 00:15:30.259
a different heading and so I really just
 

00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:31.809
a different heading and so I really just
want to be able to click this and choose

00:15:31.809 --> 00:15:31.819
want to be able to click this and choose
 

00:15:31.819 --> 00:15:33.999
want to be able to click this and choose
between those different lists they do

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:34.009
between those different lists they do
 

00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:35.920
between those different lists they do
behave a little differently but that's

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:35.930
behave a little differently but that's
 

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.540
behave a little differently but that's
not actually a plus so for instance

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:37.550
not actually a plus so for instance
 

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.790
not actually a plus so for instance
let's check out the shopping list if you

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:39.800
let's check out the shopping list if you
 

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.939
let's check out the shopping list if you
want to add an item you type in the name

00:15:45.939 --> 00:15:45.949
want to add an item you type in the name
 

00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:49.210
want to add an item you type in the name
of the item or you speak it because it's

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:49.220
of the item or you speak it because it's
 

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.740
of the item or you speak it because it's
got the microphone icon there that's

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:50.750
got the microphone icon there that's
 

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.860
got the microphone icon there that's
nice what happens if i add an item from

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:53.870
nice what happens if i add an item from
 

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.949
nice what happens if i add an item from
the pantry list though if I go to the

00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959
the pantry list though if I go to the
 

00:15:56.959 --> 00:16:00.400
the pantry list though if I go to the
pantry

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:00.410
 
 

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:03.040
 
I'm automatically given a list of

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:03.050
I'm automatically given a list of
 

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.379
I'm automatically given a list of
suggestions to add which is really nice

00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:05.389
suggestions to add which is really nice
 

00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:06.850
suggestions to add which is really nice
and I can still type them in which is a

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:06.860
and I can still type them in which is a
 

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.309
and I can still type them in which is a
good step but it does show me all these

00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319
good step but it does show me all these
 

00:16:09.319 --> 00:16:10.600
good step but it does show me all these
things would be really nice to have that

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:10.610
things would be really nice to have that
 

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.850
things would be really nice to have that
same functionality in both parts of yeah

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:12.860
same functionality in both parts of yeah
 

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.829
same functionality in both parts of yeah
right I mean it you feel like you know

00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:14.839
right I mean it you feel like you know
 

00:16:14.839 --> 00:16:16.540
right I mean it you feel like you know
what was going through these guys mind

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:16.550
what was going through these guys mind
 

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.490
what was going through these guys mind
in thinking oh we've got this great

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:18.500
in thinking oh we've got this great
 

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.249
in thinking oh we've got this great
functionality for the pantry and so

00:16:21.249 --> 00:16:21.259
functionality for the pantry and so
 

00:16:21.259 --> 00:16:23.379
functionality for the pantry and so
we'll split that off from the shopping

00:16:23.379 --> 00:16:23.389
we'll split that off from the shopping
 

00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:24.309
we'll split that off from the shopping
list so it has this different

00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319
list so it has this different
 

00:16:24.319 --> 00:16:26.619
list so it has this different
functionality but it turns out that that

00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:26.629
functionality but it turns out that that
 

00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:29.800
functionality but it turns out that that
functionality is useful everywhere now

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:29.810
functionality is useful everywhere now
 

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.319
functionality is useful everywhere now
the other thing that I kind of wish this

00:16:32.319 --> 00:16:32.329
the other thing that I kind of wish this
 

00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:35.139
the other thing that I kind of wish this
apt it differently is when it comes to

00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:35.149
apt it differently is when it comes to
 

00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:37.840
apt it differently is when it comes to
checking off items I mean what what are

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:37.850
checking off items I mean what what are
 

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.460
checking off items I mean what what are
the two things that you always do with

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:39.470
the two things that you always do with
 

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.189
the two things that you always do with
lists apps yeah things in you do you

00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199
lists apps yeah things in you do you
 

00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:45.819
lists apps yeah things in you do you
check them off has done exactly if and

00:16:45.819 --> 00:16:45.829
check them off has done exactly if and
 

00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:48.280
check them off has done exactly if and
this I think probably just a rule of

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:48.290
this I think probably just a rule of
 

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.499
this I think probably just a rule of
thumb that we can say for certain but no

00:16:50.499 --> 00:16:50.509
thumb that we can say for certain but no
 

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:52.749
thumb that we can say for certain but no
Roman Nurik should probably weigh in on

00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759
Roman Nurik should probably weigh in on
 

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:55.660
Roman Nurik should probably weigh in on
this but here's what I think if the two

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:55.670
this but here's what I think if the two
 

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.379
this but here's what I think if the two
most common behaviors in your entire app

00:16:58.379 --> 00:16:58.389
most common behaviors in your entire app
 

00:16:58.389 --> 00:17:03.309
most common behaviors in your entire app
can't be accomplished without I double

00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319
can't be accomplished without I double
 

00:17:03.319 --> 00:17:05.500
can't be accomplished without I double
tapping or long pressing there's

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:05.510
tapping or long pressing there's
 

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.929
tapping or long pressing there's
something wrong with your UI design so

00:17:07.929 --> 00:17:07.939
something wrong with your UI design so
 

00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:09.370
something wrong with your UI design so
how am I going to check out an item

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:09.380
how am I going to check out an item
 

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.130
how am I going to check out an item
there so click the item and I can click

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:12.140
there so click the item and I can click
 

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.380
there so click the item and I can click
done so that that was right so if you if

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:14.390
done so that that was right so if you if
 

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:15.579
done so that that was right so if you if
you just single click you're going to

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:15.589
you just single click you're going to
 

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:18.010
you just single click you're going to
see that that toolbar come up and that's

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:18.020
see that that toolbar come up and that's
 

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.350
see that that toolbar come up and that's
great at least it's discoverable but why

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360
great at least it's discoverable but why
 

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.059
great at least it's discoverable but why
isn't there a checkbox just next to the

00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:22.069
isn't there a checkbox just next to the
 

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.370
isn't there a checkbox just next to the
item exactly in fact if I long press

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:24.380
item exactly in fact if I long press
 

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.140
item exactly in fact if I long press
which isn't particularly discoverable it

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:26.150
which isn't particularly discoverable it
 

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.059
which isn't particularly discoverable it
does the it does the done but what I

00:17:28.059 --> 00:17:28.069
does the it does the done but what I
 

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.890
does the it does the done but what I
really expect us to do is when I do a

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:29.900
really expect us to do is when I do a
 

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.659
really expect us to do is when I do a
long press to get a contextual action

00:17:31.659 --> 00:17:31.669
long press to get a contextual action
 

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:33.520
long press to get a contextual action

for actual bar would be a really nice

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:41.900
for actual bar would be a really nice

things about now we talked a lot about

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.150
things about now we talked a lot about
 

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.940
things about now we talked a lot about
apps where it seems like the developer

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:45.950
apps where it seems like the developer
 

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.899

ran out of time and to me this is the

00:17:49.899 --> 00:17:49.909
ran out of time and to me this is the
 

00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:52.840
ran out of time and to me this is the
this is the evidence I almost have to do

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:52.850
this is the evidence I almost have to do
 

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.279
this is the evidence I almost have to do
list of stuff that we need to figure out

00:17:54.279 --> 00:17:54.289
list of stuff that we need to figure out
 

00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:56.380
list of stuff that we need to figure out
how it works in E in the UI probably

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:56.390
how it works in E in the UI probably
 

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.390
how it works in E in the UI probably
right there's a gargantuan list of

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400
right there's a gargantuan list of
 

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.630
right there's a gargantuan list of
features that obviously exists in the

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640
features that obviously exists in the
 

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.240
features that obviously exists in the
bowels of the app but there's no UI to

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.250
bowels of the app but there's no UI to
 

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.159
bowels of the app but there's no UI to
launch them and there was very little

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:06.169
launch them and there was very little
 

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:08.350

precise sure so what you want to do is
you can actually intercept any URL to

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:28.330
you can actually intercept any URL to
 

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.580

click within an application by
 

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.860
click within an application by
registering an intent filter against the

registering an intent filter against the
 

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.409
registering an intent filter against the
activity that wants to react to it and

00:21:34.409 --> 00:21:34.419
activity that wants to react to it and
 

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:36.090
activity that wants to react to it and
so what happens then is whenever that

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:36.100
so what happens then is whenever that
 

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.769
so what happens then is whenever that
URL is clicked within a webview browser

00:21:37.769 --> 00:21:37.779
URL is clicked within a webview browser
 

00:21:37.779 --> 00:21:40.289
URL is clicked within a webview browser

is going to be included as a data
 

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.899
is going to be included as a data
parameter so if you can create an intent

00:21:48.899 --> 00:21:48.909
parameter so if you can create an intent
 

00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:51.690
parameter so if you can create an intent
filter like this one and that's you can

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:51.700
filter like this one and that's you can

point though right if the if the app is
not installed we go to Google Play if it

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320
not installed we go to Google Play if it
 

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.000
not installed we go to Google Play if it
is installed so if someone tries to

you haven't you have an idea that where

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:26.890
you haven't you have an idea that where
 

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:28.290

you can store in your database so it's

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:28.300
you can store in your database so it's
 

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.150
you can store in your database so it's
not going to change and every time you

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:30.160
not going to change and every time you
 

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.160

see that ID come from an android device

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:32.170
see that ID come from an android device
 

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.170
see that ID come from an android device
you know oh yeah that's this key in my

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:34.180
you know oh yeah that's this key in my
 

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:38.130
you know oh yeah that's this key in my
database so the way you do that in this

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:38.140
database so the way you do that in this
 

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.210

ID leftover actually but you don't need

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:49.300
ID leftover actually but you don't need
 

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.820
ID leftover actually but you don't need
to know anything about open ID to use it

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:50.830
to know anything about open ID to use it
 

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.240
to know anything about open ID to use it
all you do is specify the OAuth scope

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:54.250
all you do is specify the OAuth scope
 

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.010
all you do is specify the OAuth scope
which I actually have to do a little

things that can happen at this point you
 

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.760
things that can happen at this point you
either get a token or you get a response

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:20.770
either get a token or you get a response
 

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.680

to fix it because usually the reason you
 

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.060
to fix it because usually the reason you
don't have a token because the user

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:30.070
don't have a token because the user
 

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.010
don't have a token because the user
hasn't actually authorized you to look

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:32.020
hasn't actually authorized you to look
 

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.050
hasn't actually authorized you to look
at their information so if you launch

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:34.060
at their information so if you launch
 

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.240

long as the user clicks there and says
yes then you'll get a token back that

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:49.100
yes then you'll get a token back that
 

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.820
yes then you'll get a token back that
you can use to make web service calls to

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:51.830
you can use to make web service calls to
 

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:55.870
you can use to make web service calls to
this API now if you like me the first

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880
this API now if you like me the first
 

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.029
this API now if you like me the first
time you get into calling web services

00:28:58.029 --> 00:28:58.039
time you get into calling web services
 

00:28:58.039 --> 00:29:00.240
time you get into calling web services
it feels a little tricky yeah

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:00.250
it feels a little tricky yeah
 

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:04.480
it feels a little tricky yeah
fortunately with this API it couldn't be

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:04.490
fortunately with this API it couldn't be
 

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:05.919
fortunately with this API it couldn't be
easier let's take a look at the next

00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:05.929
easier let's take a look at the next
 

00:29:05.929 --> 00:29:08.890
easier let's take a look at the next
piece of code all you do is get a URL

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:08.900
piece of code all you do is get a URL
 

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:15.149
piece of code all you do is get a URL
connection and set up the particular URL

00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159
connection and set up the particular URL
 

00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:19.600
connection and set up the particular URL
with the token that you were given so

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:19.610
with the token that you were given so
 

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.640
with the token that you were given so
that's all you need to do it's a one

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:21.650
that's all you need to do it's a one
 

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.149
that's all you need to do it's a one
call thing and the response you get back

00:29:25.149 --> 00:29:25.159
call thing and the response you get back
 

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:28.060
call thing and the response you get back
we'll actually contain the users profile

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:28.070
we'll actually contain the users profile
 

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.240
we'll actually contain the users profile
data it's a JSON format and we can take

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:31.250
data it's a JSON format and we can take
 

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:38.110
data it's a JSON format and we can take
a look at that right now oh so this is

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120
a look at that right now oh so this is
 

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.970
a look at that right now oh so this is
an example of what you get back if you

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:39.980
an example of what you get back if you
 

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.980
an example of what you get back if you
query my profile data for instance you

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:41.990
query my profile data for instance you
 

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:45.220
query my profile data for instance you
get my my name or at least what I told

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:45.230
get my my name or at least what I told
 

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:50.049
get my my name or at least what I told
google my name is and you've got a date

00:29:50.049 --> 00:29:50.059
google my name is and you've got a date
 

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:52.240
google my name is and you've got a date
of birth but no year huh no email

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:52.250
of birth but no year huh no email
 

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.310
of birth but no year huh no email
address no way to contact made people

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320
address no way to contact made people
 

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.440
address no way to contact made people
have their ad a year of birth sort of

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:56.450
have their ad a year of birth sort of
 

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.630
have their ad a year of birth sort of
tied to their email address it could be

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640
tied to their email address it could be
 

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.039
tied to their email address it could be
tricky if you go I have you gave that

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:00.049
tricky if you go I have you gave that
 

00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:04.090
tricky if you go I have you gave that
access ah that's quite possible or it

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:04.100
access ah that's quite possible or it
 

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.649
access ah that's quite possible or it
could just be the year of a very

00:30:05.649 --> 00:30:05.659
could just be the year of a very
 

00:30:05.659 --> 00:30:07.149
could just be the year of a very
pleasant scotch that you drank once

00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159
pleasant scotch that you drank once
 

00:30:07.159 --> 00:30:09.940
pleasant scotch that you drank once
that's quite possible indeed the

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:09.950
that's quite possible indeed the
 

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.580
that's quite possible indeed the
important thing here is is you're

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:12.590
important thing here is is you're
 

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.470
important thing here is is you're
getting enough information to be able to

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480
getting enough information to be able to
 

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.120
getting enough information to be able to
identify this person when they come back

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:16.130
identify this person when they come back
 

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.730
identify this person when they come back
so there's some you get the first name

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:18.740
so there's some you get the first name
 

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.140
so there's some you get the first name
last name so you can actually refer to

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.150
last name so you can actually refer to
 

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.289
last name so you can actually refer to
them by name people love that but more

00:30:23.289 --> 00:30:23.299
them by name people love that but more
 

00:30:23.299 --> 00:30:25.060
them by name people love that but more
importantly you get an ID this is

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:25.070
importantly you get an ID this is
 

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.230
importantly you get an ID this is
actually their Google+ ID which is tied

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240
actually their Google+ ID which is tied
 

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.919
actually their Google+ ID which is tied
to that user and won't change the way an

00:30:32.919 --> 00:30:32.929
to that user and won't change the way an
 

00:30:32.929 --> 00:30:36.310
to that user and won't change the way an
email address might or the the way a

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320
email address might or the the way a
 

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.620
email address might or the the way a
name might in fact absolutely absolutely

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:38.630
name might in fact absolutely absolutely
 

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:42.190
name might in fact absolutely absolutely
that's really nice so don't don't make

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200
that's really nice so don't don't make
 

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.870
that's really nice so don't don't make
your users type in email addresses and

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:43.880
your users type in email addresses and
 

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.430
your users type in email addresses and
passwords anymore this is a

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440
passwords anymore this is a
 

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.380
passwords anymore this is a
click-through interface that does the

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:47.390
click-through interface that does the
 

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.870
click-through interface that does the
exact same thing and unlike the web view

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880
exact same thing and unlike the web view
 

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.560
exact same thing and unlike the web view
that we saw earlier it's secure

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:51.570
that we saw earlier it's secure
 

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.660
that we saw earlier it's secure
which is a nice touch indeed all right

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:53.670
which is a nice touch indeed all right
 

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:55.190
which is a nice touch indeed all right
so to move on let's move on let's have a

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200
so to move on let's move on let's have a
 

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.050
so to move on let's move on let's have a
look at the the next app that we wanted

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:57.060
look at the the next app that we wanted
 

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:02.450
look at the the next app that we wanted
to check out is a grocery IQ look my

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:02.460
to check out is a grocery IQ look my
 

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.300
to check out is a grocery IQ look my

for everything this is enough let's take
 

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:11.150
for everything this is enough let's take
a look it's so this this is an app that

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:11.160
a look it's so this this is an app that
 

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.400
a look it's so this this is an app that
I quite like grocery IQ is probably my

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:13.410
I quite like grocery IQ is probably my
 

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.630
I quite like grocery IQ is probably my
favorite of the apps that we look at

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640
favorite of the apps that we look at
 

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.920
favorite of the apps that we look at
today and you can tell that the

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:15.930
today and you can tell that the
 

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.900
today and you can tell that the
developers behind this app have really

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:17.910
developers behind this app have really
 

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:19.580
developers behind this app have really
spent a lot of time and effort trying to

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:19.590
spent a lot of time and effort trying to
 

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.110
spent a lot of time and effort trying to
create something that is fully featured

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120
create something that is fully featured
 

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.500

already yeah and unfortunately we can't

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:08.970
already yeah and unfortunately we can't
 

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.230
already yeah and unfortunately we can't
show this but it actually does have

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240
show this but it actually does have
 

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.580
show this but it actually does have
pictures that would actually be sitting

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:13.590
pictures that would actually be sitting
 

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:17.270

right-to-left sliding animation when you
 

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.000

move from a list item to a detail but

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.010
move from a list item to a detail but
 

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.070
move from a list item to a detail but
that's not what Android does it has a

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:51.080
that's not what Android does it has a
 

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.920
that's not what Android does it has a
zoom animation yeah and like a funky

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:53.930
zoom animation yeah and like a funky
 

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.760
zoom animation yeah and like a funky
kind of vortex zoom icon raid but we

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:57.770
kind of vortex zoom icon raid but we
 

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.650
kind of vortex zoom icon raid but we
would do that because we're not insane

00:35:59.650 --> 00:35:59.660
would do that because we're not insane
 

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.630
would do that because we're not insane
yeah particularly because and this is

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640
yeah particularly because and this is
 

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.650
yeah particularly because and this is
the important thing is that the

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:02.660
the important thing is that the
 

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.330
the important thing is that the
animation between activities isn't

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:04.340
animation between activities isn't
 

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.790
animation between activities isn't
guaranteed and it can be changed by OEMs

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800
guaranteed and it can be changed by OEMs
 

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.290
guaranteed and it can be changed by OEMs
by different platform versions and so

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:08.300
by different platform versions and so
 

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.550
by different platform versions and so
you don't want to make any assumptions

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560
you don't want to make any assumptions
 

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.500
you don't want to make any assumptions
as to what screen animation is going to

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:11.510
as to what screen animation is going to
 

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:12.700
as to what screen animation is going to

is that if you click on a list item it

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:21.530
is that if you click on a list item it
 

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.260
is that if you click on a list item it
will take you to the details for that

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:23.270
will take you to the details for that
 

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:25.630
will take you to the details for that
list item precisely that is just an

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640
list item precisely that is just an
 

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.340
list item precisely that is just an
expected behavior so there's no point in

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:27.350
expected behavior so there's no point in
 

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.740
expected behavior so there's no point in
putting a chevron here but you could

putting a chevron here but you could
 

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.450
putting a chevron here but you could
certainly fill that space with something

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:31.460

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:08.870
be performing a design makeover on
grocery IQ next Tuesday so it will be

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880
grocery IQ next Tuesday so it will be
 

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.950
grocery IQ next Tuesday so it will be
interesting to see what

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960
interesting to see what
 

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.430
interesting to see what
and stay tuned by the way we don't have

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440
and stay tuned by the way we don't have
 

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.180
and stay tuned by the way we don't have
a time yet for this but sometime in the

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:17.190
a time yet for this but sometime in the
 

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.670
a time yet for this but sometime in the
next couple weeks we are going to do an

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680
next couple weeks we are going to do an
 

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.900
next couple weeks we are going to do an
interview with the design team and they

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:20.910
interview with the design team and they
 

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:22.940
interview with the design team and they
are going to explain the whole menu

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:22.950
are going to explain the whole menu
 

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.010
are going to explain the whole menu
button issue and we are going to get set

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020
button issue and we are going to get set
 

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.470
button issue and we are going to get set
straight so yeah that should be

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480
straight so yeah that should be
 

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.349
straight so yeah that should be
interesting stay tuned for that right so

00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359
interesting stay tuned for that right so
 

00:39:30.359 --> 00:39:32.150
interesting stay tuned for that right so
there's a couple of specific technical

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160
there's a couple of specific technical
 

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.250
there's a couple of specific technical
implementation details which I wanted to

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.260
implementation details which I wanted to
 

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.230
implementation details which I wanted to
cover as well so these are things that

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240
cover as well so these are things that
 

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.890
cover as well so these are things that
grocery IQ does well well could do

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:39.900
grocery IQ does well well could do
 

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.540
grocery IQ does well well could do
better and again i think in both of the

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:41.550
better and again i think in both of the
 

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.339
better and again i think in both of the
cases here at stuff which is probably

00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:43.349
cases here at stuff which is probably
 

00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:45.109
cases here at stuff which is probably
post dates when this app was built so

00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119
post dates when this app was built so
 

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:46.280
post dates when this app was built so
hopefully the stuff that we can point

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:46.290
hopefully the stuff that we can point
 

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:48.230
hopefully the stuff that we can point
out to the developers and they can

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240
out to the developers and they can
 

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.089
out to the developers and they can
implement as well absolutely that little

00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099
implement as well absolutely that little
 

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:53.599
implement as well absolutely that little
bit neater so the first is around the

00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:53.609
bit neater so the first is around the
 

00:39:53.609 --> 00:39:56.930
bit neater so the first is around the
way that the app sends updates okay

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940
way that the app sends updates okay
 

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.940
way that the app sends updates okay
right now there is a menu option that

00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:58.950
right now there is a menu option that
 

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.160
right now there is a menu option that
you can select to say how often you want

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:01.170
you can select to say how often you want
 

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:04.490
you can select to say how often you want
it to pull the service to check pull the

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500
it to pull the service to check pull the
 

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.250
it to pull the service to check pull the
servers ya seen the problem right there

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.260
servers ya seen the problem right there
 

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.290
servers ya seen the problem right there
right yeah yeah hey nineteen eighty-five

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300
right yeah yeah hey nineteen eighty-five
 

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.720
right yeah yeah hey nineteen eighty-five
called they want their data update

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:11.730
called they want their data update
 

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.990
called they want their data update
method back so and the bad news is the

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000
method back so and the bad news is the
 

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.760
method back so and the bad news is the
highest number you can see is five

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:16.770
highest number you can see is five
 

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.589
highest number you can see is five
minutes which kind of makes sense

00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599
minutes which kind of makes sense
 

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:20.270
minutes which kind of makes sense
because I want my shopping list to be

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280
because I want my shopping list to be
 

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.660
because I want my shopping list to be
bang up to date but I really don't know

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:23.670
bang up to date but I really don't know
 

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.400
bang up to date but I really don't know
that I want my phone firing up the cell

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:25.410
that I want my phone firing up the cell
 

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:27.440
that I want my phone firing up the cell
network and transferring data back and

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:27.450
network and transferring data back and
 

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.420
network and transferring data back and
forth between the server there's got to

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:29.430
forth between the server there's got to
 

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:31.070
forth between the server there's got to
be a better way it has to be an in fact

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:31.080
be a better way it has to be an in fact
 

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.420
be a better way it has to be an in fact
it is a better way and that's Google

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:32.430
it is a better way and that's Google
 

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.510
it is a better way and that's Google
Cloud messaging and that's what I'm

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520
Cloud messaging and that's what I'm
 

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.700
Cloud messaging and that's what I'm
going to attempt to display on the

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:37.710
going to attempt to display on the
 

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:41.240
going to attempt to display on the
screen behind me I see start off with

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:41.250
screen behind me I see start off with
 

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:43.670
screen behind me I see start off with
your app that's running on each of the

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680
your app that's running on each of the
 

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.410
your app that's running on each of the
users phones so that's what we're

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420
users phones so that's what we're
 

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.500
users phones so that's what we're
looking at up here now what you need to

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:48.510
looking at up here now what you need to
 

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:51.050
looking at up here now what you need to
do first is register the phone with the

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:51.060
do first is register the phone with the
 

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.650
do first is register the phone with the
Google Cloud messaging server and that's

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660
Google Cloud messaging server and that's
 

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.780
Google Cloud messaging server and that's
going to uniquely identify this device

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:56.790
going to uniquely identify this device
 

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:59.589
going to uniquely identify this device
with a particular user on it with Google

00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599
with a particular user on it with Google
 

00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:02.270
with a particular user on it with Google
that's then going to send a message back

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280
that's then going to send a message back
 

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.490
that's then going to send a message back
up to the device i'm going to start

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:04.500
up to the device i'm going to start
 

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.960
up to the device i'm going to start
pointing because clearly i'm bad at this

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:05.970
pointing because clearly i'm bad at this
 

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.210
pointing because clearly i'm bad at this
weather presenter not in my future ah

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220
weather presenter not in my future ah
 

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.300
weather presenter not in my future ah
but so what you now have on each of the

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:11.310
but so what you now have on each of the
 

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.720
but so what you now have on each of the
devices is a

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:13.730
devices is a
 

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:16.180
devices is a
unique address which you can then use

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:16.190
unique address which you can then use
 

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:18.250
unique address which you can then use
from your server via google cloud

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:18.260
from your server via google cloud
 

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.230
from your server via google cloud
messaging to talk to that particular app

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240
messaging to talk to that particular app
 

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.090
messaging to talk to that particular app
so the next thing you need to do is

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:22.100
so the next thing you need to do is
 

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.640
so the next thing you need to do is
actually send that down to your server

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:24.650
actually send that down to your server
 

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.700
actually send that down to your server
and now what your server has hopefully

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:27.710
and now what your server has hopefully
 

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.580
and now what your server has hopefully
is a hash of the username or user

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:30.590
is a hash of the username or user
 

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:32.800
is a hash of the username or user
identifier that has logged into that

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:32.810
identifier that has logged into that
 

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:35.700
identifier that has logged into that
particular phone and that phone combined

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:35.710
particular phone and that phone combined
 

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.960
particular phone and that phone combined
and now you have an address that you can

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:37.970
and now you have an address that you can
 

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.260
and now you have an address that you can
send messages using so you're basically

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:41.270
send messages using so you're basically
 

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.210
send messages using so you're basically
all set to go so what happens now is a

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:43.220
all set to go so what happens now is a
 

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.849
all set to go so what happens now is a
user using their tablet at home makes a

00:41:45.849 --> 00:41:45.859
user using their tablet at home makes a
 

00:41:45.859 --> 00:41:48.040
user using their tablet at home makes a
change to a shopping list you send that

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:48.050
change to a shopping list you send that
 

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.470
change to a shopping list you send that
down to your server your server goes oh

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480
down to your server your server goes oh
 

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.109
down to your server your server goes oh
okay yep updated the lists now I need

00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119
okay yep updated the lists now I need
 

00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:55.780
okay yep updated the lists now I need
everyone to who has access to the shared

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:55.790
everyone to who has access to the shared
 

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:58.240
everyone to who has access to the shared
list to see what the changes are so it

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:58.250
list to see what the changes are so it
 

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.180
list to see what the changes are so it
is now going to send a message to the

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:01.190
is now going to send a message to the
 

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.030
is now going to send a message to the
google cloud messaging to each of those

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040
google cloud messaging to each of those
 

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.430
google cloud messaging to each of those
apps using the addresses which you've

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440
apps using the addresses which you've
 

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.560
apps using the addresses which you've
got registered with it Google Cloud

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:08.570
got registered with it Google Cloud
 

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.120
got registered with it Google Cloud
messaging is then going to send that to

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:10.130
messaging is then going to send that to
 

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:11.890
messaging is then going to send that to
each of the devices which are going to

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:11.900
each of the devices which are going to
 

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.320
each of the devices which are going to
get pinged using 10th receiver they're

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:14.330
get pinged using 10th receiver they're
 

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:17.560
get pinged using 10th receiver they're
going to go oh okay look I have changes

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:17.570
going to go oh okay look I have changes
 

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.510
going to go oh okay look I have changes
to this so they then have the option to

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520
to this so they then have the option to
 

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.430
to this so they then have the option to
ping the server and ask for those

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440
ping the server and ask for those
 

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.870
ping the server and ask for those
specific updates or if it's small enough

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880
specific updates or if it's small enough
 

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.820
specific updates or if it's small enough
change you can actually package it in

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:24.830
change you can actually package it in
 

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.650
change you can actually package it in
the payload of the message that you're

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:26.660
the payload of the message that you're
 

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:31.120
the payload of the message that you're
going to send look Ian's in the cloud so

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:31.130
going to send look Ian's in the cloud so
 

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:32.560
going to send look Ian's in the cloud so
that's basically how it works and so you

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:32.570
that's basically how it works and so you
 

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.000
that's basically how it works and so you
don't ever have to do pauling you're

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:34.010
don't ever have to do pauling you're
 

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:35.710
don't ever have to do pauling you're
basically just updating the server and

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720
basically just updating the server and
 

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.859
basically just updating the server and
the server is directly transmitting that

00:42:38.859 --> 00:42:38.869
the server is directly transmitting that
 

00:42:38.869 --> 00:42:41.260
the server is directly transmitting that
information to each of the devices which

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:41.270
information to each of the devices which
 

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:46.930
information to each of the devices which
need to be updated yay okay so that's a

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:46.940
need to be updated yay okay so that's a
 

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.060
need to be updated yay okay so that's a
that's a great tip and something that

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:49.070
that's a great tip and something that
 

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:50.710
that's a great tip and something that
you should really check into is that

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720
you should really check into is that
 

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.050
you should really check into is that
really cost you anything yeah all rights

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:53.060
really cost you anything yeah all rights
 

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.060
really cost you anything yeah all rights
it's entirely cost-free that it does

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:55.070
it's entirely cost-free that it does
 

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:57.609
it's entirely cost-free that it does
save your device your users devices a

00:42:57.609 --> 00:42:57.619
save your device your users devices a
 

00:42:57.619 --> 00:42:59.920
save your device your users devices a
lot of battery life and actually means

00:42:59.920 --> 00:42:59.930
lot of battery life and actually means
 

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:01.750
lot of battery life and actually means
that their latency between changes is

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760
that their latency between changes is
 

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.250
that their latency between changes is
reduced as well so it's how do we went

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:03.260
reduced as well so it's how do we went
 

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.040
reduced as well so it's how do we went
exactly no of course this isn't magic I

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:06.050
exactly no of course this isn't magic I
 

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.050
exactly no of course this isn't magic I
mean it's not like we're you know we

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:08.060
mean it's not like we're you know we
 

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.510
mean it's not like we're you know we
don't have a way to just phone up that

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:10.520
don't have a way to just phone up that
 

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.550
don't have a way to just phone up that
device there still is polling involved

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560
device there still is polling involved
 

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.660
device there still is polling involved
but the important thing is that all of

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:16.670
but the important thing is that all of
 

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.560
but the important thing is that all of
the messages are set in one batch

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:19.570
the messages are set in one batch
 

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.359
the messages are set in one batch
instead of each app making its own

00:43:22.359 --> 00:43:22.369
instead of each app making its own
 

00:43:22.369 --> 00:43:24.400
instead of each app making its own
network connection and possibly screwing

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:24.410
network connection and possibly screwing
 

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.620
network connection and possibly screwing
up the network connection using not only

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:26.630
up the network connection using not only
 

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:30.279
up the network connection using not only
the bandwidth but battery and CPU time

00:43:30.279 --> 00:43:30.289
the bandwidth but battery and CPU time
 

00:43:30.289 --> 00:43:33.249
the bandwidth but battery and CPU time
as well exactly okay so there was

00:43:33.249 --> 00:43:33.259
as well exactly okay so there was
 

00:43:33.259 --> 00:43:34.420
as well exactly okay so there was
another tip as well which I wanted to

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:34.430
another tip as well which I wanted to
 

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.839
another tip as well which I wanted to
point out and that is about how to share

00:43:37.839 --> 00:43:37.849
point out and that is about how to share
 

00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:39.490
point out and that is about how to share
those contact with so at the moment you

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:39.500
those contact with so at the moment you
 

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.710
those contact with so at the moment you
hit share this list and it will pop up a

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:41.720
hit share this list and it will pop up a
 

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.930
hit share this list and it will pop up a
dialog asking for an email address which

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:43.940
dialog asking for an email address which
 

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.420
dialog asking for an email address which
is reasonable but I don't memorize email

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:46.430
is reasonable but I don't memorize email
 

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:48.880
is reasonable but I don't memorize email
address no I don't remember as anything

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:48.890
address no I don't remember as anything
 

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:50.950
address no I don't remember as anything
phone numbers email I don't because it's

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960
phone numbers email I don't because it's
 

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.960
phone numbers email I don't because it's
all in my gmail or my google plus and

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:52.970
all in my gmail or my google plus and
 

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:55.569
all in my gmail or my google plus and
all that seek to my phone so every way I

00:43:55.569 --> 00:43:55.579
all that seek to my phone so every way I
 

00:43:55.579 --> 00:43:57.160
all that seek to my phone so every way I
have to contact with someone is already

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:57.170
have to contact with someone is already
 

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.380
have to contact with someone is already
in the phone so I kind of resent having

00:43:59.380 --> 00:43:59.390
in the phone so I kind of resent having
 

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:01.180
in the phone so I kind of resent having
to type something that already exists

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:01.190
to type something that already exists
 

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.519
to type something that already exists
yeah so rather than asking users to copy

00:44:03.519 --> 00:44:03.529
yeah so rather than asking users to copy
 

00:44:03.529 --> 00:44:05.349
yeah so rather than asking users to copy
and paste email addresses you can use

00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359
and paste email addresses you can use
 

00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:07.210
and paste email addresses you can use
the contact picker so they can choose a

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:07.220
the contact picker so they can choose a
 

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.339
the contact picker so they can choose a
contact from the existing contact list

00:44:09.339 --> 00:44:09.349
contact from the existing contact list
 

00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:11.230
contact from the existing contact list
and the way that works is actually

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240
and the way that works is actually
 

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.460
and the way that works is actually
pretty straightforward you start by

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:12.470
pretty straightforward you start by
 

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:14.799
pretty straightforward you start by
creating an intent again a lot of things

00:44:14.799 --> 00:44:14.809
creating an intent again a lot of things
 

00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:16.900
creating an intent again a lot of things
tend to work with intense and this time

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:16.910
tend to work with intense and this time
 

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:18.999
tend to work with intense and this time
the action is pick and the cop then the

00:44:18.999 --> 00:44:19.009
the action is pick and the cop then the
 

00:44:19.009 --> 00:44:20.680
the action is pick and the cop then the
data that you want to pick from his

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:20.690
data that you want to pick from his
 

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:24.009
data that you want to pick from his
contacts or to put it more specifically

00:44:24.009 --> 00:44:24.019
contacts or to put it more specifically
 

00:44:24.019 --> 00:44:26.559
contacts or to put it more specifically
if slightly less clearly the contacts

00:44:26.559 --> 00:44:26.569
if slightly less clearly the contacts
 

00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:29.650
if slightly less clearly the contacts
contracts content provider well I love

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:29.660
contracts content provider well I love
 

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.289
contracts content provider well I love
them yeah these things are actually just

00:44:32.289 --> 00:44:32.299
them yeah these things are actually just
 

00:44:32.299 --> 00:44:34.210
them yeah these things are actually just
made to be tongue twisters as Italy we

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:34.220
made to be tongue twisters as Italy we
 

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.069
made to be tongue twisters as Italy we
love the alliteration here at Android so

00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079
love the alliteration here at Android so
 

00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:38.230
love the alliteration here at Android so
it will be a lot of aid words as much as

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240
it will be a lot of aid words as much as
 

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.079
it will be a lot of aid words as much as
we can anyway so you say that that

00:44:41.079 --> 00:44:41.089
we can anyway so you say that that
 

00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:42.609
we can anyway so you say that that
intense start an activity full results

00:44:42.609 --> 00:44:42.619
intense start an activity full results
 

00:44:42.619 --> 00:44:44.680
intense start an activity full results
oh that's going to then open up contacts

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:44.690
oh that's going to then open up contacts
 

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.390
oh that's going to then open up contacts
picker users going to click on something

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400
picker users going to click on something
 

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.190
picker users going to click on something
and it's going to send you back a you

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200
and it's going to send you back a you
 

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.940
and it's going to send you back a you
are I and what this massive screen full

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:51.950
are I and what this massive screen full
 

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:53.499
are I and what this massive screen full
of code does is actually pretty

00:44:53.499 --> 00:44:53.509
of code does is actually pretty
 

00:44:53.509 --> 00:44:56.019
of code does is actually pretty
straightforward we get a URI to a

00:44:56.019 --> 00:44:56.029
straightforward we get a URI to a
 

00:44:56.029 --> 00:44:58.749
straightforward we get a URI to a
particular contact back from the contact

00:44:58.749 --> 00:44:58.759
particular contact back from the contact
 

00:44:58.759 --> 00:45:00.999
particular contact back from the contact
picker we're going to extract that ID by

00:45:00.999 --> 00:45:01.009
picker we're going to extract that ID by
 

00:45:01.009 --> 00:45:03.309
picker we're going to extract that ID by
using a query on on the content provider

00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319
using a query on on the content provider
 

00:45:03.319 --> 00:45:05.799
using a query on on the content provider
once we have that we're going to use

00:45:05.799 --> 00:45:05.809
once we have that we're going to use
 

00:45:05.809 --> 00:45:07.569
once we have that we're going to use
that idea then make another query this

00:45:07.569 --> 00:45:07.579
that idea then make another query this
 

00:45:07.579 --> 00:45:09.490
that idea then make another query this
time on the database or the content

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:09.500
time on the database or the content
 

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.870
time on the database or the content
provider which contains the email

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880
provider which contains the email
 

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.549
provider which contains the email
addresses so we're basically going to

00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:12.559
addresses so we're basically going to
 

00:45:12.559 --> 00:45:14.319
addresses so we're basically going to
say we have this ID what is the

00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:14.329
say we have this ID what is the
 

00:45:14.329 --> 00:45:16.660
say we have this ID what is the
associated email and that's what you see

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:16.670
associated email and that's what you see
 

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:18.579
associated email and that's what you see
here is that that last part of actually

00:45:18.579 --> 00:45:18.589
here is that that last part of actually
 

00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:20.349
here is that that last part of actually
pulling out the email address from the

00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:20.359
pulling out the email address from the
 

00:45:20.359 --> 00:45:25.029
pulling out the email address from the
the query result of that cursor so once

00:45:25.029 --> 00:45:25.039
the query result of that cursor so once
 

00:45:25.039 --> 00:45:26.259
the query result of that cursor so once
you've done that you've got the email

00:45:26.259 --> 00:45:26.269
you've done that you've got the email
 

00:45:26.269 --> 00:45:28.089
you've done that you've got the email
address it's good form to then just pop

00:45:28.089 --> 00:45:28.099
address it's good form to then just pop
 

00:45:28.099 --> 00:45:29.799
address it's good form to then just pop
that into the the editor

00:45:29.799 --> 00:45:29.809
that into the the editor
 

00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:31.299
that into the the editor
to make sure the user can confirm it

00:45:31.299 --> 00:45:31.309
to make sure the user can confirm it
 

00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:33.130
to make sure the user can confirm it
modified if necessary before you got and

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:33.140
modified if necessary before you got and
 

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:37.749
modified if necessary before you got and
send off the email cool so it's it's a

00:45:37.749 --> 00:45:37.759
send off the email cool so it's it's a
 

00:45:37.759 --> 00:45:38.949
send off the email cool so it's it's a
fairly straightforward process and I

00:45:38.949 --> 00:45:38.959
fairly straightforward process and I
 

00:45:38.959 --> 00:45:40.359
fairly straightforward process and I
think something which really makes life

00:45:40.359 --> 00:45:40.369
think something which really makes life
 

00:45:40.369 --> 00:45:41.890
think something which really makes life
a lot easier and in fact you can

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:41.900
a lot easier and in fact you can
 

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.929
a lot easier and in fact you can
possibly even go a step further here

00:45:43.929 --> 00:45:43.939
possibly even go a step further here
 

00:45:43.939 --> 00:45:46.179
possibly even go a step further here
which is well you have the email address

00:45:46.179 --> 00:45:46.189
which is well you have the email address
 

00:45:46.189 --> 00:45:47.829
which is well you have the email address
and if you're logging people in using

00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839
and if you're logging people in using
 

00:45:47.839 --> 00:45:49.689
and if you're logging people in using
their email addresses then maybe I need

00:45:49.689 --> 00:45:49.699
their email addresses then maybe I need
 

00:45:49.699 --> 00:45:51.039
their email addresses then maybe I need
to send them an email if they already

00:45:51.039 --> 00:45:51.049
to send them an email if they already
 

00:45:51.049 --> 00:45:52.509
to send them an email if they already
have an account maybe you can just send

00:45:52.509 --> 00:45:52.519
have an account maybe you can just send
 

00:45:52.519 --> 00:45:54.839
have an account maybe you can just send
a notification director define exactly

00:45:54.839 --> 00:45:54.849
a notification director define exactly
 

00:45:54.849 --> 00:45:57.039
a notification director define exactly
maybe can your boat maybe you could do

00:45:57.039 --> 00:45:57.049
maybe can your boat maybe you could do
 

00:45:57.049 --> 00:45:59.229
maybe can your boat maybe you could do
five exactly so let's have a look so

00:45:59.229 --> 00:45:59.239
five exactly so let's have a look so
 

00:45:59.239 --> 00:46:01.569
five exactly so let's have a look so
let's let's move on to the to the next

english language apps as well see what

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:35.740
english language apps as well see what
 

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.950
english language apps as well see what
happens when you translate all of your

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:37.960
happens when you translate all of your
 

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:41.339
happens when you translate all of your
apps into gibberish and see whether it's

00:51:41.339 --> 00:51:41.349
apps into gibberish and see whether it's
 

00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:42.200
apps into gibberish and see whether it's
usable

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:42.210
usable
 

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:43.849

that's a fantastic idea yeah that's a
 

00:51:43.859 --> 00:51:45.170
that's a fantastic idea yeah that's a
really good way to see how does the

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180
really good way to see how does the

three work what are the UX fuzz testing
that's likely yeah it's like well if you

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:49.080
that's likely yeah it's like well if you

don't know what the words arc and they
 

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:53.300
don't know what the words arc and they
still figure it out does what are the

flow and so you want the words to just
 

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.150
flow and so you want the words to just
back up what they intuitively feel like

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160
back up what they intuitively feel like
 

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.980
