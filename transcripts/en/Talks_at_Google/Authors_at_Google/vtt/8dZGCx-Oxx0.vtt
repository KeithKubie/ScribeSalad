LEIGH GALLAGHER: Thank
you for having us.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.770
This is really exciting.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.080
Thanks to Jacob and to Google.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.230
It's great to be here.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.390
I run our "best companies to
work for" list, among many

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.160
other things, at Fortune.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.280
And you guys are always a
stalwart, if not the winner.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.300
So it's great to be here and
see it all in action.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.820
So when people ask me-- when I
tell people I'm writing this

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.920
book, or when I was writing the
book, and I would say, oh,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.380
I'm writing a book about the
end of the suburbs--

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.580
I have a section in the book,
actually, where I talk a lot

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.549
about this, because everybody
has some kind of emotional

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.080
connection to this topic
and this argument.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.940
The argument's very clear when
I tell them what the book is

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.530
called, "The End of
the Suburbs."

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.880
And so everyone's--

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.270
I got a lot of high fives,
good for you.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.570
That's awesome.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.350
That's great.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.770
I got a lot of, I live
in the suburbs.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.110
I hate it there.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.140
I got a lot of, I live
in the suburbs but

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.520
I have to be there.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.010
Without kind of asking for
this reaction, I got a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.440
tremendous amount of
people's pent up

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.620
issues about the suburbs.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.650
And I'm not anti-suburb.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.750
I wrote this book for a number
of reasons, not because I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.150
think that the suburbs are
bad and evil, and I'm a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.300
condo-dwelling,
espresso-drinking urbanist.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.770
JESSI HEMPEL: But you are.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.020
LEIGH GALLAGHER: It's not
technically a condo.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.960
But I was shocked at the
response I got while I was

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.850
reporting this book.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.780
And towards the end--

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.630
I say this in the book--
towards the end of the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.690
process, I would be out at
cocktail parties or wherever

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.610
and small talk-- this project
would come up.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.380
And in addition to people's
opinions about it, people had

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.960
lots of questions about it.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.800
And people wanted to
engage about it.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.380
And people wanted to
talk about it.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.030
And as I approached my deadline,
I stopped bringing

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.820
it up on purpose, because I knew
that if I brought it up,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.100
it would mean I would be in
conversation for another 45

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.980
minutes when I really had to get
home and finish the book.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.970
So it struck a chord.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.260
It struck kind of
a lightning rod.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.440
But not a negative one.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.300
I was telling Jessi in the car
over, I've gotten a lot less

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.840
hate mail than I thought
I would.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.590
JESSI HEMPEL: So we're
going to get to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.190
the hate mail question.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.030
Let's back up.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.130
I mean, I don't want to presume
that we understand the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.630
thesis from the title
of your book.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.140
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Sure, yes.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.670
JESSI HEMPEL: What
are you trying to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.100
say about the suburbs?

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.570
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Well, the
thesis of the book is a little

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.740
bit more nuanced
than the title.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.040
What happened was I started
observing--

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.870
there was the very sort of
whiffs of census data had come

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.040
out that sort of had the
framework of a very big story

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.950
that I thought wasn't
being told.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.080
And the gist of the thesis is
basically that we are, as an

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.340
American people, really tired of
the suburban lifestyle for

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.190
a number of reasons.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.030
And the suburban lifestyle is
actually how most people in

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.990
this country live.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.820
That's starting to change, but
in terms of percentage, number

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.150
of homes, number of people,
we are a suburban country.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.160
So I thought, if that's true
that our sort of love affair

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.800
with the American suburbs
is peaking, that is a

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.020
very, very big deal.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.160
And that's worth exploring.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.870
So then I set out
in exploring it.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.730
So the reasons we're tiring
from it are numerous.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.860
And they're complicated.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.280
And it's not because of
the financial crisis.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.160
It's because of--

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.090
or the housing crisis.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.020
It's because of a number of
other longer-term forces.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.090
But the thesis is that people
are tiring what has been held

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.150
up as this pillar of the
iconic American dream.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.070
The thesis is not that
everyone's going to live in a

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.230
skyscraper in New York City.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.010
That's impractical.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.800
That's not the way most people
in this country want to live.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.080
So the thesis is more one of
kind of urbanism everywhere.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.750
People want to live in a place
where they can walk to get a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.400
cup of coffee.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.960
That's basically the thesis.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.300
JESSI HEMPEL: So we understand
that you're addressing a bunch

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.350
of structural issues.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.740
To really understand the shift,
let's go back to the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.260
idea of what a suburb
was supposed to be

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.250
in the first place.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.000
As a child of the '70s and '80s,
I thought until I was an

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.450
adult that suburbs were the de
facto way that people lived.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.620
But they're actually fairly
recent, right?

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.540
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Yeah,
they really--

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.980
our modern suburbs are the
product of a series of

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.810
policies and a sort of
particular perfect storm of

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.920
where we were as a country
right after World War II.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.209
So I spend a lot of time in
the book talking about the

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.620
history of how the suburbs
came to be.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.920
And it's really fascinating.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.890
And it just very much mirrors
where we were as a country.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.460
So there were suburbs--

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.350
I actually go back to
Mesopotamia in the beginning

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.240
of the book, but don't
let that sway you.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.680
We had suburbs--

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.220
our first real suburbs were
these sort pre-war, in the

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.110
1800s, villages that sprouted up
kind of organically around

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.470
train stations.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.790
Our housing pattern is always
arranged around our

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.190
transportation, because you have
to be able to get around.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.270
So when the only way to get
around was by rail or by

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.620
street car, and then on your
own two feet, towns were

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.120
designed a lot differently.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.850
They were--

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.980
here was the rail station.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.500
And the towns kind of came up
organically around traditional

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.750
urban planning design, which was
a grid pattern, which had

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.450
been that from the days going
back into antiquity.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.490
And the densest area was right
around the station.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.030
And that's where the villages
shops set up shop--

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.200
the shops set up, because that
was the easiest place for

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.590
people to get off the train
and do their errands

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.840
and then walk home.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.900
And so as a result, these towns
had a very organic feel.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.630
And it's a very pleasant feel.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.140
These are towns that we see now
in a lot of the suburbs

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.330
around New York City
that are older--

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.760
have that kind of design.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.010
They're all over the country.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.700
But it really has more to do
with age than anything else,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.630
because they were built
around people and

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.150
people's day-to-day needs.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.000
And then--

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.250
JESSI HEMPEL: Well, so right
there, you said they do their

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.200
errands and then
they walk home.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.240
It seems like a lot changed
when walking

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.390
was replaced by driving.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.210
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Yeah.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.890
That's what kind of blew up the
entire model and led to

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.530
something else.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.290
And that happened after-- well,
a number of things.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.200
The car was invented in
the early 1900's.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.600
But it didn't really take off,
and didn't really catch hold

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.910
with the middle class,
until right after--

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.220
well, I don't know--
the '30s, the '40s.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.260
But the whole explosion happened
after World War II,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.720
when we had all these returning
GIs coming back from

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.300
the war, millions of them.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.390
We had a housing shortage, which
is hard to even imagine

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.770
now, because we have the exact
opposite problem now.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.710
But after World War II, we had
16 million GIs coming home and

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.340
nowhere to put them.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.260
People were living with their
parents, living in dining

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.940
rooms-- people were living
all over the place.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.200
So we had this housing
problem.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.780
And at the same time, the
car had just taken off.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.900
There were federal policies
that had put in place the

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.670
Federal Highway Act, which lay
the groundwork for 41,000

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.390
miles of paved roads for us to
get to and from these towns.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.675
We were sort of--

00:06:59.675 --> 00:07:02.220
there was this wonder of mass
production in the home

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.440
building industry
and everywhere.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.090
So the housing companies had
just been able to perfect the

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.960
technique of mass producing
single-family homes.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.730
And the FHA had been created
to fund long-term mortgages

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.860
and make home ownership a
reality for everybody.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.840
So all these things kind of
combusted together and they

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.450
just led to this explosion
in a different kind of

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.030
development, which was the
cutting and pasting of these

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.410
much more modern subdivisions
and suburban communities all

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.310
across the country.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.560
And they have a very
different design.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.710
The streets are wider.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.590
They're loopy.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.130
It's like cul-de-sacs that
feed into other connector

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.060
roads that feed into
arterial roads.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.060
There's a very specific
blueprint

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.530
for the modern suburbs.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.760
And that's what worked.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.200
They thought this was the future
and then everyone just

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.770
seized on it.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.890
And that's why a lot of the
towns that are a byproduct of

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.010
that era tend to look similar.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.910
JESSI HEMPEL: So golden age for
the suburb, like if you

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.830
could go back in time to a
specific year and it was the

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.910
thing, what year would it be?

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.535
LEIGH GALLAGHER: People
are obsessed with--

00:08:04.535 --> 00:08:05.280
oh, gosh.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.330
That's a really good question.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.710
I would say--

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.800
I don't know, 1884.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.215
The late 1800s.

00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:12.460
JESSI HEMPEL: OK, that's
the old suburbs.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.860
I'm talking like Don
Draper time.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.910
LEIGH GALLAGHER: 19--

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.510
I have to look.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.360
I have a couple stats
in the book that--

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.730
there was a house that was built
in like three hours.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.580
I mean, this was really--

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.870
the machine was cranking
on all cylinders.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:27.920
And it was--

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.480
JESSI HEMPEL: I don't think any
of us would want to live

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:29.830
in that house.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.760
LEIGH GALLAGHER: No.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.230
Although, we did it again
during the housing boom.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.090
Those houses were built
pretty quickly too.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.030
But it was probably
the mid-1950s.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.140
Levittown, the iconic suburb on
Long Island, was built-- it

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.830
opened in 1946 or '47.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.660
And that was sort of the
first of these modern

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.090
subdivision-style, mass-produced
suburbs.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.400
That was the beginning of the
modern suburban area.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.550
And then from then on, I mean,
that's still what we have.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.870
And it worked very, very well.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.100
I mean, look at all of us here
who grew up in the suburbs.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.100
This was the American way
of life-- the '50s,

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.950
the '60s, the '70s--

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.680
I would say it started to change
in the '80s, when we

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.170
just sort of jumped the shark
a little bit in terms of the

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.300
development of the suburbs.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.650
And we saw the beginning of real
suburban sprawl, where

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.660
towns sort of ceased having a
center and it was all sort of

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:23.420
about the strip mall and the
office complex and the

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.760
commercial center.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.120
And then the houses were
somewhere different and very,

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.610
very far away from
all that stuff.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.490
JESSI HEMPEL: One thing you
talk about in your book is

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.670
social isolation.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.170
And it strikes me that that
hasn't actually changed.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.720
So I'm curious, what has changed
around that over time?

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.830
I mean, it had to be true that
the experience of living in

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.850
the suburbs in the '60s was
fairly isolating, no?

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.250
LEIGH GALLAGHER: You
know, yes and no.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.750
It's funny, I mean, I think in
the '60s the towns were--

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.700
the scale was still
a little smaller.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.610
There were still centers to
a lot of these towns.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.080
And it was this sort of happy
"Wonder Years" era where

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.500
everyone had lots and
lots of children.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.140
And so there were more people
in the communities.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.060
And they did have a bit
of a livelier feel.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.540
But even back then--

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.000
I traced--

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.240
I spent a lot of time, this was
really fun just looking--

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.110
when you're a writer, you
just look for any

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.100
rabbit hole to go down.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.940
And you're kind of
procrastinating.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.590
So I spent a lot of time going
and looking at old YouTube

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.950
videos of "The Wonder Years"
or all the pop culture

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.440
references to the suburbs in our
culture, because they're

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.800
everywhere.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.300
And one of the interesting
things I found was that it's

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.590
kind of common now to take
potshots at suburbia.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.350
If you look at "Weeds" or
"American Beauty" or

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.950
"Desperate Housewives" or
"Suburgatory," all these kind

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.220
of things that poke fun at--

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.475
whether it's the cookie cutter
nature or the dark underbelly,

00:10:45.475 --> 00:10:47.100
that it looks so
picture perfect

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.600
but people have issues.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.610
That was also happening
in the '50s.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.330
I mean, there was this book
called "The Crack in the

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.540
Picture Window." It was actually
the basis for the

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.350
movie "Revolutionary
Road" much later.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.190
But it was sort of a very
dark look at suburbia.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.370
And then you had, even,
"Blue Velvet"--

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.710
very, very dark look at it.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.450
And then even this famous song--
the most famous song

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.210
about the suburbs, probably--

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.720
the song "Little Boxes," which
was used as the theme song for

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.340
"Weeds" in an amazing way.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.300
And with all these
amazing covers.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.610
JESSI HEMPEL: Everybody
familiar with it?

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.840
LEIGH GALLAGHER: I wish
we had audio here.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.240
JESSI HEMPEL: Anybody want
to sing it for us?

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:24.870
No volunteers.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:25.130
LEIGH GALLAGHER: It's great.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.970
It's a great song.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.130
The original song is great.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.090
But it was in 19--

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.460
was it '62--

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.140
very early on that this song
came out that was just

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:38.340
completely pointing out how
terrible the suburbs were.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.520
And how everyone looks all the
same and everyone went to the

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.360
same colleges.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.290
And this is all--

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.240
it just was really,
really dark.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.240
And so very early on, people
were pointing out that this

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.040
might not be the best
way for our housing

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.350
landscape to be arranged.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.840
JESSI HEMPEL: And of course,
since then suburbs have become

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.620
exurbs and they've sprawled
further out.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.730
And gas prices have gone up.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.590
So talk to us a little bit about
the relationship between

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.550
the suburb and the car.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.810
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Sure.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.780
I have a whole chapter in the
book about the suburb and the

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.620
car, because that's where
the whole experiment

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.140
kind of went wrong.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.840
I mean, I don't want to be
such a suburb hater.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.050
But that's really-- what a lot
of people's problems with the

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.410
suburbs, and why people are
leaving, relates to problems

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:22.250
they have with the suburbs.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.210
And almost all of those problems
relate to the suburbs

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.780
being designed around the car.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.650
So there wouldn't be one
without the other.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.240
This was this magical idea
that we were all going to

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.480
drive to these communities and
use the car to get around and

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.270
everything.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.810
But what that means is that
people don't really walk in a

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.570
lot of suburbs.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.890
I talked to a doctor who has
spent a lot of time focusing

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.730
on-- he's a former director of
the CDC who's now really,

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.240
really focused on this issue
of our built environment.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.220
That's the phrase people use to
talk about your everyday--

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.940
the way our landscape
is built--

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.370
and its impact on
public health.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.320
So he estimates that
New Yorkers--

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.270
I put this in the book.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.160
I don't want to come off like
a snobby New Yorker, but--

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.270
JESSI HEMPEL: She's not
a snobby New Yorker.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.590
LEIGH GALLAGHER: But New Yorkers
weigh on average six

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.300
or seven pounds less than the
average suburban American

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.490
precisely because we have
to walk everywhere.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.770
And New York, I think, is
a very extreme example.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.470
Where we walk here--

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.420
walking even one city block in
New York City is more than

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.060
most people in this country
walk in a given day.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.670
And that's not an
exaggeration.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.110
I mean, it's like, if you've
ever had friends come out of

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.970
town who live in LA or anywhere
else and they--

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.590
this is for women-- but they
pack their high heels and then

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:40.500
you go out.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.170
And you lose them after like a
half a block, because they're

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.440
like, what are we doing?

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.290
I mean, it's just--

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.080
People don't walk in the
rest of the country.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.030
And that's largely because of
the way our residential

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:54.690
environment is designed.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.650
And so there's a difference
between living in a

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:58.140
community--

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.860
I read a lot about the
suburb I grew up in,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.800
which is an old suburb.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.560
It has a really adorable
downtown.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.210
There's a trolley.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.120
There's a courthouse.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.345
There's a Main Street.

00:14:07.345 --> 00:14:08.700
It's very-- it's kind
of the ideal.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.220
It's what a lot of people want
to move to, and what a lot of

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.760
communities now want to be.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.780
But when you live near a
community like that, you don't

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.860
have to live where you
can walk to it.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.930
It's one thing--

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.620
you drive a mile to
that community.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.190
And then you get out and you
have a pleasing place to walk.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.930
But a lot of people live
10 or 15 miles from

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.610
any place like that.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.110
And 10 or 15 miles from
a place to even

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.660
buy a gallon of milk.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.050
So that's just--

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.320
you're in your car
all the time.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.680
Atlanta's like this.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.030
Thanks to the housing boom of
the 2000s, every state has--

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.950
every urban center has a place
like this, because the

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.320
development pushed so
out into the fringe.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.620
And so a lot of people are
living where they are

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.470
commuting up to 70 miles one
way, where they're--

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.110
JESSI HEMPEL: And you mentioned
in the book-- and I

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.960
thought this was funny--
that everybody always

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.450
underestimates their commute.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:04.740
Like, if I asked you--

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.435
I don't know, what's your
commute to work?

00:15:08.435 --> 00:15:09.750
Yeah, yours.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.190
10 minutes.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.410
OK, you probably have an
exact count on that.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:14.470
The close nature.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.620
Some suburban in the audience,
raise your hand.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.080
Let's get one.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.728
OK, how do you get to work?

00:15:19.728 --> 00:15:22.020
AUDIENCE: I bike, I take
the train, and I walk.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.300
JESSI HEMPEL: How long do
you think it takes you?

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.620
AUDIENCE: An hour and
twenty minutes.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.690
JESSI HEMPEL: An hour and 20
minutes every day, both ways.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.490
Each way.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.880
And so what Leigh--what you also
discovered in your book

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.810
is that when you're estimating
that time-- and I'm assuming

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.960
that at Google, giving your
prowess in technology it's an

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.800
exact estimate.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.640
But the rest of the world is
sometimes a little bit off and

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.430
always underestimates that.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:42.660
It always takes more time.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.280
LEIGH GALLAGHER:
Yeah, they do.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.080
I mean, according to the census,
the average commute

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.850
right now, I think, is
26 minutes one way.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:50.540
That's a big average, so you're

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.150
factoring in lots of things.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.890
But it's really hard to get the
exact data, because people

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.190
do under report it.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.040
And that's because they don't
want to think that they've

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.680
made this decision to
live so far away.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.620
But wait, I had the
perfect life.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.890
I have the house with my
yard and everything.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.850
So there's a lot of
data on commuting.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.150
And it's really fascinating.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.660
I mean, the things it does to
people-- it's not good for,

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.210
one thing, just time.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.210
And I think a lot of people
move to the suburbs-- the

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:25.710
biggest reason by far is to
prioritize schools and family

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.140
life for children.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.635
JESSI HEMPEL: So you wrote
about a family like that.

00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:32.240
A family who lived in Cambridge,
Massachusetts and

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.970
was having more children
and decided this is it.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.660
And they moved to a town close
to my heart, Westborough,

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.560
Massachusetts, only because
I grew up in the

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.950
town next to it.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.470
And they didn't last
very long.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.460
So tell us the story
of that family.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:45.750
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Sure.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:46.500
This is the woman--

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.030
I have a chapter in the
book that's about the

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.770
suburbs and the car.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.990
And the quote came from this
woman-- the quote for the

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.980
title of the chapter.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.790
It's called, "My Car Knows the
Way to Gymnastics." And what

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.810
she meant by that was--

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:58.540
they'd moved--

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.040
I forget where they moved
from, but they'd--

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.390
actually, her husband works
at Google, I think.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.940
But anyway--

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.260
we don't need to go into that.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.369
But they had moved with
their three children.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:11.560
They had their fourth child
shortly after they moved into

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.589
this colonial house
in Westborough.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:17.490
And the woman really wanted
to try the American dream.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.349
She said, I've never
done this.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.099
I really want to do it.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:19.950
I want the car.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:20.630
I want the minivan.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.240
I want the house.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.400
I want the whole deal.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.270
And she was dissatisfied for
a number of reasons.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.780
But one of the biggest reasons
was because she really

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.800
underestimated the amount of
time she was going to spend in

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.760
her car every day, which ended
up being close to 40 or 50

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.430
miles a day because she
had four children.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.590
And just to shuttle them around
to all the activities

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.380
they need to be in--

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.770
I mean, if there's parents
in the room, I'm sure you

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:41.660
understand this.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.670
It's soccer practice, piano
lessons, Hebrew lessons--

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:47.570
everything.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.870
And so she was in her car from
three to six every day,

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.550
traveling these vast distances
to take her kids to all their

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:55.060
engagements.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.240
And she just really thought that
she was going to move to

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.100
a suburb and there was going
to be serendipitous play

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.620
happening in the streets-- that
kids would play in the

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.680
street or in the backyard
with the swing set.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.470
That was the whole point.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.010
And they would play until it was
time for dinner and then

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:09.600
they would come in.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.020
And that just didn't happen.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.740
She said to me, there's a
playset in every backyard, but

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.290
you don't have access
to that playset

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.720
unless you have a playdate.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:23.700
So I think part of that is the
whole playdate-centric culture

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.350
is also alive and
well in cities.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.200
I think that's also a result
of how having two parents

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.020
working now-- we didn't
have that back in

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.130
the '60s, '70s, '80s.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.570
I think it's part of our--

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.060
I think the culture around
parenting has

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:37.810
changed a little bit.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.250
There's far more activities
for everyone to do.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.570
I don't know that that's
just a suburban thing.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.980
But that is one reason why
children growing up in the

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.420
suburbs today have a very
different childhood than I had

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.570
when I was growing up in the
suburbs in the '70s, when we

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.380
did play outside until 6 o'clock
and it was time for

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.550
dinner and when there
were tons of

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.110
children running around.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.870
And so she was really
disaffected with that aspect,

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:04.170
and then with the aspect
that nobody walked or--

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.280
they actually lived close to
their school and she tried to

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.830
organize an effort to get the
parents to walk a group of

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.280
kids to school every day.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.140
And nobody would do it.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.910
They didn't want do it.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.380
JESSI HEMPEL: So tell
me what happened.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.850
So here's a family
with four kids.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.190
I mean, they don't fit into
a two-bedroom apartment.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.740
What did they decide to do?

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.840
LEIGH GALLAGHER: They ended
up moving to Cambridge.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.360
They pulled the kids
out of school and

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.790
they found a row house.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.710
It wasn't cheap.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.550
They had to spend more money
than-- they incurred a serious

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.540
financial burden to be
able to do this.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.350
And she was well aware that not
everyone is able to just

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.260
change their mind like that,
because the suburbs are more

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.330
economical given the schools
and everything.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.510
But they-- they are living
a much happier

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.390
life, all of them.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.280
All six of them.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.190
Their kids love it.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.600
They walk to museums.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.070
They go to a park across the
street when they want to play.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.140
They have a postage
stamp backyard.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.110
They have a row house, less
space, but they have the kind

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.980
of life that they're
really enjoying.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.020
So that might not be
for everybody.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.800
But I found a whole lot of
people who did something like

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.090
that, who actually move to
the suburbs and then

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.300
moved back to cities.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.390
I mean, it's one thing to have--
here in New York, we

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.130
have a lot of families who
actually opt to stay in the

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.220
city and never go out
to the suburbs.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.010
But I found a lot of people who
are moving back, and many

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.630
times even sending their kids
to public school in cities.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.830
JESSI HEMPEL: So how are cities
changing to become more

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.560
friendly places to live?

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.300
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Well,
it's funny.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.160
I mean, there's a kind
of reversal going on.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.850
The cities are actually
becoming

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:33.960
a little more suburban.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.120
I mean, they're just much nicer
places to live than they

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.540
were in the '70s and '80s when
everyone rushed out and went

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.080
to the suburbs.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.190
So the narrative
around cities--

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.490
I'm sure everyone here has read
stories or books about

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:47.760
this in the past couple years.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.020
But cities are--

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.810
all over the country,
except for Detroit--

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:51.980
Detroit is a real outlier.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.270
And some of the other
rust belt cities.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.610
But cities are really
wildly resurgent

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:56.520
for a number of reasons.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.520
Crime has gone down.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.500
Public and private investment
has gone way up.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.880
They're just vastly
different places.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.070
Industry has moved out.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.070
I mean, one of the reasons why
everyone left the cities was

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.040
because we had a lot of noxious
factories, dating--

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.730
I mean, that goes way back
to when we were more of a

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.650
manufacturing-based economy.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.570
And you have--

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.590
cities now are--

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:19.920
JESSI HEMPEL: Now those
noxious factories are

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.890
beautiful lofts.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.930
LEIGH GALLAGHER:
Yes, they are.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:23.590
Exactly.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.610
And expensive lofts.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.400
I mean, look at--

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.380
the meat packing district is--
you wouldn't have gone there

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.540
even in the '80s and '90s.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.240
And now it's like a casting call
for "The Bachelorette." I

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.380
mean, it's like--

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.220
everyone goes there.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.080
Everyone goes out.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.440
Cities are like amusement
parks now.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.620
And so that's been
a huge shift.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.330
Its driven the prices up,
especially in New York, but--

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:45.900
JESSI HEMPEL: So let's talk
a little bit about the

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.040
economics of cities.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.200
I mean, is what you're talking
about a phenomenon that really

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.580
only affects the upper
class and the very

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.040
upper middle class.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.910
Can the middle class afford
to live in cities?

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:57.580
LEIGH GALLAGHER: That's
a good question.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.290
It depends on the city.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.530
Not New York City or not
Manhattan for sure.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.830
And the suburbs were originally
a big solution for

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.610
our middle class.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:08.280
And that's why they
were built.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.530
And our middle class
is shrinking.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.810
And so that's, I think, one
reason we're seeing actually

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.350
really high levels of poverty
in the suburbs now.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.870
So it is a bit of an economic--
it's more expensive

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.630
to live in a city than a suburb,
especially if you have

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.900
to pay for private schools.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.100
But one of the big movements
that's happening, and one of

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.510
the things I spend a lot of time
on in the book is this

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.610
movement to sort of urbanize
the suburbs.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.180
People really want to go back
to this model where there is

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.890
some sort of cute, lively
town center.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:38.160
And a pleasing place to go
and bump into people.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.140
And a lot of people want that.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.600
Whether it's in the suburbs
or the city,

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.660
that's all they want.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.410
And so a lot of home builders
and developers and planners

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.692
are kind of falling all over
themselves right now to sort

00:22:48.692 --> 00:22:50.880
of build these sort of
utopian urban burbs.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.310
And they don't really
exist now.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.700
I mean, they exist in a few
different places, but there's

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.440
not nearly enough of them to
suit the demand that's coming.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.410
So the ideal does not have
to be moving into a city.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.410
People just want--

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.760
JESSI HEMPEL: Is this like
the river towns, like

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.600
hipsturbias--

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.560
Terry Town and Hastings
on Hudson?

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.770
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Yeah,
that's close to it.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.480
LEIGH GALLAGHER: I mean, the New
York Times did this story

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.470
with the headline "Hipsturbia"
back several months ago.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.600
And it was all about how
hipsters were-- the Brooklyn

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.550
class was now moving up to the
river towns, which offer this

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.240
kind of really funky town where
there's a Main Street

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.120
and a yoga studio and a coffee
shop and all that stuff.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.390
And they do, because those towns
were built on the sort

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.220
of old urban bones.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.600
Not just the river towns,
but other New

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.230
York suburbs as well.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.950
But it's funny.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.045
I mean, I talked to a friend of
mine who lives in Hastings.

00:23:36.045 --> 00:23:37.090
And I said, oh, did you see?

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.430
You live in Hipsturbia.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.790
And he sort of rolled
his eyes.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.810
He said, you know, this
isn't hipsters.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.850
He said this is like upstate
with corporate lawyers.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.420
Because it's really
expensive there.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.710
And he said you're still
in your car a lot.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.770
I mean, no matter what you're
still in your car a lot when

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.300
you live in the suburbs.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.980
But that is--

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.130
I think people are really
starting to draw this

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:01.090
distinction between
the "Weeds"-style,

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:08.180
cul-de-sac-heavy, big,
cut-and-pasted suburb and the

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.460
one with more character.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.760
And usually, those are
a little bit older.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.300
And we're starting to
see a reversal in

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.460
valuations, where those--

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.130
in some places, neighborhoods
that are older are retaining

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.620
their housing values more so
than newer neighborhoods,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.460
which-- in the past, that
was always reversed.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.930
People always want new.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.520
And you're starting to see
that revers a little bit.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.690
It's one of a number of
reversals in economic

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.310
valuations that play into
this whole thesis.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.810
JESSI HEMPEL: And so you talked
in the book about a man

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:37.050
who launched an interesting
experiment that essentially

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.450
got squashed when the housing
bust happened.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.410
But it was an experiment to
give mortgages based on a

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:47.610
broader picture than basic
pen-and-paper financial

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:48.970
ability to pay.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.090
Can you talk a little
bit about what

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.130
that experiment was?

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:51.510
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Sure.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.140
This is this outfit out of
Chicago called the Center for

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.300
Neighborhood Technologies.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.820
And there's a guy there named
Scott Bernstein who is just a

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.150
real kind of genius
in this field.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.790
And he had spent a lot of time--
his whole expertise,

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.810
and this organization's
expertise, is quantifying how

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:11.310
much transportation costs eat
up disposable income.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.120
And so people think about
the cost it takes to

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.220
fill up your gas tank.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.170
But it's not just that.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.700
I mean, anybody who owns
a car knows this.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.600
It's the cost of maintenance.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.120
It's the cost of--

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.640
I mean, everything that goes
into owning a car-- parking

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.320
and all that stuff.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.790
And so he did a lot of
calculations across the

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.820
country and found that in many
markets, usually the market's

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.100
that are the farthest from the
sort of urban center, the sort

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.660
of "drive to qualify" zone, as
it was called during the

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.070
housing boom, because the people
who could least afford

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:43.030
it were going the furthest to
find the house they wanted.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.220
And actually, this woman in
Boston said that too.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.530
They went so far way because if
you're going to spend, you

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.030
want it to be the best
house you can buy.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.460
And that's part of this house
American dream psyche mania

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.480
that we have going.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.880
But anyway, he found that in
many communities, people were

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.900
spending as much or more of
their disposable income, or

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.850
their monthly income, on their
transportation costs as their

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.740
housing costs.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.600
And that's largely because when
you're doing a 70 mile

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.060
commute, or two per household,
that's a lot of money.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.020
And people don't think about
that when they think about

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:16.930
their housing costs.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:17.880
They really don't.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.890
You just think of the
house itself.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:23.490
But that's eating up just tons
and tons and tons of

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.590
people's-- it's taking a huge
hit on people's wallets.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.800
So anyway, he basically devised
this idea for a

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.470
location-efficient mortgage, he
called it, where the cost

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.820
of transportation was
built and baked into

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.020
your monthly nut.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.900
And to the kind of mortgage
you were going

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:38.910
to be able to get.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.120
And you would be able to qualify
for a bigger mortgage

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.680
if you lived in a more
responsible place.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.010
So just actually baking in where
the house was located

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:51.170
into the actual total cost of
your house that the bank was

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:52.870
willing to lend for.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.620
And kind of acknowledging that
that was a huge part of the

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.340
expense of the house was going
to be where it's built.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.590
And so they did really well.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.180
They did studies on
these mortgages.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.570
And in a study of 300 of them
or something, there was one

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:06.670
that failed.

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.570
And it didn't even
ever default.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.530
They fixed it before
it came to default.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.080
So these have been
proven to work.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.290
And they're an idea that a lot
of people think makes a whole

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:16.920
lot of sense.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.280
But the housing bust and our
economic crisis came around.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.810
And they never-- they haven't
really gotten traction.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:25.160
It's very hard to get the banks
to move on something

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.000
that doesn't act in
their interests.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.820
JESSI HEMPEL: That
is indeed true.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.850
Indeed true.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.760
So you also address this startup
doing something called

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.240
a walkability score.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:35.840
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Yeah.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.140
So this is a startup that people
here might have heard

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.040
of called Walk Score.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.910
And what Walk Score does is it
uses all sorts of algorithms

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.060
to be able to give you a score
from 1 to 100 on how walkable

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.430
your neighborhood is.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.590
And you just plug in
any address and it

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.730
will give you a score.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.640
So I live on West 10th
street in Manhattan.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.040
And my walk score is 100,
which means that I can

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.640
basically walk anywhere
I need to go.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.705
Where I grew up in Media,
Pennsylvania--

00:28:05.705 --> 00:28:07.140
I forget what the score is.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.120
I think it's in the 20s.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.750
But that's considered
car dependent.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:11.780
So you can do this anywhere.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.860
So it's really fun to
play around with.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:19.010
And this company is really
riding a wave of buzz in terms

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.610
of what people are demanding
from their houses and their

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:22.620
neighborhoods.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.420
So walkability is kind of this
big new buzz word in real

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.150
estate circles.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:27.970
And real estate agents are
starting to use it.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.720
It's being promoted
everywhere--

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.680
new communities.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.660
The walkability of a
neighborhood is really seen as

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.560
a huge thing that people
are looking for.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.670
So 15,000 real estate agencies
are now baking in the API to

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.360
their websites, because when
you're shopping for a house,

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.780
in addition to what it looks
like, how many bedrooms, is it

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.630
a colonial, whatever, people
are interested

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:51.600
in what it's near.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.430
And I think that really reflects
a huge change in what

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:58.270
people are looking for from
the places they live.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.150
So it's a huge thing.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.420
And those communities are going
to be able to command

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.990
higher prices and do better.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.660
We don't have enough of them.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.360
So--

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.270
JESSI HEMPEL: So afterwards
she'll give us all some

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.086
tutoring based on where to
invest based on this, right?

00:29:12.086 --> 00:29:14.440
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Somebody said I
could open a consultancy and

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.600
advise people where
to live, so--

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.350
JESSI HEMPEL: On that note,
let's open up to the audience.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.600
Do we have any questions
in our audience?

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.120
All right, we've got somebody
at the mic.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:24.720
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.960
Thank you for coming.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.990
I know a little bit about--

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:30.940
not I know about real estate,
but I know a little bit about

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.170
real estate in the Central
Valley of California and

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:33.880
Bakersfield.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.820
And they have, for instance,
this gigantic construction on

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.120
the grapevine called Fort Tejon
Ranch, which is utterly

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.190
enormous in the middle
of the highest point.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.060
Just a terrible place
to have a complex.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.490
But also, in Bakersfield itself,
a ton of new home

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.790
construction.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.870
And it looks like a nice
suburban area.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.990
What I find interesting about
these new homes is that

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.360
they're not actually
selling the home.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.640
It's a giant town
home complex.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.790
So you don't actually--

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.650
you don't own the home in the
same way that I own my home.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.220
I have the right to do whatever
I want to the

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.750
exterior of my house.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:13.350
And it seems like this is a way
to bring the cost of the

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.210
house down for people
in that area who

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:17.835
want to live in houses.

00:30:17.835 --> 00:30:20.240
There are hardly any apartments
in Bakersfield.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.470
But I wonder if this is a trend
that you've seen to make

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:27.070
housing more affordable,
but less--

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.600
but really, you don't own
the house in the same

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.680
way that you own--

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.590
again, in the same
way that I do.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.170
So I wonder what this
trend means.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:35.060
JESSI HEMPEL: So it's sort of
like a New York City co-op.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.190
LEIGH GALLAGHER: It does.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.890
It's townhouses?

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:39.850
Sorry.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.100
AUDIENCE: They're
full-size homes.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.260
They're full-size, multifamily
homes.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:48.750
Bakersfield has very few
apartment buildings because

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.620
there's so much space
to sprawl out.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.080
Not unlike Los Angeles.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.920
Well, Los Angeles is much
more contained.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.040
But it's just houses
after houses.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.340
And they're building and
building and building.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.950
And that paused for a while
a few years ago.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.730
But they're back
in full force.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:02.540
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Well,
if this is some sort

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.580
of innovative way--

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.330
I don't quite know the
structure here.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.940
But people don't necessarily--

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.810
the home ownership rate
is following.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:15.790
And renting and other types of
financial arrangements are

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.060
definitely gaining ground.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.820
I don't know if this is a sort
of communal setup or if it's--

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.360
I don't know exactly what
the structure is.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.020
But I thought you were going to
say they were sort of town

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:29.280
homes, which is interesting
because more urban kind of

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.280
style of development is coming
everywhere, even in places

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.150
like Bakersfield, which
is ground zero

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.670
for drive-to qualify.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:37.460
Absolutely.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.560
The people there do the longest

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.700
commutes in the country.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.600
And I actually have an anecdote
in my book about a

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.960
woman who had to leave
her house at 4:00--

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.960
she got up at 3:50,
left at 4:00.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.980
Only then would the commute be
only an hour and 15 minutes.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.430
But then she'd get
there at 5:15.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.240
And so she and her husband,
they were rare.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.270
They actually commuted
together.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.040
And they would go and park in
the McDonald's parking lot and

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.950
recline their seats and set
their cellphones and just

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.320
sleep for an hour.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.020
And on the days when she was
alone, she would drive right

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.740
to her classroom--

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.090
she was a teacher--

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.080
and she would take a
nap under her desk.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.590
And then once it was time to get
ready, she would get ready

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.680
in the ladies' room, and bring
her flat iron and everything.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.650
But she would literally
sleep under her desk

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:18.280
for an hour or two.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.280
She said she felt like
George Costanza from

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.960
the Seinfeld episode.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.830
This is a New York audience.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.700
You guys get that, right?

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.670
JESSI HEMPEL: All right,
let's jump to this

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.140
question over here.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.780
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
if in the course of your

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:34.860
research you reached any
conclusions about the size of

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.820
new house construction and the
impact it has on some of the

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.800
things you're describing.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.320
Because I live in the suburbs.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.870
One thing that I've noticed is
that a house that's the normal

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.240
size house like my house, like
2000 square feet, they just

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.890
don't build houses like
that anymore.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.590
New construction is like 3,500
square feet, 3,800 square

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.230
feet, 4,200 square feet.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:59.640
And I was just wondering if
you'd seen any impact of that.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.740
LEIGH GALLAGHER: That's a
really good question.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.130
That is changing.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.470
The housing boom and bust really
kind of changed the

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:09.240
psyche on the whole excess
consumption and everything.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.510
Statistically, the average size
of a new home has not--

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.990
it's come down a little bit.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:17.400
Then it went up a little bit in
2011 because for a really

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.680
long period of time--

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.140
or during the peak of the
financial crisis, the only

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.940
people that were buying houses
were very wealthy who were

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.670
paying cash.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.250
So it skewed the numbers
little bit.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.650
But overall in the zeitgeist,
and the home builders, are

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.120
changing the way they
are building houses.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.640
They don't ever use the word
"small." It's not a word they

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.990
like to talk about.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.700
So they will say our homes
are now right size.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.990
Or the floor plans are
a little different.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.230
And they're making more
"efficient" use of space.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:42.730
That's what everyone's
talking about.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.260
But anecdotally--

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.380
JESSI HEMPEL: Efficiency
is such a good word.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.165
LEIGH GALLAGHER: It is.

00:33:46.165 --> 00:33:47.180
But that's--

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.290
people don't want houses where
they're not using the space

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.170
that they bought and paid for.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.200
It costs a lot to
heat and cool.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.970
And people are really starting
to recognize this. that.

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:58.000
So you're seeing all these kind
of interesting movements

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.300
come to be also, like life
edited, which has gotten a lot

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.230
of coverage here in New York.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.070
Graham Hill, who founded
TreeHugger, has this new

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.630
movement about just reducing
the amount of

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:07.460
stuff that you have.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.719
And his TED talk got like
two million views.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.719
There is a movement in the
homebuilding industry for the

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:14.000
not-so-big house movement.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.860
There's an architect,
Sarah Susanka-- or

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.090
she's a home designer.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.350
And she advocates for building
differently, so that you're

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.170
using more of the
space every day.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.750
And so we're definitely seeing
a lot more interest in that.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:27.170
And the types of communities
people want, they tend to be

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:29.276
communities that have
smaller houses.

00:34:29.276 --> 00:34:32.880
JESSI HEMPEL: So let's pop
over here for a question.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.150
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:37.820
I'm curious as to how--

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.859
I think there's sort of an
elephant in the room in the

00:34:39.859 --> 00:34:42.230
story you've been telling,
because--

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.699
the things that you've been
talking about, people moving

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:47.625
to the suburbs to go to good
schools, people being in

00:34:47.625 --> 00:34:51.120
cities having to buy
private schools.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.739
And the whole white flight of
the '60s and '70s and the

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:57.020
urban decline thing is,
in a lot of ways,

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.610
a story about race.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:03.340
And I wonder how that ties in
with the story of suburbia,

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:08.010
because it was an explicit
policy in this country that

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:11.690
the newly built suburbs were
going to be for white people.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.590
And that was a really
big factor in why

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.370
everybody moved out there.

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.230
I'm wondering how that figures
into everything.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.040
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Yeah,
great question.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.470
It's true.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:20.950
Back when the FHA--

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.410
I won't get too bogged
down in history.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:25.520
But there was a process when
homes were approved for

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.430
different kinds of mortgages.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:27.740
And homes that were
red lined--

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.310
it was explicit or
inexplicit--

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.630
blacks were denied benefits that
were flowing to whites

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.380
when it came to the kinds of
houses they could buy and the

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.350
neighborhoods they could live.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:42.790
Totally a huge part of
our housing history.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:45.270
As the suburbs grew and grew and
grew, they got so big that

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:48.370
they became this jumble and
began to reflect everything

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:49.040
about America.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.480
So you now have suburbs in every
shape, flavor, size,

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.810
style, economic class, race,
ethnicity, and everything.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:01.890
So they are much more reflective
now of America in

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.900
sum than they were when they
were born and created,

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:05.690
absolutely.

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:06.970
But the home ownership
rate in this

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:11.740
country is 64% on average.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.730
For whites, it's 74%.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:16.570
And for blacks, it's 44%.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:20.930
So the policies behind home
ownership are still--

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:22.070
there's vast differences.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.060
And so that's, I think, still
a huge issue in our housing

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.490
market in general.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:31.830
I don't think it plays so much
a role into the migration

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:32.830
that's happening now.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.770
I think it's a bit
more everyone.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.596
The trends I write about really
impact everybody.

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:40.042
JESSI HEMPEL: Let's jump here.

00:36:40.042 --> 00:36:40.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:44.140
You talked a lot about people
finding the urban lifestyle

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.700
more attractive and moving
from suburbs to cities.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.050
I'm curious, in your research,
was there any data that

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:52.880
suggested the opposite move,
from the suburbs to a more

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.690
rural environment, or to
stand-alone towns that

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:57.830
wouldn't be considered a suburb,
with just how easy it

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:58.810
is to be connected.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:03.000
LEIGH GALLAGHER: That's a
really good question.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.760
Most of the research seems to
suggest that people are

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.330
looking for more urban
and more connection.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:09.450
You can totally get that
in the right kind

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.490
of small town, though.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.740
I mean, the town I grew up in
that I write a lot about is

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:16.870
very much a kind of Grover's
Corners-esque type of place.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.110
And what people want is
connection and community.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.380
And that was totally lost in
the way we kind of ended up

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.730
maxing out our suburbs.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.400
But it does exist in small
towns, completely.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.380
Another-- some people suggested
to me that the

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:33.730
future is in dual home
ownership, where you have--

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.630
you see a lot of that in New
York, where you have your

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.490
urban dwelling and then
you have your

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:38.410
place in the country.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:42.260
And I think it's a rarefied
slice of the population that

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.340
can live that way.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.950
But this person was sort of
saying, no, you can do it--

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:49.080
people at income levels that
you'd be surprised at, this is

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.300
going to be kind of the
way of the future.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.720
So I don't know.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.940
I think with rural--

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:58.290
I think the appeal
of the small town

00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:59.410
definitely plays a role.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.480
One economist I talked
to talked about--

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.330
He had a word for it.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.490
Cities with 300,000 or less, he
thinks that's going to be

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:06.380
the future.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.400
So that's hardly small town.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.230
That's hardly rural.

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.500
But smaller cities.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.550
So that's one other aspect.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.970
JESSI HEMPEL: Let's jump
right over here.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:15.770
AUDIENCE: So I grew
up in Wisconsin.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.920
And pretty much all of Wisconsin
is either a suburb

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.940
or a rural area.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.910
And one of the ways I'd always
thought about suburbs--

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:26.340
I grew up in very much a
cookie cutter suburb--

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.050
is sort of on the border
between the

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:30.780
urban and the rural.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.270
Sort of places that
exist that--

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:37.270
sort of geographic in nature,
just places adjacent to both

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:38.240
types of communities.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.810
And I hadn't really thought
about it from the lifestyle

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.480
perspective, or the choices, et
cetera, I'm sure my parents

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.110
had thought about very deeply.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:50.030
I guess if you extrapolate
outwards the trends that

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.580
you're seeing, what happens to
that place in between the

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.380
cities and the rural areas.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.790
What do you call those and what
function do they serve?

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.570
And I guess I'd just be
interested to hear you sort of

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:02.210
look forward.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.710
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Yeah.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.240
Well, I mean what you're
describing--

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.310
I mean, the suburbs, that's
how they were designed.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.370
It was like, here's cities.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:09.170
Here's the country.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.400
We're going to throw them
together and come up with the

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.160
perfect mixture.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.160
Like the perfect solution.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.070
It's going to be--

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.040
bake them together and we'll
have the best of both worlds.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.200
But I think you're talking
about more of the remote

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.460
suburbs that are closer to the
rural farmland and stuff,

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.730
where farmers made a lot of
money by selling their land to

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:28.190
developers.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:30.860
And actually, now a lot of those
farmers are making a lot

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:35.050
of money on the other end by
buying them back for nothing.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:35.660
They are.

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:36.660
JESSI HEMPEL: Oh, the irony.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.380
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Yeah, it is.

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.100
It's great.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.670
But there's a big question.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.390
What happens to all
these houses?

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.320
If people are going to migrate
inward, what happens to them?

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.730
There's the theory of economics
that if a price

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:50.800
falls low enough, it'll be
of value to someone.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.950
So maybe landlords will
come in and try to

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.950
rent out those houses.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.400
Maybe communities--

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.230
they'll become immigrant
communities of a certain type.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.460
Maybe big extended families
will take

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.770
over these big houses.

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:10.700
Maybe they'll turn into artist
lofts or something.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.650
So there's all sorts of uses
that have been proposed for

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:17.250
these houses that we have
that are built far way.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:20.810
And that arguably there won't be
a market for in the future,

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.500
because we're also not having
as many children, which is

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.010
another factor.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:26.340
But that's anybody's guess.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:32.250
I mean, a lot of enterprising
investors are buying up

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.460
hundreds of single-family
homes with the intent of

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.720
renting them out.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.470
And it remains to be seen
if that's going to be a

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.510
sustainable solution.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.220
But very good question.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.020
JESSI HEMPEL: Let's
jump over here.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.830
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
ask you specifically

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:45.080
about Silicon Valley.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.270
And I wanted to know if that
fits into your general thesis

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.840
or if it's sort of an exception
because of all of

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.790
the wealth creation and
jobs that are there.

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:55.120
LEIGH GALLAGHER: That's a
really good question.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.160
It fits in.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.390
I would say Palo Alto is a good
example of the old burb.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.150
It's got this quaint town.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.140
It's got a real center.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.590
It's a place that a lot
of people want to be.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:06.330
The neighborhood is
built at scale.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.410
The streets are narrow.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:08.260
There's sidewalks.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.030
The houses are built a little
close together.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:11.610
So it all has all the
bones there that

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:12.990
make up a good suburb.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.290
There was sprawl outside
of San Francisco.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:19.110
I mean, you saw it especially
in the East Bay, but

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:19.960
all over the place.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.660
So a lot of those
things happen.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.370
But San Francisco came up in
my research a little bit.

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:26.940
A large part, I talk about
what companies are doing.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.280
And a lot of companies are
moving back to opening in big

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.290
cities or shuttering their big
suburban office parks and

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:35.420
opening in cities.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.400
So in San Francisco, you see
some of the hottest startups

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.600
in the past couple years have
opened in the city instead of

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.960
in the valley.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.300
I mean, Google is obviously
the exception to that.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.140
But look at where we
are right now.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:53.260
I mean, 20 years ago, Google
would have probably decided to

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.860
locate in Mount Kisco.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.360
I mean, it's just-- that's a
really good example of how

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.150
things have changed.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.020
This building that we're in
right now, and the price that

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.060
was paid for it and
how in demanded it

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.930
is, tells you a lot.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.480
But Silicon Valley
is interesting.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.525
It does fit the trend
in certain ways.

00:42:09.525 --> 00:42:12.390
JESSI HEMPEL: Let's jump
right over here.

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:16.280
AUDIENCE: You spoke a little bit
about race as it pertains

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.370
to home ownership.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:22.360
But I wonder a bit if--

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.090
if you know a bit about
statistics about religious

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:30.480
preference or maybe immigrant
communities that might find a

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:35.790
more isolated neighborhood
to be preferable.

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:36.750
LEIGH GALLAGHER: One of
the things I found--

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:39.070
I mean, people like to live
around people like them.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:41.830
So families like to live
around other families.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:45.470
People of different religious
persuasions or beliefs or

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.650
whatever like to be around
people that are like them.

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:49.390
Young single people like
to be around other

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:50.350
young single people.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.350
So that happens in
the suburbs.

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:54.460
That happens in the cities.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.620
I mean, you look
at Williamsburg

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.750
and the Hasidic community.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.500
So I think that's always
going to be the case.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.760
But those people might be moving
to different places.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.260
AUDIENCE: But I guess
my point is that--

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.790
and I'm making an assumption
here, which is that religious

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:09.190
groups and immigrant populations
tend to have

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:10.450
larger families.

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:11.520
I don't know if those
are true, but I

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.180
believe they're true.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:12.580
LEIGH GALLAGHER: That's true.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.560
That's true statistically.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.220
And we need that.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:14.870
We need those people.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.360
The birth rate in this country
is falling like a stone.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.450
And that's a whole
other reason--

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:20.110
I have a whole chapter
on demographics.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:21.720
We're not having children
anymore.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.670
I mean, it's not that dramatic,
but it almost is.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:27.460
I talk about-- this is not
related to your question, but

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.710
my father grew up on a block in
an inner spring suburb in

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.790
Philadelphia where there were
41 children on his block.

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:35.230
And this was in the '50s.

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:37.660
And I hired a private
investigator to count how many

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.660
children there are in
that block now.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.193
And it's a little
bit informal.

00:43:41.193 --> 00:43:42.582
JESSI HEMPEL: Creepy.

00:43:42.582 --> 00:43:43.045
LEIGH GALLAGHER: What?

00:43:43.045 --> 00:43:43.971
JESSI HEMPEL: Creepy.

00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:44.900
LEIGH GALLAGHER: I know.

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.040
But there's 15 or fewer.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.230
And that's playing out all
over this country.

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:53.490
So we need the immigrant
population to sustain our

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:57.320
longevity as a country.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.130
JESSI HEMPEL: OK,
right over here.

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:01.620
AUDIENCE: As you mentioned in
that story you told earlier,

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.190
you had a couple that moved
out to the suburbs for the

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.520
space and the schools,
obviously.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.100
What are the trends with
urban schools?

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.510
Are they getting better?

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:11.320
LEIGH GALLAGHER: That's the
huge issue, because

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.040
it's like, oh, great.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.030
Everyone wants to
live in a city.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.510
Well, the schools have to be
good for that to happen--

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:17.190
to draw the young families.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.500
And they're--

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:22.441
I talked to a developer here who
owns a company based in--

00:44:22.441 --> 00:44:24.030
it's Jonathan Rose Company.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.760
He's a big developer.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.620
And he said that all his young
people-- all his employees

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:28.200
live in the city.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.210
They're all making it work.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:32.080
They're all finding schools,
whether its magnet schools or

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.910
public schools that are good
or whatever, because not

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:37.390
everybody can afford
private schools.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:39.280
JESSI HEMPEL: Is that in
New York specifically?

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.140
LEIGH GALLAGHER: That's
in New York.

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.670
He's in New York.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.860
But I talked to someone else in
Philadelphia who's bringing

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.550
their kids back and looking
at a sort of

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.590
magnet school situation.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.400
That's a big question mark.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.090
And I think the schools
need to get better.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.390
I think they are
getting better.

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:56.700
But on the other hand, I think
schools in the suburbs are

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.440
going to face continuing
challenges going forward.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.850
You're seeing a lot of them--

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:04.910
as suburbs depopulate and as
suburbs age because of this

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:07.800
declining birth rate, a lot of
schools are having to merge or

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.020
close and they're seeing their

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.390
taxpayer-funded resources decline.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.130
And that trend is going
to accelerate.

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:15.800
So I think it might even
out a little bit

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.610
more than people think.

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:19.430
JESSI HEMPEL: Right over here.

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:23.460
AUDIENCE: So the suburbs grew
out of World War II.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.510
And part of that growth,
too, was television and

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:28.780
advertising.

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:31.770
And we see television viewership
on decline.

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.220
I think it's near
all-time lows.

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:37.060
Can you say anything about
the American consumer?

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:41.140
And if the end of the suburbs
is coming, will that also

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.960
portend the end of the
American economy?

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.640
Where are the lawn tractors
going to go to?

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.640
All the stuff we get
out of Home Depot.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.910
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Yeah,
that's a good point.

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:50.410
Good point.

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:51.530
I mean, I think it's changing.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:56.170
So right, in the '50s, suburbia
was baked into every

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:58.430
single consumer marketing
image you could imagine,

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:00.330
whether it's TV commercial
or an add on a

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.700
billboard or whatever.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.290
So now we're just seeing those
images in different places.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.350
And those images might
be changing.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:08.880
So maybe the American dream is
not a lawnmower and a yard.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.590
But it's a great Wi-Fi
connection and a really cool

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.230
place for entertaining
your friends.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.650
And there's different kind--

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:16.210
it's true.

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:18.550
I mean, that's what the
millennials want.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:20.940
I mean, that's a lot of
you in the room here.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.790
But people are poking and
prodding and studying the

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.410
millennials to see how they want
to live and where they

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:26.890
want to live.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:29.260
And how they want to live their
lives, because that is

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:31.420
going to answer the question you
just asked of what is the

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.410
consuming economy going
to look like.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:36.290
And the studies show that they
don't want a car, which is a

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.230
whole other story.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.790
The number of kids getting their
driver's licenses is

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:43.640
dropping, which is really weird
to anybody who grew up

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.620
in the '70s or earlier.

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.180
And they want other things.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.710
So they want devices.

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:51.130
They want their gadgets.

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:52.120
They want their smartphones.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.490
They want their Google
everything.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:57.540
So that's the difference.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.790
JESSI HEMPEL: Leigh,
another--you and I were

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.080
talking about this
on the way over.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.440
Another way to sort of frame
that idea and to really tie

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.750
what you were talking about to
your thesis is to think about

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.855
what was going on in
the 20th century.

00:47:08.855 --> 00:47:12.140
I mean, the 20th century
was about mass, right?

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.360
It was about mass production.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.070
It was broadcast media.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.160
It was producing things
at scale.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.690
And the internet came along and
really disrupted that at

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:21.940
the end of the 20th century.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.330
And so the 21st century is about
technology in search of

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:26.870
personalization.

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:29.720
So all of our models are
breaking down on every level.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:29.950
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Yep.

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:31.110
I think that's a great
way to put it.

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:32.020
That's exactly right.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:37.460
I mean, everything was broadcast
instead of cable and

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:37.930
everything.

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:41.860
And so now people want that
same kind of customization

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.880
from their communities.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.170
Why should you have to just
choose from A or B, cul-de-sac

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:48.180
or skyscraper?

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.890
For a long time, that
was kind of our

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:51.100
choices in this country.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.410
I'm not really exaggerating
that much.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:55.640
And so now people want lots
of different options.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.300
And that's why this is really
a positive story, because

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.180
people are going to be able to
pick and choose and have a lot

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.270
more options at their disposal
when it comes to where they

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:07.810
want to live, how they want to
live, how they want to spend

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:11.190
their time, which is a huge
part of where you live.

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:14.190
And I think that totally
replicates the kind of

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:16.150
changing narrative of what's
happening in our country.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:17.950
That is a great way
to put it, Jesse.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:21.420
JESSI HEMPEL: So we have time
for one more question.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.570
AUDIENCE: So I was curious
when you were doing your

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:27.290
research if you got into at all
what I would characterize

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:29.340
as sort of the dysfunctionality
or

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:33.450
schizophrenia of a lot of these
suburban towns and their

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:33.990
governments.

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:38.430
Like in the town I live in, and
it's very common the area

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:40.920
I live in, there are these
endless fights about the

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:45.200
school budget and about funding
different things.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.170
And about, should we have green
space or should we let

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:51.940
that space be developed, because
then that would lead

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:52.800
to more ratables?

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.690
Or you can be in one town and
your taxes can be 30% lower

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:00.140
than the town next to you
because the town next to you

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.830
has some big company like IBM in
it or something like that.

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.900
And I was wondering if you got
into at all sort of their

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:08.360
whole suburban model of local
government and whether it's

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.610
going to work going forward.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.130
LEIGH GALLAGHER: You know,
that's a really good question.

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:13.030
I didn't spend too much
time on that.

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.010
I mean, I did want to
go and sit in on

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:15.990
one of those meetings.

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:17.620
I think that would have been
something really fun to do.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.470
But I didn't get
the chance to.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:22.390
You know, that may change.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:23.930
I mean, I think we're
going to have--

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:26.480
the taxpayer base is going to
increasingly shift in the

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.725
suburbs to older people.

00:49:28.725 --> 00:49:31.590
And it's going to become a
bigger, kind of more diverse

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:35.110
mix as the suburbs become kind
of jumbled up and as people

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:36.370
see their incomes decline.

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:38.280
I think those fights are going
to get worse because you're

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:40.220
not going to have one faction
that only wants the

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.280
schools to be good.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.220
You're going to have
multiple factions.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.630
So I don't see that changing.

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:46.500
I think I see it
getting worse.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:50.410
JESSI HEMPEL: Do you think that
people are less involved

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:53.370
in their town or city government
when they live in

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:54.860
cities as opposed to suburbs?

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:56.773
Do they feel less ownership
over it?

00:49:56.773 --> 00:49:58.400
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Well, cities
work in kind of micro

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.050
communities anyway.

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:01.770
So that's a really-- that's
a good question.

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:04.020
I mean, Robert Putnam wrote
great book, "Bowling Alone,"

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:06.450
in the '80s or so.

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:10.590
And a lot of people suggest
that sprawl actually makes

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:14.190
people less connected and feel
less sense of community, even

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:15.170
though that's what
the suburbs were

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.840
designed to kind of foster.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:22.500
So I think you see a lot of
community activism in cities.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.450
JESSI HEMPEL: So last
question, Leigh.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.100
You've been all over the United
States and the world in

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.570
reporting this book.

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:30.720
Do you have a suggestion for
those of us who are being

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.090
priced out of Brooklyn?

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:36.010
Des Moines or Birmingham?

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:37.610
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Well, I always
say in New York we're

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:40.160
really lucky because we have
a lot of those older

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.560
suburbs around us.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.340
So if you do want to move to
the suburbs here, you have

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.540
some great choices.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.310
But I'm still looking for that
perfect utopia where you kind

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:50.290
of cut and paste Brooklyn and
you put it somewhere else

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:51.930
that's cheaper and
more affordable.

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.470
JESSI HEMPEL: Well, thank you
to Google for having us in.

00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:58.432
And thanks to Leigh.

00:50:58.432 --> 00:51:00.280
LEIGH GALLAGHER:
Thanks so much.

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.010
JESSI HEMPEL: And the big
question I'm sure you're all

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:03.500
wondering--

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.780
I can't believe I almost got off
the stage without telling

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.440
you this, but there are
many ways to get

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.780
Leigh's book, in fact.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:14.490
You could buy it, you could
download it on Google Play, or

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:17.350
you could ask for it for
Christmas from a loved one who

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:18.220
could get it for everyone.

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.370
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Great
idea, Jessi.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:20.230
JESSI HEMPEL: What
do you think?

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.530
LEIGH GALLAGHER:
That is great.

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.570
And I think there are a limited
number back there, but

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:22.870
they might--

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:24.190
I don't know if they're still
up there or not, but

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.860
there are some here.

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.270
So feel free to take
one or buy one.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:28.170
JESSI HEMPEL: Thank you.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:28.970
LEIGH GALLAGHER: Thanks
