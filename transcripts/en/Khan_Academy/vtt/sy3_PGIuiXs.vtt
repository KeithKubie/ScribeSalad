00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.447
- [Voiceover] A tea infuser in the shape

00:00:02.447 --> 00:00:05.770
of a right rectangular pyramid is

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.888
seven point nine centimeters tall

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:11.747
and has a base three centimeters long

00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:14.866
and one point five centimeters wide.

00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.426
To make the best tea,

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:20.746
the infuser should be 80% filled with tea.

00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:24.207
What is the volume of
tea, in cubic centimeters,

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:28.026
needed to fill the infuser
to 80% of its capacity.

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:30.785
Round to the nearest tenth.

00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:33.844
All right, so this tea infuser,

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:34.823
it's kind of one of those fancy

00:00:34.823 --> 00:00:36.444
teabags that hold their shape.

00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:39.223
It's the shape of a right
rectangular pyramid.

00:00:39.223 --> 00:00:40.960
So, it's gonna look something like this.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.439
Let's see.

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:44.559
Its base is three centimeters
by one point five centimeters.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.240
So, its base is, let's say
that's three centimeters

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.800
by one point five centimeters.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.319
So, it might look something like that.

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.818
So that's its base and we draw that.

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:57.178
Actually, I can even label it.

00:00:57.178 --> 00:00:59.059
So, this is three centimeters.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.138
This is one point five centimeters

00:01:02.138 --> 00:01:05.861
and then it is seven point
nine centimeters tall.

00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:08.518
So, if we went from the center

00:01:08.518 --> 00:01:10.740
and if we were to go straight up

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.217
it's seven point nine centimeters tall.

00:01:13.217 --> 00:01:17.017
So, this dimension right over
here is seven point nine,

00:01:17.017 --> 00:01:19.057
seven point nine centimeters,

00:01:19.057 --> 00:01:20.999
and it's a right rectangular pyramid.

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:22.780
So, you can kind of think
of the pyramids in Egypt

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.119
although this one, this one, this one's a

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.619
little taller relative
to its base and those

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.320
but you might've seen
these fancy tea infusers.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.520
So, it's gonna look something like this

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.679
and if it was transparent you would

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.958
be able to see this one right back here.

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.653
So, what we can do is we can first

00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:44.954
find the volume of this
right rectangular pyramid

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:45.794
and then they're gonna,

00:01:45.794 --> 00:01:48.656
they say that it should
be 80% filled with tea.

00:01:48.656 --> 00:01:51.475
So, we need to figure out
what 80% of its volume is

00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:53.194
and then that's gonna
tell us what's the volume

00:01:53.194 --> 00:01:57.394
of tea needed to fill the
infuser to 80% of its capacity.

00:01:57.394 --> 00:01:58.275
Now, you might be saying,

00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:00.034
"How do I figure out the volume

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:02.835
"of a right rectangular pyramid?"

00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:05.074
Well, I'm about to tell you that.

00:02:05.074 --> 00:02:06.415
And there's a formula.

00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:07.354
I'm not gonna prove it here

00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:09.254
especially if you're in
the middle of the SATs.

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:10.669
No amount of time for proofs.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:15.050
But the formula here in some
ways is strangely intuitive.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.791
You multiply, essentially, the base,

00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:22.250
the area of the base times the height

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.189
and then divide that by three.

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.652
And so what's the area of the base?

00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:27.770
Well, it's going to be,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.871
it's going to be the
length times the width,

00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:33.010
the length times the width

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.969
and then you multiply
that times the height.

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.648
So, it's gonna be the
length times the width

00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:42.409
times the height and
then divide it by three.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.147
So, in this case, it's gonna be,

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:46.169
and just another way of thinking about it,

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.430
this right over here, the
length times the width,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.350
that's the area of this base,

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.788
and then you multiple it times the height,

00:02:53.788 --> 00:02:55.027
and then you divide by three.

00:02:55.027 --> 00:02:56.648
If you didn't divide
by three you would get

00:02:56.648 --> 00:03:00.507
the volume of the cube, of the cube,

00:03:00.507 --> 00:03:00.886
oh, not the cube.

00:03:00.886 --> 00:03:02.827
I should say the rectangular prism.

00:03:02.827 --> 00:03:03.505
It's not a cube.

00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:05.024
All the dimensions are not the same.

00:03:05.024 --> 00:03:07.782
That would, that would contain this thing.

00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:08.958
But we're not concerned about the

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.638
volume of the rectangular prism.

00:03:10.638 --> 00:03:14.201
We are concerned with the volume

00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.220
of the right rectangular pyramid.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.518
And so, this is going to be
a length three centimeters

00:03:20.518 --> 00:03:24.059
times a width of one
point five centimeters

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.638
times height of seven
point nine centimeters

00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:31.281
divided by, divided by three.

00:03:31.281 --> 00:03:34.860
Well, this three, three
divided by three's just one,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.356
and let's see.

00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:38.534
You have centimeters, whoops, this is.

00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:40.054
Just let me change.

00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:42.116
This is centimeters right over here.

00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:44.635
Divided by three.

00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:45.777
That cancels with that.

00:03:45.777 --> 00:03:47.755
You have centimeters times
centimeters times centimeters.

00:03:47.755 --> 00:03:50.516
It's going to be centimeters cubed.

00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:52.237
So, your volume is going to be, let's see.

00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:54.853
It's gonna be one point five times

00:03:54.853 --> 00:03:59.454
seven point nine centimeters
cubed or cubic centimeters.

00:03:59.454 --> 00:04:02.296
Now, that's the volume of the entire,

00:04:02.296 --> 00:04:04.776
of the entire fancy, I guess, tea infuser.

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:06.536
I call 'em fancy teabags.

00:04:06.536 --> 00:04:08.976
But we wanna know what
80% of its capacity is

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:10.574
because that's how much tea we need.

00:04:10.574 --> 00:04:13.314
So, we wanna multiply this times 80%.

00:04:13.314 --> 00:04:16.074
So, you would multiple zero point eight

00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:20.754
times one point five
times seven point nine

00:04:20.754 --> 00:04:23.853
centimeters cubed and let's see,

00:04:23.853 --> 00:04:26.896
zero point eight times one point five.

00:04:26.896 --> 00:04:29.173
Let's see, that would be
point eight plus point four

00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:32.655
so this is, this part, this
is gonna be one point two

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:36.456
times seven point nine centimeters cubed.

00:04:36.456 --> 00:04:39.286
We could try to approximate this, in fact,

00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:42.191
that this is looking approximately right,

00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:43.589
but we could use a calculator here.

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:46.073
So, let's just feel good about it.

00:04:46.073 --> 00:04:51.022
So, if we say one point
two times seven point nine

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:55.172
we get nine point four eight.

00:04:55.172 --> 00:04:56.293
Nine point four eight

00:04:56.293 --> 00:04:58.851
and if we round to the nearest tenth,

00:04:58.851 --> 00:05:00.331
well, the round to the nearest tenth

00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:01.592
we have an eight in the hundredths place,

00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:03.852
we're gonna round up to nine point five,

00:05:03.852 --> 00:05:08.082
which is exactly that choice.
