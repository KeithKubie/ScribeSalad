00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060
Doug:  Alright, this is our second round

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.379
filming our first review of....

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.760
What we're so excited to see "Fan 4 Stick," as everybody calls it.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.800
Rob's already prepped up here as you can see.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.100
I got whiskey!

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.600
Rob:  Well, then, bring the vodka back.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.139
According to Simon Kinberg on adapting the Fantastic Four comic books in the film:

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.580
"this Fantastic Four movie is sort of a celebration of all the Fantastic Four comics that have preceded it."

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.300
Doug:  Did we see the same trailer? I don't even remember the trailer looking like that!

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.500
Rob: Give me that.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.260
Somehow I don't think that's what we're gonna see.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.220
Doug:  We're just gonna start watching it. So here we go.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.520
Rob:  Twentieth Century Fox!

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.300
We finally made a decent X-Men movie starring no X-men but two.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.900
Doug:  Oh, they emphasized the 'F'!

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.620
Like instead of the 'X'?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.840
Oh that's stupid.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.260
Hehe.  A foreshadow of things to come.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.800
Rob: Yeah

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.700
Fantastic Four:

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.200
Junkyards.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.600
Brooding music.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.460
Jimmy Grimm: It's clobberin' time.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.700
Come here. What'd ya think.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.580
Doug: Really?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.600
Rob: Fantastic!

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.420
I'm sorry, but did we end up in The Explorers reboot

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.060
Rob: Right?

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.400
No. I imagine this is like Doc Brown's device back in the wild west: it's just gonna make a block of ice.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.120
Doug: Awesome!

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.220
I made weed!

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700
Not that bad of an opening, honestly.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.900
Rob:  Uh, yeah... And that's what concerns me.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.200
Reed: It modulates the frequency of matter from one location to another back again

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.270
It's a teleporter.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.060
Doug: Oh come on!  I could follow that, how could a teacher not follow that?

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.700
Rob: Is this pre Betsy Devos or post?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.760
Teacher: You're disqualified.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.900
Rob: Uh...

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.820
Excuse me!

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.660
Doug:  So many questions.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.160
Rob: He blew up the basketball thing.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.900
Even if you don't think that plane went into the desert, he did that!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.600
Doug: Yeah.
Rob:He fucking did that!

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.560
Fuck you, Homer Simpson, he fucking did that!

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.500
Doug:  You just go to Kids Fairs, huh?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.460
Rob:  Yeah, do you think this is how NASA works?

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.020
"How are we gonna get into space?"

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.200
Doug: "SCHOOL FAIR!"

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.040
Rob: "Aha, this paper mache volcano taught me everything!"

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.800
Doug: That's gonna be The Thing?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.280
Rob: He's the muscle.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.960
Doug:  Yeah, he looks really muscular.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.540
They really don't turn the lights on in their school, do they?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.880
You need a flashlight just walked through the hallway.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Rob:  The Altogether Kinda-Uninteresting Blur Four!

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.660
Reed: So, you like music?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.680
Doug:  "No I hate it."

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.560
"HATE music!"

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.360
Rob: Just build yourself an inflatable woman, already!

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.900
Susan: Here you are, Captain Nemo.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.700
Rob: "Uh, that's Mr. Fantastic, thank you!"

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.880
TV: Victor Von Doom is on here.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.700
Rob:  Aaaand can't take seriously.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.300
Director Storm: He deserves another chance.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.800
Doug: Give to him another chance!

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.500
Rob: I'm just waiting for this movie to, like, punch me in the face.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.600
So far, this is not God-awful....

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.460
Doug: Borat?

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.940
Hehe. Borat Dinklage.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.800
It sounds like a Ducktales villain!

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.180
Rob:  "Bless me bagpipes!"

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.300
"It's Von Doom!"

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.720
TV:  Baking soda volcanoes?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.720
Rob: Oh, my God. They made a baking soda volcano reference.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.820
I was five steps ahead of this movie!

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.080
It's trying to be all meta by like:

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.400
"Well, we're going to make fun of the fact that this guy spouting cliches by having the other characters make fun of the cliches."

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.280
But really

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.420
you're still using a bunch of cliches

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.000
actually making it more obvious that you're falling back on cliches.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.100
That can't be Johnny Storm!

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.140
"Why? Cuz he's black?"

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.940
No, because he's not that lame!

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.360
Johnny:  Is that . . . Adolf?

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.140
Doug: Why do you need to make fun of his name?

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.400
His natural name has already been made fun of!

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.260
Rob: [singing] Science montaaaaage.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.150
Science-y thiiiiings!

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.180
Doug: Typing. Music going Dee doot dee doot dee doot dee doot!  Ha ha. Chinese food?

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.300
Rob:  That says they have time to, like, socialize.         Doug:  You eat Chinese and laugh. That's, uh . . .

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.320
That's a lot of character, there.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.760
Susan: I gotta say, it's  fun having you here.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.040
Doug:  Yeah, that's the word I'd use to describe-          Rob:  You haven't had a conversation yet!

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.100
Did they share a line of dialogue yet?                            Doug:  "You don't understand: we ate Chinese!

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.740
We laughed!  That's fun to us!"

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.480
Rob:  I didn't think  I'd say this, but can we get Von Doom in the silly outfit already?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.509
Doug: You know, thank God these superhero things happen to people named "Storm" and "Doom."  I mean, if it just happened to a guy named "Bob"...

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.358
Director Storm:  Answers to questions we don't even know to ask yet.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.017
Rob: Like will there be a sequel. No.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.780
Doom: I could use some . . . [whistles]

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
You want a drink?                                                                 Rob: Oh, you said it buddy!

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.979
Doug: TURN ON A LIGHT!

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.199
FUCK!  Turn on a light!

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.369
Reed:  Who's gonna have my back?                                 Doug: "Well, not me. I'm, like, two pounds."

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.600
He's taller than him!  How is he gonna have his back?!

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.780
Johnny: I'm sorry, this Borat-

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.139
Rob: Fuckin - Oh my God. Oh my God!                            Doug:  This is weird.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.220
We're making these jokes before they're happening.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.639
Rob: But you know what that's a problem

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.600
If I say he looks like Borat, and then they mention that he looks like Borat, then the movie's just stating the obvious.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.200
Doug: It's like in Waterboy, where they make the teacher look like Colonel Sanders,

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.579
and in, like, 20 minutes in it's like "he called colonel Sanders! Ha ha!"  Like, yeah,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.940
we all saw that and got that, like, immediately.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.900
You know, I was gonna say that having their faces covered is not good, because we can't see their expressions...

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.429
But it's so dark anyway, we wouldn't see them, regardless

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.760
Christ is that not interesting.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.620
It's just not an interesting world.                                        Rob: Sure, why not, let's just walk on it.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.440
Doug:  This is why you didn't go!  This is why we didn't send you.  You're bad scientists.                                          Rob: Yeah.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.120
Doug:  "Ah!  Something! Run!  There's finally something in this movie!"

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:18.389
Rob: "Man, it's been like an hour!  I didn't expect plot to happen!"  Oh no, power went out of New York.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.879
I've never seen that before in any comic book movie.

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:27.479
"Can you suck your own dick?  We've been asking that question since you got here. We're so curious.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.100
Can you stick your own head up your ass?

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.820
Can you strangle yourself with your own neck?  Like, we got a billion of these, pal!"

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.140
Doug: [loses it]

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.620
I don't like this dark reboot of Goonies!

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.380
Rob: Do we just get to skip all the scenes where they have to, like, kind of react and deal with their powers and, like-

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.400
Doug: I guess so.                                                                  Rob:  You gotta know Susan Storm is like "fuck you assholes!

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.280
I have these powers because you dicks went into this thing and were like:

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.100
'hey, save us!  Do science-y things!'  And I did my science-y things and then I get shit!"

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.660
Doug: Yeah, I can't tell she's pissed off or if that's just her normal look, like everyone else.

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:09.479
Remember when Johnny was, like, the show-off, and fun and goofy and . . . what's even his character?

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.479
What's any of their characters?

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.660
He's watching the movie we wish we were watching.  Even the bright sunny day . . .

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.280
Rob: That bright sunny day was the color of puke!

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.540
Reed: Does it hurt?                                                                 Rob: Being in this movie, yes.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.830
Doug: "Can I brood with you?"

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.310
Reed: They made it ugly

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.480
Rob: A line that defines this fucking movie!

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.240
"You made it ugly."

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.380
Doug: Oh, he smiled.  Hey hey!                                            Rob:  Hey, he smiled! Woo! Take a shot!

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.479
He smiled!  This may be the only fucking shot I do during this whole thing!  Huh huh!

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.020
Director Storm: Johnny, you need to listen to me- Johnny: I did listen you, and that's what got me here in the first place!

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.520
Doug:  I agree.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.520
There's way too much listening in this movie.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.620
Scientist:  Do you have a visual?

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.970
Rob: Yes, we have a visual.  "Can you describe it?"  No, it's uninteresting.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.046
Wait, we have a new visual kind of silly.

00:06:56.046 --> 00:06:58.569
Doug: He turned into a mech turtle.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.439
It's like I'm playing of really inferior version of System Shock or something.                                                             Doug: "I am the crash kill Dummy."

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.820
So far, he's used to stretchy powers to push people and jump over a rail.  Fantastic!

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.620
See Bruce Campbell flying by - "Ahhhh!"

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.280
Rob: "My God!  how do you stop it?"

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.690
Doug: Von Doom is like "I guess I should destroy the world . . . I guess."

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:26.820
Rob: It'd be so much better if Von Doom had like the voice of Archer. "Oh my God.  I can't believe you guys still trying to attack!"

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.920
Doug:  Oh no, giant rock. I only have, like, a million rocks to throw at this giant rock.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.490
Rob: "Okay, keep trying, guys."  They're like the Dane Cook of Superhero teams!

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.340
Reed: Enough!

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.049
Doug: "Ok. That worked. That word he said? I'm out."

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:46.210
Rob:  "You know, I was gonna do it, but he enough 'enough,' so I'm totally gonna stop now and - Oops!  Fooled you!"

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.259
What? What what just happened? I dunno.                      Doug: "I don't know, but we did it together."

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.020
Rob: Hooray, we did that!

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.960
Doug: We kinda suck . . .

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.400
Rob: Oh really?  Three people worked on the screenplay, and it was produced by seven people, and it somehow didn't come out good?!

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.179
You don't say!

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.130
Doug: Philip Glass??  What?!                                                Rob: Philip Glass is slumming it.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.480
Doug:  Well, let's be honest,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.880
has he ever really started?  You know,  it's like the movie itself is so embarrassed to be Fantastic Four that they

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.300
could never verbally say it out loud.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.840
Rob: Until the very end-

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.880
Doug: No! They didn't say it!                                                 Rob:  That's right! They fucking cut-

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.000
All three of them seem like perfectly decent actors, so it's not like I'm sitting here

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.480
going, like, "oh everybody's bad."

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:38.259
But the script gave them no lines to chew on!
Doug: I'd much rather have something take a risk and fail,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:46.629
than something play it safe, bland, not interesting all the way through. Because at least the failure will leave an impact.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.480
Rob: I will play the first movie left more of an impact.  Doug: Yeah, I remember it!

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.920
Rob: And it was like,  I remember how bad this movie is. Doug: Yeah.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.900
And that about it and uh... And we see you next time. Bye!

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.520
Rob: [groans]
Doug:  Bad movie . . .
