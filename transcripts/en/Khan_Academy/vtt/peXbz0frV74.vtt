00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.140
I'm going to do a couple more
moment and force problems,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.320
especially because I think
I might have bungled the

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.680
terminology in the previous
video because I kept confusing

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.120
clockwise with counterclockwise.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.370
This time I'll try to
be more consistent.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.080
Let me draw my lever again.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.590
My seesaw.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.680
So that's my seesaw, and that is
my axis of rotation, or my

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.270
fulcrum, or my pivot point,
whatever you want to call it.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.490
And let me throw a bunch
of forces on there.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.760
So let's say that I have a
10-Newton force and it is at a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.830
distance of 10, so distance
is equal to 10.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.310
The moment arm distance is 10.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:58.140
Let's say that I have a
50-Newton force and its moment

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.180
arm distance is equal to 8.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.710
Let's say that I have a 5-Newton
force, and its moment

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.292
arm distance is 4.

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:15.360
The distance is equal to 4.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600
That's enough for that side.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:31.210
And let's say I have a I'm
going to switch colors.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.580
Actually, no, I'm going to keep
it all the same color and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.280
then we'll use colors to
differentiate between

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.960
clockwise and counterclockwise
so I don't bungle

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.300
everything up again.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.520
So let's say I have a 10-Newton
force here.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.055
And, of course, these vectors
aren't proportional to

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:46.750
actually what I drew.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.230
50 Newtons would be huge if
these were the actual vectors.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.810
And let's say that that moment
arm distance is 3.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.670
Let me do a couple more.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.220
And let's say I have a moment
arm distance of 8.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:13.130
I have a clockwise force of 20
Newtons, And let's say at a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.330
distance of 10 again, so
distance is equal to 10, I

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.680
have my mystery force.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.010
It's going to act in a
counterclockwise direction and

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.500
I want to know what
it needs to be.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.670
So whenever you do any of
these moment of force

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.680
problems, and you say, well,
what does the force need to be

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.340
in order for this see
saw to not rotate?

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.490
You just say, well, all the
clockwise moments have to

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.800
equal all of the
counterclockwise moments, So

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.500
clockwise moments equal
counterclockwise.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.750
I'll do them in different
colors.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.560
So what are all the
clockwise moments?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.140
Well, clockwise is this
direction, right?

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.940
That's the way a clock goes.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.052
So this is clockwise,
that is clockwise.

00:03:04.052 --> 00:03:06.290
I want to go in this
direction.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.710
And so this is clockwise.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.950
What are all the clockwise
moments?

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.450
It's 10 Newtons times its
moment arm distance 10.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.650
So 10 times 10 plus 5 Newtons
times this moment arm distance

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.310
4, plus 5 times 4, plus 20
Newtons times its moment arm

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.200
distance of 8, plus 20 times 8,
and that's going to equal

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.400
the counterclockwise moments,
and so the leftover ones are

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.280
counterclockwise.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.590
So we have 50 Newtons acting
downward here, and that's

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.240
counterclockwise, and it's at
a distance of 8 from the

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.240
moment arm, so 50 times 8.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.120
Let's see, we don't
have any other

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.890
counterclockwise on that side.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.600
This is counterclockwise,
right?

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.290
We have 10 Newtons acting
in the counterclockwise

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.860
direction, and its moment arm
distance is 3, plus 10 times

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.680
3, and we're assuming our
mystery force, which is at a

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.390
distance of 10, is also
counterclockwise,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.000
plus force times 10.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.120
And now we simplify.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.630
And I'll just go to a neutral
color because this

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.290
is just math now.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.610
100 plus 20 plus 160 is equal
to-- what's 50 times 8?

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:23.220
That's 400 plus 30 plus 10F.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.770
What is this?

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.500
2, 50 times 8.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.470
Right, that's 400.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.480
OK, this is 120 plus
a 160 is 280.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:41.860
280 is equal to 430-- this is
a good example-- plus 10F, I

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.550
just realized.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.390
Subtract 430 from both sides.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.610
So what's 430 minus 280?

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.050
It's 150.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.540
So it's minus 150
is equal to 10F.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.260
So F is equal to minus
15 Newtons in the

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.290
counterclockwise direction.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.240
So F is minus 15 Newtons
in the counterclockwise

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.830
direction, or it means that
it is 15 Newtons.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.620
We assumed that it was in the
counterclockwise direction,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.790
but when we did the math,
we got a minus number.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.490
[SNEEZE]

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.060
Excuse me.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.860
I apologize if I blew out your
speakers with that sneeze.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.740
But anyway, we assume it was
going in the counterclockwise

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.330
direction, but when we did the
math, we got a negative

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.340
number, so that means it's
actually operating in the

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.770
clockwise direction at 15
Newtons at a distance of 10

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.630
from the moment arm.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.160
Hopefully, that one was less
confusing than the last one.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.000
So let me do another problem,
and these actually used to

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.320
confuse me when I first learned
about moments, but in

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.260
some ways, they're the
most useful ones.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.030
So let's say that I have
some type of table.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.940
I'll draw it in wood.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.190
It's a wood table.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.090
That's my table.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.920
And I have a leg here,
I have a leg here.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:26.020
Let's say that the center
of mass of the top of

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.390
the table is here.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.350
It's at the center.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.010
And let's say that
it has a weight.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.410
It has a weight going down.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.370
What's a reasonable weight?

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.540
Let's say 20 Newtons.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.480
It has a weight of 20 Newtons.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.510
Let's say that I place some
textbooks on top of this

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.310
table, or box, just to make
the drawing simpler.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.010
Let's say I place a box there.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.140
Let's say the box weighs 10
kilograms, which would be

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.350
about 100 Newtons.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:16.050
So let's say it weighs
about 100 Newtons.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.050
So what I want to figure out,
what I need to figure out, is

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:25.090
how much weight is being
put onto each of

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.540
the legs of the table?

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.460
And this might not have even
been obviously a moment

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.820
problem, but you'll see in
a second it really is.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.740
So how do we know that?

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.100
Well, both of these legs are
supporting the table, right?

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.020
Whatever the table is exerting
downwards, the leg is exerting

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:45.220
upwards, so that's the amount of
force that each of the legs

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.120
are holding.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.930
So what we do is we pick-- so
let's just pick this leg, just

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.780
because I'm picking
it arbitrarily.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.040
Let's pick this leg,
and let's pick an

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.340
arbitrary axis of rotation.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.920
Well, let's pick this is as
our axis of rotation.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.080
Why do I pick that as the
axis of rotation?

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.690
Because think of it this way.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.950
If this leg started pushing more
than it needed to, the

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.320
whole table would rotate in the

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.390
counterclockwise direction.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.210
Or the other way, if this leg
started to weaken and started

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.900
to buckle and couldn't hold
its force, the table would

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.130
rotate down this way, and it
would rotate around the other

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.760
leg, assuming that the other
leg doesn't fail.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.740
We're assuming that this leg
is just going to do its job

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.280
and it's not going to move
one way or the other.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.110
But this leg, that's why we're
thinking about it that way.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.330
If it was too weak, the whole
table would rotate in the

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.110
clockwise direction, and if it
was somehow exerting extra

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.960
force, which we know a leg
can't, but let's say if it was

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.380
a spring or something like that,
then the whole table

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.409
would rotate in the
counterclockwise direction.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:48.560
So once we set that up, we can
actually set this up as a

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.120
moment problem.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.450
So what is the force
of the leg?

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.470
So the whole table is exerting
some type of-- if this leg

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.960
wasn't here, the whole table
would have a net clockwise

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.550
moment, right?

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.690
The whole table would tilt down
and fall down like that.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.750
So the leg must be exerting a
counterclockwise moment in

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.790
order to keep it stationary.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.640
So the leg must be exerting
a force upward right here.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.850
The force of the leg, right?

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:14.400
We know that.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.190
We know that from
basic physics.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.690
There's some force coming down
here and the leg is doing an

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.650
equal opposite force upwards.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.260
So what is that force
of that leg?

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.740
And one thing I should
have told you

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.720
is all of the distances.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:34.310
Let's say that this distance
between this leg and the book

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.610
is 1 meter-- or the box.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:42.550
Let's say that this distance
between the leg and the center

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.980
of mass is 2 meters, and so
this is also 2 meters.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.390
OK, so we can now set this
up as a moment problem.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.430
So remember, all of the
clockwise moments have to

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.090
equal all of the
counterclockwise moments.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.930
So what are all of the
clockwise moments?

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.060
What are all of the things that
want to make the table

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:06.790
rotate this way or this way?

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.920
Well, the leg is the
only thing keeping

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.400
it from doing that.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.290
So everything else is

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.840
essentially a clockwise moment.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.780
So we have this 100 Newtons,
and it is 1 meter away.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.270
Its moment arm distance is 1.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.500
So these are all the clockwise
moments, 100 times 1, right?

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.320
It's 100 Newtons acting
downwards in the clockwise

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:31.710
direction, clockwise moment, and
it's 1 meter away, plus we

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.230
have the center of mass at the
top of the table, which is 20

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.670
Newtons, plus 20 Newtons, and
that is 2 meters away from our

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:44.250
designated axis,
so 20 times 2.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.950
And you might say, well, isn't
this leg exerting some force?

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.780
Well, sure it is, but its
distance from our designated

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.780
axis is zero, so its moment
of force is zero.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.420
Even if it is exerting a million
pounds or a million

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.510
Newtons, its moment of force,
or its torque, would be zero

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.470
because its moment arm distance
is zero, so we can

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.330
ignore it, which makes
things simple.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.610
So those were the only
clockwise moments.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.490
And what's the counterclockwise
moment?

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.350
Well, that's going to be the
force exerted by this leg.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.680
That's what's keeping the whole
thing from rotating.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.480
So it's the force of
the leg times its

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.370
distance from our axis.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.770
Well, this is a total of 4
meters, which we've said here,

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.020
times 4 meters.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.180
And so we can just solve.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.870
We get 100 plus 40, so we get
140 is equal to the force of

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.110
the leg times 4.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:48.040
So what's 140-- 4 goes
into 140 35 times?

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.430
My math is not so good.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.940
Is that right?

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.730
4 times 30 is 120.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.690
120 plus 20.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.370
So the force of the leg
is 35 Newtons upwards.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.040
And since this isn't moving,
we know that the downward

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.130
force right here must
be 35 Newtons.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.630
And so there's a couple of ways
we can think about it.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:14.950
If this leg is supporting 35
Newtons and we have a total

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.850
weight here of 120 Newtons, our
total weight, the weight

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.180
at the top of the
table plus the

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.270
bookshelf, that's 120 Newtons.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.120
So the balance of this
must be supported by

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.820
something or someone.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.060
So the balance of this
is going to be

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.830
supported by this leg.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.810
So it's 120 minus 35 is what?

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:34.120
[PHONE RINGS]

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.640
Oh, my phone is ringing.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.010
120 minus 35 is what?

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.710
120 minus 30 is 90.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.720
And then 90 minus
5 is 85 Newtons.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.540
It's so disconcerting
when my phone rings.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.340
I have trouble focusing.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.000
Anyway, it's probably because
my phone sounds

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.160
like a freight train.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.940
Anyway, so there you go.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.800
This type of problem is actually
key to, as you can

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.660
imagine, bridge builders, or
furniture manufacturers, or

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.730
civil engineers who are bridge
builders, or architects,

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.160
because you actually have to
figure out, well, if I design

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.650
something a certain way, I have
to figure out how much

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.160
weight each of the supporting
structures

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.650
will have to support.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.920
And as you can imagine,
why is this one

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.670
supporting more weight?

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.990
Why is this leg supporting more
weight than that leg?

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.340
Well, because this book, which
is 100 Newtons, which is a

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.680
significant amount of the total
weight, is much closer

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.670
to this leg than it
is to this leg.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.290
If we put it to the center, they
would balance, and then

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.730
if we push it further to the
right, then this leg would

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.310
start bearing more
of the weight.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.310
Anyway, hopefully you found
that interesting, and

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.640
hopefully, I didn't
confuse you.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.160
And I will see you
in future videos.
