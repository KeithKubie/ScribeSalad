00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.160
- [Instructor] So in this
video we're going to revisit

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.330
another super simple economy that only has

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.290
a farmer and a builder on an island.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.040
And we're gonna review
what we learned about the

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.500
multiplier and the marginal
propensity to consume,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.830
but we're gonna do it a
little bit more abstractly.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.910
So just as a bit of a review,
the marginal propensity

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.820
to consume, this is a number
usually between zero and one

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.640
that says if you were
to get an extra dollar,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.490
how much of that would you spend?

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.470
And so your marginal propensity to consume

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.070
if it is 0.25, that means that
if you were to get a dollar

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.960
you would spend 25 cents of it.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.650
If your marginal propensity
to consume is 0.6,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.370
that means that if you were to get $1,000,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.870
you would spent six tenths of it,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.190
you would spend $600.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.440
And so using this idea, and I'm gonna keep

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.270
it abstract, let's just say that we start

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.630
with the farmer, she spends
X dollars on products

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.060
or services from the builder.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.720
So X dollars goes to the builder,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.250
now what's the builder going to do?

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.180
And we talked about this
in the previous video.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.660
The builder's gonna say, I have X dollars,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.940
we're gonna assume everyone on this island

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.220
has the same marginal
propensity to consume,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.170
he's now going to spend some of it.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.460
And he only has one place to spend it,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.590
it's a very simple economy,
what's he going to spend?

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.130
Well he's going to spend
X times the marginal

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.030
propensity to consume.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.070
If this seems very
abstract, think about it.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.500
If X was $1,000, and if
the marginal propensity

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.740
to consume is let's say 25 hundredths,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.940
or 0.25, now he's going to spend $1,000

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.350
times 0.25, which would be $250.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.930
But now all of a sudden, the
farmer has this much money,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.430
and what's she going to do?

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.850
Well she's going to spend this times

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.180
the marginal propensity to consume.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.110
So she is now going to
spend X times the marginal

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.760
propensity to consume, which is how much

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.530
she got from the builder, and how much of

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.490
that is she going to spend?

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.250
Well that times the marginal propensity

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.360
to consume again.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.750
So it would be the marginal
propensity to consume squared.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.840
And then this just keeps
going on and on and on.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690
And so he's gonna get this amount,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.530
what's he gonna spend?

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.610
Well he's gonna spend
that times the marginal

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.580
propensity to consume again,
so it's going to be that,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.550
and we could just keep
going on and on and on,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.010
but if we wanna figure out
how much increased output

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.440
is there in this economy
because of that initial

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.190
expenditure of X dollars, well you would

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.620
just sum everything up.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.240
It would be X plus X times
the marginal propensity

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.919
to consume plus X times
the marginal propensity

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.010
to consume squared, goes on and on and on.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.100
If we want, we can factor out an X,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.350
so X times one plus marginal
propensity to consume

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.970
plus marginal propensity
to consume squared

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.480
on and on and on, and you might recognize

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.210
from your algebra class,
or maybe your pre-calculus

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.880
class that this is an
infinite geometric series

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.380
that we cover in other
videos, and you can actually

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.010
sum this up, it's one of the cooler things

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.320
in mathematics.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.750
This can be summed up
as being equal to one

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.290
over one minus the marginal
propensity to consume.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.800
And so you have that
initial expenditure of X,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.260
but the total amount of output
is X times this expression,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.250
and so that's why this
expression right over here

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.530
is known as the multiplier.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.480
If the farmer spent $1
initially on the builder,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.040
well it's going to be $1
times this expression,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.700
in terms of how much
increased output there is

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.830
in the simplified economy.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.590
So this is the multiplier.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.100
Now let's do something interesting

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.610
and something new that
we hadn't done before.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.190
Let's imagine that somehow
some magic government

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.230
shows up on this island and
decides to tax the farmer.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.970
Just says, hey, we're
gonna take some money

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.490
from this farmer for whatever it might be,

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.200
and so this magic government, the amount

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.300
that they take away, we
will call that delta T,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.600
you could sometimes do that
as your change in taxes.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.040
So this is positive, that
means that the government

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.300
is getting money, and
money's being taken away

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.870
from the farmer.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.260
So what's gonna be, what's
the farmer going to do?

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.530
Well, from the farmer's point of view,

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.160
they, she now has the
delta T less dollars,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.380
and so that's going to
affect her consumption.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.510
It's going to decrease her consumption.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.170
How much is it going to
decrease her consumption by?

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.260
Well it's gonna be the
amount she has to give

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.730
to the government, times
her marginal propensity

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.560
to consume.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.320
Times the marginal propensity to consume.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.610
Why does this make sense?

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.400
Well in the situation where
if I give the farmer a dollar,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.320
let's say the marginal
propensity to consume

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.320
is 0.5, if I gave her a dollar,
she would spend 50 cents.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.530
If I took a dollar away from her,

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.580
she would spend 50 cents less.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.400
The amount I take away,
times the marginal propensity

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.060
to consume.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.290
But if this is the effect on the farmer,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.410
what's going to be the
total effect on output?

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.880
Well, this is the situation
where essentially X

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.010
is equal to that.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.150
If I take away delta T from the farmer,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.440
that's essentially saying
X is equal to this thing

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.840
right over here.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.150
So X is equal to this
thing right over here,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
and so what's going to be the impact?

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.930
Well, the total output
is going to be equal

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.930
to X, which is negative delta T times the

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.790
marginal propensity to consume,

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.400
marginal propensity to consume,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.660
that part right over here, that is that,

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.220
times this, time the multiplier.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.010
Times one over one minus
the marginal propensity

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.370
to consume.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.480
Or if you wanna express this multiplier

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.650
as something multiplying
by that increase in taxes,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.650
this would be equal to delta T times

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.940
the negative of your marginal
propensity to consume

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.730
over one minus the marginal
propensity to consume.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.630
And so this expression,
what seems all fancy

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.880
and technical, but all
it's doing is saying,

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.170
alright look, if you take
money away from the farmer,

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.450
this would be the effect
on her initial spend,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.180
and so then you get this
multiplier on the taxes,

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.340
and this negative is because
if you have a positive

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.330
taxation right over here, it would have a

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.780
decrease in output
because of the multiplier.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.380
And some of you might have seen something

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.740
where the denominator looks different,

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.830
you might see something called an MPS,

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.830
or marginal propensity to save.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.900
And that just comes out of the simple idea

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.453
that if I have, let's say
that I have a marginal

00:06:31.453 --> 00:06:35.590
propensity to consume of 0.3,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.680
well that means for every dollar I get,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.750
I'm gonna spend 30 cents of it.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.850
Well how much am I going to save?

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.050
Well if I spend 30 cents,
I'm gonna save the rest,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.720
so my marginal propensity
to save in this situation

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.640
would be 70 cents.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.610
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.680
your marginal propensity to consume

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.610
plus your marginal propensity to save

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.370
is equal to one, or another
way of thinking about it,

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.440
subtract the marginal
propensity to consume

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.190
from both sides, your
marginal propensity to save

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.810
is equal to one minus your
marginal propensity to consume.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.610
And so that's why this
thing is the exact same

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.880
thing as this thing, and so sometimes,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.260
you might see a formula
for the tax multiplier,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.506
let me write this down.

00:07:16.506 --> 00:07:21.506
Tax multiplier, that looks like this,

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.471
where they write the
negative of the marginal

00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:28.520
propensity to consume
over, instead of one minus

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.240
the marginal propensity to consume,

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.340
they write the marginal
propensity to save.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.010
And when you're learning
this in economics,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.270
it all seems so cryptic,
where did this come from,

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.920
MPS, MPC, people try to
memorize these things,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.300
but as you can see, it's
coming out of reasonably

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.810
straightforward algebra.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.648
Economists sometimes have a knack for

00:07:45.648 --> 00:07:47.820
making straightforward
algebra seem a little bit

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.070
more complicated than it needs to.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.130
In the next video, I'll
do some worked examples

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.740
so that we can actually
apply these formulas

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.990
to see, and see that it makes sense.
