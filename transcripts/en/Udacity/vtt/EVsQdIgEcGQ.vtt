00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
So what does recognition entail?

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.920
Well it's actually many different tasks.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.780
One example is somebody might show
you a particular area and say,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.350
you know, is that a lamp?

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.442
Okay, and that's verification.

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:15.270
And the, this particular case what
I mean is that it's verification of

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.730
a general class.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.260
Okay?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.310
Is this thing a lamp?

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.470
We'll get to identification in a minute.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.520
Another possibility is you might say,
are there any people here?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.000
And that would be detection.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.740
That is, I haven't told you
where in the image to look,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.440
I just want to know are there
any people in this scene.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.130
Another is,
I might have a specific instance.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.840
And I might show you an example,
and say is that Potala Palace?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.420
That's in this particular case,
of a location, of a thing.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.617
Sometimes, identification,
we all know, is in faces, right?

00:00:41.617 --> 00:00:43.916
I show you and say,
you know, is this Megan?

00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:46.302
And you say, no,
that's not nearly as nice as Megan.

00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:49.100
But anyway, that's identification.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.940
A more interesting question is what
we'll loosely call categorization,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.680
all right?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.770
So you're generally putting out a label.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.240
You know, here we have this label that
in the background there are mountains,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.220
and there's trees over here,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.720
there's people here, vendors, this thing
was a street lamp, these are buildings.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.995
And this is what's referred to
as object categorization and

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:07.620
we're going to talk more about that.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.440
But we might also want to
just label the entire scene.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.460
Say you know, this is an outdoor
city where people go and buy stuff.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.460
All right, so that was also,
would entail some form of recognition.
