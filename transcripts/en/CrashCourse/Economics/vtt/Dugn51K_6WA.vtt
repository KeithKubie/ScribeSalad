Adriene: Welcome to Crash Course: Economics. I'm Adriene Hill.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.540
Jacob: And I'm Jacob Clifford. And today we're going to talk about money and finance.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.480
Adriene: I know we said in the first episode that economics isn't really about money...

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.320
Jacob: Economics isn't about getting rich quick, but it all boils down to trading things you have for the things you want.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.060
Adriene: Like, I've got this giant zucchini, but I'd love that piece of pizza. Want to trade?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.200
Jacob: No way!

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:31.820
[Theme Music]

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.420
Imagine you live in a world without money, and you're a dentist that wants to go buy a car.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.660
First you need to find a bunch of auto workers who need dental work.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.280
And if these workers don't want dental services and prefer being paid in something else like

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.300
flat-screen TV's, then you have to find TV manufacturers that have toothaches.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.960
Try posting that on Craigslist...

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.720
This is called the "barter system", and it takes a lot of time and energy.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.720
Of course, many people still barter for stuff, but for most transactions, we use money.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.800
Which is a way more efficient way to do business.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.440
The people who really need dental care will pay you with money, which you can now use to buy a car.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.020
Economists point out that money serves three main purposes.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.120
First, it acts as a "medium of exchange". It's generally accepted for payment for goods and services.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.040
Now, that medium of exchange means we're not stuck in the barter system.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.140
Next, money can be used as a "store of value".

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.660
The reason why a dentist doesn't normally accept fruit or baked goods is because you can't save those things up to go buy things like cars.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.520
Plus,  bananas go bad pretty quickly in a safe deposit box.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.700
Money also serves as a "unit of account".

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.040
We don't measure the value of cars in bananas, muffins, or root canals.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.340
Instead, we use money because it's a standardized metric that allows us to measure the relative value of things.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.160
Adriene: Most people assume that money is just cash and coins, issued and endorsed by a government.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.080
Coins have been used for thousands of years, and they're a great example of money,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.140
but technically money is anything that's used as a medium of exchange.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.660
For example, cigarettes were used as money in prisons until smoking bans were put in place.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.660
Nowadays, prisoners use postage stamps and even small packages of mackerel as currency.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.740
Animals like cattle and sheep, also sacks of grain, all these have been used as money.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.780
Some societies even used feathers or shells.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.660
The indigenous people on Yap Island in the Pacific Ocean used money called "rai stones".

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.820
These were large doughnut-shaped disks made out of limestone.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.980
The largest ones are around ten feet wide, and weigh four tons.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.700
The point is what economists consider money is anything that's accepted as a medium of exchange.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.600
And that's changed a lot over time.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.600
Today, cash and coins are often used as money since they're easy to carry around, physically durable, and hard to counterfeit.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.160
But a lot of money today doesn't end up in anyone's pocket, or wallet, or duffel bags, or even wheelbarrows.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.320
It moves around electronically.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.760
Increasingly, people get paid in the form of checks or direct deposits into their bank.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.220
A lot of our money isn't physical. It's digital. It exists on some bank's computer.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.620
And as long as that computer is secure, and the zombie apocalypse doesn't permanently knock out the power,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.000
and your nation's monetary system is functioning as it should, those electronic dollars do all the things they're supposed to do.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.980
Another form of digital money that you often hear about is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that is not issued or regulated by a specific country.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.460
But since some people accept it as payment, many economists consider it money.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.300
Unlike other electronic currency, Bitcoin doesn't involve a bank, so people can, in theory, buy things more anonymously.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.440
This appeals to people who don't trust central banks, and also people who want to buy illegal stuff online.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.320
That illegal trade means law enforcement and regulators are also very interested in Bitcoin.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.980
Bitcoin isn't only for internet drug deals though.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.320
There's a lot of speculation in Bitcoin, meaning people buy up Bitcoins, hoping to turn a profit on them.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:49.540
This makes Bitcoin more of a speculative asset, and limits its use in buying and selling actual goods and services.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.240
Could Bitcoin or another virtual currency be how everyone pays for things in the future?

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.560
Who knows! But if anyone wants to give me 10 Bitcoin for this zucchini, we've got a deal.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.900
Jacob: There's kind of a glaring question here: what makes these pieces of paper so valuable?

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.300
Well, in the past, each dollar issued by the U.S. government was redeemable for a specific amount of gold.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.920
That was called the "gold standard", and it meant that the government couldn't issue more money than it had in gold reserves.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.340
Back in the 1930's, the U.S. decided to move off the gold standard and some people freaked out about not having something tangible to back our money.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.100
But it's important to remember that money, whether it's cash, or gold, or small pouches of mackerel, is all about confidence.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.480
The Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman said, "The pieces of green paper have value because everyone thinks they have value."

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.360
With that in mind, a gold standard, or even a mackerel standard,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.060
might not make money more valuable or reliable.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.580
A lot of economists agree with this, which is why no country uses the gold standard.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.660
There are calls by some politicians to bring it back, but that's probably never gonna happen. Sorry, Ron Paul.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.880
Adriene: Okay, I know we said economics is not about the stock market.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.540
But now it's time to explain what it is, and why it's important.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.440
The stock market is just one piece of something much bigger: the financial system.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.220
To understand the financial system, you need to picture two different groups.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:11.440
First, you have "lenders". Sometimes these are corporations with a bunch of cash, but lenders can also be ordinary households, people like you and me.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.380
Us regular folks are gonna need money in the future to retire, or send our kids to college, or go on a vacation to Yap Island.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.180
So we need a way to turn the money we have now into more money in the future.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.880
The second group is "borrowers". There are several different kinds of borrowers.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.520
First you have other households who want to borrow money to buy stuff like a car or a house.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.200
You also have businesses that have a great idea for a new product, but that have a problem.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.680
They need money to make the product, and they'll have money when the finished products are sold.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.220
But for now, they need to borrow money to invest in capital - things like machinery, tools, and factories.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:53.260
And they'll pay it back once they make some sales. Basically they need to buy stuff to produce other stuff.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.300
Third, you have governments who need to to borrow money because they're spending more than they're bringing in.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.540
So you have lenders who have money now and want to turn it into more money in the future.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.100
And you have borrowers who need money now and will repay it in the future.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.420
The financial system is a network of institutions, markets, and contracts that brings these

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.700
two groups together. Lenders put money into the financial system, which loans it out to borrowers.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.000
These borrowers pay back those loans with interest, which makes it worth the lender's time. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.680
There are three ways this exchange takes place. The first is banks.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.740
A lender deposits money in a bank, and then the bank turns around and loans that money

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.320
to a family who wants to buy a house or a business that wants to expand.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:44.020
As those borrowers pay the interest on their loans, the bank takes part of that money to cover their costs and passes the rest along to the depositor.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.320
The second way lenders an borrowers link up is through the "bond market".

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.620
A government or large corporation that needs to borrow money will sell bonds to lenders.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:02.500
A bond is basically an IOU in which the borrower agrees to pay regular interest payments and promises to repay all of the money back at a set date in the future.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.200
If that lender decides they'd rather have cash now, they're free to sell that bond to another party.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.100
The third way lenders and borrowers link up is through - you guessed it - the stock market.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.440
Say Jacob and I want to expand our lemonade business, but we don't have the money to do it.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.780
We could sell stock, which is basically slices of ownership in the company.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.800
Households get the stock, and we get the cash.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.780
If our company profits in the future, and we become lemonade moguls, we'll share some of

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.740
those profits with the shareholders, or the shareholders can sell the stock at a higher price.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.760
Either way, they make money if the company's profitable. Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.220
So banks and bonds have something in common. They're dealing in something called "debt".

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:50.380
If you get a loan from a bank, or if you're a government that sells a bond, the amount you must repay is set.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:56.260
In almost all cases, you're obligated to pay back the amount you borrowed with a set amount of interest.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.420
Stocks, on the other hand, are known as equity.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.600
If a company enjoys high profits,
shareholders get more money.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.640
If a company goes bankrupt, shareholders may get nothing.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.340
In the news, you'll hear about changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:15.440
But fluctuations in stock markets are not reliable indicators of how the economy's doing.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.880
Often changes in the stock market are reactions to real, or just perceived,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:26.060
changes in economic fundamentals like consumer confidence, the unemployment rate, and GDP growth.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:31.840
Bonds and stocks also have something in common. They're traded on markets for financial instruments.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:40.440
Bonds are debt instruments, and stocks are equity instruments, but they're both pieces of paper that are traded on markets with many buyers and sellers.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:50.500
Banks, on the other hand, are financial institutions. With the help of the FDIC, they safeguard our money while making loans to individual households and businesses.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.760
Jacob: So why do we even need this complicated financial system? Why don't households take their savings and lend them out directly?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.340
Well, if you want to loan out your life savings to your neighbor so he can launch his artisanal smart phone business, go for it!

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.540
But that's a pretty risky bet, so you're more likely to use a financial system.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.600
Financial markets, with instruments like stocks and bonds, allow borrowers to crowd source the money they need to borrow.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.920
They raise their capital from lots of investors and
spread the risk around. Banks do the same thing.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.840
They accumulate small deposits from thousands of people and use that to make loans.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.680
It's like Kickstarter except better because you get money as opposed to an earnest thank you email.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.120
From the lender's point of view, a financial system allows you to spread your savings over dozens or hundreds of different loans.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:35.080
A few companies might go bankrupt and a few people might pay back their car loans, but those losses will be offset by borrowers who do pay back their loans.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.800
You don't have to put all your eggs in one basket.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.960
Adriene: So that's money in the financial system. The thing to remember here is that this stuff is not just an abstraction or someone else's concern.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:51.500
Almost all of us are lenders and borrowers at some point in our lives, and understanding lending and borrowing is a big deal.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.040
While it might seem like you're borrowing from a faceless institution,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:04.060
you might be borrowing my money from that faceless institution, and I'm gonna need that back if I can't get anyone to accept this zucchini as payment.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.600
Thanks for watching!

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:12.600
Jacob: Crash Course Economics was made with the help of all these nice people who believe in some way that there's value in those green pieces of paper.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:21.420
Your green piece of paper can help support Crash Course on Patreon. You can help keep Crash Course free for everyone, forever. And you get good rewards.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.340
Thanks for watching! DFTBA!
