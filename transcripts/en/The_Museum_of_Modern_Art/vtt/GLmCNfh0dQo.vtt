00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.510
Independent filmmaking didn't begin with the
Sundance film festival.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.820
There were always independent films being
made outside of the Hollywood studio system.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.670
One thing I've tried to do here at the Museum
is program film series that go beyond the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.130
idea of the masterpiece

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.160
beyond the single great standalone film and
present that sort of second level of accomplishment

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.420
which was very widespread in Hollywood.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.470
The good, but not great—

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.960
"Come back out of that dreamworld, Rembrandt."

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.739
—the interesting, but not perfect.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.480
There's a lot of material in there that can
be reclaimed, that is immensely enjoyable

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.100
stylistically sophisticated,
good, solid filmmaking

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.140
that is not going to win Oscars, is not going
to break the Box Office

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.350
but is part of what made up the experience
of film going during the classical era.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.469
My name is Dave Kehr.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.789
I'm a curator in the Department of Film at
the Museum of Modern Art

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.780
and today we're going to take a look at B
movies

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.200
and specifically through the lens of the Republic
Pictures library.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.940
Republic was the best established, the best
known of the Poverty Row Studios.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.060
They made so many films.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.710
They feel like a major in most ways—except
they weren't.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.600
They cost one fifth of what a Hollywood film
would cost, a major studio Hollywood film

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.600
would cost.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.820
The term “B movie” has lost a little bit
of its original meaning over the years

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.740
and it's come to mean just a low-budget film.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.790
Originally, it meant something very specific.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.581
These were movies designed to be shown on
the lower half of double bills

00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:47.440
mostly in the '30s and '40s when the system evolved.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.660
Running about an hour, with no stars.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.980
And they were meant to be sold to the theaters on the basis of a flat rental fee rather than a percentage of the gross

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:05.280
which meant that a lot of the smaller theaters, small town theaters that couldn't afford the big studio films

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:14.560
would take movies from so called "Poverty Row" studios, of which Republic was the littlest giant.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.840
Today when people talk about B movies, they're
mainly talking about cheap horror films from

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.840
the '60s and ‘70s…

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.090
“The killers are eating the flesh of the
people they murder.”

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.670
…which has nothing to do with this.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.069
“Oh no!”

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.910
These films, the Republic films, the Poverty
Row films were operating on a Hollywood aesthetic

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.530
but doing it on the cheap.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.630
So, not a lot of retakes, not a lot of big
sets, not a lot of elaborate camera movements.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.900
Knowing what kind of stories you can tell
on a low budget and what kind of stories you

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.074
You know, a lot ingenuity required, and we
can appreciate a film like “Storm Over Lisbon.”

00:02:48.074 --> 00:02:53.850
You know, a lot ingenuity required, and we
can appreciate a film like “Storm Over Lisbon.”

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.870
It almost looks like a big budget picture,
it almost seems to have major stars in it

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.730
but none of this is true.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.790
"Storm Over Lisbon" is Republic's attempt
to cash in on "Casablanca."

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.569
And while it doesn't exactly imitate the film
scene for scene, it hits all of the major

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.349
beats, all of the major plot points, all of
the major character profiles, but does so

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.870
in a Republic way.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.290
And in this case it does it with a great sense
of humor because director George Sherman was

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.930
very conscious of what was going on there.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.540
Instead of Humphrey Bogart, we had Richard
Arlen.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.349
Instead of Ingrid Bergman, we had Vera Hruba
Ralston

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.200
who was a Czech ice-skating champion who had
been imported to Hollywood.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.099
And there are moments in "Storm Over Lisbon"
where she is called upon to emote on the same

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.190
level as Ingrid Bergman in "Casablanca"

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.930
how frozen in face her expression is.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.100
how frozen in face her expression is.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.129
“I was told to put it there, but I don’t
always do what I am told.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.860
I know enough about you, Greg, not to want
anything to happen to you.”

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.860
Oh, she has to do some big dance scenes which
seemed to consist of her ice skating routines

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.709
except she's doing them without ice skates.

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.330
It's very strange and very funny.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.910
But the film, somehow it works.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.840
It's a very tight 80 minutes, beautifully
shot by a cinematographer named John Alton

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.449
wonderful backlighting effects, quite stylish,
quite funny, and very entertaining still.

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:33.300
But a movie that is, if anything, kind of,
very self aware, aware of its limitations.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.180
“Is there anything wrong with Dr. Maynard?”

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.910
“Nothing that a little strangling and a
shot of embalming fluid didn’t cure.”

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.320
“You don’t mean he’s dead?”

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.380
“Oh no.”

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.380
“Oh yes.”

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.160
Oh, "Valley of the Zombies."

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.910
That's a good example of a B horror movie.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:59.010
This is trying to be a big expressionistic
freak out, but they clearly have no money

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.100
to really stage any of the scenes.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.510
So you have actors describing what happened
offstage.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:12.780
“I found it… in a land of voodoo rights
and devil potions where your profession has

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.580
no place.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.400
The Valley of the Zombies.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.000
You seem skeptical, doctor!”

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.270
Dave: "Oh you should have seen it.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.270
And I bet it was, but we're not going to see
it in this movie

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.970
And I bet it was, but we're not going to see
it in this movie

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.340
because we can't afford to build that castle
and we can't afford to populate it with an

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.960
army of zombies.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.280
"You're going to put me in my grave!"

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.920
“S.O.S.Tidal Wave" is a good example of
Republic ingenuity.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.580
They had acquired the rights to a 1933 film
called "Deluge" that started with an amazing

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.520
special effects sequence  of Manhattan being destroyed by a tidal wave.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:08.640
Tidal Wave" is an attempt to build an 
different storyline around that same footage

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.940
recycling the old stuff in a completely new
context.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.440
They actually bring in an early version of
television so characters can watch the old

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.590
footage which is supposedly representing what's
going on downtown.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.440
"The tidal wave!

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.940
The tidal wave!

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.560
It's coming!"

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.600
No one seems to notice that the clothes have completely changed somehow in the voyage downtown.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.400
But it doesn't matter.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.800
And suddenly “S.O.S. Tidal Wave," a movie that probably cost $3.50 looks like it cost at least $500.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.840
Quite ingenious the way it uses this stuff
and weaves it in and finds a new way of repurposing it.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.320
“Men and women of America, this is the end!”

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.060
In B pictures, the genre was often the star.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.800
The people were coming to see “a cowboy
picture.”

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.560
"Trigger Jr." is a great example of a kind
of Saturday matinee Republic picture.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.380
Basically a children's film with some pretty
simplistic moral choices set against a background

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.320
of a traveling circus that has somehow ended
up in the middle of the Southwest.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.650
None of it makes a lot of sense but it gives
Roy Rogers a chance to sing few songs.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.270
♫ May the good lord take a liking to you
♫

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.570
♫ May he spread his blessings on your trail
♫

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.960
♫ May he be your guide anywhere you ride
♫

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.760
There are a couple of good action sequences,
there's a little romance

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.020
there's a little comedy, almost as if it were a variety program

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.020
almost like the bills on a vaudeville show.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.270
It's a satisfying experience.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:42.990
On the other hand you have a film like "Hellfire"
which is from 1948 which takes a lot of those

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.320
archetypes and smooshes them up in an interesting
way.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.180
“I don’t know who you are, but nobody
can throw whiskey in my face.”

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.740
“So you don’t know me, Lou?

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.830
Well take a good look!”

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:06.650
Instead of the figure of the snarling outlaw,
"Hellfire" merges that with the film noir

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.789
femme fatale.

00:08:07.789 --> 00:08:16.470
We have a lady outlaw whose nemesis is a reformed
gambler who is trying to raise the money to

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.590
build a church.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:23.539
So suddenly this moral clarity that you have
in Roy Rogers' films becomes something rather

00:08:23.539 --> 00:08:27.870
complex and perverse and not at all easy to
parse.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.960
Same is true of a crime film like "The City
That Never Sleeps."

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.020
It's not just cops and robbers, good guys
and bad guys.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:42.750
It's not easy to draw a line between who we're
supposed to be rooting for and who we're not.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.950
This is a film directed by a fellow named
John H. Auer who had a very operatic tone

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.490
in his work.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.320
Standalone sequences he would build to these
levels of hysteria almost.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:01.220
And you see some quite remarkable examples of that in this film involving elaborate shootouts

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.900
Mysterious figures.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:09.740
A mechanical man who is an actor impersonating
a robot who stands in the window of a strip

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.580
joint and attempting to attract customers becomes the witness to a killing.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:21.360
The B films do not have the high gloss production
values of an A picture, so you're getting

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.360
a different angle on American life.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.900
You're getting something much more elemental,
unadorned, immediate.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.700
“Greg I, I want to dream like you...of the
beautiful things.”

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:38.149
There were certainly A pictures that could
do that but with a B, because you couldn't

00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:42.390
build that elaborate New York City set on
the back-lot

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.240
you went out into Los Angeles and shot on
the street.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.040
So you have a physical immediacy, you know,
a reality in these films that often was not

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.010
apparent in the studio movies.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.660
I think for younger filmmakers looking at
this work would be one way of approaching

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.580
the limitations  you're going to face as a filmmaker right now

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:08.620
because these are not movies that have recourse
to multiple cameras, digital effects.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:13.420
There's no do-overs, you have to really think about
what you're going to do, and then do it.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.600
You didn't have a lot of film to waste.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.670
Now you have virtually limitless digital material
that you can shoot on any given film.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.870
In those days, it was costing you a lot to
shoot anything.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.330
So you really prepared very seriously.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.530
There's no improvisation in these movies—it's
all planning.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:38.330
The Republic Library has not been widely available
for a very long time now.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:44.390
It disappeared into television rights in the
'50s and '60s.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.880
There were not good prints available, a lot
of the color stuff was completely unrestored

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.150
and didn't look anything like it should.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:57.959
And in the last few years, that library came
under the stewardship of Paramount pictures

00:10:57.959 --> 00:11:03.269
and they have taken a tremendous initiative
to basically restore that entire library,

00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:04.290
six hundred some films.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:09.570
It’s been a terrific process of discovery
and I hope I can continue with that.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:15.010
There’s still a lot more to come out of
this collection and I hope to do another series

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.760
one of these days.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:25.200
So those are a few of my thoughts on B movies
and I would love to hear some of yours.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.120
This is a new series for the Museum so we'd
appreciate it if you could let us know what

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.920
you thought worked about it, what didn't work
about it or if there are any other topics

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.480
in terms of films or directors or genres that
you'd like to see covered?

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:43.600
You can subscribe for more videos like this
and others from MoMA Film and from the Museum.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.580
My name is Dave Kehr, I'm a curator at the
Museum of Modern Art, and I'll see you next time.
