00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:03.888
- [Voiceover] Let's write
29/100 as a decimal.

00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:06.555
So we'll start with 29 over 100,

00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:09.624
and let's start breaking that down

00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:11.316
till we can get to place values

00:00:11.316 --> 00:00:13.483
'cause place values
will help us to convert

00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:15.711
to write this as a decimal.

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:18.128
29/100 we can break that down

00:00:18.128 --> 00:00:19.961
into 20/100

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:23.685
plus 9/100.

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:25.847
20/100 plus nine more hundredths

00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:28.401
is equal to 29/100.

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:30.355
So we've just broken it down some here.

00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:32.571
It's still equivalent to 29/100.

00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:36.558
We're just taking it apart
trying to get to place values.

00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:39.873
Going from there, we
can simplify even more.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.035
20/100 can be simplified.

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:45.229
We could divide 20 and 100 by 10.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.396
So we'll say 2/10 plus 9/100.

00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:56.214
And now, if you can hear,
the tenths, hundredths,

00:00:56.214 --> 00:00:59.559
these are place values we
should recognize from decimals.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.963
So what we've shown here is that 29/100

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:05.796
is equal to two-tenths

00:01:10.228 --> 00:01:11.978
plus nine-hundredths.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.773
Here we have two-tenths,
which matches 2/10,

00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:24.438
and nine-hundreths, like
our 9/100 right there.

00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:29.015
And so we can take those
and think about place value.

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:33.374
If we have our decimal,
let's first put our decimal.

00:01:33.374 --> 00:01:35.230
Over here to the left of the decimal's

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.182
our ones place value.

00:01:37.182 --> 00:01:40.357
We don't have any ones
here so we'll put a zero,

00:01:40.357 --> 00:01:43.602
zero ones, but then next is tenths,

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:47.769
then we have our tenths and we have 2/10.

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:51.231
And after tenths, the
place value after tenths

00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:55.296
is hundredths, and here, we
see, we have nine hundredths.

00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:58.740
So we'll put a nine in
the hundredths place.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.157
And so down here,

00:02:01.474 --> 00:02:03.307
0.29 or 29 hundredths,

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:09.410
is equivalent to the fraction, 29/100.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.123
And just listen to how those are said.

00:02:11.123 --> 00:02:13.727
It's kind of a clue that we did well.

00:02:13.727 --> 00:02:17.810
29 hundredths is equivalent to 29/100.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:22.148
Both the fraction and the
decimal are read the same way.

00:02:22.148 --> 00:02:23.392
So that's a pretty good clue

00:02:23.392 --> 00:02:25.915
that we probably rewrote these correctly.

00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:29.082
So 0.29 is equal to 29/100.

00:02:32.588 --> 00:02:34.334
Let's try one more, let's try something

00:02:34.334 --> 00:02:37.084
let's say maybe 53/10.

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.570
So again we're gonna break this down.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.785
We'll have 50/10 plus how
many more tenths are left?

00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:52.245
There's still three more tenths.

00:02:52.245 --> 00:02:56.742
And again, we can simplify,
we can simplify this.

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:59.909
50/10 can be divided by 10.

00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:04.812
So instead of 50/10, we'll say 5/1,

00:03:04.812 --> 00:03:08.312
plus, we still have those 3/10.

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.762
And now we've got this to place value.

00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:15.179
Five ones, is 5/1,

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.213
plus your 3/10

00:03:22.094 --> 00:03:23.427
is three-tenths.

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:28.878
So thinking, let's put our decimal,

00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:32.030
over here to the left of
the decimal's our ones,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.272
and we have five ones.

00:03:34.272 --> 00:03:36.688
And to the right of the decimal is tenths,

00:03:36.688 --> 00:03:38.874
and we have three tenths.

00:03:38.874 --> 00:03:41.457
So 5.3 or five and three tenths

00:03:43.177 --> 00:03:46.365
is equal to 53/10.

00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:48.701
To write 53/10 as a decimal,

00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:52.868
we will get 5.3 because it was
five ones and three-tenths,

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:57.304
which we showed right here,
five and three tenths.
