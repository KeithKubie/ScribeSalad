00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.570
Problem 31.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.180
Use the problem below
to answer the

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.440
question that follows.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.820
All right, so this
is our problem.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.420
A red car and a blue car compete
in two 100 mile races.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.490
That's the first race, that's
the second race.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.130
In the first race, both cars
leave the starting

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.300
line at the same time.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.480
That's right there.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.770
When the red car crosses the
finish line, the blue car has

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.500
10 miles left to go.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.510
They drew that right there.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.080
Red car crosses the finish line,
blue car has 10 miles

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.140
left to go.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.425
In the second race, both cars
start at the same time.

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:34.150
But while the blue car begins
at the starting line, right

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.000
there, the red car begins
10 miles behind

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.980
the starting line.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.900
Fair enough.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.640
Assuming that each car's
average speed does not

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.250
change-- that's a
big assumption.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.570
So I'm assuming from race to
race, they have the same

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.960
average speed.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.860
How far has the blue car
traveled in the second race

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.660
when the red car reaches
the finish line?

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.380
So the red car reaches the
finish line, the blue car has

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.300
traveled this distance x.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.550
That's what they want us
to solve for, for x.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.900
How far has the blue car
traveled with the red car

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.730
finishes the finish line?

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.580
Now, this statement right here,
assuming that each car's

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.170
average speed, at least in
my brain, is a big clue.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.760
It tells us that that's
important-- that their average

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.640
speed is the same.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.930
So from race to race, they don't
have, obviously, the

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.840
same average speed.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.310
The red car is faster
in either case.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.130
So let's say that r is equal
to the red's speed.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.370
And let's say that blue is
equal to blue's speed.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.030
Now, in either situation, either
drawing, let's say in

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.350
the first race, they
both traveled the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.850
same amount of time.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.760
The same amount of time it took
the red car to go the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.170
whole 100 miles, the blue car
traveled this distance, which

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.110
is 90 miles.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.115
How did I know 90 miles?

00:01:45.115 --> 00:01:48.720
Because he has 10 miles left
to go in a 100 mile race.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.130
So if we know that distance is
equal to-- sometimes you say

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.980
speed times time, or rate times
time; I'll use speed,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.870
just because I already
used r-- is equal

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.400
to speed times time.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.480
That also tells us that
time is equal to

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.130
distance divided by speed.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.320
So in the first race, in race
1, the time that the red car

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:19.310
took to finish the 100 miles
is 100 miles divided by r

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.740
miles per hour.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.385
And notice, the units will
cancel out properly.

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:28.810
If you divide miles by miles
per hour, you're left just

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.560
with hours.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.510
So this is the time it takes
for the first car

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.200
to finish the race.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.570
Now, we also know that's the
same amount of time it took

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.330
the blue car to go 90 miles.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:48.300
So that is going to be equal to
90 miles over b, or blue's

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.380
miles per hour.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.650
Right?

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.130
That's what the first
race tells us.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.990
Now, what does the second
race tell us?

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.320
The second race, we can
do the same logic.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.790
Race 2.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.180
So, in the time it takes the red
car to travel 110 miles.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.350
Right?

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.640
He drives the whole 100 miles,
and he started 10 miles back.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:18.580
So the red car, 110 miles
divided by red miles per hour

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.660
is equal to what?

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.820
It's equal to x.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.070
The distance the blue car
travels is equal to x miles

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:36.190
divided by blue's miles
per hour, b miles per

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.360
hour, just like that.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.780
Now, what do we have here?

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.460
We want to solve for x, and
maybe, just maybe, if we can

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.360
find an expression for the ratio
between r and b, then

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.540
maybe we can solve for x.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.880
Let me show you what
I mean by that.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.900
Let me switch colors to make
this a little bit less

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.820
monotonous.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.570
So this first, from race 1, we
got the information that 100

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.380
over r is equal to 90 over b.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.400
If we cross multiply, we
essentially get 100b, 100

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.280
times b is equal
to 90 times r.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.890
If we divide both sides by
90, we get 100 over 90

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.295
b is equal to r.

00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:22.580
If you divide both sides by b,
and you swap the sides, you

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.130
get r over b is equal
to 100 over 90.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.480
So we know what the ratio of
red speed to blue speed is.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.620
It's 100 to 90.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.820
Now, can we do the
same thing here?

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.070
Let me do this in red.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.800
OK, so here, if we cross
multiply, from race 2, we have

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.800
110 over r is equal
to x over b.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.170
If we cross multiply, we get
110b is equal to rx.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.160
And then, let's see, if we
divide both sides by x, we get

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.670
110 over x b is equal to r.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.340
And then if we divide both sides
by b, we get 110 over x

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.250
is equal to r over b.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.660
That's the information that
the second race gave us.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.130
Now, the first race already
told us what r

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.180
over b is equal to.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.550
It's equal to 100 over 90.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.460
So we can replace r over b,
based on the information in

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:26.710
the first race, with
100 over 90.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.720
Now, let's see, so our big
takeaway-- notice, they don't

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.690
want us to solve for x, they
just want us to set up the

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:39.370
problem-- is 110 over x is
equal to 100 over 90.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.730
Now, let's see which of these
choices say that.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.410
110 over x is equal
to 100 over 90.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.600
That's choice A.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.510
Just like that.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.760
Next problem.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.100
All right.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.080
Use the diagram below
to answer the

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.810
question that follows.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.570
The diagram above is used to
describe the relationship

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.220
between the circumference--
right, the circumference is

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.310
going around the circle-- the
radius-- that's the radius--

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.595
and the area of a circle.

00:06:10.595 --> 00:06:12.400
The area, we know what
the area is.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.770
Assuming that the circle is
divided into enough sections

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.770
so that the figure on the
right approximates a

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.030
rectangle, which of the
following relationships is

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.220
demonstrated?

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.380
So here they divided
into six wedges.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.320
It looks like a Trivial Pursuit
piece, and they put

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.950
them all up.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.020
But you could imagine, if you
made the wedges even thinner,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.870
if you divided into 12 wedges,
then it would start

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.990
to look like this.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.690
It would look like this if you
did it into 12 wedges.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.870
And if you did it into 24
wedges, it would start looking

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.690
more and more like a rectangle
that looks

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.310
something like that.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.340
The more you divide the
wedges, it looks more

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.190
and more like that.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.860
So let's see what they're
trying to show us.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.110
So if this is r, right here.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.960
On the wedges, this distance--
or actually this

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.620
distance-- is also r.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.960
Right?

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.530
That distance is also r.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.950
The whole thing is obviously
the circumference.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.850
Over here, on our kind of
approximated rectangle, what's

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.070
our circumference?

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.640
Well, our circumference is that
plus that, plus that,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.430
plus that, plus that,
plus that.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.300
So if we just look at maybe
the base of our rectangle,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.180
that is 1/2 our circumference.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.550
Right?

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.450
That's 1/2 our circumference.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.260
Because our circumference is
these arcs plus this arc,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.380
these three arcs.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.860
This is just 1/2 of them.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.840
So the area of the rectangle,
the area of this rectangle--

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.350
which is the same thing as the
area of the circle, because

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.960
all we did is we just kind
of cut up the circle and

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.300
rearranged it into a rectangle,
a reapproximated

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.020
rectangle-- the area of the
circle of the rectangle is

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.010
going to be the base, which
is equal to 1/2 times the

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.770
circumference, times the height,
which is the radius.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.870
And, well, lucky for me, that's
actually the actual

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.450
choice, choice A.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.410
Just like that.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.350
Actually, this is
a fun exercise.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.020
Maybe I'll do a whole video
explaining why area is 1/2 the

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.240
radius times the circumference
using this example.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.650
Because if you divide it into
more and more and more wedges,

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.010
it's going to look more and
more like a rectangle.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.440
I'll leave that for you
to experiment with.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.120
Problem 33.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.090
A pretzel company sells pretzels
in a cylindrical

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.820
container with a radius
of 10 centimeters

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.860
and a height of 30.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.580
Let me draw it.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.750
So a cylindrical container,
radius is 10 centimeters, and

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:38.240
then the height of our container
is 30 centimeters.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:38.520
Right?

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.190
It's all centimeters.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.380
The company's packaging
designers are considering

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.590
switching to a new cylindrical
container with a radius of

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.600
20-- so it's a bigger radius,
radius of 20 centimeters-- and

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.680
a height of 15 centimeters.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.750
How does the volume of the
proposed new container compare

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.050
to the volume of the
old container?

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.270
So the old container's volume is
going to be this area times

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:03.910
the height.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.940
So it's going to be, so
the volume is equal to

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.570
the area pi r squared.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:09.800
r is 10.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.650
r squared is 100.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.810
So it's going to be 100pi,
that's the area up here.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.250
That's 100pi.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:19.780
And then we're going to multiply
that times the

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.770
height, times 30 centimeters,
and so it's going to be equal

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:29.180
to 3,000pi cubic centimeters.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.620
That's our old container.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.800
Our new container-- what's
the area up here?

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.700
Pi r squared.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.340
The area is equal to
pi times r squared.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.450
r is 20.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.330
20 squared is 400.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:49.980
So our volume is equal
to 400pi times 15.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.820
And what's 400 times 15?

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.280
400 times 15 is what?

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.440
6,000.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.930
400 times 10 is 4,000.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.120
400 times 5 is 2,000.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.270
Right.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.190
It's 6,000.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:06.870
So the volume of our new
container is 6,000pi

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.545
centimeters, or cubic
centimeters.

00:10:08.545 --> 00:10:10.930
So our new container
has twice the

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.740
volume of our old container.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.380
So let's see if they say that.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:14.690
Let's see.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:20.450
The volume of the new container
is twice the volume

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.670
of the old container.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.470
That is correct.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:24.970
Choice D.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.220
Next problem.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.700
All right.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.790
A fuel tank was approximately
1/8 full.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:41.890
After adding $50 worth of fuel,
the tank was 3/4 full.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.890
If the fuel cost p dollars
per gallon, all right,

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.600
approximately how many gallons
does the tank hold when full?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.100
So, let's see, we added $50, and
it's p dollars per gallon,

00:10:54.100 --> 00:11:02.690
so we added-- so 50 divided by
p gallons took us from 1/8 to

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.380
3/4 full of a tank.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.300
So how much did it add?

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:12.200
We went from 3/4 of a tank--
from 1/8 of a tank to 3/4.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.380
So how much did we add?

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.760
If we just take the difference
between the two, we can

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.840
rewrite 3/4 as 6/8, minus
1/8, equal to 5/8.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.790
So we added 5/8 of a tank.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.520
Going from 1/8 to 3/4 is
adding 5/8 of a tank.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:34.180
So this is equal to 5/8 of
a tank, of a tank of

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.870
gas, of our fuel tank.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.930
Now they're saying,
approximately how many gallons

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.430
does the tank hold when full?

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.420
And it's all in terms of p.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.620
So to solve for one tank, we
can multiply both sides of

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.940
this equation times the
reciprocal of this, times 8/5.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.400
Let's do that.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.380
So you multiply 8 over 5 on the
left-hand side, times 8

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.290
over 5 on the right-hand side.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.950
And then you're left with--
well, that can just cancel.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.380
5's cancel here.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.230
8's cancel here.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.960
That's why I did it.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:09.180
So one tank is equal to 8 over
5, times 50 over p gallons.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.490
So if we just divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.270
by 5, it becomes 10.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.710
That becomes 1.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:22.930
8 times 10 is 80 over p gallons,
is equal to 1 tank.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.575
And that is choice A.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.860
Next question.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.870
A homeowner-- let me switch
colors-- a homeowner is

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.160
planning to use carpet tiles to
cover the floor of a room

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.160
measuring 9 feet by
10 feet, 8 inches.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:48.170
So it's 9 feet by 10
feet, 8 inches.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.790
Whenever I see that, I like to
write it as a decimal, or I

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.870
like to write it just
purely as inches.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.030
How many inches is this?

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.200
10 feet is 120 inches, right?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.260
12 inches per foot.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.910
So 120 plus 8.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:04.380
So this is also 128 inches.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.210
So I'll just write that there.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.970
So it's 9 feet by 128 inches.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.120
If the carpet tiles are 8 inches
wide and 1 foot long,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.430
and there are no gaps between
the tiles when they're placed

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.090
on the floor, how many carpet
tiles will the homeowner need

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.340
to cover the floor
of the room?

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.100
So I'm going to place them this
way, just because I kept

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.200
this side in foot.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.200
So I'm going to use the foot
dimension on the foot side.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.630
So this is 1 foot by 8 inches.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.300
Right?

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.710
That's the dimension
of our tile.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.400
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.440
It's 1 foot on this side
right here, and

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.800
then 8 inches on that.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.470
So clearly, we're going to be
able to add-- we're going to

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.060
have 9 tiles, because
we have 9 feet.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.840
So we're going to have 9 tiles
in this direction.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.190
And then how many tiles
in this direction?

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.400
It's 8 inches, and we have
a total of 128 inches.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.830
So how many times does
8 to go into 128?

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.740
8 goes into 12 once,
1 times 8 is 8, 48.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.160
8 goes into 48 six times.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.260
So you'll have 16 tiles
in that direction.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:08.310
9 tiles here in the, I guess,
on the width, 16

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.550
tiles in the length.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.960
So we're going to have
16 times 9 tiles.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.420
6 times 9 is 54.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:21.050
1 times 9 is 9, plus 5 is 14.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.465
So we're going to
need 144 tiles.

00:14:23.465 --> 00:14:26.060
So that's choice C.
