00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Alright, let's get started.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We see just a 1, and we've seen all of it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Then we totally could be in this state.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
E goes to 1, and then there's my finger. That's where we are.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We've already seen the 1.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We're done with--we're ready to apply this rule, E goes to 1.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Everything here is fine.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here the input hasn't changed, and we have another state,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but remember that we said before, depending on your point of view,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when you see a 1 you can either be reducing a 1 to expression

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
or you could be completely done with parsing.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
1 is in the language of this grammar.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We normally think of things like 1 + 2 - 3, but the lowly 1 alone is in this grammar.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
S goes to E. E goes to 1.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And this says, I finished parcing the string. Great!

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now we just see a 1, but this state says, oh, I've seen an E, and I've seen a +,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and I'm looking for an E in the future.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This can't work because it requires us to have seen the +.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If I put my finger here, the + is in the past, and I haven't seen any +'s in the input,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so we can't make that work out.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The next one has the same input, but a slightly different state.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I've seen an E, and I'm looking for a + and then another E.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Yeah, I could totally imagine a + followed by another E filling this out.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
That could work, so this is a possible state that we could be in.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We see 1 + as the input, and this is a little more complicated,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and now the one that we had to reject before suddenly becomes valid.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
My finger is here, and E and a + are in the past.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Here's the E. Here's the +, and I'm looking for some new expression in the future.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This fits very well.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The last one was a bit of a ringer. This was a bit of a trick question.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It required you to have the definition well in hand.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This looks very promising.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I put my finger here and it says, oh, there's a 1 and a + in the past,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and we're looking for an E--that all sounds good.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But remember that the definition of a parsing state is that it's one of the rules

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
from our grammar, augmented with a single red dot.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
E goes to 1 + E is not a rule in our grammar.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The closest rule in our grammar is 5, which is E goes to E + E.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Every symbol matters.

00:02:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This can't be a valid parsing state because E goes to 1 + E is not a rule in our grammar.
