00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.750
Life is a train station, and we as people, are the trains;

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.220
people getting on and off at different times every day, every week, every month, every year...

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.250
People will walk in and out of our lives

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.879
in the same type of way they board and exit a train.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.820
Some people stay on for a long ride,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.839
while some only go for a short stop or two.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.869
However, we're more affected than the average train by people coming and going. As

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.059
a train you're only expected to power on and keep chugging along.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.610
It seems easy to go on without stopping, and it's tempting for us to try doing it, too

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.570
but

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.299
we're people not trains. It's actually not that easy.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.339
Sometimes it's hard to power on to keep going and chugging along...

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.969
Sometimes we have to stop and cool our engines a bit before we can keep going.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.309
When someone who meant a lot to you gets off, it hurts!

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.110
You can ignore it.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.520
But, ignoring the pain only prolongs it. And to confront it might cause you even more pain than you've ever felt in your life!

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.110
But is it worth it to experience all this if you could eventually find solace in the end?

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
If it meant you could,

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:39.849
Let it go...

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.499
Letting go is one of the hardest things in life. I

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.240
am a firm believer that people come into your life with a purpose. And, once that purpose is fulfilled,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.880
they will inevitably leave.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.720
Sometimes, people are in your lives for good reasons, and maybe it will seem that they leave too soon.

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.639
But maybe it's the departure that is the true purpose,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.299
the true lesson that they have to offer you.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.219
There are different types of letting go: the type of friends and significant others leaving, and that of death.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.479
But death is to be discussed at a later date. I

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.520
have had to let go of a lot of people throughout my life, especially since starting college. I

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.598
have been in and out of different relationships that have each dramatically changed me as a person.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.239
These experiences and people have shaped my values and beliefs,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.849
challenged what I thought to be true, and made me realize some hard truths about myself and about others.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.610
The first person who changed me significantly

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.340
was a boy.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.769
Let's call him "Jason" whom I talked to for about a year. He

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.419
was one of the first people in my life whom I considered toxic;

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.030
he was selfish,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.600
Illogical and honestly just a horrible person!

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.739
No matter what I said, he would disagree with me just because he could. He would never admit when he was wrong;

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.819
even if it made him look bad, he would ask for favors

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.518
that would only benefit himself and would even make me go out of my way to do them, even though

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.099
I never would receive the same kind of favor in return.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.810
You may be asking yourself, "Why would I keep talking to this person?

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.380
This is obviously an abusive friendship and not the way anyone should be treated!" Well,

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.420
the reason I kept trying to talk to him was because he was the first person

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.229
to show interest in getting to know me deeper...

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.979
Like a true best friend. I never

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.630
experienced that before.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.259
We would have great conversations, and he would be there for me when I was falling apart.

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:15.139
My freshman year of college was the first time I had to confront the possibility that I might have depression.

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.469
Having him around felt great because it meant I had someone to help me up when I was down,

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.179
someone wanted me even though I had felt broken beyond repair.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.880
I was so caught up with that feeling that I almost wasn't able to see how manipulative

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.469
he really was and when I did, it crushed me. I had to distance myself

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.399
and it hurt because I thought he cared

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.350
but he was using me and taking advantage of my kind heart.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.649
I had never experienced a situation where I was the one who had to end the relationship:

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.890
That what the lesson "Jason" taught me. He's just one example of the people I've had to let go in my life

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.089
The one thing I have learned though, is that if a person is compromising who you are as a person,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.830
forcing you to change your fundamental beliefs without your permission,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.830
then you are better off without them.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.880
If they make you feel guilty for being yourself, for disagreeing with their opinions that they take for a fact,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.490
for telling them how you feel?

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.740
Then, they don't deserve to be in your life.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.330
Now, I

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.080
understand that letting people go is something that has to happen sometimes, and it will hurt.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.580
But, not as much as it would if you continue to associate with that person. In

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:49.320
the long run, it's better off to distance yourself from those people instead of sticking around and letting them hurt you. And,

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.640
whatever you do,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.890
don't lose hope. The right people will come into your life,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.190
they might just not have found you yet.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:07.379
So if you recently realized the "friends" you thought you had we're not good for you? That's okay.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.190
Don't think that you're alone in this world, because you're not.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.830
Your people are on their way.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.180
They may even be sitting next to you

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.560
and you don't even know it. Don't be afraid to reach out and try to make new friends. Although

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.649
it's scary, and the fear of reduction is strong,

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.709
the worst case scenario is if they don't stick around,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.459
they weren't meant to stay in your life, and that's okay.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:38.159
You're narrowing down the potential possibilities for your true friends and loved ones. I

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.689
hope these things help you realize that it might not be our fault people leave after all,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.889
it might just be the people around you. You don't deserve to be treated as anything less by someone else because you deserve the BEST!

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:02.650
And sometimes that best is only achieved by letting someone leave your train station and letting them go on their way. And

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.830
the thing that isn't always realized is

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.130
that's okay.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.209
