00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.870
Lately, you’ve seen THIS weapon in the news
a lot.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.230
These firearms elicit emotions for millions
of Americans.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.850
Some want these weapons to be available and
unrestricted, some want to regulate them,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.829
and some want to ban them outright.

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:13.909
But what do you know about these rifles?

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:15.070
How do they work?

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.360
And why did they become so widespread?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.590
This weapon is hotly politicized, with some
saying the data and equipment is just “too

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.690
complicated” to properly debate.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.020
Which has been made even more complicated
by emotion and propaganda.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.070
So let’s try to cut through that.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.770
First, we need to know what this IS.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.970
People call this the AR-15, but it’s part
of a family of weapons that are all related

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.841
to the Armalite AR-15
a gas-operated rifle that the US military

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:41.770
adopted in the 1960s.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.720
They named it the M16, and that has variants
-- the M16A1 A2, and A4.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.890
There’s also the shorter (carbine) version
called the M4.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.040
Or its variants like the CAR-15 or Colt Commando
or versions with different systems and markets

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.330
like the HK-416 Canada C7 or Danish LSV M/04.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:03.329
And on top of THAT Colt bought the design
and uses the trademark the AR-15 which just

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.010
makes things even more confusing.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.170
This one firearm family has SCORES of cousins
and configurations which is one reason people

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.170
call it “too complicated” -- and why many
just call this firearm family, “The Black

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.170
Rifle.”

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.430
So that’s what is IS, but what made it so
popular?

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.340
You can trace the success of this weapon to
a few things: First: Engineering.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.340
Second: U.S. Patent Law.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.570
And Third: More engineering
So first: ENGINEERING.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.350
At its most simple, a gun is a fairly basic
machine that takes advantage of simple physics:

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.850
You take a tube, you add something explosive,
and you put a projectile in front of that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.400
explosion to push it out of the tube.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.150
Firearms have been around for a millennia,
but it wasn’t until the end of the 1700s

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.660
that... for the first time EVER, a firearm
had interchangeable parts.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.680
Imagine that.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.990
Before the late 1700s a gun was a hand-wrought
personal machine.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.740
Even “simple” muskets were hand-made individuals.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.070
And every gun was a one-of-a-kind possession.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.700
If it broke, parts needed to be made by a
gunsmith to fit YOUR weapon.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.170
But now with interchangeable parts, a gun
could be modified, repaired, and completely

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.190
built from parts.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.970
This was a revelation -- and important -- hold
onto this idea.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.330
Next, more advancements made firing faster,
and eventually insertable magazines containing

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.281
multiple rounds were invented,and improvements
in design generally made weapons lighter and

00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:25.610
easier to use.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.569
They also fired faster, and faster, and faster.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.520
This is because American military studies
completed during World War II and the Korean

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.680
War found -- when armed with an automatic
rifle that fires as long as the trigger is

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.420
squeezed -- soldiers shot at a large area
to SUPPRESS the enemy rather than aiming at

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.790
specific targets.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.190
So, engineers shifted their attention from
shot quality, to shot quantity;

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.550
In 1956, in response to the need for speed,
E.M Stoner applied for a patent that describes

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.700
a simple method for siphoning expanding gases
from exploding gunpowder to operate the reloading

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.390
mechanism of a military rifle.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.190
This was a big deal, opening the door for
better-performing and longer-lasting automatic

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.989
weapons for military combat.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.290
In 1962, Stoner’s gas system was assessed
and accepted by the Pentagon’s DARPA.But,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.520
the government was dragging its feet to adopt
the new rifle -- and by 1963 ads appeared

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.640
selling a semi-automatic version of this military
weapon to the public.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.180
By 1966, the Army and Marine Corps were issuing
the rifle to troops in Vietnam, under its

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.180
new name the M16.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.540
And then in 1977 Stoner’s patent expired.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.709
This is when the U.S. patent law comes into
play.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.430
Once in public domain, other companies could
take advantage of this firing system, AND

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.580
another thing… the interchangeable parts.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.840
With the AR-15, Armalite and Colt don’t
just manufacture a rifle, they also provide

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.510
a platform.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.350
The AR-type rifle was and IS modular.Modular
meaning, parts are so interchangeable that

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.950
you can get them almost anywhere, and customize
almost every part of this weapon.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.510
Owners can take and swap out the stock, the
grip, the chamber, or the barrel -- commonly

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.780
called the uppers and lowers. and once the
internet came on the scene, could buy these

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.390
parts anywhere.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.930
People can even 3D-print parts to build a
black rifle -- someone did in 2013 and fired

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.059
over 600 rounds.

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.880
The Lowers are what actually (legally) constitutes
the gun.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.250
That’s where the serial number is, and the
action is contained.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.719
These interchangeable parts can alter the
type and caliber of shot, the type of magazine,

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.839
and people can even add a scope (or two!),
or a grenade launcher if that’s their thing.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:37.409
For the military this was a feature, not a
bug…

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.280
According to a piece about it in the Washington
Post: it makes the weapon ideal “for close-

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.999
and medium- to long-range engagements and
the preferred weapon used to kill the enemies

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:48.229
of the United States.”

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.559
But for civilians -- these interchangeable
parts meant the Black Rifle could be used

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.569
in different ways.

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.150
An owner could swap in different uppers for
varmint, big game hunting or target practice.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:07.720
Or different lowers to accommodate various
magazines or stocks. And this is how we ended up arguing about specific parts, like bump stocks.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.939
There are even parts for show guns that aren’t
even for shooting, just for being fancy.

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:17.189
The AR-type weapon’s success in civilian
life is because it’s like a custom built

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.569
motorcycle, homebrew computer, or 3D-printed
model.

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.349
No two Black Rifles have to be the same.

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.900
Which brings us back to why some say, ”it’s
too complicated” to debate.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.960
But it could be UNcomplicated if we just had
consistent language to address when discussing

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960
it.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.370
The AR-type weapon is one of the most popular
weapons in the world.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.379
The National Shooting Sports Foundation estimates
5 to 10 million AR-platform weapons are in

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:47.539
circulation in the U.S., but no one knows
exactly how many because in 1986, Congress

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.830
made it illegal to register any firearms,
firearm owners, or transactions.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.729
So here we are.

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.710
This modular weapon is a result of the world’s
militaries search for a rapid-fire, simple

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.770
weapon that people of all sizes and backgrounds
could use.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.639
Hopefully, this video helps you talk to your
friends about what you DO or DON’T like

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.969
about this weapon, and helps us all understand
why they seem to be everywhere.

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.509
This is a tough topic to be unbiased about,
it carries lot of emotion for people.In the

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:19.499
end, like any piece of engineering, what we
do with these Black Rifles … isn’t just

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:23.919
the responsibility of those who created it,
those who manufacture it, those who sell it,

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.330
those who regulate it, or those who use it,
but it’s about all of us.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.320
The future is in our hands.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.960
Firearms and weapons aren't the only thing in a military arsenal. Have you ever wondered how we got photos from spy satellites before digital cameras?

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.360
