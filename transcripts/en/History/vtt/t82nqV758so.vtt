00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.300
You probably had the
most disgusting moment

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.600
in the history of
"Alone" because things

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.700
were getting so dire you
decided to eat leeches.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:17.900
[suspenseful piano music]

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.070
Oh, what the heck.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.700
Let's get these all
four, all at once.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.230
I'm still deciding if I'm
going to throw up or not.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.670
[laughs]

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.000
[sarcastic laughing]

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.270
Gross.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.170
Gross.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.230
Ew, gross.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.330
Yuck.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.230
- Did you just throw up?
- I did not.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.400
Oh, come on.
Really?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.630
I did not throw up.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.030
What did they taste like?

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.970
A tainted leather green
bean is what they taste

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.430
like, really chewy.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.000
But it's protein, right?
- Yeah.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.400
There's something in
there that is good for me.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.100
I'd probably go after
more, to tell you the truth

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.170
and stockpile my leeches.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.330
It's not every day
you get to take part

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.630
in organic, local,
free range leech.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.100
You can't buy that at the store.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100
I think we've invented
a whole new fad.
