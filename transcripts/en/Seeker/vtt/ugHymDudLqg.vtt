00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.639
Guys, do your lips always get chapped?

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.300
Yeah… that might be your fault.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.620
Hey everyone!

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.740
Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.089
Chapped lips are terrible.

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.510
It’s that uncomfortable dry sensation on
your lips, flaky or cracking skin, and in

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.710
some of the worst cases, bleeding.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.529
They're more common in certain seasons or
climates.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.100
But what causes your lips to chap in the first
place?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.000
To start, the skin on your lips is much more
sensitive than the rest of the skin on your

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
body.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.669
Your lip structure is just different.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.860
While it is made up of the epidermis and dermis
like the rest of your skin, the outermost

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.120
layer of the epidermis-- the stratum corneum--
is much thinner on our lips.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.590
So thin, that it allows more visibility into
our blood vessels - giving our lips that reddish

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.590
color.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.780
What’s more, lips don’t have sweat glands
to provide moisture or hair to provide protection

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.129
from the sun.

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.379
This helps explain why lips get more chapped
in the cold winter months or after catching

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.289
some rays on a hot sandy beach.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.250
The excess wind, lack of moisture in the air,
and UV rays can cause your lips to lose moisture,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.830
burn - and they end up being chapped.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.490
Yeah, chapped lips can just be a sunburn...on
your lips.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.299
But it isn’t always the weather’s fault.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.330
Sometimes you end up doing it to yourself.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.260
Have you ever woken up with super dry lips,
especially when you’re congested?

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.650
Well, this could be because you were breathing
through your mouth, removing the moisture

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.650
from your lips!

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.500
And perhaps even worse, is the act of licking
your lips excessively.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.530
It may sound counterintuitive, but as the
saliva evaporates from your lips, it sucks

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.390
away heat and moisture, leaving your lips
potentially drier than before you licked them.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.860
Many products we use and foods we eat can
also be the culprits.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.110
These range from irritating cosmetics, to
toothpastes, medications, figs, food colorings,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.320
and, wait for it… even lip balm.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.930
While some lip balms may be helpful, others
can make chapped lips worse.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.640
I know, this one really got me too.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.450
But, the problem is ingredients in some lip
balms…

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.140
Like propyl gallate, or phenyl salicylate,
can be skin irritants, and another, salicylic

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.350
acid, helps skin slough off more easily!

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.280
One super common lip balm ingredient that
you may love is Menthol - it tastes and smells

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.130
delicious but it's also an alcohol and can
dry out your lips.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.190
So what can you do restore moisture to your
dry, chapped lips?

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.390
Staying hydrated, breathing through your nose,
and using a humidifier during dry months helps,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.150
not to mention avoiding licking your lips,
staying away from harmful products, and reducing

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.320
sun and wind exposure.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.240
But if you’ve just gotta get your lip balm
fix, the Mayo Clinic says to try some good

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.610
ol petroleum jelly.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.520
But, the trick here, and with anything you
use for your chapped lips, is to make sure

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.020
that it works for you.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.520
We all have different allergies, sensitivities,
and reactions to different products.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.450
So, what may work for your pout, may not work
for someone else’s.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.640
This is a pretty common problem for people
in the winter, but different seasons will

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.950
affect our bodies in surprising ways!

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.060
For example, did you know winter can alter
your genetics?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.660
Julia has the scoop in this video.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:11.640
Guys, do you have any 
science questions?

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.600
What should we look into next?

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.819
