As an app developer,

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.689
you don't think of monetization at
the end of when you build the app.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.610
You should really be thinking
monetization when you first are thinking

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.600
about building your app.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.410
I met this amazing app developer
in the Bay Area who built a game.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.340
And he came to talk to us recently,
and he said, you know,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.470
I have to start all over again.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.870
We were kind of scratching our heads.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.740
We said, why?
He said,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.330
I never thought about building
the breaks inside the game for

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.210
where an ad would actually sit.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.180
He's like I have to kind of
start over and think about okay.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.910
You know, where, maybe in this level,
I'll put one here.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.860
And maybe, during where it
shows the scores and all that.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.510
So, he had to actually go back and
redo his game which was unfortunate.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.830
But, it just shows you that, when you
are thinking about monetization, or

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.200
even just building your app in the first
place, think about the future.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.030
Don't think about right then and there.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.360
Think about what you really want to
get out of your app in the long term.
