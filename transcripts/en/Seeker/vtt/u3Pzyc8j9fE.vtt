00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.569
Anyone else think it’s a little weird to
be adult mammals that drink the breast milk

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.029
of other animals that’s meant for babies?

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.360
No? just me?

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.440
hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.770
Humans only recently started drinking cow’s
milk.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.020
We kind of well forced ourselves to do it.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
For the longest time people made cheese and
other dairy products but sometimes would get

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.910
stomach pains and digestion issues from it.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.320
But around 7,500 years ago something changed.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.560
Someone in Central Europe, didn’t get ill
when they drank cow’s milk.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.570
Their DNA mutated, for the better!

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.120
Now 65% of people are lactose intolerant,
and that percentage is even higher in those

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.600
of East Asian descent.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.609
So if you’re one of the 65% but still like
something sweet to pour on your fruity-Os,

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.579
what should you use?

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.829
Well the most common alternative to milk is
SOY.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.609
Soy is a traditional crop in China, so soymilk
is probably thousands of years old.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.289
But it didn’t really hit the US until the
1980s when it was introduced in San Francisco

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.989
in 1979 by Hong Kong based company Vitasoy.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.721
Since then, the product has taken on a life
of its own.

00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:08.790
It’s made by soaking the beans for a while,
mostly likely overnight and then grinding

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.860
them down so it makes a nice.. well.. milky
consistency.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.840
Chinese and japanese methods differ on when
exactly to boil the beans, but no matter the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.380
method heat must be applied to kill protease
inhibitors which can damage the pancreas.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.930
But soymilk is pretty good for you!

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.890
It has just as much protein as regular milk,
more fiber, and soy has been shown to lower

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.250
bad cholesterol and raise the good kind according
to a study published in The American Journal

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.270
of Cardiology.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.000
Other studies like one published in Circulation
show that soy products can reduce blood pressure.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.030
But it does have its downsides, soy is notorious
for it’s high levels of isoflavones which

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.320
some are considered might be harmful because
they mimic estrogen.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.070
Some studies show that too much exposure of
soy’s phytoestrogens in mice in the womb

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.320
might harm a fetus’s reproductive abilities
later in life according to one study published

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.860
in the journal Biology of Reproduction, but
other studies should they’re beneficial

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.110
to adults in other ways.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.210
So the research is mixed on the subject.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.821
And soymilk it’s low in vitamin D compared
to cow’s milk, one study published in the

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:05.880
Canadian Medical Association Journal found
that kids who drank non-dairy milk are twice

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.649
as likely to have low vitamin D. But that
can be added, so fortified drinks are the

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.499
way to go if you're worried about it.

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:15.810
But some people are allergic to soy… so
almond milk becomes the best choice.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.950
Almond milk has been around for awhile too,
at least since Medieval times.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.950
And it’s simply made.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.400
It’s just ground up almonds and water then
strained.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.549
Yeah so easy you can make your own!

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.239
But it’s not that packed with nutrients,
an 8-ounce glass of almond milk contains only

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.799
1 gram of protein and fiber.

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.930
And most manufacturers add in vitamins and
minerals like Calcium and Vitamin E.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.880
And no it doesn’t dry up California, yes
growing almonds uses a lot of water.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.040
Almonds use 10 percent of California’s agricultural
water supply.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.860
So almonds are thirsty yes, but most of what
goes into almond milk isn’t almonds….

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.409
according to one brand, Alpro, only 2% of
their product is actually almonds.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.450
The rest is just water, thickening agents
and added nutrients.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.180
So it’s still a net win for the environment.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.140
But if you’re like me and allergic to almonds..
well you’d probably be safe with coconut

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.140
milk.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.489
Coconut milk is made from the white fleshy
bits of a coconut.

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.560
like most of the other products, it’s mashed
up or grated and boiled in water then strained

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.260
through something like a cheese cloth.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.749
While coconut milk tends to be high in fat,
an 8 ounce glass will have over 30 grams,

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:17.750
they are dense in other nutrients like fiber,
b vitamins, vitamin e and minerals like iron

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.750
and magnesium.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.260
So, what type of milk should you drink?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.180
Well pick whatever you like the taste of best,
in my experience none of them get close to

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.579
tasting like cow’s milk, but vanilla soymilk
isn’t that bad.

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.050
but if you’re looking to pack in the protein,
I wouldn’t use almond milk, go for soy.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.999
Oh, and what about human breast milk?

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.860
Is that a good alternative?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:47.859
That’s actually the topic of a whole ‘nother
DNews video 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:04:01.870
from Julian.
