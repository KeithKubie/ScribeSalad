[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.650
FOX BUTTERFIELD:
Thank you, David.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.943
Am I audible?

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:13.750
AUDIENCE: Go ahead.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.190
FOX BUTTERFIELD: OK.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.660
So I'm going to talk
about my new book, which

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.385
was just published, called,
"In My Father's House."

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:23.260
And I have to say
something about the origins

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.010
of the book, which emerged
from a series of seemingly very

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.860
dry, academic studies that
were unknown to the public.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.150
And these showed
that crime tends

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.640
to run very heavily in families.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.500
These multi-year
studies were conducted

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.830
in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh,
Rochester, Denver,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.950
and, most recently, Chicago
in the United States

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.770
and in London in the UK.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.010
What they found was
astonishing because the results

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.379
in each of these cities over
a very long period of time,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.060
over more than 50 years--

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.760
they found that 5% of families
account for half of all crime.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.060
And 10% of families account
for 2/3 of all crime.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.080
And whichever city you looked at
over whichever period of time,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.270
the same result came back.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.900
And I just say it again because
it was astonishing to me

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.990
that 5% of families are
responsible for half

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.680
of all crime.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.559
And 10% of families
are responsible for 2/3

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.100
of all crime.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.465
This intergenerational
transfer of violence,

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:42.790
as criminologists
like to refer to it,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.470
was first documented
in a separate,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.870
but, similar, study
done in Boston

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:55.270
in the 1940s, which looked at
a sample of 500 delinquent boys

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.400
from working class homes.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.060
The study found that 2/3 of
the boys sentenced by a judge

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.440
to a reformatory had a
father who had been arrested,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.600
convicted, and sent to prison.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.350
And half of the boys
had a grandfather

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.870
who had been arrested
and sent to prison.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.820
And half of the boys
also had a mother

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.525
who had been arrested
and sent to prison.

00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:22.810
Equally striking, all
of the delinquent boys

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.200
in the Boston study were white.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.780
In part, this racial
makeup is a reminder

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.280
that until the 1960s, at least,
until after the Second Great

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.490
Migration of blacks from the
South during and after World

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.200
War II, most crime
in the United States,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.420
including violent crime,
was committed by whites.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.080
So when we think back
on our famous criminals,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.440
we think back to Jesse James
in the 19th century in Missouri

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.560
or Al Capone in
Prohibition Era-Chicago,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.601
or Bonnie and Clyde in
Texas during the Depression.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.630
The common and pernicious
American stereotype today

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.170
of young black predators
with guns dealing drugs

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.650
is really a creation
of the last 30 years.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.040
While it is true that blacks are
overrepresented in prison, they

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.930
still--

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.390
I should say that whites
still commit the majority

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.870
of all crimes in the US.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.670
Despite this
statistical evidence

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.090
of the role of family
in crime, criminologists

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.000
have largely neglected
this line of causality,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.700
instead looking at such
well-known risk factors

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.570
as bad neighborhoods, poverty,
deviant peers at school,

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.370
drugs, or gangs.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.350
These are real
issues, of course.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.910
But chronologically,
a child's life

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.660
begins at home with his
or her own family long

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.690
before the neighborhoods
or friends or classmates

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.800
have an influence on them.

00:03:58.406 --> 00:04:00.530
John Laub, who is one of
our leading criminologists

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.150
at the University
of Maryland, has

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.380
written that
scholars have largely

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.140
avoided focusing on the
families because that would tend

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.690
to suggest that there
is a biological or even

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.380
genetic basis for
crime, which could get

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.120
the criminologists
who said something

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.315
like that labeled as a racist.

00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:23.690
Because these studies were so
little known by the public,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.110
to me they represented an
opportunity during 15 years

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.090
that I wrote about crime
and criminal justice

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.460
for "The New York Times."

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.310
I wanted to try to
find a white family

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.190
with a large number of members
who had been sent to prison,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.160
both as a way to
refocus on the family

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.100
and as a way to try to
disentangle race from crime.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.020
By happenstance, an official
of the Oregon Department

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.210
of Corrections told me
that he had a family

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.990
that he thought had six members,
a white family that he had

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.655
six members who were in prison.

00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:57.500
And he offered to
let me interview

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.100
the members of the family in
prison if I came to Oregon.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.920
At that time, I was
living in Boston.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.360
But I was intrigued
by the family.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.650
And I went out and,
little did I know

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.849
that after 10 years of
working on this project,

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.640
I would find that the
real total of members

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.760
of the family in
prison was not 6.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.010
It's 6-0, 60 members over four
generations of this family

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.750
known as the Bogles.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.290
And the Bogles had
a story to tell,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.830
how criminals often grow
up in criminal families.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.700
What you are raised
with, you grow to become,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.880
Tracey Bogle told me.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.250
He was the first of the men
that I talked to in prison.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.410
He was serving a
16-year sentence

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.310
for a crime that
involved kidnapping,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.256
armed robbery, aggravated
assault, car theft, and sodomy.

00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:54.920
He'd committed the crime with
his older brother, Bobby Bogle.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.870
In my first interview
with Tracey,

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.340
he unintentionally handed
me the theme of the book.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.790
He said if I'd been raised
in a family of doctors,

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.500
I'd be a doctor today.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.810
But I was raised in
a family of outlaws.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.030
And the only law
we knew were cops

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.220
coming to break down our
doors, coming to arrest us

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.180
or to send us to jail.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.310
Tracey's story, in some
ways, was a familiar story

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.280
about the power of
imitation among children,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.205
imitation of their parents or
their older brothers or sisters

00:06:32.205 --> 00:06:34.290
or grandparents.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.940
Doctors, we know,
often have children

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.460
who grew up to become doctors.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.140
Lawyers have children who
grow up to become lawyers.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.900
For the Bogles, it was a
story about family values,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.550
although not just
the family values

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.680
we normally mean when we talk
about family values being good.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.706
The Bogle criminal
pater familias,

00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:58.330
as Bobby and Tracey
told their stories,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.795
was their father, who is
known as Rooster Bogle.

00:07:01.795 --> 00:07:08.720
Rooster was a short man with
large protruding ears and dark,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.540
curly hair, and a nasty temper.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.160
He was not the most-violent
member of the family.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.880
That distinction belonged
to his eldest son, Tony,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.940
who with his wife, Paula, were
convicted of murder in Tucson,

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:28.080
Arizona, where Tony is serving
a life sentence in prison.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.140
But Rooster was the most
malignant member of the family,

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.900
spreading what his boys
came to call the family

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.530
curse like a criminal
contagion, which

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.630
infected almost everyone in the
family over four generations.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.370
As Bobby told me, Rooster
hated toys and sports.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.770
The only thing fun
for him was stealing.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.650
So he took us out with him
to burglarize our neighbors'

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.632
houses or steal their
cows or chickens

00:07:55.632 --> 00:07:57.840
or take their mail out of
their mailbox, particularly

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.270
Social Security checks
if they could find them.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.420
And one night Rooster
led his whole clan

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.600
to the big Bonneville
Dam on the Columbia River

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.975
and broke into
the fish hatchery.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.434
They took as many coho
and Chinook salmon

00:08:14.434 --> 00:08:16.100
as they could load
into Rooster's truck.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.650
Their mother, Kathy,
served as the lookout,

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.870
waiting in the truck while
they were inside the wire.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.900
And then she drove
the getaway vehicle.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:32.551
So it was a burglary
by the whole family.

00:08:32.551 --> 00:08:34.890
Rooster also did not
believe in celebrating

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.789
Christmas or birthdays.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.590
And years later, while
he was incarcerated

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.320
in the Oregon State
Penitentiary in Salem,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.020
Bobby could remember
only one Christmas

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.210
when his father gave
him a Christmas present.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.050
It was a heavy, metal wrench
in a plain, brown paper bag

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.050
presented with no explanation.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.640
Bobby was only four
years old at the time.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.940
And he was a little stumped
as to what this was.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.940
But then he recalled what he'd
heard around the family dinner

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.820
table in excited conversations,
his father boasting

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.180
about the burglaries that
he'd done when he was younger.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.824
So Bobby decided that his father
had given him a burglar's tool.

00:09:14.824 --> 00:09:16.490
And the next morning,
which was actually

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.940
Christmas Day, he snuck out
of the house before dawn

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:25.600
and with his older
brother, Tony,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.030
broke into a nearby
grocery store.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.190
In the back of a store,
there was a caged-in area

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.025
with a padlock on it
where all the Coca-Cola

00:09:33.025 --> 00:09:34.810
bottles were stashed.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.900
And Bobby used this
great, big wrench

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.040
to break open the padlock
and got the Coca-Cola bottles

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.480
and took them home with him
to have a family celebration.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.550
When he walked in the
door with all the bottles,

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.860
Rooster was elated.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.160
He said, yes, that's my boys.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.800
It was as if he was
celebrating a school report

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.130
card with straight A's or a
Little League baseball home

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:00.630
run.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.730
Bobby told me, my
father had been

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.720
encouraging us to steal
practically since I was born.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.240
He taught us stealing
was good as long as we

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.830
didn't get caught.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:19.500
If the boys got caught, Rooster
would cut a switch off a tree

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:25.140
and use the branch to whip the
boys until their backs and legs

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.900
were covered with blood.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.410
So, Bobby said, we were a crime
family, where stealing was fun

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.900
and going to prison
was the honorable thing

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.420
to do for your family.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.280
One of the happiest
moments of Tracey's life

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.850
occurred when he
was eight years old.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.590
And he and Bobby managed to
break into the attic of a bar

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.406
one evening and
snuck up the stairs

00:10:47.406 --> 00:10:49.030
and waited till after
dark when the bar

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.180
had closed and then went
back down the stairs

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.190
into the darkened room.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.050
And they helped
themselves to all the cash

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.480
in the cash register.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.650
They stuffed it in a
bag and walked home

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.070
to where they were sharing
with their mother, which

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.316
was a trailer.

00:11:05.316 --> 00:11:07.940
And while their mother was still
sleeping early in the morning,

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.270
they took the sack
of cash and poured it

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.430
over her head,
which woke her up.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.570
And she shrieked with joy.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.010
That made Tracey very happy.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.820
And when he told the story
to me in prison about that,

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.040
he was so happy, the tears
began to run down his cheeks.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.080
And he began to shake.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:39.390
It was as if, in recalling
this robbery, that he

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.390
was able to transport
himself over the high walls

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.930
of the prison, in fact,
transport himself back in time

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.620
to that very moment in his
mother's mobile home years

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.070
before.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.950
Rooster not only took his
children out to commit crimes,

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:59.870
he also happily prophesied
where that would lead them.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:05.000
Some days, he would take his
boys to a lake to go fishing.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.370
The route would take them
past another prison outside

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:12.140
of Salem, Oregon State
Correctional Institution

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.280
at Salem, which is surrounded
by mounds of shiny, razor wire.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.060
Rooster would gaze
at the prison,

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.660
as if he was looking
at some ancient castle.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.836
And he would say to his
boys, look carefully.

00:12:27.836 --> 00:12:29.460
Remember this because
when you grow up,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.760
this is where you're
going to live.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.000
In fact, as Rooster's
seven sons grew older,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.210
they all dropped out of school.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:43.457
Bobby left in the seventh grade,
Tracey in the eighth grade.

00:12:43.457 --> 00:12:45.540
And instead of attending
conventional commencement

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.580
ceremonies, they graduated
to more serious crime.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.000
Their favorite as teenagers
was to steal big rig trucks, 18

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.070
wheelers, which they
would drive down

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.440
I-5 from Salem and
the Willamette Valley

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.800
to California, over 300 miles,
or east to Boise, Idaho,

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.417
on I-84, more than 450 miles.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.000
When they started
these capers, Tracey

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.820
was so young and short
that he could barely

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.500
see over the steering wheel.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.330
And his feet hardly
touched the pedals.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.990
He was seven.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.080
Altogether, the boys claim
to me that they stole

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.000
more than 300 big rig trucks.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.390
Of course, you'd want to allow
for some youthful braggadocio

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.450
in this.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.630
But the number was still large.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.120
And the boys were eventually
caught and arrested

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.400
and sentenced to the most-secure
juvenile reformatory in Oregon.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.280
Please allow me a flashback
here because the Bogles' story

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.235
actually starts much
earlier than Rooster.

00:13:54.235 --> 00:13:56.230
I was able to trace
the family back

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:02.850
to the end of the Civil
War in 1865 in Tennessee

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.880
to a tiny farming
hamlet called Daylight

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.280
in the hills of Tennessee,
central Tennessee,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.210
near Nashville.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.800
Rooster's ancestors,
it turns out,

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.375
were poor farmers and
con men, grifters,

00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:18.500
who tried for years to
trick the federal government

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.910
in Washington into giving
Roosters great grandfather

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.517
a Civil War pension.

00:14:24.517 --> 00:14:26.600
He claimed that he had
been a captain in the Union

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.270
Army, which he was not.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.330
He wasn't even in
the Army at all.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.140
But they kept trying until the
beginning of the first World

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.370
War in 1914.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.860
So like 40 years, they
kept filing false petitions

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.500
to the government.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.630
And Rooster's own
father, Lewis Bogle,

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.260
continued the family
tradition of being

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:57.210
a con artist when he moved from
Tennessee to Texas in 1921.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.930
He joined his uncle there, who
came from Daylight, Tennessee,

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.640
selling the local
specialty, which

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.500
was nursery trees stock,
young apple and pear trees.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.310
His uncle had made a small
fortune with this business

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.240
and had been able to purchase
a house and a new Model T Ford,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.540
which is the symbol of the
Automobile Age, which had just

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.840
arrived in the US.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.720
Lewis soon fell in love
with a local country girl,

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.430
named Elvie Morris.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.200
And he conned her
into believing that he

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.870
was the real owner of the
Model T Ford and of the house.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.750
And she was so smitten
by this, seeing this man

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.190
with apparently good prospects,
that she married him.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.350
But then the local economy
fell into a depression

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.730
because the price
of cotton dropped.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:48.299
And so Lewis's uncle decided
to move back to Tennessee.

00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:49.840
And in the process,
he sold his house

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.150
and took the Model
T Ford with him.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.800
And Lewis was
exposed as a fraud.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.700
Luckily, his new wife came to
the rescue because as a girl,

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.390
she had learned how to
drive a motorcycle, which

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:07.980
young women in Texas, in those
days, did not consider polite.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.780
With her motorcycle
skills, she went out

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.600
and found a carnival, which
was traveling through.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.170
And they needed somebody to
drive a motorcycle around,

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.340
what's called, a motor drum.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.965
I don't know if any of you know
what a motor drum is, where you

00:16:23.965 --> 00:16:26.410
drive around the walls and
go up and up, and up and up

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.460
to the top.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.700
And then, the person
driving the motorcycle

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.327
will raise one hand up.

00:16:32.327 --> 00:16:33.910
And the customers
leaning over the top

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.490
would drop money
into their hands.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.205
Sorry.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:41.500
Elvie and Lewis, in fact,
spent the next 20 years

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.760
working in the carnival,
which was, largely--

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.135
The people that they worked
with were largely gypsies.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.070
And they barely
eked out a living.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.850
But they supplemented it
by making and then selling

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.810
moonshine during prohibition.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.060
And they sometimes got
arrested and went to prison.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.540
They lived in railroad cars or
tents, moving from town to town

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.569
each week as the
carnival moved on.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.819
So there was no time
or place, really,

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.630
for their children
to go to school.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:18.500
So most of their children
grew up almost illiterate.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.540
Rooster was the last child.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.190
And in 1958, when he was
16, he joined his brothers

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:29.840
and his sister and his mother in
burglarizing their neighborhood

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.230
grocery store.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.450
They were then living
in Amarillo, Texas.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.990
And the burglary was the largest
in the history of Amarillo,

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.260
up to that point.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.160
They made off with $20,000
from the grocery store.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.400
And Elvie sat at the dining room
table, as they tell the story.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.840
And she had all the money.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.234
And she would put
bills out in front

00:17:50.234 --> 00:17:51.900
of each of the members
of the family who

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.990
had taken part, as if she
was dealing a deck of cards.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.845
But two months later, the
police solved the crime.

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:01.724
They arrested the Bogles.

00:18:01.724 --> 00:18:03.890
And Rooster was sentenced
to five years in the state

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.415
penitentiary in Huntsville.

00:18:06.415 --> 00:18:10.190
It was only after all the
boys finally got out of prison

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:14.030
and came home that their
father and mother decided

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:18.740
they should move away from
Amarillo because police

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.380
were picking them up anytime
there was something suspicious.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:26.120
So they tried moving
to Oregon, to Salem.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.450
But that did not stop their
criminal proclivities, which

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.610
they simply brought with them.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.190
Even now, 60 years
after that, there

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.100
are still 10 Bogles
in prison and three

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.860
who have escaped and
are hiding somewhere

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.990
in Montana and Arizona.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.330
One criminologist
estimated the costs

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.526
of a family like the
Bogles to society

00:18:48.526 --> 00:18:51.590
that the Bogle family
by itself would

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:57.250
have cost other Americans
a total of $480 million,

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:00.130
rather staggering figure.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.470
Finally, I'd like
to share a few ideas

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.870
on what the Bogles and the
research on how crime runs

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.890
in families might tell us about
reforming our criminal justice

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.640
system.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.070
One of the oddities about
the criminal justice system

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:17.570
is that, although we
spent $282 billion

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.800
on the criminal justice
system last year,

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.600
the criminal justice
system does not keep data

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.000
on families like the Bogles.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.890
That is, when
somebody is arrested,

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.140
the police don't
ask them, do you

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.640
have a father or a
mother or brother

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.000
or sister or children
who have been in prison?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.210
When somebody goes to court,
the prosecutor and the judge

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.700
don't ask, do you have
anybody in your family

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.860
who's ever been to prison?

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.260
If a person is convicted
and sent to prison,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.605
when they arrive in prison,
the prison doesn't ask them,

00:19:47.605 --> 00:19:49.730
do you have a mother or
father who's been in prison

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.794
or an aunt or an
uncle or grandparent

00:19:51.794 --> 00:19:53.210
or children who've
been in prison?

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:01.387
So nobody really knows
exactly how many children

00:20:01.387 --> 00:20:02.220
there are like this.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.180
One way a
family-focused approach

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.610
could make the criminal
justice system more effective

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.520
is if we gather data on this.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.510
I don't mean to
stigmatize the Bogles

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.360
but it's rather to
help them by trying

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.950
to get them therapy
at an early age

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.770
when they're more
easily reached.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.030
It might sound intrusive.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.360
But it could be as
simple as an intake form

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.240
that you fill out when you go to
visit your doctor or hospital.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.990
And they ask you, do you have a
family history of heart attack

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:43.360
or strokes or
diabetes or cancer.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.900
And we all pretty much are
accustomed to answering

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.950
those questions.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.530
And it helps because that
can play a vital role

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.020
in whether you're likely
to get the condition too.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.230
And it's very similar.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.300
Criminality is passed
down in a very similar way

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.900
we know because the
statistics I was talking about

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.760
show that the more
members of your family

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.110
you have who have been
convicted and sent to prison,

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:16.400
the more likely you are
to go to prison yourself.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.338
So it's similar to
what happens medically.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.670
Second, a family
focus could lead

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.370
to more therapies
or better therapies

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:32.640
for young people who are in
danger of becoming delinquent.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.590
For example, in
recent years, there's

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:42.570
a new program called
multisystemic therapy, which

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.200
uses highly trained
psychologists or social workers

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.690
to go into the
homes of people who

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.420
have a child or a
teenager who's getting

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.070
in trouble with the law.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.610
And the program can be
triggered by the youngster

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.940
appearing before a judge,
who decides to send them

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.160
to this therapy, rather
than sending them

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.140
to a locked institution.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.470
The program will bring this team
of specially trained therapists

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.250
right into the home and
actually often set up shop there

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.870
and live there with the family.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.810
The trick is to try to get the
whole family, not just the one

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.520
kid whose getting in trouble,
but to learn about the father,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.420
the mother, the brothers,
the sisters, grandparents,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.752
if they can be found,
if they're around.

00:22:24.752 --> 00:22:29.770
And multisystemic therapy
has treated 200,000 families

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.180
over the past 10
years in 35 states

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.250
and 25 foreign countries.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.980
And the early results
are very encouraging.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.860
There's also another way to
use a focus on the family

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.930
to reduce crime.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:50.410
The judge who presided over
many of the Bogles' trials

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.860
over four generations
was named Albin Norblad.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.800
He was a crusty
law-and-order Republican,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.270
who favored a lock them up and
throw away the key approach.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.380
But over years of
dealing with the Bogles,

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.990
he told me, when the courts
try to deal with families

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:09.150
like these, we always lose.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.040
He said, just locking
up more Bogles

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.970
is not going to do anything
more than cost taxpayers' money.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.210
He said we need another
solution to this.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.320
He didn't know that at the time.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.620
But a few things have
emerged since then.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.840
And one program came
about by accident

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.510
after Hurricane
Katrina obliterated New

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.620
Orleans in 2005.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.150
A young criminologist at
the University of Texas

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:41.400
noticed something fascinating
because most state inmates

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.930
in Louisiana, in the prisons,
come from New Orleans.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.810
After Katrina, they
couldn't go back home

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.010
because their houses were gone.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.380
So they began moving to Texas.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.350
And this criminologist
began to survey them

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.840
at one- and three- and
five-year intervals

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.670
after Katrina to see if their
rate of recommitting crimes

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.490
would go down or
would stay the same.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:09.270
And what he found was that
the ones who moved away

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.910
had a much lower rate of
recommitting crime and being

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.430
sent back to prison,
compared to those

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:18.060
who had managed to go back to
their homes in New Orleans.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.840
What he concluded was
that by moving away,

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.200
these people had been
able to, former inmates,

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.200
had been able to break
their social network.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.251
And so they were able to
get away from the habits

00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:33.000
that they had learned
with their families.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.740
And this young criminologist,
named David Kirk,

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.830
then created a
program in Maryland,

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.650
using funds from the Maryland
Department of Corrections,

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:51.195
for inmates who are being
released from prison

00:24:51.195 --> 00:24:52.445
whose homes were in Baltimore.

00:24:52.445 --> 00:24:57.690
Baltimore dominates prison
population in Maryland.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:02.310
And they worked out a program,
under which the state would

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.220
give inmates who agreed
not to go home to Baltimore

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.320
but would move to other
parts of Maryland--

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.810
It would give them a housing
allowance of $1,200 a month.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:14.670
And quite a few of the inmates
have taken the state's offer

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.940
and have not moved back to
their homes in Baltimore

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.880
but moved away to other
places, taking housing loans.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.460
And the rate of re-offending
for those people

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.660
has really plummeted.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.080
And it's one of the few
actually successful programs

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.320
that anyone can identify.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.960
I'm also very happy
to tell you that,

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.260
because it took me so long,
10 years, to write this book,

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.340
to get all the Bogles to
talk, that, finally last year,

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.030
the first member of the family
ever in 150 years, actually

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.920
graduated from college.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.810
Her name is Ashley Bogle.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:53.620
And she was a
granddaughter of Rooster.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.560
She decided that she didn't want
to be like the other members

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.680
of her family.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.110
And she was very good in school.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.780
And she got straight A's all the
way through high school and all

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.340
the way through college.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.910
And she's now got a job
helping work with computers--

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.210
I can't tell you exactly what--

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:13.590
in a hospital right
outside of Salem.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.140
She's bought herself
a small apartment.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:16.740
She has a car.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.490
And she has a
three-year-old daughter, who

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.530
she's raising as a single mom.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:25.500
So she has finally
managed to get past this.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.930
And every day when she
commutes to the hospital,

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.330
from her home to the
hospital where she works,

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.610
she has to pass right by the
Oregon State Correctional

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:37.330
Institution, where many of her
family members were locked up.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.020
In fact, she still has a cousin,
who is exactly her age, who's

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.540
inside that prison.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.320
But she doesn't dwell on
this bizarre coincidence

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.560
because she has been
able to move past it.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.430
She no longer needs to live
with crime, with violence,

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.560
or with prison in her life.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.650
So I'd like to stop there
and invite any of you who

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:02.131
have questions, please.

00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:02.630
Yes.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.878
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.480
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.820
So you mentioned
different solutions

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.210
to help the Bogles and
everyone in their situation.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.470
The first one,
here at Google, we

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:23.500
have this policy where we always
think that more data is better.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:27.810
So you mentioned people
should have, maybe,

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.180
list that their parents
or their immediate family

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.440
went to prison.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.550
But don't you think there
could be bias introduced

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.910
if the jury or the
judge knows that person

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:43.027
comes from a family of crime?

00:27:43.027 --> 00:27:45.360
FOX BUTTERFIELD: I'm glad you
asked that because I had--

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.750
I wanted to make a
comment about that.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.040
So, yes, I mean, this
is a balancing act.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.710
The judge will know.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:00.180
The prosecutors will
know if the person

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.789
themself had a prior record.

00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:03.330
But now we're getting
to the question

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.670
of if some member of their
family had a prior record.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.330
It's a balancing act.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.880
And I don't know the answer.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.790
But, actually, I was thinking
that maybe Google would

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.450
have an answer as to how you get
this data because it's actually

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.270
available.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.540
Every state and every
city has a record

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.790
of people who are
sentenced to prison.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:27.570
And they have it.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.940
It's on your computer
anytime you want to look,

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.160
whether you're in Arizona
or Texas or California

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.040
or Washington or Oregon.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.050
You can easily find it.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:39.210
So it's a question of
collecting that data

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:42.030
and putting it somewhere.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.160
I don't know the answers
to how you balance that.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.910
But the benefit would be
that you could stop more

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.230
of the members of this family.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.210
If the Bogles had
been known for--

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.010
they'd been publicly
or at least known

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.850
to the authorities for
what they were doing

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.210
for all the time that
passed, the opportunities

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.730
were lost to try to change them.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.030
But nobody could do it because
they didn't fully know.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.900
So the judge who told me--

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:12.390
Well, this judge
named Albin Norblad,

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:15.780
he said that he'd had five
families like the Bogles

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.200
in his court, all of whom had
more than 50 members in prison

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.112
covering four generations.

00:29:22.112 --> 00:29:23.820
And he was just one
to throw his hands up

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.130
because he had very little
he could do about them.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.270
But if they'd been
seen earlier, they

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:37.109
could've been, some way,
headed away from this.

00:29:37.109 --> 00:29:39.150
I don't know the correct
answer to your question.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.910
But I think it's something
we have to think about.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:42.570
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:43.500
Thanks.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.000
AUDIENCE: So in
your talk you talked

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.040
about a lot of the
socialization that happened,

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.560
about how the child was
given the wrench when

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.545
they were really young, went
off and stole all these colas,

00:29:52.545 --> 00:29:55.736
about how somebody was talking
about this criminal act

00:29:55.736 --> 00:29:57.610
and it brought tears to
their eyes and so on.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.240
So how does bringing a
whole bunch of people

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.045
into that family
and having that--

00:30:03.045 --> 00:30:04.920
You mentioned that it's
one of the solutions,

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.628
having these people
come into the family.

00:30:06.628 --> 00:30:08.640
How does that help with
the whole socialization

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.010
and glorification of
crime that they already

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.690
have in their family?

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.581
Does that make sense?

00:30:14.581 --> 00:30:16.580
FOX BUTTERFIELD: Yes, of
course, it makes sense.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.680
It's a good question.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.510
I think the one program
that I mentioned--

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.910
There are several
others very similar now,

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.920
which are actually
now companies that are

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.900
in the business of doing this.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.640
They're multisystemic
therapy actually

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.980
has its headquarters in
Charleston, South Carolina.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.813
There's a similar company
based in New York.

00:30:33.813 --> 00:30:36.720
But they're, basically now,
all around the country.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.990
And they work to try to find
the most positive person

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.520
in the family, whoever it is.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.180
Doesn't matter whether it's
a grandparent or cousin.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.510
And then they try to get
the family member who's

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.660
most in trouble and
attach relations

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.620
between the most positive person
and the person most in trouble

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.880
and try to see if they can
get some benefit from closer

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.760
relationship between
those two extremes.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.800
But they also work
with the whole family.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.107
And I saw one program in
Jacksonville, Florida, which

00:31:09.107 --> 00:31:11.190
was quite interesting
because the local prosecutor

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:17.700
there, when kids were
starting to get in trouble,

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.484
he had hired--

00:31:18.484 --> 00:31:20.025
Instead of hiring
another prosecutor,

00:31:20.025 --> 00:31:21.810
he'd actually hired
a psychologist.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:26.662
And the psychologist devised
a series of weekly meetings.

00:31:26.662 --> 00:31:28.620
If there was a kid getting
in serious trouble--

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.290
For example, I saw a boy
who was five years old who

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:32.510
had hit a girl--

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:35.310
a boy who had hit
a girl, also five--

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.796
over the head with a brick
and fractured her skull.

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:40.170
Normally, the boy
would have been

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.880
taken in front of a
juvenile court judge

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.360
and sent to some locked
juvenile facility,

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.850
even though he was
only five years old.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:52.060
But, in this case, the
prosecutor had set up a team.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.600
And what they did was they
brought together people

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.464
from all different agencies.

00:31:56.464 --> 00:31:58.380
So they had somebody
from the police, somebody

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.350
from a local parole
and probation.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.660
They had somebody from
the school department.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.390
They had somebody from the
hospital where each of the kids

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.424
was born.

00:32:08.424 --> 00:32:09.590
And they sat around a table.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.780
And they would go around
the table asking questions.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.460
What do you know about this kid?

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.560
And police would know this much.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.780
And the parole officer would
know another part of it.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.060
And then the hospital
would find out more.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.820
For example, this
particular kid was--

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.520
His mother was a
cocaine addict and had

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:29.120
been born addicted to cocaine.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.887
And the school would
tell them other stories.

00:32:31.887 --> 00:32:33.720
So by the time they'd
gone around the table,

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.870
they had learned a great
deal more about the kid.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.236
And they were able to figure
out ways of dealing with him.

00:32:39.236 --> 00:32:41.580
And in Jacksonville
what they did was--

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.270
Because Jacksonville's a large
military base and has a large,

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.205
retired military population--

00:32:46.205 --> 00:32:48.920
It has Air Force and Navy bases.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.730
So they get volunteers and they
assign them, the volunteers,

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.174
to work with these kids,
actually be there in the house.

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:58.590
So they will be there when the
kid gets up in the morning,

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.310
make sure he or
she gets breakfast,

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.710
then will walk with
them to school,

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:07.556
and then be there when they get
out of school, bring them home.

00:33:07.556 --> 00:33:08.930
If they have
homework to do, make

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.096
sure the homework gets done.

00:33:10.096 --> 00:33:12.680
Make sure they have a
proper dinner that night.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.940
And, in some cases, what
the prosecutor would do is,

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.910
he would say the
mother or the father

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.860
have to sign a civil contract.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.380
He can't force the family
to take the therapy.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:28.040
But if they sign a civil
contract, that's enforceable.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.360
And then, the kid will be in
that program for maybe two

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:30.860
years.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.401
And then, in the case that I'm
talking about, where the boy--

00:33:33.401 --> 00:33:34.580
whose name was Freddie--

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.790
broke the girl's
skull with a brick,

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:41.130
he had this mentor in
this life for two years.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.230
And that's now more
than 10 years ago.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:46.190
And he's had no further
juvenile record.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.760
Being able to figure out
what was wrong with him,

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.996
understand what he--

00:33:50.996 --> 00:33:52.370
I should have said
that they also

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.920
then discovered that
the actual father was

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.080
in prison for murder.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.480
But only by pooling
all these resources

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.197
were they able to establish
what the family was like

00:34:02.197 --> 00:34:04.280
and what influence they
might have had on the kid.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.060
And then you bring in the mentor
who forms this positive role

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.409
model that the kid
didn't otherwise have.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:14.150
So that particular case and
the Jacksonville case, a lot

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.290
of good stuff has happened.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:16.790
And it doesn't cost much money.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:20.067
The volunteers are free.

00:34:20.067 --> 00:34:22.400
And it certainly costs a lot
less than locking a kid up,

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.850
which could be $35,000--
$50,000 a year,

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.114
even though they're
only five years old.

00:34:28.114 --> 00:34:29.405
AUDIENCE: Following up on this.

00:34:29.405 --> 00:34:31.210
So it sounds like
the problem is when

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:34.090
people start doing crime with
young age, it's fun and profit.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:35.659
And they don't get punished.

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:37.159
That grows.

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:39.110
So they get more fun
and profit, until they

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.659
commit something serious,
get once caught, and then

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:43.170
go to prison.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:47.040
So would it help to try to
correct them at earlier age,

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.210
to kind of try to catch
for the small crimes

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.429
and punish them someway or
work with them, like you say,

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:52.929
therapy.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:57.230
But therapy's just different
word for prison, just milder

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:58.895
prison.

00:34:58.895 --> 00:35:01.520
FOX BUTTERFIELD: I'm not sure I
would agree that the therapy is

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.350
a milder form of prison.

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:07.800
I mean, the therapy
properly done can be very--

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.570
is proved very beneficial
in these cases from the ones

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.520
that I've looked at and
spent some time with.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:20.980
And the juvenile prisons
are wretched places.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:26.534
And they very seldom have much
positive impact on the kid.

00:35:26.534 --> 00:35:28.450
AUDIENCE: It seems like
many of these programs

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.180
would be most effective if
the people want to change,

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.287
want to get out of
this life of crime.

00:35:33.287 --> 00:35:34.870
In how many of your
interviews did you

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:37.120
find that people did
want to get out of it.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.740
And how often was it?

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:42.610
Were people satisfied with
the current situation?

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.110
FOX BUTTERFIELD:
That's a good question.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:48.700
So in the Bogle family,
very few of the people

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.910
really wanted to get out of
it because this is the values

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:53.530
that they had learned.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:57.670
And their value system
was, to the rest of us,

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:59.620
looks kind of upside down.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.232
And it was, in fact, when
they got out of prison

00:36:02.232 --> 00:36:03.940
that they found it
very difficult to cope

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.620
with the world because,
in prison, they

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.280
were used to having
everything free and available.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.040
I mean, your housing was free.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.540
Your food was free.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.370
You didn't have to pay taxes.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.930
You didn't have to obey
the law, particularly.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.100
So you were able to
do what you wanted.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.880
I was able to spend time with
one of the Bogles, Tracey

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.600
Bogle, when he finally got--
finished his 16-year prison

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.179
sentence.

00:36:30.179 --> 00:36:31.970
Everybody else in his
family was in prison.

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:34.270
And nobody could go and
pick him up when he got out.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.530
So I went.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.210
And I spent the next
two weeks with him,

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.670
watching what he had to
do and all the places

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:43.690
he had to register and sign up
and what programs he had to do.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:48.910
He found it incredibly hard
to go straight, although he

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:50.140
said to me, the key words.

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.630
He said, this just
isn't any fun.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:54.370
It was much easier
committing crimes.

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:55.250
And so he went back.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:56.749
And he began
committing crimes again

00:36:56.749 --> 00:36:59.380
because that was
what he like to do.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:05.755
And living the regular law and
order life just wasn't any fun.

00:37:05.755 --> 00:37:06.255
Yes.

00:37:06.255 --> 00:37:07.140
AUDIENCE: Could you
share some numbers

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.560
about how many families
like this that you

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.100
were able to encounter?

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.240
FOX BUTTERFIELD: Well, so
this was sort of the big one

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.240
that I encountered.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.740
After I started
work on this family,

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.031
I didn't go looking for others.

00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:23.280
But there were many other
branches of this family

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.660
that I also looked at.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.930
So there was another branch
like Rooster's, which

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:30.270
I did the research on them for
over a long period of time.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:32.490
But it was just too much
to put into the book.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:35.520
And the stories became
very repetitive.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.490
They sounded a lot
like each other.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.670
So my book editor said, you just
can't put them all in the book.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:44.190
So I threw away more
than half my research.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:47.460
I mean, painful for me but
it made the book a lot easier

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.630
to read.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.390
My editor was right about that.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:53.272
But once I found
the Bogles, I mean,

00:37:53.272 --> 00:37:54.480
I heard about other families.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.470
But it was just impossible
to spend that much time doing

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.489
another family.

00:38:00.489 --> 00:38:02.030
AUDIENCE: So earlier
you said that it

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.950
seemed like some of
the family members

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.590
were totally fine
with the arrangement

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:09.617
and the way things were
going in their family.

00:38:09.617 --> 00:38:12.200
Did you get the impression that,
if at the end of the sentence

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.030
they were offered the chance
to just stay in prison,

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.279
that they would have taken it?

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.910
FOX BUTTERFIELD: No.

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:21.350
I did meet one
person who actually

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:25.550
did that, who was
released from prison

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:30.350
but refused to leave
because he was actually

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.007
worried that when he got
out, he would screw up again.

00:38:33.007 --> 00:38:34.340
And he would commit more crimes.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.540
And he'd have to
go back to prison.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.230
And he stayed in prison
several extra years

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:40.970
when he didn't have to.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:42.980
So, I mean, that does happen.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.060
But I'd say most people
when they're let out,

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:45.950
they want to get out.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.920
But then they find that life
outside is really much more

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.850
difficult. It's hard
to pay your bills

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:55.580
for your house and your
food and pay your taxes,

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.459
so taxes, not something they
ever had to worry about.

00:38:58.459 --> 00:38:59.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.412
Thank you.

00:39:01.412 --> 00:39:02.870
AUDIENCE: So I was
wondering if you

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:05.420
had an opinion
about alternatives

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.770
to prison, from just
community work, all

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:15.020
the way to the penal
abolition movement that

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.970
is kind of on the fringe.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:17.570
But it exists.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:20.960
There are people who argue
for the complete abolition

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.540
of anything penal and
process everything

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.645
through civil courts.

00:39:25.645 --> 00:39:27.020
FOX BUTTERFIELD:
So you're asking

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:32.450
about what are the alternatives
that exist instead of prison?

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:36.920
AUDIENCE: And more about your
opinion about, well, what--

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.339
If you were to set the
policy, where should we go?

00:39:39.339 --> 00:39:40.880
FOX BUTTERFIELD: So
I would certainly

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:47.000
want to have many more
alternatives than we have now

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.609
and particularly for younger
people who are starting

00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:50.900
to get in trouble with the law.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.930
We want to try to
divert them from this.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:56.740
But the criminal justice
system in the United States

00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:01.090
is set up to hit people pretty
hard as soon as you can.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:04.460
So they get very long sentences.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.130
American sentencing laws
are much tougher than those

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:11.960
of almost any other Western
country or are just many

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.220
more years or life imprisonment
or these three strikes

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:19.850
and you're out laws, which
other countries just don't have.

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:23.210
So we end up with much
greater proportion

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:25.310
of our population in prison.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:29.690
So I think since 1980, we've
put almost 15 million people

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.970
in prison in this country
as separate individuals,

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:35.350
not people going back for a
second time, so 15 million.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.040
And it's almost 10
million children

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.170
who, at some point
in their lives,

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:43.100
have had a parent in prison.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.810
Since we know that
that tends to create

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:51.140
more crime and more criminals,
that's not a good solution.

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.740
Specifically, I'm not sure which
alternative you're looking at.

00:40:57.865 --> 00:40:59.990
AUDIENCE: I don't have
experience with this myself.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.820
But my wife was--

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:07.130
She used to be a judge in
France and working specifically

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.700
with inmates.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.580
It's a special judge
that in France handles

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:14.360
parole and alternatives
to prison and also people

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.010
going out of prison.

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:18.260
And so there are alternatives,
at least in France.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:22.460
We have alternatives,
like electronic bracelets

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:28.160
or anklets, the possibility to
work outside and sleep in jail,

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.120
and for minor offenses,
well, things like community

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.350
work and so on.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.990
FOX BUTTERFIELD: So you've
just given a very good answer

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:36.031
as to what we're missing.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.620
As far as I know, we don't
have people like that.

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.640
We don't have a judge
who watches over

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.380
people who are
released from prison

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.110
and provides
alternatives for them.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.680
It doesn't exist.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.010
We want to lock
people up, which is

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.440
why we have, by far,
the world's largest

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.670
proportion of our population
in jail or prison.

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.610
So you're describing
something that

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.420
would be very nice to
have in this country.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:07.700
But we don't have it.

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:12.025
AUDIENCE: Well, it's not
all rosy in France itself.

00:42:12.025 --> 00:42:16.760
I mean, prisons are over
capacity by a factor of two.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.550
And, of course, nobody
will vote for more money

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:20.790
to get people into prison.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.900
So last time there was
a right-wing government

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.130
that added more stricter
laws, like three strikes

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.650
and you're out and so on.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:32.660
What they did is
that, simply, instead

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:36.780
of commuting all sentences
under a year into alternatives,

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.500
they started commuting all
sentences under two years

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.820
into alternatives just out
of lack of space in prisons.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:44.970
Maybe it was a good thing.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.790
I don't know.

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.340
FOX BUTTERFIELD: Well I mean,
that's a much more enlightened

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.780
and progressive
system than we have,

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:55.170
is we go for the heavy
duty stuff very quickly.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.615
We don't have
enough alternatives.

00:42:57.615 --> 00:42:59.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you very
much for presenting today.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:00.865
FOX BUTTERFIELD: Thank you.

00:43:00.865 --> 00:43:03.780
