00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.750
Welcome back.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.780
Before we proceed further and
get a little bit better

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.000
understanding of why maybe some
of these investors were

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.330
so keen on investing in mortgage
backed securities,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.330
essentially loaning this money
to all these people who are

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.090
buying these ever appreciating
houses, I think we need to a

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.110
few more tools in
our tool belt.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.910
So I'm going to introduce
you to the concept

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.710
of the yield curve.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.890
You might have heard
this before.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.970
You might have heard people
on CNBC talk about it.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.460
And hopefully, after about the
next five or ten minutes, you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.600
will know a lot about
the yield curve.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.290
So when most people talk about
the yield curve, they're

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.950
talking about the treasury
yield curve.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.930
And what does that mean?

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.580
What is even a treasury?

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.230
So these treasury securities,
whether they're T-Bills,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.445
treasury bills, treasury notes,
or treasury bonds.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.130
These are loans to the
federal government.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.720
And these are considered
risk-free.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.090
Because if you lend to the
federal government and they're

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.840
running short of cash, all they
have to do is increase

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.590
taxes on us the people and they
can pay back your debt.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.400
So in dollar denominated terms,
the treasury bills,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.060
notes, and bonds are about as
safe as you can get in terms

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.420
of lending your money
to anyone.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.540
So when most people talk about
the yield curve, they're

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.630
talking about the risk-free
yield curve.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.260
And they're talking about the
curve for treasuries.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.770
So first, a little bit
of definitions.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.470
What is the difference between
treasury bills, treasury

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.480
notes, and treasury bonds?

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.790
They're pretty much all loans
to the government.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.210
But they're loans for different
amounts of time.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.580
So if I give a loan to the
government for $1,000 for six

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.500
months, that will be
a treasury bill.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.710
So I will give the government
$1,000, the government would

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.180
give me a treasury bill.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.340
And that treasury bill from the
government is essentially

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.229
just an IOU saying that I'm
going to give you your money

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.740
back in six months with
interest. Similarly, if it's

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.010
three months, it's a three
month treasury bill.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.590
Treasury notes are loans that
are from one year to 10 years.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.110
So on this graph that we're
going to make using the actual

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.060
yield curve rates, from zero
to one year-- and actually

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.490
there's no zero year
treasury bill.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.250
Actually, the shortest
one is one month.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.830
This would be something like
here on our graph.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.810
So from one month to one year,
these are T-bills.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.090
And this is just definitional.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.560
Then from one year to 10
year, these are notes.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.670
Actually, I believe the one
year itself is a note.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.440
Up to one year is a bill.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.520
Although, I might be
wrong with that.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.490
Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.700
That's just a definitional
thing.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.950
From one to 10 year, these
are called notes.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.850
And then when you go beyond
10 years, these are called

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.470
treasury bonds.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.930
These are just definitional
things to worry about.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.060
So with that out of the way,
let's talk about what the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.840
yield curve is.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.570
I'll just give you a simple
thought experiment.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.260
If I'm lending money to someone
for a month versus

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.020
lending money to that person for
a year, in which situation

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.080
am I probably taking
on more risk?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.040
Well, sure, if I'm lending
someone for a month, I know

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.870
only so much can happen
in that month.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.920
So I would expect to be paid
less interest. Not just

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.530
obviously in dollar terms, but
even adjusted for time, I

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.370
would expect less interest
for that month.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.410
And this is actually an
important point to make.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.880
When I say that I'm charging
6% interest for that month,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.730
that doesn't mean that after a
month the person is going to

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.650
pay me 6% on my money.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.040
It means that if I were to give
that money to somebody

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.820
for a month, and they
were to pay it back.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.970
And then I were to give that
money to, say, that same

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.240
person, or another person, for
a month, and I were to keep

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.770
doing that for a year, then in
aggregate I would get 6%.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.310
So that 6%, no matter what
duration we talk about,

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.550
whether one month, one year,
five years, 15 years, when we

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.190
talk about the interest rate,
that's the rate that on

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.160
average we would
get for a year.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.440
It's the annualized
interest rate.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.740
So going back to my question.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.970
If lend someone money, even the
government, for a month,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.870
there's usually less
risk in that.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.510
Because only so much
could happen in a

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.570
month versus in a year.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.190
In a year there might be more
inflation, the dollar might

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.120
collapse, I might be passing on
better investments, I might

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.880
need the cash in a year's time,
while I have a lot of

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.630
confidence that I don't need
the cash in a month's time.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.690
So in general, you expect less
interest when you loan money

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.910
for a shorter period time than
a longer period of time.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.645
And so let's draw the
yield curve and see

00:04:57.645 --> 00:04:58.490
if this holds true.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.830
So I actually went
to the treasury

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.400
website, so that's treas.gov.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.490
And this is the yield curve.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.000
So they say on March
14, so this is

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.860
the most recent number.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.830
And I'm going to plot this.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.520
They say, if you lend money to
the government for one month,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.830
you'll get 1.2% on that money.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.740
And remember, if it's $1,000
it's not like I'm going to get

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.830
1.2% on that $1,000 just
after a month.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.320
If I kept doing it for a year,
this is an annualized number,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.950
I'll get 1.2%.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.400
And so for three months, I
get a little bit less.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.080
And then for six months
I get more.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.710
And then it does seem that the
overall trend is that I expect

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.700
more and more money as I lend
money to the government for

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.530
larger and larger
periods of time.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.490
And this is a little interesting
anomaly that you

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.610
get a little bit more
interest for one

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.500
month than three months.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.810
And we'll do a more advanced
presentation later as to why

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.170
you might get lower yields for
longer duration investments.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.195
That's called an inverted
yield curve.

00:05:58.195 --> 00:06:02.160
So let's just plot this and
see what it looks like.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.530
So you saw where
I got my data.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.000
So they say for one month
I'd get 1.2%.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.030
So this is one month.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.800
It'd be right about here.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.370
Three months I get about
the same thing.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.720
For six months I get 1.32%.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.910
Maybe that's like here.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.520
One year, I get one 1.37%.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.460
Maybe it's here.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.880
Five years, I get 2.37%.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.130
So that's maybe like here.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.760
And these aren't all
of the durations.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.700
I'm just for simplicity not
going to do all of them.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.030
For 10 years, 3.44%.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.850
So maybe that's here.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.410
For 20 years, I get 4.3%.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.870
Like that.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.540
And then for 30 years,
I get 4.35%.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.400
So the current yield curve looks
something like this.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.140
And so you now hopefully at
least understand what the

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.830
yield curve is.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.960
All it is, is using
a simple graph.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.950
Someone can look at that graph
and say, well, in general what

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.340
type of rates am I getting for
lending to the government?

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.710
On a risk-free free basis, or
as risk-free as anything we

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.280
can expect, what type of rates
am I getting when I lend to

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.100
the government for different
periods of time?

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.730
And that's what the yield
curve tells us.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.120
And in general, it's
upwardly sloping.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.380
Because, as I said, when you
lend money for a longer period

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.000
of time, you're kind of
taking on more risk.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.770
There's a lot more that you
feel that could happen.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.020
You might need that cash.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.480
There might be inflation.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.560
The dollar might devalue.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.690
There's a lot of things
that could happen.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.120
So the next question
is, well, what

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.500
determines this yield curve?

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.890
Well, when the treasury, the
government, needs to borrow

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.370
money, what it does is say, hey
everyone we need to borrow

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.990
a billion dollars from
you, because we

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.510
can't control are spending.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.920
And they say we're going to
borrow a billion dollars in

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.960
one month notes.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.490
So this is one month notes.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.790
They're going to borrow
a billion dollars.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.370
And they have an auction.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.340
And the world, investors from
everywhere, they go in, they

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.460
say, well, this is a
safe place to put

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.850
my cash for a month.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.490
And depending on the demand,
that determines the rate.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.800
So if there are a lot of people
who want to buy those

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.940
one month treasuries, the rate
might be a little bit lower.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.290
Does that make sense to you?

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.170
Think about it.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.900
If a lot of people want to buy
it, there's a lot of demand

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.390
relative to the supply.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.840
So the government has to pay a
lower interest rate on it.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.159
Similarly, if for whatever
reason people don't want to

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.630
keep their money in the dollar,
they think the U.S.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.860
might default on their debt
one day, and not that many

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.480
people want to invest in the
treasury, then that auction,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.510
the government is going to have
to pay a higher interest

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.340
rate to people for them
to loan money to it.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.310
So maybe then the auction
ends up up here.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.230
And similarly, the government
does auctions for all of the

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:03.380
different durations.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.150
And duration, I just mean
the time period you're

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.320
getting the loan for.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.370
So they do it for one month,
three months, six months, one

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.940
year, two year, three
year, et cetera.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:17.930
Once the government has done
that auction-- You give the

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.010
money to the government,
they give you an

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.740
IOU called a T-bill.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.100
Then you could trade it
with other people.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.930
And that's going to determine
the rate in the short term.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.510
So the government does
the auction.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.310
But then after the auction,
and a lot of people had

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.990
demand, but then a lot of
people get freaked out.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.180
And the public markets, when you
try to sell that treasury,

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.480
will then expect.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.200
a higher yield.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.690
I know that might be a little
complicated now.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.510
And I always start to jumble
things when I run out of time.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.780
But hopefully at this point you
have a sense of what the

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.590
yield curve is.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.210
You have a sense of what
treasury bills, treasury

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.820
notes, and treasury bonds are.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.440
And you have some intuition
on why the yield

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.180
curve has this shape.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.110
See you in the next video.
