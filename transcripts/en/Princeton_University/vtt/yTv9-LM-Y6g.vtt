AMITAVA BHATTACHARJEE: The reason why we

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.640
see a total eclipse in the first place is
pretty remarkable.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.170
It happens when the sun is totally blocked
by the moon because the moon comes exactly

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.100
between the sun and the Earth
at some special location.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.730
Imagine you're in a room, and you have a light
bulb in a corner, and you're holding a piece

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.880
of circular cardboard to 
block the light bulb.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.400
You can do this only if the light bulb and
the board have a certain relative size, and

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.440
if the light bulb and the board 
have a certain distance.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.850
It turns out that the sun is exactly 400 times
the moon's diameter, and also exactly 400

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.800
times further away from the Earth 
than the moon is.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.629
This makes a total solar eclipse 
nearly a perfect fit.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.480
However, there is a difference between 
a partial and a total solar eclipse.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.460
In the area of partial solar eclipse, this
blocking will not be perfect and there always

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.780
will be a crescent of the sun that you will
see such as in places like Princeton.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.050
You will have to use protective eye gear to
see it because the sun has harmful radiation.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.900
No matter where you are in the United States,
you are within a day of driving to get to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.860
a total solar eclipse belt.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.320
I'm Amitava Bhattacharjee.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.760
I'm professor of astrophysical sciences at
Princeton University, and I'm also head of

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.200
the theory department in the 
Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.
