Uh, I got this in last night.

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:07.841
The State of Nevada is trying
to, uh, pass a referendum

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.944
where, uh, state, and, uh,
local government employees

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.313
cannot have moustaches.

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:17.017
'Has anyone seen this?
Prop 5-5-1?'

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.485
- 'They're uh...'
- That is [bleep]

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:19.753
I find that [bleep].

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.155
- 'Take away our moustaches.'
- That ain't fair.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.390
They will take my moustache

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.559
from my cold,
dead upper lip, my friend.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.661
I ain't coming into work
without a 'stache.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.963
Junior, you was born
with that moustache, wasn't you?

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.932
Hell, yeah.
It's my daddy's moustache.

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:33.333
Or he had a similar one.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.868
'I don't want to work here
without a moustache.'

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.370
'I really don't.'

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.971
I don't want
to work here either.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.908
Well, you have a very light
moustache, so lucky you.

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:43.844
It is time for a bleaching.

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.178
Hi, sheriff's department.

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:46.914
- Oh, I didn't do anything.
- No, no, it's alright.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:49.116
No, no, no, no.
Don't run, don't run.

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.551
Sir, I wonder if we could take
a moment of your time today.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.388
The, uh, the state government
is, uh, trying to pass a bill...

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.858
(Larrie)
'Oh, my God. Oh, no.'

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.192
Oh, no.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.362
No, it's alright. Well, you can,
you can help us out.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:03.931
Oh, alright,
I thought it was a bad thing.

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.499
What the state government
would like us to do

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:07.000
is they,
they're trying to require us

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.736
to perform
our job moustache-less.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:10.771
(Larrie)
'Moustache-less?'

00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:13.840
Yes, without
the aid of moustaches

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.642
and, uh, we're trying
to get 2,000 signatures

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.110
here on this petition.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.613
Why do they don't... Why don't
they like the moustache?

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:20.981
Sir...

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:23.583
All them "bureaucrats",
they got to do something.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.452
- I think I know why.
- Why is that?

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.221
'Cause you look like
gigolos with moustaches.

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.858
You look like
paid male companions.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.697
Well, I can sign... Do you have,
like a "maybe" column?

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:37.764
What's your name, sir?

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.468
- Larrie Plum. P-L-U-M.
- Larrie Plum.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.637
Larrie Plum.

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:45.872
Uh, L-A-R-R-I-E.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:49.076
I-E? Larrie with an I-E?

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:50.944
Yeah, same pronunciation.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.747
Well, we had two Larrys
in the family, so they went...

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:57.150
One "Y" and one I-E
except after "C."

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.485
Initial next to
your signature there.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.722
Sure. Uh, what am I signing now?

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.123
- Thank you.
- We're good. Thank you.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.425
Well, good luck to you
in your chosen field.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.561
Sheriff's department is trying
to take away

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:09.229
our moustaches as deputies

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.931
and we're getting
a petition together

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.500
to see if we can hold
onto 'em for a little while

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.237
so if you wouldn't mind putting
your, uh...John Henry on there

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.473
you'd do us, uh, a big favor.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.208
Wait, what?

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:22.843
We want you
to sign this petition.

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:23.944
We're trying
to keep our moustaches.

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:25.379
They're trying
to take them away.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.415
If you could just, uh, put
your old John Williams on there

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:29.616
that'd really, uh,
give us a good--

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:30.851
I don't get it.
Well, there...

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.352
This doesn't make
any sense, kind of.

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:33.820
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's what we think, too.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.022
- It's ridiculous.
- We think the same thing.

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:36.923
- It's just completely stupid.
- Yeah.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.925
I don't, I don't necessarily...

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.994
I mean, you guys look like
a bunch of a butt darts.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.329
I think it'd be a...

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.464
What, what, what, what?
We look like "butt darts?"

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.199
[siren wailing]

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.934
We need members of the community
to help us out

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.069
by signing this petition.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.103
If you'd sign it tonight

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.671
that'll let us
keep our moustaches

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.106
which will let us
keep you safe

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:55.242
so we'd appreciate
your signatures tonight.

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:59.079
- Okay.
- 'Fantastic.'

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.849
Um...can we, uh

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.818
sign our character names?

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:06.019
- Sure.
- Yeah, go ahead.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.855
What's our opinion on the
department banning mustaches?

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.190
'Check out the action on these.'

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.958
You can't tell whether
I'm smiling or I'm angry

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.393
when I do that, hmm?

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.028
Poker face.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.396
Yeah.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.565
- I think you're gonna--
- Am I going for my gun?

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.935
My lip's not telling you.
Uh-uh.

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:23.737
Where am I going in my kill
window? Hm?

00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:24.871
Gun, base, cuffs?

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.808
Am I gonna hug you,
or am I gonna choke you out?

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:29.176
This ain't sayin'.

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:31.311
And with this, forget it.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.749
'He could bluff me
with a, a two.'

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.684
- Am I mad at you?
- I'm folding right now.

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.953
Am I about to help you
find the Arby's?

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:42.823
You don't know.

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:45.659
[rock song playing on speakers]

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:53.467
I'll say I, uh,
admire your conviction.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.538
Turning in your badge and gun.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:07.581
Keeps them, uh, wild dogs
away from you, huh?
