00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.130
There are two types of
exercises on Udacity.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.420
The first we'll call form exercises.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.020
Form exercises involve some combination
of traditional form elements,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.570
such as short answer boxes and
multiple choice questions.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.780
Here's an example.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.530
This is a simple multiple choice
exercise from knowledge base AI.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.260
Here, I'll select one of
the radio buttons at the bottom.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.970
Then I'll click submit.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.410
I'll see some feedback on the right and
then I can try again.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.330
After I've successfully
completed an exercise,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.850
the dot at the top will change color.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.470
Exercises can get pretty complicated.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.480
For example,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.980
here's one from knowledge based AI that
involves filling out several blanks.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.610
Note that at first, your only options
are to look at the instructions again,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.060
by clicking view instructions,
or to submit an answer.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.770
To move forward, you must attempt
the exercise at least once.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.850
However, after attempting it you
may choose to view the answer

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.150
if you're having trouble
with the exercise.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.370
&gt;&gt; Note that most of our courses don't
assign credit for exercise completion.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.260
They're really just here for
your benefit.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.840
But some of the courses do.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.420
Make sure to read your course's syllabus
carefully to find out if you'll be

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.590
graded on your participation
in these exercises.
