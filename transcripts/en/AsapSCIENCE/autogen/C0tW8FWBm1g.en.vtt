00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.620
 Fentanyl is not a new drug, but it has seen a very large increase over the past three years. 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.240
 It has become a critical crisis in North and South America. 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.680
 Simply, once touched it may cause an overdose. 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.100
 So what exactly does he do to your mind and body? 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.200
 Fentanyl is an opioid that can block pain signals through multiple pathways on the direction of the brain and spinal cord. 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.740
 For this reason he was dismissed as a dwelling of pain at first. 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.580
 Your brain can also produce dopamine in larger amounts, causing a strong sense of activity and relaxation. 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.340
 Essentially, the fentanyl takes away your body building in the endorphine system 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.920
 By tying opioid receptors, in a way very similar to that of your endorphins. 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.540
 But at a much stronger level. 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.400
 This may seem fun, but these active receptors can curb your brain's ability to control the levels of carbon dioxide in your body 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.900
 It is likely to cause the person to stop breathing. 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.580
 Furthermore, it affects the side involved on the rotor 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.080
 Cold, vomiting, fainting, urination and severe constipation. 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.300
 In addition, fentanyl is much stronger than other violets. 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.100
 100 times more powerful than morphine and heroin 50 times. 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.280
 Many drugs need to cross blood barriers in the brain. 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.260
 These barriers allow small soluble fats to cross, and water-loving molecules can be inhibitory. 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.300
 Both morphine and heroin are soluble fats, but they have a pole and water-loving groups 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.680
 This makes them slowly cross the barriers. 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.260
 While fentanyl is neither a polar nor a soluble solubility, it enters the brain in minutes. 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.180
 This means that you only need a very small amount to become under influence and there is a hazard at this stage. 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.080
 A lethal dose of fentanyl, approximately two Almiliqram, two grains of sugar semblance in the test tubes. 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.600
 While it needs a high level of precision to perform effectively, it is very easy to receive an overdose. 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.720
 In fact, there are many reported incidents of my future ODing for the first time due to a simple touch of fentanyl powder. 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.120
 Or inhalation of dust. 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.280
 However, some toxicologists doubt the accuracy of these cases. 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.420
 If you can set the time, an individual can give an injection of Nelskone 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.820
 Which works to stop anesthesia by blocking the receptors of aphids. 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.300
 But scientists could not keep up with the new fentanyl analogues. 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.500
 Such as the most potent carvinthenyl ten million times morphine 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.660
 He noted that it is still likely to be used in chemical warfare. 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.240
 Today, mortality rates in America are high due to overdose of drugs. 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.900
 65,000 deaths in 2016 compared to 59,000 in 2015 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.540
 The use of Avon is the core of the problem. 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.420
 In context, it is higher than rifle deaths, 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.640
 Of HIV / AIDS deaths, as well as deaths from motor vehicle accidents. 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.800
 All evidence indicates a worsening of the problem by the end of 2018. 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.800
 Reason? Research suggests that the prescriptions for opioids spread to pain, causing addiction. 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.365
 Also causes rapid access to millions of tablets by non-specialists to dispense drugs to fall into the wrong hands. 

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:46.020
 As the risk became clearer, doctors reduced the prescription of opiates 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.680
 But that did not change the fact that thousands of people who were addicted could cause them to look into illegal markets. 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.300
 As demand mounted, illicit drug markets headed for cheaper solutions. 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.660
 Unlike the compound of poppy heroin (narcotic plant), it is artificially fentanyl completely and can be manufactured in any place at a cheap price. 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.165
 China has become a very important nation in the manufacture of fentanyl, and the North American Land Stocking Act operates. 

00:03:08.265 --> 00:03:13.600
 After all, the United Kingdom urges British to find critical solutions to crises in order to convince people not to use opiates. 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.440
 The ban on Chinese markets could simply lead to the transfer of production to another country. 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.000
 Many government officials are appealing to the government to protect consumption sites. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.780
 Where people with addiction can be monitored, reducing the risk of overdoses. 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.360
 It can be supported by counseling and anti-addiction drugs, helping people stop using it. 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.660
 But is it possible that some drugs are good for you? 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:43.200
