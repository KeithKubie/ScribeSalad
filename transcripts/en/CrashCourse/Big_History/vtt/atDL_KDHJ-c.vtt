Hi there, I’m Emily Graslie and welcome
to Crash Course Big History.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.729
Today, we’ll be discussing human ancestry
and genealogy – important for understanding

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:10.170
where we come from and how we relate to each
other today.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.950
Looking at the modern science on the topic,
the evidence points toward conclusions that

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.820
unify humanity into a closely knit family,
reminding us of our common identity.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:30.599
INTRO
Our species, Homo sapiens, came into existence

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.820
approximately 200,000 to 250,000 years ago,
foraging for generations in East Africa.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.870
These early humans were a very small population
with fairly limited genetic diversity.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.390
In fact, studies of human mitochondrial DNA,
the small amount of DNA that exists outside

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.129
of the nucleus of a cell, have concluded that
the ancestry of every human alive today goes

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.250
back to a single common ancestor from around
this time.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.110
Over the next 100,000 years we spread across
Africa, down to the southern Cape, and into

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.110
West Africa.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.500
The low population numbers of human foraging
groups and their relatively disconnected communications

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.850
with each other, allowed for the genetics
of African foragers to begin diversifying.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.750
with population growth over the next several
tens of thousands of years, more connections

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.230
were made between foraging groups, and human
genetics became more uniform again all over

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.230
Africa.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.230
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.170
Around 100,000 years ago, humans moved out
of Africa into the Middle East, and maybe

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.860
making it as far as India.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.670
According to genetic studies, the migration
may have been due to a population boom, as

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.160
humans got better and better at hunting and
gathering.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.450
We can already see collective learning at
work.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.310
Then disaster struck.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.690
Around 74,000 years ago, the gene pool contracted
significantly and shrank to only about 3,000

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.180
to 10,000 people in the entire world.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.480
The best explanation we have for this, among
a number of contenders, is the super-eruption

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.250
that happened around that time at Mount Toba
on the island of Sumatra, in present day Indonesia.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.530
It may seem odd that an explosion halfway
around the world afflicted the inhabitants

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.240
of Africa and the Near East.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.460
But Mount Toba exploded with the estimated
force of 1.5 million Hiroshima-sized nuclear

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.460
bombs.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.070
A layer of volcanic ash, an average of 15
cm thick, settled over everything in South

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.240
and East Asia, but also in India, Arabia,
and as far as East Africa.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.640
Much more ash was flung up into the atmosphere,
darkening the skies, and obstructing sunlight,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.440
in the middle of what was already an Ice Age.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.170
A decade of perpetual winter for the entire
globe followed, with long-lasting effects

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.190
for centuries.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.460
The population appeared to recover quickly
after the weather improved.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.560
Over the next 10,000 years there are indications
that humans went through a population boom.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.900
In fact, the growth was so great that it is
one of the primary hypotheses for why 64,000

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.580
years ago humans made another journey outside
of Africa into our largest mass migration

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.580
yet.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.580
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.010
For a while, migrant humans stuck to warmer
climates, spreading across South and East

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.010
Asia.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.390
In a very short space of time, maybe a few
centuries and at most a few thousand years,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.460
humans had colonised everywhere from Pakistan
to Korea, avoiding the chillier continental

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.770
climates further from the coasts.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.480
Approximately 60,000 years ago, humans spread
down the land bridge that existed between

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.770
Indonesia and the Asian mainland.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.220
Through the use of these bridges and perhaps
even seafaring rafts, humans did what no hominine

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.620
group had ever done before: they landed in
Australia.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.110
Eventually humans managed to adapt to colder
climates, spreading into Central Asia and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.390
Europe approximately 40,000 years ago.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.610
A few thousand years later, we were even living
in Ice Age Siberia.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.440
but, we weren’t the first hominine group
to have done all this.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.240
In fact, there’s concrete evidence that
humans ran into the now extinct Neanderthals

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.990
and even interbred with them.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.360
Anyone outside of Africa of Eurasian descent,
about 1.5 to 2% of their DNA is of Neanderthal

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.360
origin.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.750
Another thing that no previous hominine had
done was migrate into the Americas.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.920
The dominant theory is that humans simply
walked from Asia to the Americas along the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.870
Bering Strait, though recent discoveries have
thrown the exact dates into question.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.240
but, genetic tests show that humans emigrated
out of Siberia, perhaps hunting animals, and

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.640
moved into the land-bridge between Russia
and Alaska as early as 30,000 years ago.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.120
At this point we would have been prevented
from traveling past the glaciers that blocked

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.390
us from entering the rest of the Americas.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.130
But either by the thaw of those glaciers or
a coastal route, or both, humans spread into

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.430
the Americas around 13 to 16,000 years ago,
rapidly heading south.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.990
But let’s jump backwards a bit.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.840
In evolutionary terms, 74,000 years ago is
not long ago at all.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.239
And a few thousand people is a tiny gene pool
of relatives.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.120
Humans are very closely related for a mammalian
species.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.470
When humans left Africa 64,000 years ago,
they left in small foraging bands of a few

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.470
dozen at a time.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.150
It was a decidedly smaller population that
eventually ballooned from all the new resources

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.650
the rest of the world had to offer.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.400
What differences there are between ethnic
groups are pretty small.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.970
Certain diseases are more common in some groups
than others, but you see the same pattern

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.320
occur within individual family histories.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.639
Largely superficial and cosmetic traits differ
from region to region.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.180
One of the most prominent traits by which
we have historically distinguished human from

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.400
human is skin color, which is caused by the
melanin levels in our skin.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.990
Melanin is useful because it dissipates UV
radiation and helps prevent the occurrence

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.740
of skin cancer -- particularly useful in areas
with lots of sunshine.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.699
100,000 years ago, every human on the face
of the Earth was African.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.340
Melanin levels were roughly the same.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.530
And it was only when we spread out into other
regions of the world 64,000 years ago, into

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.550
different climates, with differing degrees
of UV radiation, did that slowly begin to

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.550
change.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.020
According to genome research, the humans who
arrived in India, East Asia, and Europe between

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.340
60,000 and 40,000 years ago had dark skin
tones.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.780
And until very recently they retained that
appearance.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.460
Specific genes that lead to depigmentation
only became active when humans entered regions

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.190
where they weren’t getting enough sun and
thus not as much vitamin D. But even this

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.110
change took thousands upon thousands of years.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.230
Researchers have determined, for instance,
that until 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, there

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.670
were no white people.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.490
These ethnic distinctions are blurred even
further by the extreme mobility of different

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.480
peoples across the ages and especially since
500 years ago, when all the world zones began

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.130
uniting into a single global system.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.610
A great many people have mixed ancestries
as a result.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.090
In fact, if you got your genome tested, there
are reasonable odds that your ancestry is

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.270
pretty diverse too .
It’s worth asking why we’ve had a long

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.610
tortured history, involving war, murder, slavery,
and genocide over our differences.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.310
Plenty of primates, from New and Old World
Monkeys to great apes like Gorillas and Chimpanzees,

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.680
show hostility toward their own species in
inter-group encounters, arising out of competition

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.370
for food and mates.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.110
For instance, chimpanzees, are known to range
around their territories to find strangers

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.580
to ambush, mutilate, and sometimes kill.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.840
Hostility, fear, wariness, and caution, are
visceral traits that go back millions of years

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.260
in our evolutionary history.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.750
Humans, who aren’t much better except when
we apply logic and reason, distinguished between

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.820
groups by tribal markers.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.760
Humans are good at understanding symbolism,
and here we put it to poor use.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.540
Different body paints, dialects, and fashions
in groups that were otherwise ethnically indistinguishable

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.300
led to great rivalries and generations of
conflict.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.500
Once humans started diversifying in appearance,
as languages grew more distinct, as religions

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.340
became more distant, and as battles for resources
continued, these tribal markers also intensified.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.490
From a gut instinct to be wary of strangers,
came the learned behaviour of judging a person

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.010
by their outward traits.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.910
Then came Charles Darwin and the theory of
evolution, a great leap forward.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.370
Soon after came the abuse of evolution, which
was a great leap backwards.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.930
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, all
the old prejudices found a new explanation,

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.330
displayed with a thin veneer of scientific
credibility.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.940
Darwin’s On the Origin of Species (1859)
made almost no mention of humans.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.940
Deliberately.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.570
While evolution had the makings for hard science
when applied to different species, when applied

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.900
hastily to Homo sapiens, it had all the makings
of pseudo-science.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.020
On the one hand, until the 1950s and the discovery
of DNA and the synthesis of various parts

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.470
of Darwinian theory, humans had a very poor
understanding of genetics and how closely

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.160
related humans really were.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.510
A lot the discoveries about our close ancestry
were only uncovered in the second half of

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.199
the 20th century by more archaeological findings
and the sequencing of the human genome.

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:58.730
On the other hand, Natural selection, which
proved revolutionary to biology, was sometimes

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.410
inappropriately applied to human groups.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.460
Differences in behaviour that we ascribe to
cultural learning today were given a biological

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.460
explanation.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.340
For instance, even Darwin in the Descent of
Man (1871) hypothesized that more emotional

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.530
cultures and more reserved cultures were the
result of inherited traits, rather than just

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.270
how people are raised to behave in those societies.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.180
Some of this was more sinister.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:24.240
Karl Vogt, a German pseudo-scientist, set
out in the 1860s to prove that Africans were

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.070
a different species from Europeans.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:31.289
Ernst Haeckel in the 1880s put forth a theory
that humans evolved in Asia, not Africa, and

00:08:31.289 --> 00:08:35.469
that different major ethnic groups had actually
separate primate ancestry, meaning we were

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:40.409
divided not by a few thousand years but by
millions and millions of years of evolution.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.699
He then talked about superior and inferior
groups.

00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:47.820
With European imperialism on the rise, pseudo-scientists
grasped toward unsupported theories, cranial

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.910
measurements, and a whole range of justifications
for their biases.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:56.389
In the 1890s, as competition between Western
empires heated up, figures like Georges Vacher

00:08:56.389 --> 00:09:00.999
de Lapouge and William Ripley, subdivided
Europeans into different superior and inferior

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:07.139
groups as well, this contributed to the intensification
of scientific racism in 20th century Europe,

00:09:07.139 --> 00:09:08.949
and fed the rise of fascism.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:12.610
This kind of thinking spread all over the
world in the 20th century and some element

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:17.860
of scientific racism can be found in the Sino-Japanese
wars, and conflicts in Rwanda, Sudan, and

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.290
others on a tragically long list.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.199
Ignoring our common ancestry continues to
have modern consequences.

00:09:24.199 --> 00:09:28.420
We humans have been warring for millennia
and it pays to remember the story of our origins

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:33.579
and how closely related we actually are, especially
as we move forward as a global society into

00:09:33.579 --> 00:09:34.860
the trials and tribulations of the 21st century.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.699
Just like the Big Bang reminds us of a single
point of origin for all matter and energy

00:09:38.699 --> 00:09:42.250
in the Universe, linking us together, the
story of humanity reminds us of our common

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.250
identity.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.850
What diversity there is, is cultural.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.480
Which I think is something to celebrate.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.720
We should specially celebrate the diversity
that is most crucial to human genius and collective

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.029
learning -- the diversity of thought.

00:09:54.029 --> 00:10:15.670
See you next time.
