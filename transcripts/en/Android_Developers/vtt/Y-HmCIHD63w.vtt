00:00:07.447 --> 00:00:08.780
HUNG-YING TYAN: Hello, everyone.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.390
My name is Hung-ying.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.505
I'm here to talk about GSI,
the generic system images.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.720
GSI is by definition, the
purest form of Android framework

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.750
that we can build from AOSP.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.100
By purest, we mean that it
doesn't contain any device

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.160
maker or carrier customization.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.270
You will want to ask--

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.910
AOSP has been there
for 10 years--

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.030
why does it become
a thing right now?

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.600
It is because GSI is the central
piece in Treble compliance.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.170
So remember the project, Treble?

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.380
We took on the Android
updatability problem

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.580
with Treble.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.270
About two years ago
in the Oreo timeframe.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.260
We re-architected Android
to have a clear boundary

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.210
between the Android framework
and the hardware related vendor

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.070
implementation.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.240
With this boundary
clearly defined,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.650
we no longer need to update
the vendor implementation

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.220
with the Android framework.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.480
So this has greatly reduced the
cause and time for device maker

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.310
to update their
Android framework.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.420
Now, to make sure that
the boundary is not

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.060
altered by device
makers at will,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.600
we require every
Treble certified device

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.290
to pass a set of
CTS and VTS tests

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.260
with their Android
framework replaced by GSI.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.820
So with all these powerful tools
in place, about a year ago,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.790
we started to see the
momentum of faster Android Pie

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.595
adoption this year.

00:02:14.595 --> 00:02:19.140
So let's take a look at
the Android beta program

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.930
at Google I/O last year.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.260
Only Nexus and Pixel phones
were available for you

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.792
to try out Android Oreo.

00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:33.360
And fast forward one
year later at Google I/O

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.240
this year, it was
the first time ever

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.774
that we had non-Google phones
to join the beta lineup.

00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:48.990
And it's not one,
it's not two, it's

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.870
7 device makers joining us.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.540
So the progress was phenomenal.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.570
We know we are on
the right track.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.910
And we will continue
to push for it.

00:03:03.526 --> 00:03:08.530
Now despite that GSI is
the central piece in Treble

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.710
compliance, we feel that it has
a lot more potential than that.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.610
So we set out a goal to make GSI
be more accessible and useful,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.050
not just for device makers, but
also for the general public,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.400
including app developers
like you and even consumers.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.860
An important first
step toward that goal

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.150
is to make GSI
available in AOSP.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.970
So for this, we have
published Pie GSI in AOSP.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.140
So now you can download
and build Pie GSI today.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.930
We are also exploring
ways to make

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.430
future GSI available
earlier than the release

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.100
of next Android version.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.350
So you will be able to try out
next century version earlier

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.965
over GSI.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.920
And at the same
time, we can also

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.990
get early feedback from you.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.702
So the benefit is mutual.

00:04:20.702 --> 00:04:25.750
So please stay tuned for our
further announcements on this.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.780
Finally, we understand
that trying out GSI

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.710
can be cumbersome sometimes.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.940
We are looking into different
ways to improve the process.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.820
Right now we have an idea of
trying out GSI without actually

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.315
flashing GSI onto the device.

00:04:46.315 --> 00:04:49.350
But I'm not going
into detail here.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.690
We do have a working early
prototype at our demo booth.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.800
In addition to that, we also
prepare a set of devices.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.240
They are all running
on the same Pie GSI.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.830
So please do check out our
demos at the Android platform

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.430
sandbox.
