00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:09.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
and welcome to I/O Live.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.640
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'm here with Iliyan,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.280
who is a principal
engineer on Android

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.370
and he leads Project Treble.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.190
Hi, Iliyan.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.700
ILIYAN MALCHEV: Hello, Timothy.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.000
How are you?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.720
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm super.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.440
How are you?

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.760
ILIYAN MALCHEV:
Excellent, thank you.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.440
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So that
keynote was amazing

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.189
and there was a lot
of your work up there.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.410
In fact, Project Treble.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.670
I want to talk about that.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.740
But before, could you
describe the problem?

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.593
What are you solving
with Project Treble?

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:32.009
ILIYAN MALCHEV:
What we're solving

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.830
is what we call Android's
version fragmentation problem.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.740
Which is best explained--
if you're an app developer,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.370
you have to deal with all
of these Android versions

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.900
that you have to
implement against.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.899
And this is a massive
pain to deal with.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.940
So this is the problem
that we started addressing

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.992
at with Project Treble.

00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:51.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And how you
solve that with Project Treble,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.910
is you make it easier for
manufacturers to upgrade

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.119
to the latest version, right?

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:56.368
ILIYAN MALCHEV: Correct, yeah.

00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:58.170
I mean, for developers
to have the latest,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.990
device manufacturers have
to launch their devices

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.080
on the latest or upgrade
existing ones to the latest.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.470
But historically it's
been very difficult, which

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.920
means expensive, to do that.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.170
Which is why device
manufacturers simply

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.550
didn't do it.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.145
This is why we have Android
version fragmentation today.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.770
The way that we solve
it is effectively

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.800
by lowering their costs.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.370
That's what Project Treble is.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.203
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All
right, so Project Treble

00:01:25.203 --> 00:01:26.340
was introduced last year.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.360
What's new this year?

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.860
ILIYAN MALCHEV:
What's new this year

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.380
is that we effectively
completed the engineering

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.420
portion of our work
and we embarked

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.290
on an operational side of it.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.290
Which the goal of it is to
accelerate the deliverables,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.080
the intermediate deliverables
of Android, to the OEMs,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.750
to the device manufacturers,
so that they can do their work

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.640
to launch these devices and
upgrade these devices much,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.260
much earlier than previously.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.900
So the end result is that we
expect companies like Samsung,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.700
for example, to do their
work in the same year

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.529
when we launch Android.

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:59.820
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.330
Now, what OEMs are launching?

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.500
ILIYAN MALCHEV: We
have seven companies,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.860
in addition to Google's
very own Pixel of course,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.000
who are launching
previews-- betas--

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.720
this year.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.660
And these are Oppo, Vivo,
Nokia, Sony, Essential,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.660
OnePlus, and Xiaomi.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.660
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.080
ILIYAN MALCHEV: That's
a lot of companies.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.790
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
you and I actually

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.840
have our pockets full
of some of these phones.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.280
ILIYAN MALCHEV: Yes, we do.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.220
We do.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.803
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Which
I think it would

00:02:25.803 --> 00:02:29.130
be neat to show there's the
same version of Android running

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.610
on each of these
different phones.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.984
ILIYAN MALCHEV: Yeah, that's
what's beautiful about this,

00:02:32.984 --> 00:02:36.600
is that these are devices by
completely different companies,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.420
which all run the same
version of Android.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.890
That was never
happening until now.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.660
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
totally awesome.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.910
ILIYAN MALCHEV: And there's
one more thing, of course.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.680
In addition to these previews,
we have a total of 18 devices

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.500
by 11 manufacturers
who will either launch

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.690
or upgrade their existing
devices to the latest

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.080
of Android this year.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.616
ILIYAN MALCHEV: It is.

00:02:57.616 --> 00:02:59.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So for
developers, this, again,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.040
really matters,
because it simplifies

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.840
their overall developer
experience, which

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.695
they can get started on by
downloading the preview.

00:03:06.695 --> 00:03:08.236
ILIYAN MALCHEV:
That's exactly right.

00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:09.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Iliyan, thank you

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.024
so much for joining us
to explain all of that.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.690
ILIYAN MALCHEV: Thank
you for having me.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.481
TIMOTHY JORDAN: To
learn more, head on over

00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:15.980

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.220
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is I/O Live.
