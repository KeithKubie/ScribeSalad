&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Alright, good afternoon Google
Chicago!

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:07.720
For those of you who don't know me, my name
is David Lieber. I am with the State and Local

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.350
Public Policy Team. For those of you that
may have seen me before I'm like, I guess

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.250
I'm like the new best friend that you never
wanted. [chuckles]

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.279
Today's event is a continuation of our Fireside
chat series which was inaugurated during the

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:29.150
2008 campaign season and continued in 2010.
The Chicago Mayoral Fireside Chat Series really

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.530
represents the first time that we've brought
the event outside of Mountain View and to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.230
one of our other offices and I think we can
probably all agree that there's no better

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.980
place to do that in Chicago.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.380
Our guest today is Mayoral Candidate Miguel
del Valle who came to Chicago at the age of

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.390
four and has lived here ever since. At a young
age, Mr. del Valle was tapped to run both

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.370
the Barreto Boys and Girls Club and the Association
House here in Chicago.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.110
His political career began in 1982 when he
worked on the historic campaign of Mayor Harold

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.659
Washington. In 2006, he became the first Latino
elected to the Illinois State Senate where

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.719
he served for almost 20 years, rising to become
the Assistant Majority Leader.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:18.189
In 2006, Mr. del Valle was appointed to be
City Clerk by Mayor Daley and in the next

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.329
year, 2007, he won a citywide election for
the same office. During his tenure, transparencies

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:30.249
have been a hallmark in the City Clerk's Office.
City Hall meetings are now streamed and archived

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:35.590
and ordinances and city budgets have been
made available through the City Clerk's Website.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.219
So please everyone let's give a warm welcome
to our guest today, Miguel del Valle.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.719
[applause]

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.219
[unintelligible]

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.719
[pause]

00:01:48.719 --> 00:02:01.340
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Thanks. So we're now a week
out from election and everyone is still trying

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.101
to obviously make their final decisions about
who they are going to support. And one of

00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:10.789
the challenges I'm sure everyone has, particularly
those who are undecided, is how to distinguish

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.290
one candidate from another.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.769
So the question for you is what distinguishes
you from other candidates and why are you

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.190
the right choice for mayor?

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.939
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Well it is a challenge
for people to distinguish because we still

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:35.189
have a system that because of funding puts
some candidates at a disadvantage. And that's

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:43.430
why I continue to advocate for campaign finance
reform because we can't have a strong democracy

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:51.450
if only millionaires and people with access
to large campaign contributions are the only

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.959
ones who can run for office.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.349
That is not good for our democracy and so
we need to continue to look at how it is that

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:06.749
we level the playing field so that choices
could be made based on an individual's skills,

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:13.720
abilities, experience, track record, and not
based on who can afford to put more 30 second

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.860
spots on television that many times say very
little about who the candidate really is.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.860
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:29.780
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: So having said that, I
am, as you indicated in the introduction,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.260
an individual who's lived in the City of Chicago
since I was four years old. I have had both

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:44.690
feet firmly planted in the neighborhoods of
the City of Chicago, I have worked in various

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:53.060
capacities doing community organizing and
as a community activist delivering human services,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.120
and then entered the political arena when
Harold Washington was elected mayor.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.340
I chaired one of his commissions as a volunteer
and then was motivated and inspired by his

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.950
historic election in the City of Chicago,
and then decided to leave a position as executive

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.769
director of a human services agency, Association
House, an institution established by Jane

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.889
Adams in the late 1800's in the City of Chicago,
as one of many settlement houses that were

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.979
established at the time to help different
immigrant groups settle in the City of Chicago.

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:36.650
So I left that position as executive director
and decided to run for office for the first

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:45.229
time without any prior political experience
and no political organization and no funding

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:52.360
and we were able to win an election where
I challenged an eight year incumbent in the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.210
state senate who was at that time the Chairman
of the Senate Transportation Committee and

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.680
an individual very much connected with the
local political machine.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.840
So I served in the Illinois Senate for 20
years. During the 20 years in the Illinois

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.449
Senate, I was a member of the Senate Appropriations
Committee and dealt with budgets four, five,

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.960
six times the size of the city budget, both
on the operating side as well as on the capital

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.979
side. So I have plenty of experience dealing
with fiscal matters, and then of course sponsored

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.220
lots of major pieces of legislation during
that period.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.840
And then went on to become City Clerk where
then I've been an administrator more than

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.780
anything else even though the City Clerk's
office is one of three citywide elected positions

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.979
in the City of Chicago -- you have Mayor,
City Clerk, and City Treasurer. It is more

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.650
of an administrative function -- we're basically
the keepers of the record, of the legislative

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.590
branch of city government and we're the point
of access for the public to that record.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.580
And one of the things I did when I came in
[chuckles] was develop and establish an electronic

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.260
document management system. Would you believe
that in the City of Chicago, a world class

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.800
city, things were done by paper,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.159
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [chuckles]

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:17.080
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: journals etcetera produced
by paper. And so we've modernized the office,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:24.220
we've used technology to bring the council
closer to the people putting the city council

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.770
meetings online, doing live webcasts of those
city council meetings, and we've done those

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.770
types of things.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:38.110
So back to your question of what makes me
different: my experience, my knowledge of

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.620
neighborhoods in the City of Chicago, my long
track record of advocacy. I see things through

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.580
a different pair of eyes. I'm not the guy
who made $18 million in two years, but I'm

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.060
the guy who's been in the neighborhood fighting
battles year after year after year.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.810
And now I've decided that I want to use the
authority of the Mayor's Office to tackle

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.470
the very same issues that I've dealt with
over the years: education, the quality of

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:11.919
public education in the neighborhoods; public
safety; access to affordable housing. Those

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:18.370
are some of the issues that I want to tackle
and I think that while I have a lot of experience,

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.639
I also have the heart for the neighborhoods
of the City of Chicago.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:29.720
And I'd like to say that we've set a tone
in this campaign. From the very beginning

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:37.970
I said, "This race needs to be about the issues
in the neighborhoods. It needs to be about

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:43.060
the need for balanced growth and balanced
development in the City of Chicago. It needs

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:48.370
to be about engaging communities. It needs
to be about organizing communities" because

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:56.539
I'm a big believer in lifting communities
by empowering them to organize themselves.

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:02.700
I think the city can play a role in that so
everything we do whether it's the police department

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:10.040
and how it operates in the communities and
taking a CAPS program -- which is the Community

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.250
Alternative Policing Program -- and converting
that into a program that really operates as

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:21.590
intended which is to develop a relationship,
a working relationship, with individuals and

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.479
community organizations and churches and other
civic institutions, small businesses within

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:31.319
the community to take on issues of public
safety.

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:37.410
Those are the kinds changes that I want to
see and so I think because of my extensive

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:42.350
experience in working with neighborhoods I'm
in a better position to do that so that we

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.630
can really earn the title of "World Class
City".

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.000
Some people gave us that title a long time
ago --

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.950
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: but that title was based
more on what you see downtown. And what I'm

00:08:53.950 --> 00:09:01.350
saying is that for us to really, really earn
that title we need world class neighborhoods

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.350
and that's my goal.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:06.670
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: So I wanted to build on that
because you talked about sort of being a candidate

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.670
that's been involved with community activism
in the neighborhoods. Your campaign slogan

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:17.340
is, "A major for all Chicago, for every neighborhood."
Does that suggest that in a del Valle administration

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.390
that aldermen would have more authority than
they do now in terms of economic development

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.190
in matters concerning the ward or less?

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:29.130
&gt;&gt;Migue del Valle: They should have more authority
on just about everything. What I wanna see

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:38.290
aldermen is move away from dealing with routine
matters though the legislative process. And

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.500
by the way, we're going to get there and let
me explain.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:48.880
Right now, in the City of Chicago, if you
own a small business you're starting a small

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.210
storefront operation, a bakery. I talked to
a couple the other day who have started a

00:09:54.210 --> 00:10:01.160
bakery in Beverley and you want your sign.
[chuckles] You wanna put up a sign. You wanna

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.270
put up an awning with your name on it. It'll
take you two months.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:11.190
And in order to do that you have to go to
your alderman and your alderman has to file

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:17.750
an ordinance and that ordinance has to be
approved, and so it takes about two months

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:24.560
because the city council meets once a month.
That's an archaic process.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:32.120
Number one it shouldn't have to go through
the legislative system and so why not do it

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.290
administratively. You could still have the
aldermen sign off because the aldermen want

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:40.640
to control what happens in their ward and
certainly on zoning matters and other kinds

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.450
of matters -- that's what they elected for.
They're responsible for how the street looks

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.950
and what goes where.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:57.410
So they need a role, but you can do that administratively
and then you can take that out of the legislative

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:03.750
process and use the legislative process to
deal with substance; to deal with legislation

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:09.080
rather than ordinances to put a stop sign
here or to put residential parking zones here

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:15.040
or there. All these things end up going through
the council and it shouldn't be like that.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:23.420
Now we should have the council become a deliberative
body. If it was truly a deliberative body,

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:30.870
as it should be, then I don't think we would
have had the fiasco that we had with the meter

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:38.100
lease in the City of Chicago. That was put
together by the Mayor's Office. It was a plan.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:43.600
It was negotiated behind closed doors, put
together and then presented to the City Council

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:51.910
for a vote within a two day period; a 75 year
lease where the city has given away its authority

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:57.360
to do a whole bunch of things including the
authority to determine how many meters we're

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.020
going to have in the City of Chicago.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:04.730
If I wanna establish more bike lanes, for
example, or bus lanes because I wanna reduce

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:11.210
the flow of traffic downtown because I want
us to become a greener city and we're concerned

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:15.790
about air quality and a whole bunch of other
things, and I want to encourage the use of

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:24.390
public transit. If I want to do all that,
then we cannot do the, make the changes that

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:31.820
are necessary without compensating Morgan
Stanley, the company that has this long term

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.820
lease.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.820
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-um.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:42.410
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: If we want to, for example,
ease up on our harsh treatment of motorists

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:49.430
in the City of Chicago who, after getting
two tickets, parking tickets, within a year,

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:55.910
are booted if they don't pay those tickets
on time. And there are people who lose their

00:12:55.910 --> 00:13:01.970
jobs and let's face it they aren't sometimes
able to pay within that period.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:07.410
Well if I want to go back to where we used
to be, where we used to boot cars after four

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:15.230
or five tickets, then that triggers what they
call a compensation event in the contract,

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:24.580
which means that somehow, if we're easing
on enforcement, then that has an impact on

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:32.260
their revenue and therefore we have to find
a way and calculate what they need to be compensated

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:37.720
for. This is the type of agreement that was
entered into. Aldermen, many aldermen, did

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.590
not read that full agreement because they
didn't have the time.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:47.810
And so if we have a more deliberative body
that takes time to conduct public hearings

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:53.330
and to give an opportunity for proponents
and opponents to chime in, which is what is

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:58.430
supposed to happen, then you're gonna get
a different kind of result. That is not to

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:05.190
say that we still wouldn't have leased the
meters because in this climate, in this economy

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.190
 --

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.190
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [clears throat]

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.740
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: there's been tremendous
pressures on cities to come up with ways to

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.790
generate revenues and privatization has been,
of course, one of those ways.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:22.790
So the pressure's still there. But how we
make decisions I think is definitely going

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:29.221
to change and has to change because, as I've
said, as mayor I'm going to liberate the aldermen

00:14:29.221 --> 00:14:33.320
in the City of Chicago. And I'm going to allow
them to do their work because that's what

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.430
they get elected to do. They're there to represent
their constituents in their wards and they're

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:44.400
gonna have to make book in Chicago the history
has been strong mayor, weak council. I wanna

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:51.610
strong mayor, strong council, and I actually
want them to have to cast votes and assume

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:57.990
responsibility for some of the tough decisions
that are ahead of us regarding budget cuts

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.530
and as well as revenue decisions. Where's
the money going to come from?

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.530
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.360
So you mentioned privatization and that's
obviously been a controversial subject whether

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:12.420
it be with the parking meter fiasco or now
with the festivals and the talk of privatizing

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:17.980
those and even the Taste of Chicago. Do you
think there is a role for privatization in

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.230
the context of good governance?

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:26.370
&gt;&gt;Migue del Valle: Well of course there is.
But before you take the step, lots of questions

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:31.600
have to be answered. Are we talking about
efficiencies? Are we talking about reduced

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:40.880
costs? Are we talking about taking a function
delivered or a service delivered by a group

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.570
of individuals who are city employees --

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:44.570
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.620
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: and then privatizing the
delivery of those services and then having

00:15:48.620 --> 00:16:00.600
a company that is going to pay substandard
wages and then help expand the number of individuals

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.860
out there who are the working poor in the
City of Chicago?

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.860
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:10.110
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Those things have to be
weighed, but there are some areas, for example,

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:15.740
I'll throw one out: recycling. Right now we
have 16 wards in the City of Chicago that

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:23.910
recycle. It's been very, very difficult for
the recycling services to be expanded yet

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:27.920
we need to go. If we're gonna be a greener
city, we're going to have to go to citywide

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:33.500
recycling. I wanna go to citywide recycling.
There's a possibility there of a private-public

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.300
partnership to do that.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:44.350
Now we're gonna make sure if there's an agreement
there, that over the years we're able to capture

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:54.310
the growing value of the recyclable materials.
So all of that needs to be figured out and

00:16:54.310 --> 00:17:00.450
we need to make sure that we don't enter into
an agreement that short changes the residents

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.450
of the City of Chicago.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:07.120
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: So we have a tool here called
Google Moderator and in advance of this series,

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:14.059
we solicited questions from Chicago employees,
things that they wanted to hear and the number

00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:20.510
one topic that was brought up and voted upon
and voted up was education. And so I'm hoping

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:26.059
you can talk to us a little bit more about
what your plans are for education and, specifically,

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:31.779
how do you plan on insuring that every student
in Chicago receives the same opportunity regardless

00:17:31.779 --> 00:17:33.620
of what school district they live in?

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:39.050
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Well it's a very good
question. As you know, Chicago is the largest

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:46.520
school district in the state. Illinois has
about 869 school districts. We have more school

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:53.529
[chuckles] districts than just about any other
state. Chicago is the largest with over 400,000

00:17:53.529 --> 00:17:55.649
students.

00:17:55.649 --> 00:18:02.050
There are inequities within the overall public
education system in the State of Illinois.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:08.960
We have a little over two million students
in public schools in the state in those 869

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:17.330
school districts. And of course we have a
financing structure that relies heavily on

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:25.379
local property taxes, too heavily. And we've
argued for a long time that we need to reform

00:18:25.379 --> 00:18:30.700
how we finance public education in the State
of Illinois and shift away from the reliance

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:36.120
on local property taxes and more on the state
income tax.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:43.370
Well, years ago I advocated for that and when
I was advocating for that shifting, I said,

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:48.720
"We ought to do it now because the day's going
to come, given the state's track record, when

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:54.769
we're going to end up seeing an increase in
the income tax and it's not gonna go for education

00:18:54.769 --> 00:18:58.919
and we're not gonna be able to do that shift
because the money's going to be needed to

00:18:58.919 --> 00:19:00.259
deal with the state debt."

00:19:00.259 --> 00:19:07.289
Well, guess what's happened? That's what happened
this year. There was an increase in the state

00:19:07.289 --> 00:19:16.419
income tax of two percent for four years and
then it'll drop back down to 3.75 percent.

00:19:16.419 --> 00:19:23.330
We have a set rate in Illinois as you know.
But we haven't financed or reformed how we

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:30.091
finance public education. In the meantime
we have to take care of business here in District

00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:32.789
299 which is the Chicago Public Schools.

00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:39.610
And during my campaign, I've talked about
how in Chicago, with good intentions, we've

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:46.940
developed a two track parallel system of public
education with magnet schools, selective enrollment,

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:53.350
and charter schools on one track and the neighborhoods
on another track. And while I continue to

00:19:53.350 --> 00:20:00.389
support academic options for kids and for
families, we have to focus in on our neighborhood

00:20:00.389 --> 00:20:06.259
schools because that is where [chuckles] we
have some serious, serious problems.

00:20:06.259 --> 00:20:07.259
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:11.590
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: I want a family, a young
family with a child who reaches preschool

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:19.500
age, who is ready to send their child to school
to not have to grapple with, "Do I [chuckles]

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:25.070
put my child in the school across the street
or down the block from where I live in or

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:32.720
do I find a school across town, a private
school or another public school that's selective,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.510
with selective enrollment?" Today's there
an article in the Tribune today about the

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:43.560
gifted and classical programs and the number
of families that do all kinds of things [chuckles]

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.150
to prepare their little ones to take that
test because people are worried.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:53.789
That's one of the biggest decisions that you
make as a family. Where are you going to send

00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:59.840
your child to school? It's an important decision.
And so I want neighborhood schools to become

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.520
an option for families. Right now people are
looking all over.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:11.749
Do you know that for high school, for high
school slots, last year there were about 13,000

00:21:11.749 --> 00:21:18.340
applications for 3,000 slots? So that means
the 10,000 who didn't get in to a selective

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:24.059
enrollment high school in Chicago ended up
in the regular school or going to a private

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:28.590
school. And so that is the challenge.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:33.889
Now some have said, "Well the only way you're
gonna get away from that and the only way

00:21:33.889 --> 00:21:40.220
you're gonna really deal with this is by continuing
to create charter schools." We're not going

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:47.259
to charter school our way out of this. We
have to tackle the needs and the issues at

00:21:47.259 --> 00:21:52.499
our neighborhood schools. And that's how you
build communities. We cannot build and stabilize

00:21:52.499 --> 00:21:57.620
neighborhoods if all the kids [chuckles] in
the families are constantly leaving the neighborhood

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.509
and running away from the neighborhood. How
do you stabilize communities?

00:22:01.509 --> 00:22:07.020
I see neighborhood schools as anchors for
the development, for stimulating all kinds

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:11.700
of activities. That's why I wanna see a community
learning center at every neighborhood underperforming

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:18.690
school. And by that I mean a center where
families can participate in educational and

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:24.379
cultural and recreational activities from
two in the afternoon 'til eight thirty, nine

00:22:24.379 --> 00:22:27.139
o'clock in the evening and on Saturdays.

00:22:27.139 --> 00:22:31.370
And we're doing this already. This is not
something that I'm just coming up with right

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:36.970
now. I did this as a legislator. I have schools
in my old legislative district where parents

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:43.509
are taking English as a second language classes,
GED classes, college credit courses, the kids

00:22:43.509 --> 00:22:48.450
are there at the same time getting homework
and tutoring assistance, engaged in enrichment

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.200
activities which are important in these neighborhood
schools. Because in every neighborhood school

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:59.370
you find bright children who aren't being
challenged and they get bored and they, they

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.740
get bored -- one of the reasons for the dropout
rate. I've worked with kids who dropped out

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.879
of high school, dropped out of regular high
schools, and end up in alternative schools

00:23:08.879 --> 00:23:14.850
and excelling and doing very, very well because
they were bright kids who were just not being

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.690
challenged and were just not in the right
setting.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:23.740
And so besides the community learning centers
that we want to do that include the cultural

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:32.139
enrichment activities, then we want to establish
a program to reenroll dropouts. Fifty percent

00:23:32.139 --> 00:23:40.200
of African-American high school students in
the City of Chicago drop out of school. About

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:46.429
43 to 45 percent of Latinos drop out of school.
We are not gonna stabilize communities, we're

00:23:46.429 --> 00:23:51.059
not gonna build neighborhoods if we don't
pull them back in. And some of them drop out

00:23:51.059 --> 00:23:55.340
because of concerns for public safety, gang
activity, other kinds of activities; they're

00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:00.320
bored, they're not being challenged. There
are all kinds of reasons. They begin to miss

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.649
school, they fall behind, they fail courses
in the first year, and then they're out.

00:24:05.649 --> 00:24:11.940
I increased the compulsory attendance age
in the State of Illinois from 16 to 17 because

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:17.240
I want schools to hang on to these kids longer.
And by the way, the compulsory attendance

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.980
age had not changed in the State of Illinois
since the early 1900s.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.980
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Hum.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.860
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: That's how long it had
been. When the compulsory attendance age was

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.389
last changed, the Cubs had won the World Series.

00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:30.389
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:31.389
[laughter]

00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:34.350
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Just to put it into proper
context here.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:42.740
And so those kinds of changes are taking place.
Also dual credit, dual college enrollment,

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:48.179
working with our community colleges is something
that I wanna see more of. So kids could take

00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:52.460
college level courses while in their junior
year and senior year in high school and then

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.809
that would facilitate the transition to our
community colleges or to four year colleges.

00:24:57.809 --> 00:24:59.850
We don't do enough of that.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:05.279
We have to change a lot of things. We have
to allow for school later on in the day. We

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:09.249
have to be more flexible with the scheduling
 -- a long list of things that need to be

00:25:09.249 --> 00:25:15.179
done. But it is my top priority. It's the
reason, I should say it's the main reason

00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:20.990
why I decided to run for mayor and that is
to deal with the quality of public education

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.070
in our neighborhoods.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:28.539
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Hum. So Google has been on
somewhat of a hiring spree lately and we have

00:25:28.539 --> 00:25:34.429
approximately 400 employees in this Chicago
office. There have been some concerns raised

00:25:34.429 --> 00:25:42.059
with the legislature's increase in the personal
income taxes and corporate income taxes that

00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:47.999
it's going to be difficult to attract and
retain talent and attract and retain the next

00:25:47.999 --> 00:25:53.200
technology start up or technology company
whether that be Groupon or Google.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:59.159
How do you plan to ensure that Chicago continues
to remain competitive as a global business

00:25:59.159 --> 00:26:05.710
hub and is able to attract and retain the
best sort of talent here to build the city

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.571
and to build the work force around the city?

00:26:07.571 --> 00:26:11.779
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: First of all, I think
we will continue to be very competitive. We

00:26:11.779 --> 00:26:18.410
have some of the best universities in the
country right here -- University of Chicago,

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:25.240
Northwestern. We have a great public university,
University of Illinois. And so we're gonna

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.789
remain very competitive.

00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:34.380
The question is how do we create more opportunities
for more people in the City of Chicago so

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:41.190
that we're not a Tale of Two Cities, extreme
poverty in the surrounding areas. And I say

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:48.360
that [chuckles] when I take 290 coming in
sometimes and I see that beautiful skyline

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:54.730
in front me, to the east of me I see the Emerald
City. I always think of the Wizard of Oz ?

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:55.730
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [chuckles]

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.269
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: and what it took to get
to the Emerald City. Sometimes I feel that

00:26:58.269 --> 00:27:04.470
that's what a lot of people do. How do you
get to that and how do you expand those borders

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:10.110
so that everyone is part of that Emerald City?

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:16.039
And I think that certainly dealing with the
quality of public education is an important

00:27:16.039 --> 00:27:23.749
piece of that. I've talked to small manufacturers
who want to develop advanced manufacturing

00:27:23.749 --> 00:27:29.379
here in parts of the city on the west side,
and the first thing they tell me is that they're

00:27:29.379 --> 00:27:32.499
concerned about being able to find the skilled
work force.

00:27:32.499 --> 00:27:38.059
And so that's why programs like the one, the
Austin Polytech Program on the west side where

00:27:38.059 --> 00:27:42.980
they're working with a couple of manufacturers
and training the kids, machinists to deal

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.179
with today's equipment. More of that needs
to be done.

00:27:47.179 --> 00:27:54.840
On the tax policy side, folks, I know it's
painful. I've yet to talk to a business person

00:27:54.840 --> 00:28:00.600
who says, "Yeah, go ahead increase my taxes."
I don't know of anyone who does that, who

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.360
says that. I'm sure they're out there.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:13.989
But the fact of the matter is that Illinois
was about to start defaulting. Providers have

00:28:13.989 --> 00:28:22.269
waited nine months, eight months to be paid.
The only state worse than us was California,

00:28:22.269 --> 00:28:30.179
in the country. There was really no other
alternative but to raise that tax. I'm glad

00:28:30.179 --> 00:28:36.490
it was done temporarily and not permanent
even though it's the legislature so they could

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:41.369
always go back in three or four years and
then make the tax increase permanent. I would

00:28:41.369 --> 00:28:48.779
hope that that doesn't happen. But the fact
of the matter is that we need to pay our bills

00:28:48.779 --> 00:28:54.980
and I really think that this threat that's
out there, the Governor of Indiana and New

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.120
Jersey putting up a welcome sign --

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.120
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Right.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:05.360
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: and trying to lure companies
away from Illinois is just not something that

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:13.379
I think is gonna play out. Sure, some people
will make a decision based on that obligation.

00:29:13.379 --> 00:29:23.289
But I think Chicago is strong and I think
many parts of the state are strong and businesses

00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:24.289
will do well here.

00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:30.690
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Let's talk about something
that's maybe not nearly as sexy, tax increment

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:34.690
financing. You've talked a little bit on the
campaign trail about TIF surpluses which I

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:39.220
think surprised a lot of Chicagoans to hear
the term "surplus" and "Chicago" in the same

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:44.440
sentence. But can you talk a little bit more
about the TIF surplus and what if anything

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.360
you might do with any TIF surplus funds?

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:52.070
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Well first of all we don't
know what the amount is and we're the ones,

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:59.110
we being the city, will determine what the
surplus is. But that determination gets made

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:05.409
by looking at what's obligated and what projects
are in the pipeline and once you subtract

00:30:05.409 --> 00:30:09.851
all of that, then you see what's there, 'cause
TIF's generate about $500 million a year.

00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:20.100
And this year for this current fiscal year
we used about $30 million or so for the budget

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:25.759
to deal with this year's budget. That triggered
the release of dollars because it's a formula

00:30:25.759 --> 00:30:34.659
driven process to CPS of about $90 million.
I anticipate that we're going to have to do

00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:42.549
the same thing for fiscal year 2012, because
we are at this point talking about a $650

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:48.239
million deficit and my guess is that it's
going to be higher than that. And so we're

00:30:48.239 --> 00:30:49.970
going to have to use those dollars.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:59.220
Now I also believe that TIF's should be created
for what was originally intended and that

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:05.600
is to spur economic activity in blighted areas.
We haven't done that. A lot of TIF dollars

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:13.350
have gone into the downtown area and so the
Mercantile Exchange got something like $15

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:18.539
million and Boeing and others have gotten
money.

00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:26.059
I wanna see TIF's used to stimulate economic
activity in areas that need it number one,

00:31:26.059 --> 00:31:31.989
and I want to see it tied to job creation.
And so if the job creation doesn't take place

00:31:31.989 --> 00:31:38.549
then those TIF dollars oughta come back to
the city. So we're gonna do a lot of work

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:48.289
with TIF's. But I believe that tax increment
financing is a good economic development tool.

00:31:48.289 --> 00:31:50.890
I'm not one of those who wants to do away
with TIF's.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.429
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum. And do you support
the Sweet Home Chicago proposal?

00:31:54.429 --> 00:31:55.429
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Yes.

00:31:55.429 --> 00:31:56.429
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Okay.

00:31:56.429 --> 00:31:57.429
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: I supported --

00:31:57.429 --> 00:31:58.429
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: The answer.

00:31:58.429 --> 00:32:01.940
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: the Sweet Home Chicago
proposal because we've had the CHA plan for

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:07.679
transformation. It's slowed down because of
the slowdown in economy, and I don't think

00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:13.980
we're getting as many federal dollars as we
should be getting for the development of affordable

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.499
housing and public housing.

00:32:16.499 --> 00:32:20.980
And so there's a desperate need out there
and we all know what's happening with the

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:27.090
housing market. We have a serious, serious
problems with foreclosures in the City of

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:31.210
Chicago and with some of the lending institutions
 -- the banks walking away from some of these

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:38.820
properties and failing to secure these properties.
And so that is at the top of the list for

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.139
the next mayor and that is dealing with the
housing crisis --

00:32:42.139 --> 00:32:43.139
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:32:43.139 --> 00:32:45.980
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: that we have. Because
I think the market has begun to bottom out

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:50.639
and I think we're gonna see a turn around.
Property values are gonna start to go back

00:32:50.639 --> 00:32:56.149
up and so we have to stimulate more activity.

00:32:56.149 --> 00:33:01.460
There's a group in Brownsville that has a
wonderful project. And for those of you who

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:07.539
are familiar with Brownsville, it has a fabulous
history in the Africa-American community.

00:33:07.539 --> 00:33:13.279
And I met with them a couple weeks ago and
they said, "Listen," they showed me, "these

00:33:13.279 --> 00:33:18.570
are all the vacant lots that the city owns."
The city owns a ton of vacant lots and what

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:23.159
they want to do is take those lots and they're
working with a developer and they're gonna

00:33:23.159 --> 00:33:29.140
build market rate housing as defined by the
community, in working with the developer.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:37.500
And that kind of community driven neighborhood
development is what I want to see more of

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.770
in the City of Chicago.

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.789
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum. We do wanna take some
questions from the audience. So if you do

00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:46.700
have some questions feel free to line up at
the mic and ask anything that's on your mind.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.549
But I do wanna do a quick lightening round
 --

00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:50.549
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Right.

00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:53.049
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: which I hope will be fun for
you.

00:33:53.049 --> 00:33:58.590
Question here: ketchup on a Chicago hot dog
unacceptable or impeachable offense.?

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.309
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: I don't use it, I don't
use ketchup.

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:02.509
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: No ketchup. Alright, that's
good. I mean that was ?

00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:03.509
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: No.

00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:05.021
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: that's a deal breaker for
a lot of people who are going to the polls.

00:34:05.021 --> 00:34:06.820
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: And no one should ever
admit that in Chicago.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:07.820
[both laugh]

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.721
&gt;&gt;David Leiber: Favorite restaurant in the
city?

00:34:09.721 --> 00:34:14.030
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Well I have a little Puerto
Rican restaurant Café Central on Chicago

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:20.110
Avenue which is probably the oldest Puerto
Rican restaurant in the City of Chicago, like

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.070
45, 50 years old or something like that.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.070
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Okay. Favorite search engine?

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.679
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Oh --

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:27.679
[laughter]

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:28.710
I thought there was only one.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.560
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs] Say no more.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.720
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: I use Gmail and I forgot
Gmail is Google.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.220
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: That's right.

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:38.750
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: You guys have cornered
it. I tell ya.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.110
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs] Blackberry, iPhone,
or --

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.110
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: iPhone.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.110
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: iPhone okay.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.690
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: I love the iPhone. Love/hate
relationship with the iPhone.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:46.690
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:48.410
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: You know those dropped
calls are frustrating.

00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:49.410
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:51.410
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: But I love the iPhone.

00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:52.850
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Cubs or White Sox?

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:54.750
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: I'm a sports fan.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:55.770
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:56.770
[laughter]

00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:01.080
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: But people laugh when
I say that, but I really am! I mean I'll sit

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:06.330
there and I'll go back and forth, I'm a surfer,
and I'll watch a Cub game and a Sox game at

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:14.690
the same time while I'm watching a Bulls game.
That's how I am. Love Cubs, Sox, Bears, Blackhawks,

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:15.690
of course.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:16.690
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Absolutely.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.580
What do you think about another Olympic bid?

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.880
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: I don't see it at this
time.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.270
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:29.080
And here's sort of a curve ball here, but
other than your own campaign videos what's

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.540
the last YouTube video you watched?

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.710
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: You know --

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:34.870
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Is that too much of a curve
ball there?

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:37.060
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: No well I have the YouTube
on my iPhone --

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.060
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.490
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: so I've seen some videos.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.490
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.820
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: But I remember one with
a baby.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.820
[laughter]

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.170
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah, there's lot of cats,
we have lots of cats.

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.760
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: You have lots of cat ones
 --

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.760
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.100
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: and babies and every now
and then when I show my kids the dog video

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.100
 --

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.100
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Right.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.100
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: and all the kinds of different
 --

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.100
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: I do.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.800
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: I just love seeing my
grandson. He loves seeing some of those videos.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.750
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah, I do the same thing
with my three year old. It provides minutes

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.750
–of -

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:05.750
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Yeah.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:06.750
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: entertainment.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.750
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: sure.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:08.750
[laughter]

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:12.140
But by the way you guys you could see a few
good videos that have been put on YouTube

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.140
related to my campaign.

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.140
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yes.

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:18.020
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Like the bike guys. And
just a quick story. Some high school students

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:25.690
at Sullivan High School decided to do a video
criticizing one of my opponents on education

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:32.090
issues. And they put this thing up and I didn't
know, I didn't know these kids, they did this

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:38.020
on their own working with their teachers.
That YouTube video has now gotten almost 10,000

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:43.490
hits. So it's amazing and of course we love
it.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:44.490
[laughter]

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.310
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Let's take a couple of questions
here.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.000
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi, welcome Mr. del Valle.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Thank you.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.760
&gt;&gt;female #1: My name is Frances Young. And
in my family I have quite a few Chicago police

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.760
officers --

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.760
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Yes.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.100
&gt;&gt;female #1: or family members that work with
the Chicago Police Department. I haven't heard

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:03.970
a lot from your campaign on what your plans
are. This has been quite a year for the Chicago

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:08.870
Police Department. We've heard like from all
of the mayoral candidates that, yes you would

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:15.340
replace the current superintendent and lots
of people have said that we will bring in

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.361
more police officers.

00:37:16.361 --> 00:37:23.790
But right now the morale at the Chicago Police
Department is really low. What are your plans

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:28.070
to one bring up the morale of the Chicago
Police Department, what all over is your crime

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.070
plan for Chicago?

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.530
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: And I've talked quite
a bit about that, but I don't have the millions

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.190
of dollars to put the commercials on TV.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.190
&gt;&gt;female #1: Um-hum.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:38.460
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: So people like you will
say, "Hey he doesn't have a plan." Well that's

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.660
because I don't have those commercials.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.660
&gt;&gt;female #1: [laughs]

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.980
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: And those commercials
don't tell ya much anyway as I said. But I've

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:52.980
talked about the need to fill vacancies, but
I'm not going to pander to the Chicago Police

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:57.390
Department by proposing, for example, that
there be a discussion on residency.

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.390
&gt;&gt;female #1: Um-hum.

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:02.540
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Chicago police officers
should live in the City of Chicago and it

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:07.280
should be a requirement and should continue
to be a requirement. A couple of my opponents

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:11.630
have said, "Yeah, it's something we can talk
about." What are we -- we're tryin' to build

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:15.110
up the middle class in every neighborhood
in the City of Chicago. We're gonna allow

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:21.820
people to move out but earn their salary from
property tax payers and residents in the City

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:25.320
of Chicago who pay taxes? So that's wrong.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:31.490
Community policing. One of my problems with
Jody Weis is that he really hasn't strengthened

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:36.610
the CAPS Program. So I wanna reinvent the
CAPS Program and develop a true community

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:42.220
policing model that's effective. And I understand
that there were budget cuts this year that

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:47.681
pulled police officers away from community
policing. That has to be reversed. We have

00:38:47.681 --> 00:38:54.110
to move folks from administrative positions
and free those positions up for the front

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.280
line. That has to happen.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:02.630
I've talked to Jody Weis about making better
use of the cameras, the blue light cameras.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:11.970
When was the last time we saw a report on
TV that showed that as a result of video captured

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:19.980
of a crime being perpetrated, that that led
to an arrest and then to a conviction?

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.780
The cameras are not being used. People have
lost in the neighborhoods that desperately

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:28.650
need these cameras to function and trusted
the cameras initially, they've lost faith

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:33.650
in 'em. I dealt with a particular street where
there was a camera where on three different

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:39.740
instances, there were shootings practically
in front of the camera that should have been

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:44.340
captured, and each time I checked, either
the camera was not working properly, it was

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:53.900
not turned on, or it wasn't facing the right
direction because it scans. And so I was and

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:59.150
have been dissatisfied with some of Jody Weis'
responses.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:07.520
On the other hand, it is true that crime rates
have dropped. It is true that the number of

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:14.080
incidents regarding police misconduct have
dropped, and so there are some positive things

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.410
that have happened.

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:21.000
But as mayor I would prefer to have my own
team. I doesn't mean that there isn't a role

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:28.330
for Jody Weis somewhere in the city, even
though he has a very, very huge salary. So

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:32.680
I know we can't find another place that's
gonna pay him as much as he's makin' now.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:39.300
But I prefer to have my own team. I'm gonna
be held accountable as mayor, I want my own

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:44.240
superintendent in the Chicago Public Schools,
who by the way is an educator. And for the

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:50.340
police department I feel that we should be
able to find someone within the ranks who

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:55.000
can assume that position. And I think that
will do a lot for morale.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.100
When Jody Weis came into town as an FBI man,
a good guy ?

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.100
&gt;&gt;female #1: Um-hum.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:10.630
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: when he put on that uniform,
that was a mistake. To this day a lot of police

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:15.800
officers resent that because he didn't, he
wasn't trained in the police department. He

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:24.070
wasn't a police officer, and so he was a civilian,
FBI person, and he came in and he still puts

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:31.180
on the uniform. That's, that may seem small
to us but to police officers, it's a big deal.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.180
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:36.310
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: And those kinds of things,
those kinds of missteps I think have led to

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:41.280
the climate that you have today, but there
are a lot of good things that Jody Weis has

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.970
done and we have to give him credit for the
good things he's done.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:44.970
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:49.450
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: We'll take one more question
and then Mr. del Valle has to be on his way.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.440
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hi, so thanks so much for coming.
Just jumping back to you were talking about

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.800
the City Council being a rubber stamp and
so forth. I'm lucky I live in the 32nd ward

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.720
so I have one of the few aldermen who voted
against the parking meter deal.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.350
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Scott Waguespack.

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:02.960
&gt;&gt;male #1: Right, yeah. And my question is
I think you're being a little too generous

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.830
to say they were tied up with the minutia
of doing their aldermanic duties instead of

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.260
just kind of being in the pocket of daily.
I'm kind of wondering how much of talking

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:14.680
about setting the City Council free is related
to their positions not being so intertwined

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.930
with the patronage machine and how much of
it is the fact they're just the wrong people.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:21.610
So if you were elected, how do you think that
would start to change?

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:22.610
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Well --

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.220
&gt;&gt;male #1: If you have the vast majority of
the same people in place?

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:30.760
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Well I'm glad you asked
that question because we may get as many as

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:42.780
15 maybe more new aldermen in this election.
So a new mayor and a huge turnover in the

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:49.990
City Council presents an opportunity for us
to really change the climate, change the environment,

00:42:49.990 --> 00:43:01.260
change how the City Council conducts its business.
So that guys like, aldermen like Waguespack,

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:08.620
he's a very principled, very independent alderman.
I wanna see more aldermen like Scott in the

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:15.160
city council. As a matter of fact he's being
aggressively challenged right now because

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:20.590
of his independence and because he speaks
his mind. We need more aldermen like that

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:21.940
in the City Council.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:26.630
That's again one of the things that distinguishes
me from the other candidates. I'm not gonna

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:32.840
get into details right now, but it's no secret
out there that one of the leading candidates

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:43.081
is helping funnel money to a group that is
working to elect certain aldermen, where they're

00:43:43.081 --> 00:43:48.800
making big contributions to make sure that
certain aldermen get elected and, of course,

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:55.960
then the understanding will be that they will
then be beholden. That's exactly what we want

00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.460
to get away from in the City of Chicago which
is what you're talking about.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:08.960
And yes does that mean that we're gonna have
some difficult days depending on issues? Yes,

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:14.741
but that's democracy; you call that democracy.
And that's what people want in the City of

00:44:14.741 --> 00:44:18.600
Chicago. I think there's been a whole new
generation. The demographics have changed

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:25.200
in the City of Chicago. There are a lot of
folks out there who want to see city government

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:35.150
tackle tough issues and to be, use a deliberative
process that's going to allow for public input

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:41.740
and for debate. And so I'm looking forward
to that and I will encourage that. And I think

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:46.150
that because of this turnover that's going
to happen, unlike in the past.

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.150
[pause]

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.740
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Great.

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.920
Well, Mr. del Valle, thank you so much for
coming. We wanted to present you, we've been

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.500
here at Google Chicago for 10 years now, and
this is a 10 year, 10 stars anniversary --

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:00.500
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Ten stars, okay.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.560
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: sort of a T-shirt. So thank
you so much ?

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.560
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Thank you.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.570
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: for coming today. We really
appreciate it. Thank you.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:05.570
[applause]

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:08.610
Thanks a lot. This is for you.

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:11.640
&gt;&gt;Miguel del Valle: Thank you folks.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.660
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Go ahead.
