00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:06.380
In reality, DSM as originally envisioned, that is, a threads package for

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.880
a cluster is dead. Structured DSM,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.910
namely, providing higher level data abstractions for

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.490
sharing among threads, executing on different

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.870
nodes of the cluster, is attractive, to

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.220
reduce the programming pain for the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.670
developers of distributed applications on a cluster.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.615
We will discuss one such system, called persistent

00:00:28.615 --> 00:00:31.690
temporal streams, as part of a later lesson module.
