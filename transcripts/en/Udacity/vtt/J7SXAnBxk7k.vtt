00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.222
The answer is negative seven.

00:00:01.222 --> 00:00:05.370
There's a lot going on here, so
let's take this step-by-step.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.840
The first thing we need to do
is look at the grouping symbols.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.500
Here we have nesting grouping symbols
with parentheses inside brackets.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.510
When this is the case, do the innermost
set of grouping symbols first and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.880
then work your way out.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.480
So the first thing we should
do is six minus eight.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.860
Six minus eight equals negative two.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.840
So we'll just rewrite our expression and
substitute in negative two and

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.960
this is our new expression.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.780
Now let's work our way out four
minus negative 2 equals 6.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.916
We'll rewrite our expression again and
substituting six in for four minus

00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:50.280
negative two, our expression becomes six
divided by six plus negative two cubed.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.970
When parentheses are used
to indicate clarity, for

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.910
example, keeping a sign
associated with a number,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.970
we don't treat them as grouping
symbols like we normally would.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.640
The next thing that we need to
do is evaluate this exponent.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.385
We're not evaluating this next
because of the parentheses but

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:11.543
because it's an exponent.

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:16.525
So negative two with parenthesis
cubed is equal to negative two

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:21.511
times negative two minus two
which is equal to negative eight.

00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:27.426
So our new expression becomes six
divided by six plus negative eight.

00:01:27.426 --> 00:01:31.050
Now we've done all the grouping
symbols and all the exponents.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.070
Next thing to do is multiply and
divide from left to right.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.724
Six divided by six equals one.

00:01:36.724 --> 00:01:40.710
We substitute that back into our
original equation to get one plus

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.804
negative eight.

00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:45.830
One plus negative eight equals
negative seven, and we're all set.
