00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.467
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:10.789
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:11.830
DEAN KARNAZES: Thank you.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.940
And let me let me start
by asking how many of you

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.478
ran the marathon yesterday?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.550
And how many of you did not want
to get out of bed this morning?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.570
It was warm out
there, wasn't it?

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.620
I mean for London, yeah.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.060
I saw a lot of
people struggling.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.340
But it was glorious.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.300
So, what I am.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.100
I've run marathons.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.250
But I also run what are
called ultra-marathons.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.340
And in Latin,
ultra means beyond.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.540
So an ultra-marathon is
anything beyond a marathon.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.100
And a marathon-- for
us marathoners know--

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.730
is 26.2 miles.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.110
Never used to be that way.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.660
And I'll explain why.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.880
But right now, since 1908, the
distance has been 26.2 miles.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.720
So the people that
had their hands

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.010
raised, they ran that
distance yesterday.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.050
So congratulations.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.510
So I'll tell you that
this is a show called

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.070
"The David Letterman Show."

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.860
And it was filmed
in New York City.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.140
I got a request to be
on David Letterman.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.520
And the thought
of being on stage

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.940
with a celebrity like that
was so intimidating to me.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.820
It was overwhelming.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.778
But I thought, you have
two weeks before you're

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:27.200
due to be on the show.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.600
And in that two-week
time frame, they'll

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.970
probably give you
extensive media training.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.740
There will be dry runs.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.720
They'll let you know
the questions David

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.580
will be asking in advance.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.100
And they'll help me
prepare the answers.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.429
Well, a week goes by, I
haven't heard from anyone.

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:43.970
Two weeks go by,
and all of a sudden,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.300
I found myself on an airplane
from San Francisco, my home

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.652
city, to New York City.

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:51.110
And they pick me
up at the airport.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.750
And they kind of whisk me
around in this sleep-deprived,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.910
jet-lagged state.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.410
And then at 6 o'clock
at night, they

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.124
bring me to the back entrance
of the Letterman Studio.

00:02:01.124 --> 00:02:03.540
And they take me up this thing
they were calling the Green

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.052
Room, which was beige.

00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:07.260
And they put me in this room.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.060
And they say, sit down Dean.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.259
Sit on the couch.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.380
Relax, have some food.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.470
And I'm not so relaxed.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.070
I'm thinking, the training,
the briefings, the dry run--

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.025
when are we going to
get all these things?

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:21.150
And then eventually two of
David's-- what they call

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.160
handlers-- walk in the room.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.660
And these handlers
sit down with me.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.240
And they say OK, Dean,
here's what you've got to do.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.910
When you're on the show tonight,
don't make any reference

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.730
to it being Monday night,
because your segment is going

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.340
to air on Wednesday night.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.167
I said, well, OK.

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:36.750
I can do that.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.710
What's next?

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.510
And they said, that's about it.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.190
And they walked out.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.750
And now I'm in there
kind of looking

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.240
at my watch freaking
out, thinking

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.986
the training, the dry run.

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:48.360
And then two more
people come in.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.310
And they ask me to stand up.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.330
So I stand up.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.030
And like any runner does, I
start shaking my limbs loose

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.149
for the big training program.

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:58.440
And these two people, they
kind of look me up and down.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.300
One rubs his chin,
looks at the other one.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.460
They say, yeah, the
guy looks fine to me.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.080
And they walked out.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.320
I don't know who they were.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.820
And now, I'm just really,
really anxiety-ridden.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.200
I'm thinking, the
training, the dry run.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.840
I hear on the loudspeaker,
ultra-marathon man,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.570
we need you at stage
level immediately.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.100
And this door swings open.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.840
And there's a guy
standing there.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.150
And he walks me down this
stark, white hallway--

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.000
this nondescript hallway
with these fluorescent lights

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.990
overhead.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.490
And we get in a
freight elevator.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.476
We go down a couple of stories.

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:33.600
The door opens, there's
another guy standing there.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.130
The first guy hands
me to the second guy.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.260
The second guy kind of
parades me around a corner.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.550
And there's a third guy.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.484
And I notice the third
guy has a headset on.

00:03:40.484 --> 00:03:42.150
And when he sees me
walking towards him,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.602
he says three, two,
one, you're on.

00:03:46.602 --> 00:03:49.500
I'm like, what?

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.390
And he said, go.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.130
Everyone's waiting for you.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.394
So I kind of stamber out.

00:03:53.394 --> 00:03:54.560
I'm not sure what to expect.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.530
And I come around
the corner and wham,

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.830
I'm just blinded by these
huge, white stage lights.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.530
I can't see anything
but this fog of white.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.840
And I hear laughter
and applause.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.210
It was like I was in heaven.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.320
I'm sitting there frozen
like a deer in the headlamps.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.290
And I looked to my left, and
there was David Letterman,

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.736
with his hand outstretched.

00:04:16.736 --> 00:04:17.360
And it's funny.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.589
I wasn't supposed to run out.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.750
I was supposed to just sit
there as the segment ended.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.041
But they didn't really tell me.

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:23.150
So I have this motto--

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.490
when all else fails, get
up and start running.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.000
So I just got up and
ran out of the studio.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.970
But anyway, that tells you
a little bit about who I am.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.980
That was 10 years ago when
my first book came out.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.280
10 years later, I
haven't really stopped

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.440
running since that point.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.940
And the story I'm
going to tell you

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.490
today is about the
origins of the marathon.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.310
So this is my fourth book.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.680
And I think in a lot of
ways, my most personal book,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.870
because I'm 100% Greek.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.830
And my dad has always insisted
we're from the same village

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.680
in the mountains of
Greece as Pheidippides,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.070
or Phee-dee-pee-dees,
the famous Greek runner.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.840
I always tell him,
Dad, I grew up in LA.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.210
What village in Greece
are you referring to?

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.542
It was a very fascinating
journey to go down.

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:10.250
And I think I'll share
it with you today.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.999
I think that's why I'm here.

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:14.540
You probably are
thinking that you're

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.870
listening to Dean Karnazes
speaking, correct?

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.710
My name is actually
Constantine Nicholas Karnazes.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.780
So that gives you some
indication I'm Irish.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.030
But how many of you
marathoners, especially,

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.840
know the definition
of the word marathon?

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.600
Probably you have
an idea, right?

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.030
I think most people would
define a marathon as anything

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.840
of excruciatingly long
duration, like marathon

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.820
sessions of Congress--

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.940
or parliament here-- or
marathon traffic jams.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.330
But a marathoner will tell
you what is a marathon.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.150
It's a foot race of
26.2 miles, correct?

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.740
And that's the definition.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.600
The actual definition is
field filled with fennel--

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.070
fennel the wild herb.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.640
And the reason being
is that in 490 BCE,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.590
the Persians invaded Greece.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.100
And they landed at
this coastal plain

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.680
that was covered in wild fennel,
which grows all over Greece--

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.480
hence, marathon.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.341
So when people say--

00:06:17.341 --> 00:06:18.840
they have those
bumper stickers that

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.370
say 26.2, they should
actually read fennel,

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.190
because that's the definition
of the word marathon.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.000
We also know the story of
this gentleman, Pheidippides,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.320
that supposedly ran from
the battlefield of Marathon

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.040
to the Acropolis after
the Athenians somehow

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.960
defeated the Persians.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.630
That distance is 24.8 miles.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.520
And I'll get to that later on.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.970
But he ran 24.8 miles to the
Acropolis proclaimed niki,

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:49.560
niki--

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.020
or victory, victory, nike, nike.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.310
We're victorious.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.390
And then what happened to him?

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.050
He died, right?

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.030
Yeah, he died.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.130
But there's more to
the story than that.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.980
He was actually a
class of citizen

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.820
known as a hemerodromoi,
which meant day-long runner.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.280
He was a professional
foot messenger.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.240
And the Greeks realized that
in the mountainous terrain

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.360
of southern Greece, a
trained hemerodromoi

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.760
could outrun a horse.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.370
And I know this to be true,
because I've actually raced

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.280
a horse over a
100 mile foot race

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.510
in the mountains of Vermont.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.130
And I beat the horse.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.270
So there's some debate
about the actual translation

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.140
of his name, Pheidippides,
meaning spare the horse,

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.360
presumably because a
trained runner could not

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.180
kill off a horse.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.290
We'll send a runner instead.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.160
I was fascinated
with this story.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.660
And I wanted to
learn more about it.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.960
But the first thing I
wanted to learn is what must

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.580
it felt like running in that
costume that he's wearing?

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.910
So I visited a
Hollywood costume store.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:01.110
And I was outfitted with
the hoplite running suit.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:06.770
And I decided I would tackle
the Silicon Valley marathon.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.780
And I will tell you,
after doing that, I

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.490
think I know why he died.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.300
There was some chafing.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.630
There was blistering
where the sun don't shine.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.460
And I also ran barefoot.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.470
And only about
half of that course

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.040
was on man-made,
natural dirt surfaces.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.970
The rest was on the
road, as you see here.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.140
So my feet were pretty beat up.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.289
I did see a gentleman
running barefoot yesterday

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.070
in the marathon as well.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.620
And he was in the medical tent.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.057
So I don't think
his journey ended

00:08:38.057 --> 00:08:39.890
with a medal around his
neck, unfortunately.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.295
But running barefoot,
especially on man-made surfaces,

00:08:43.295 --> 00:08:47.795
is very difficult. After
this, I completed this race.

00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:51.140
And I thought, OK, I did
everything Pheidippides did.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.701
I'm one with my ancient brother.

00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:54.700
But I learned something.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.450
I was on a webinar
with a gentleman

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.840
by the name of Professor
Paul Cartledge from Cambridge

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.160
University.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.300
And Dr. Cartledge explained
to me that what he did

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.570
was actually go much
further than just running

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.060
from marathon to the Acropolis.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.350
The historical record says
that when the Persians invaded

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.907
the Athenians, they realized
they were badly outnumbered.

00:09:17.907 --> 00:09:19.490
And they were going
to be slaughtered.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.740
So they needed reinforcements.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.840
And if you know anything
about ancient Greece

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.620
or if you've seen the movie 300,
who's the most bad ass fighting

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.390
force in ancient Greece?

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.130
The Spartans-- you
know, this is Sparta.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:38.120
So they dispatched Pheidippides
to run from Athens to Sparta.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.690
And that distance is 153 miles.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.640
So it's much further
than the distance

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.352
from Marathon to the Acropolis.

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:49.040
I also learned that
there is a modern day

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.580
incarnation of that race
called the Spartathlon.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.150
And it basically follows the
footsteps of Pheidippides

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.190
from Athens to Sparta.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.900
So I signed up to do this race.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.050
And this is what the
starting line looks like.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.190
We're at the base of
the Acropolis there.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:12.350
And there were 350 runners
in the race that year.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.560
There were 47 different
countries represented.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.590
And it's the most elite of
the elite ultra-marathons.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.950
It's very hard to gain
entrance to actually be

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.330
able to compete in this race.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.440
You can see some of the
terrain here is beautiful.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.020
But it's very, very mountainous.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.620
The race is also held in
September in southern Greece.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.890
So it's very, very
hot and humid.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.200
Another thing that makes
this race so difficult

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.340
is that it tries to stay
within the historical record

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.370
of milestones that Herodotus,
the father of history,

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:54.140
recorded Pheidippides being at
certain points during his run.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.900
You have to be at a
city called Corinth,

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.020
which is 50.22 miles
from the start,

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.830
within 9 and 1/2 hours of the
starting gun going off, or else

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.110
you're eliminated from the race.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.570
And those of you that
know marathoning, that's

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:13.310
two back-to-back marathons
in very hot mountainous

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:18.050
conditions, each of those
being around a 4 and 1/2 hour

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.400
marathon-- or sub
4 and 1/2 hours.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.140
And the thing is, you don't want
to be there anywhere close to 9

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.840
and 1/2 hours because those
aggressive cut-offs continue

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.030
the entire duration.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.390
What they have is this thing
they call the death bus.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.820
And it drives along as a sweep.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.680
And anyone that doesn't
make the cut off

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.200
has to get into this bus.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.970
And I heard the
bus was horrible.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.680
I heard there's moaning
and groaning in there.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.310
There's blisters.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.510
And it doesn't smell very good.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.390
So I thought, just stay
ahead of these cutoff times,

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.590
because you do not want
to get in this bus.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.000
The other thing
with this race is

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.330
that you have to complete
it within 36 hours,

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.360
because the historical
record from Herodotus

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.660
says that Pheidippides
arrived in Sparta the day

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.480
after setting out, which can
be interpreted as he left one

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.000
morning, got there by
sunset the next day.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.860
One thing I wanted to do in
taking on the Spartathlon

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.730
is only wanted to use those
foods the ancient hemerodromoi

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:27.110
had access to when they were
running 2,500 years ago.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.620
So I hate olives, figs.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.350
This is cured meat--
kind of a beef jerky.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.980
And something they call pasteli,
which is a ground sesame seed

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.540
honey paste.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.620
I also only drink water,
no electrolyte replenish

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.070
or sports beverages to
try to reproduce what

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.210
he might have gone through.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.030
There are eight stations
set up along the way.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.210
And I thought it was
really very Greek

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.510
that a lot of the volunteers
were having a hard time

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.060
supporting their
families, because

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.070
of the economic
situation in Greece.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.170
Yet they'd come out and
support all of us runners

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.240
as we're running
down their streets.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.280
They had pitchers of
water that you could--

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.824
like yesterday-- where you
could kind of sponge off.

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:13.240
Unfortunately, the
water was warm.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:13.994
There's no ice.

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:15.160
So it's almost like a sauna.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.740
It was almost deleterious
to put the water on you.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.900
But I just felt
kind of obligated,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.587
because they were
there servicing us.

00:13:23.587 --> 00:13:25.170
Another thing that
really surprised me

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.530
during the Spartathlon was even
though there were 350 of us

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.900
at the start, the field
spreads out very quickly.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:37.230
So I ran, I would say,
over 80% of that 153 miles

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.420
all by myself.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.710
When you run 153 miles,
how many days does it take?

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.660
Where are the hotels?

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.370
Where do you sleep?

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.110
The answer is you don't.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.680
You just keep
running for 36 hours

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.090
straight through the night.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:59.160
You just put on a headlamp,
and you keep going.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.890
That checkpoint I was running
into was about mile 115.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.830
And I was refueling
here on some more figs.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:13.300
So at this point, I'd been
eating figs for about 17 hours.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.250
And right when I
left that checkpoint,

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:20.140
I was going to scale something
called Mount Parthenion.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.850
And if you see, this is an
altitude profile of a course.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.830
So this is looking at
what you've got to climb.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.820
The red line below is
the Boston Marathon--

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.320
Heartbreak Hill they call it.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.170
Super--

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.870
So I ran Boston
Marathon the Monday

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.710
before the London Marathon.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.350
And I'll tell you, Heartbreak
Hill felt like a speed bump

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.450
to me after climbing
Mount Parthenion.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:51.550
So it's a 3,000 foot climb
in about a two mile stretch.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.280
And that's the equivalent
of about three Empire State

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.320
buildings straight
up into the sky.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.540
It's 15 mile stretch from one
side to the next checkpoint.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.220
And in those 15 hours-- this is
as I came down the far side--

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:16.140
in 15 miles, it took me five
hours to cover 15 miles.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.950
And I was moving as
quickly as I could.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.264
My heart rate was almost maxed
for that entire five hours.

00:15:21.264 --> 00:15:22.680
And all I covered
in that duration

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.260
was 15 miles, because
it was so treacherous

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.950
up on this mountain.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.360
And here's a view as the night
turned to day the next morning.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.880
You can see the mountain
in the background.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.940
The one unique thing with
the Spartathlon in that it's

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.220
like no other race on earth.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.130
Because there's no finish line.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.460
How many of you have done a race
where there's no finish line?

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.810
You run with a timing chip.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.590
And you're going
across timing mats

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.920
so they're recording
your time the entire way.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.700
But in the main square of
Sparta is this towering bronze

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.460
statue of King Leonidas--

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.920
the King-- "This is Sparta!"

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.170
And what you do to
finish this race

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.560
is you run up to
the King's feet--

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.690
this bronze statue--
and you touch his feet.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.210
And when you touch his
feet, they stop the clock.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.040
And your race is done.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.670
So here's a shot of me touching
his feet at the very finish.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:20.300
It's a hugely
emotional moment that's

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.570
standing below, because
you've been out there just

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:27.900
battling the elements, battling
yourself, battling your mind.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.700
And when you get to Sparta,
it's such a beautiful moment.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:36.230
And every single runner I saw
touch his feet, you just melt.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.910
You get the chills.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.620
And it was just an
incredible experience.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.270
Here's another perspective.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.240
After the race, there's a
mandatory medical check.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.470
And I've never seen--

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.300
I've been to a lot of medical
checks at the end of races--

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.590
I've never seen anything
like this place.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:17:01.310
There were more IV bags in
there than grapes on a vine.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.620
People had broken their legs.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.560
They were in splints.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.430
It was really quite
a traumatic scene.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.079
But I checked out just fine.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:14.220
And having explored this area
a bit and knowing Greece,

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.490
I knew that what do you do after
a race like this in Greece?

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.300
It's Greece, right?

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.650
Why am I running 153 miles
through the mountains?

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.369
Go to the beach.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.670
So I hit the coastline
right after that.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:31.500
And that is the US
cover of my book.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.700
So you've got the UK cover,
which I think is a much--

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.091
if you have a book in front
of you, look at the covers.

00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:39.090
Which one do you prefer?

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.485
AUDIENCE: US.

00:17:40.485 --> 00:17:41.520
DEAN KARNAZES: US?

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.340
Oh no.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.320
My publisher is here.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.810
But I think I'll
end by explaining

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:54.656
why the marathon is not
24.8 miles as the run from--

00:17:54.656 --> 00:17:56.280
well, let me go on
with the full story.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.860
So Pheidippides gets to Sparta.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.340
He says to the Spartans, were
being invaded by the Persians.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.780
We need your help.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.400
The Spartans said, that's fine.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.380
We'll come to your aid.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.950
Except, we can't leave,
because the moon is not full.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.950
And our religion forbids
us from leaving for battle

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.080
until there's a full moon.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.840
That won't be for
another six days' time.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.239
So now, Pheidippides is
sitting there thinking, wow,

00:18:21.239 --> 00:18:21.780
that's great.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.405
They're coming.

00:18:22.405 --> 00:18:24.780
But they're delayed by six days.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.790
I've got to tell my
Athenian mates that

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.820
are waiting at Marathon that
the Spartans are on the way.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.530
They're just going to take a
little bit longer to get there.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.580
So what does he do?

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.330
He turns around and
dead-heads back.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.640
He runs back to Marathon.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.560
The battle is fought.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.300
And then he ran the final--

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.380
this is my version--

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.040
then he ran the final
stretch into the Acropolis

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.870
to fall dead.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.480
He deserved to
die at that point.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.600
But that is-- again--
that's 24.8 miles.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.980
Why is the legend not the
Spartathlon-- this 153 mile

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.330
round trip?

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.880
Well, if you look back into
history, in ancient Greece,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.510
there was nothing
more noble than dying

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.810
in the cause of your countrymen
and serving your country--

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.460
fulfilling your mission.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.890
And that last
stretch from Marathon

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.290
to the Acropolis, someone died.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.780
And that was just the
most glorious story ever.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.990
Someone running a 153
miles round trip-- well,

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.574
the guy is just a
hemerodromoi I mean,

00:19:23.574 --> 00:19:24.948
that's what he
does for a living.

00:19:24.948 --> 00:19:25.920
He's paid to do it.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.060
Yeah, it was a crappy
day at the office.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.896
But he just did his job.

00:19:29.896 --> 00:19:31.020
He died at the end, though.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.210
That is Greek.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:38.010
But the marathon-- the modern
Olympic marathon that started--

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.190
the modern Olympics,
which began in 1896,

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.730
the marathon was
actually 24.8 miles.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.820
The next subsequent couple
Olympics, the marathon

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.440
distance, was 24.8 miles.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:56.220
Well, in 1908, the marathon came
to London for the summer games.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.220
And the queen
wanted the marathon,

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.170
which was the marquee
event of the Olympics,

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.930
to finish in front
of the royal viewing

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.240
box on the Olympic track.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.360
And that was a little bit
further than 24.8 miles.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.210
That was 26.2 miles.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.280
So she talked to
the King and said,

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.290
we have to change a couple
of things around here

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.130
with this race.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.800
We've got to make it
a little bit longer.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.010
And he, of course, said, well
that's going to be a problem.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.220
These people have been
running for 24.8 miles.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:31.470
Adding another 1.4 miles,
that's going to be a tough sell.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.690
And she gave him one
of those looks that--

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.240
you men that have
wives, you know

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.781
a woman when she
gives you that look,

00:20:37.781 --> 00:20:39.630
she gives you one of those.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.070
And what do you do when
your partner gives you

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.350
a look like that?

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.850
You say, yes, darling.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.110
Anything for you.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:50.520
So the King issued a decree
forever changing the distance

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.490
of the marathon to 26.2 miles.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.630
And the rest is history.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.440
So I think that at
the London Marathon,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.060
if you're an
anarchist, at 24.8, you

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.590
might as well just stop, right?

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.180
In that last four, I
just say, hail the King.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.020
All hail the King.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.420
We just ran that last four--

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.860
1.4.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.686
But anyway, that's
the road to Sparta.

00:21:12.686 --> 00:21:14.060
The story is much
more intricate.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.840
It's much more personal.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.360
It's a journey not
just about running,

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.010
but about finding out who I am.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.040
And I think that's a
journey that all of you I

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.400
encourage to take--

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.590
to look back into your ancestry
and figure out what makes you,

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.400
you.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.780
And that's kind of what
this book is about as well.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.460
So the one thing I
will say is that I

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.220
spoke about a gentleman
that guided me through this.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.060
I'm not a historian.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.380
I can barely write my name
in the dirt with a stick.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.880
So I'm not even an author.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.370
But the gentleman who
guided me through this book

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.460
and the history, Dr.
Cartledge from Cambridge,

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.790
is here in the room.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.970
So can you please, yeah--

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.701
PAUL CARTLEDGE: I
ran all the way.

00:21:56.701 --> 00:21:58.200
DEAN KARNAZES: So
I think what we're

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.000
going to do is open
up some questions.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.730
You can ask me questions
about my background

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.266
or any sort of
historical questions.

00:22:06.266 --> 00:22:08.140
PAUL CARTLEDGE: That's
a lovely presentation.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.910
DEAN KARNAZES: You'll answer
the historical questions.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:10.910
PAUL CARTLEDGE: Of course.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:11.410
Of course.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.850
SPEAKER: OK, we
will need the mic.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.560
So please wait for the mic.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.710
Dr. Cartledge, you
will also need the mic.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.600
So I will run a bit.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.030
AUDIENCE: Couple of questions.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.130
Do you follow any specific diet?

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.930
Or do you recommend any
specific diets for long runs?

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.850
And the second question.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.340
I've heard that the Kenyan
people run quite a bit.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.246
They perform great in the
tournaments, Olympics,

00:22:38.246 --> 00:22:39.120
and things like that.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.950
Is there anything to
do with the genes?

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.150
Or how do they do that?

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:46.360
DEAN KARNAZES: Yeah, so do
I follow a specific diet?

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.731
I'll tell you what not to eat
while running for 36 hours.

00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:50.230
Figs.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.050
I would train for six or
eight hours eating figs.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.920
And it was just fine.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.380
But when you run for 24 hours
eating figs, it's not so good.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.450
Why do we eat figs?

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.005
Because to help our regularity.

00:23:06.005 --> 00:23:07.630
Well, when you're
running for 36 hours,

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.850
you don't necessarily
want to be regular.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.340
So I avoid fibrous foods.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.400
I don't carbo load any more.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.250
This idea of carbo loading used
to be very popular, where you

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.985
eat a lot of pasta and rice.

00:23:19.985 --> 00:23:22.360
And it just left me the next
morning at the starting line

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.220
feeling very bloated.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.160
So now I just stay to
a very simple diet.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.690
I follow what's
called a paleo diet.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.550
So I don't eat anything that's
refined or processed in a bag.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:38.020
If you can't pull it from a
tree or dig it from the ground

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.320
or catch it with your
hands, I don't eat it.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.420
I have a mentor, a guy by
the name of Jack Lalanne,

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.630
who was one of those
American fitness guys--

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:46.750
muscle guys.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.330
And he said, if man
makes it, don't eat it.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:53.110
And if it tastes
good, spit it out.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:55.800
This guy sounds very Spartans
to me, I can go with that.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.920
Yeah.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.370
And as for the Kenyans,
I think there's

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.470
a number of things
that help the Kenyans.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.990
One, they live at altitude.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.360
So they're training at altitude.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.560
They're from a
culture of runners.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.480
So they're kind of
immersed in that.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.940
They start at a very young age.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.940
They also are very
driven, because if they

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.330
win a race like the
London Marathon,

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.015
that's more money
than 15 Kenyans will

00:24:25.015 --> 00:24:26.140
make their entire lifetime.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.350
And that's just one race.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.590
So they're very
motivated in that

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.630
regard as well-- very hungry.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:32.830
And good for them, yeah.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.070
AUDIENCE: Could I just ask,
is there not a South American

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.140
people that also--

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.975
not just an African one--

00:24:39.975 --> 00:24:42.749
that does a lot of this
long distance running?

00:24:42.749 --> 00:24:44.790
Am I right in that you
mentioned it in your book?

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.340
DEAN KARNAZES:
Yeah, well there's

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.926
a couple cultures that are
from long distance runners.

00:24:47.926 --> 00:24:49.300
There's one in
the Copper Canyon,

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.485
which were Tarahumara Indians.

00:24:53.485 --> 00:24:55.110
So there's a book
called "Born to Run."

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.401
Some of you-- so you know
about the Tarahumara Indians.

00:24:57.401 --> 00:24:59.920
I went down and
visited these folks.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.100
And it's the same thing.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.490
They were just from
a culture of running.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.680
I said to one guy, what's
your training like?

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.017
He said, well some days
I run 60 or 70 miles.

00:25:09.017 --> 00:25:10.100
I said, that's incredible.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:10.490
What do you do?

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.823
He's like, well I'm the mailman.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.645
So it's kind of
culturally, yeah.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.990
AUDIENCE: OK, so what allows
you to trace the story

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.950
from Pheidippides
without the sources that

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.562
allow you to know,
OK, what happened

00:25:27.562 --> 00:25:28.520
or what did not happen.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.870
What do we know for sure?

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:31.270
DEAN KARNAZES:
Can you translate?

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.295
Because your accent is strong.

00:25:34.295 --> 00:25:36.170
PAUL CARTLEDGE: I think
what the question was

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.960
what is the ultimate basis,
in terms of evidence,

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.670
for the run of--

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.860
I call him Philippides.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.720
Dean calls him Pheidippides.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.550
But comes to the same thing.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.460
And it is ultimately
just a few lines--

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.640
one chapter of Herodotus.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.360
And I thought you all ought
to know that this year is

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.360
Herodotus's 2,500th birthday.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.790
If you believe he was
born in 484 BC/BCE,

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:11.280
why is 2017 the 2,500th
anniversary of his birth?

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.530
Can anybody help me with that?

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:18.490
Because if you add together 2017
and 484, you don't get 2,500.

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.970
You get 2,501.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.370
Because there's no BC
naught or AD naught.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.700
So you go from BC
one to AD-- or CE--

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.450
one.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.740
And therefore, you take off--

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.260
anyway, that's beside the point.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.160
Herodotus was traveling around
and talking to Spartans,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.180
talking to Athenians.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.550
He wasn't either a
Spartan or an Athenian.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.590
He came from what's
today Turkey--

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.630
from Halicarnassus, Bodrum.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:49.300
And in his day, he had been
born in the Persian Empire--

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.350
this empire that was
trying to conquer

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:55.590
mainland Greece to add to its
existing territory in Asia.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.950
So he had a particular
personal interest.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.200
You rightly called him
the father of history.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.600
History in Greek means inquiry.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.390
History is the result
of inquiry in English.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.180
But in Greek, it's the
process of inquiry.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.010
If you go to the Natural
History Museum in London,

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.570
that's the Museum of
the Inquiry into Nature.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.610
It's not the result of inquiry.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:18.350
It is the inquiry itself.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:21.020
So he inquired, why
did the Greeks--

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.930
the few Greeks who could
agree amongst themselves

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:24.830
for long enough--

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.210
why did they win?

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.700
Why did they not get
wiped out, totally

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.290
conquered, so on and so on?

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.160
So it was partly logistics.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.350
It was partly spirit.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.470
And this is Dean's
main point, I think.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.740
So there's this one chapter.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.480
And he says, really, what Dean
has said-- that "Phillippides"

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:46.764
or Pheidippides, was a hemeron,
or hemerodromois, or dromois.

00:27:46.764 --> 00:27:47.930
And there's a problem there.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.450
What does that
mean, a day runner?

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.430
Does it mean that he
runs only in the day--

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.540
not at night?

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.930
And there are people who
think that ancient Greek day

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.050
runners did not run at
night, whereas Dean has

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.360
run three nights consecutively.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.360
And certainly, everybody
on the Spartathlon

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.090
and indeed "Philippides,"
Pheidippides

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.740
had to run at night.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.700
Now, was that because there was
a particularly good full moon?

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.840
Not possible.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.760
It might be.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.380
But nevertheless,
even that probably

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.910
wouldn't have
given enough light.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.280
It is a really puzzling
thing how these guys

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.620
kept going over that terrain.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.690
I've tried walking barefoot.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.900
And the problem is prickles.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.380
It's not just rocks.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.136
It's the things that
grow on the rocks.

00:28:33.136 --> 00:28:34.370
Damn painful.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.160
But it's probably the case
that actually Pheidippides

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.560
from a very young age--

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.750
I imagine he comes from
a family of runners.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.820
And as with all crafts,
if you start it,

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.070
you learn it from your dad.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:50.270
Typically your dad because this
is a very male-dominated world.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.490
You harden your feet so it has
a kind of carapace over it.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:57.050
You don't actually feel with
your tendons the ground.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.810
You've got this skin
carapace over your feet.

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.040
Anyway, all he says is he
arrived there on the second

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.550
day-- so more than 24
hours, we would say--

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.170
less than 48 hours.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:13.760
And so the Spartathlon
averages it, gives you 36.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.410
It's a notional figure.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:19.010
And that's really all he says
apart from one detail, which

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:20.600
is very ancient Greek--

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.840
that at some point on
his run, Pheidippides,

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:29.000
"Philippides" met a very
strange creature-- a being.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.860
And not entirely human--

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.970
partly goat, partly
horse, partly human.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:40.730
So human down to here, goaty
legs, and a horse's tail.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.230
And his name was Pan or Pan--

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.020
it's a long A in Greek.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.190
And that's where
we get panic from.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:54.210
So if Pan is on your side, he
instills panic into the enemy.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.720
And so he addressed Philippides.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.200
And Philippides asked
him, what's going on?

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.810
And Pan says, you Athenians.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.790
You don't worship me yet.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:06.380
He came from Arcadia.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.500
And he was worshiped
as a god in Arcadia.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.710
He's the son of Hermes,
who's the messenger god.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.200
So he's a very useful
god for travel.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.857
Anyways, Philippides
obviously gets back to Athens,

00:30:17.857 --> 00:30:19.190
they win the battle of Marathon.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.590
And this is fact.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:25.000
They indeed instituted a
cult under the Acropolis

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.740
and a rural shrine.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.470
So it's not just
Herodotus making it up--

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.500
what a story.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.950
Philippides must
have been bonkers.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.620
But we then ask, don't we?

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.590
Have you heard of
the third man effect?

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.180
Does that phrase mean--

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:44.740
you're running, and you
imagine you see someone.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.960
Or, if you're an ancient
Greek, you project it as a god.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.660
And you project it
in Arcadia as Pan.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.670
Did he really have a vision?

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.770
Was he hallucinating?

00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:00.280
Did he really believe
that he saw Pan?

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.150
So that's just--

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.692
DEAN KARNAZES: He's
giving away all the book.

00:31:03.692 --> 00:31:07.306
PAUL CARTLEDGE: You've
got to read the book.

00:31:07.306 --> 00:31:10.330
SPEAKER: Maybe you just ask
a question and one of you

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:11.299
repeats it so--

00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:13.090
DEAN KARNAZES: Yeah,
we'll just paraphrase.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:13.840
Sure, that's fine.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:16.550
Yeah.

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:21.120
Yeah, you can just speak.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.490
AUDIENCE: Since you mentioned--
well, two questions.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.704
Since you did run a
marathon barefoot,

00:31:25.704 --> 00:31:28.460
you mentioned [INAUDIBLE]
tribe, just curious

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.990
what are your thoughts
about barefoot running

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.090
in general with regards to,
I guess, human physiology

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.900
and what makes sense
biomechanically

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.640
with modern shoe
technology [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.902
whether that's
serving us or not?

00:31:42.902 --> 00:31:44.993
And second question--
what's next?

00:31:44.993 --> 00:31:46.201
What's your next [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:46.201 --> 00:31:47.826
DEAN KARNAZES: Well
the first question,

00:31:47.826 --> 00:31:52.270
we were talking about running
barefoot or wearing shoes

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.670
that are over-built. A
lot of shoes, I think,

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.540
are over-built with structure
and so forth versus running

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.710
in a more natural-feeling shoe.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.660
And I've always thought
that barefoot running

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.190
was the way we were engineered
to run, as Paul said.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:07.960
When I looked at
some of the runners

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.810
in the Tarahumara
Valley, the callus

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:13.550
on the bottom of their
feet were tremendous.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.550
It looked almost like
an elephant foot.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.100
I thought that's probably
why they've got that layer.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.150
They're not feeling
as much as we do.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.290
But I love to run barefoot
on the beach, on the sand,

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.230
or if there's a
nice grass field,

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.700
run barefoot on the grass.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:32.120
And you'll see, you
alter your gait.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.420
So when you run in
cushioned running shoes,

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.140
what you typically do is you
go to this heel strike pattern,

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.780
where you strike on your heel,
because there's a big EVA foam

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.140
pad there, and you
roll off to your toe.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.090
What happens when
you run barefoot

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:49.370
is you run more either
on mid-foot or forefoot.

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.340
So you prance along.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:56.117
So think if you're standing
on a block maybe this high.

00:32:56.117 --> 00:32:56.950
And you're barefoot.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:58.390
And you're going to jump off.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.391
Would you land on your heel?

00:33:00.391 --> 00:33:00.890
No.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.019
You'd land on your
forefoot area.

00:33:03.019 --> 00:33:04.810
And that's what it
feels like when you run.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:07.430
And to me, that is the way
we are engineered to run.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.310
It's a much more
natural feeling.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:12.130
We tend to take shorter,
choppier foot strides.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.130
So we alter our gait
in that regard as well.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.540
And we accentuate our arm swing.

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.350
So quicker arm
swing, quicker steps.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.260
Yeah.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.880
What's next?

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.660
Well, I'm hoping
to run a marathon--

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.480
I once ran 50 marathons in
all of the 50 United States

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.730
in 50 consecutive days.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:34.050
And I thought-- do you feel like
running a marathon right now?

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:34.550
Yeah.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:37.240
PAUL CARTLEDGE: And Hawaii
is a little distance

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.600
from the mainland of the states.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.480
DEAN KARNAZES: I swam there.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.938
PAUL CARTLEDGE:
You swam to Hawaii.

00:33:40.938 --> 00:33:42.040
And then you ran there.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.415
DEAN KARNAZES: I thought that
was the ultimate road trip.

00:33:44.415 --> 00:33:47.650
So I want to take that same
footprint, just globally,

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.570
and try to run a
marathon in every country

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.180
of the world in one year.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.630
So that's my plan-- is to
set on a global expedition

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.580
and run a marathon in
every single country.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.600
It sounds like the
ultimate road trip to me.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.040
Uh huh?

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.174
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:07.174 --> 00:34:10.618
So given that you've
accomplished many times

00:34:10.618 --> 00:34:13.844
over something that many of
us will never even attempt

00:34:13.844 --> 00:34:15.639
to accomplish, I
think you probably

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:18.406
have a really interesting
perspective on what is possible

00:34:18.406 --> 00:34:20.030
versus what is not possible.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:23.246
So, one, could you share,
maybe, some of that perspective,

00:34:23.246 --> 00:34:24.870
in terms of how you
think of overcoming

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:29.870
challenges that maybe the
average person would find

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.450
really difficult to overcome.

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:36.174
And two, does everything else
in your life seem really easy?

00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:37.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:40.010
DEAN KARNAZES: Well, the first
time I heard of someone run--

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.020
when someone said I'm
going to run 100 miles,

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.820
I couldn't get my
head around it.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.295
I though, how many
days does it take?

00:34:47.295 --> 00:34:48.420
Where are the camp grounds?

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.429
Where are the hotels?

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:51.639
And he said no.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:54.420
The starting gun goes off
just like at the marathon.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.850
And 100 miles later, you
get to the finish line.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.970
That's how you finish the race.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.840
And it was such an expansive
idea to me, I thought.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.250
I don't even like
driving 100 miles.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.140
How can a human run 100 miles?

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.060
That's impossible.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.370
And then I went out and did it.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.820
And I learned that
a lot of barriers

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.480
are self-constructed-- at least
physical barriers, for me.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.900
They're just barriers that
I've put in my own mind.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.450
If someone had
said to me, the man

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.470
five years before the
man ran 100 miles,

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.570
could you possibly
run 100 miles?

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:31.360
I would say no.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.420
I'm incapable of that.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.820
That'd be completely out of
the realm of possibility.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.240
And then I went and did it.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.622
And I thought, wow,
that was amazing.

00:35:40.622 --> 00:35:43.080
And it proved to me I was better
than what I thought I was.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.690
And I could go further than
what I thought I could.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.000
And I think that lesson
translates into everything

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.500
with life.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:54.810
You can apply that to
education, to your career,

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.120
to interpersonal relationships.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.454
You learn that a lot of things--

00:35:58.454 --> 00:35:59.953
the barriers you
put in front of you

00:35:59.953 --> 00:36:01.500
are just things
that don't really

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.410
exist-- that you've just
conceived them yourself.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:08.922
Does that kind of
address your-- yeah, OK.

00:36:08.922 --> 00:36:10.130
Have you ever run a marathon?

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.776
AUDIENCE: No, only a half.

00:36:12.776 --> 00:36:15.075
I don't think I'll come to full.

00:36:15.075 --> 00:36:18.920
DEAN KARNAZES: Well
I'll tell you what.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.710
The person that finishes
that full marathon will

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.510
be a different person
than the one that

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:26.840
stood at the starting line
that morning before the gun

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.620
went off.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.710
You learn more about yourself
through hardship and struggle

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.880
and adversity than you
do through comfort.

00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:37.440
Uh huh?

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.130
AUDIENCE: Do you follow a
training plan beyond running?

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:42.674
Like do you run to
train for running?

00:36:42.674 --> 00:36:44.965
Or do you also do a whole
bunch of extra cross training

00:36:44.965 --> 00:36:45.506
or something?

00:36:45.506 --> 00:36:48.446
Like how do [INAUDIBLE]
what you do?

00:36:48.446 --> 00:36:50.970
DEAN KARNAZES: Well, I don't
do something most of you

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:51.900
are doing right now.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.610
I never sit down.

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:56.700
So my entire-- sorry.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.212
My entire office has been
converted to standing level.

00:36:59.212 --> 00:37:01.170
It's been that way for
about the last 15 years.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:04.350
So I do all my writing, all my
emails, and everything standing

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:04.860
up--

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.540
typically barefoot,
and typically

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.440
bouncing around on my toes.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.956
I have a pull-up bar in my
office and a sit-up mat.

00:37:10.956 --> 00:37:13.080
And throughout the course
of the day, I have this--

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.340
what's called HIIT training--

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.630
High Intensity
Interval Training.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:21.090
So they're sets of push
ups, pull ups, dips,

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:23.340
and something called burpees.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.230
So it's about a 12
to 15 minute routine.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.160
Your heart rate is very
elevated the entire time.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.010
And I'll do, maybe,
four or five of those

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.550
throughout the course of
the day along with running.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.270
Yeah.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:39.660
And when I'm in a training
block, I'll get up early--

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.070
maybe 3:30 in the
morning-- and I

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.740
like to try to run a
marathon before breakfast.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.094
And so run a marathon,
and then go to work,

00:37:46.094 --> 00:37:47.760
do the HIIT training
throughout the day,

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.800
and then do a shorter--

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.790
maybe 10 or 12 mile
run-- in the afternoon,

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:58.249
like a tempo run or pace
run or hill repeats.

00:37:58.249 --> 00:37:59.540
Does that answer your question?

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.720
AUDIENCE: That's amazing.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.055
PAUL CARTLEDGE: Go to
work on a marathon.

00:38:07.855 --> 00:38:09.765
AUDIENCE: What do
you think about while

00:38:09.765 --> 00:38:11.745
running for such long times?

00:38:11.745 --> 00:38:14.607
And how do you keep
yourself motivated?

00:38:14.607 --> 00:38:16.940
DEAN KARNAZES: So what do you
think about while running,

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.990
and how do you stay motivated?

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.477
Running, I think
about a lot of things.

00:38:21.477 --> 00:38:22.560
And I think about nothing.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.976
The one thing I
like about running

00:38:23.976 --> 00:38:25.980
is I'm a very strong introvert.

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.470
And when I'm running,
I can just kind of

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:31.260
put the world in
perspective and kind of

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.670
be alone with
myself for a while,

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:36.040
just to work things
through and to think.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.070
I also listen to audio books.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:42.690
So I've got about 500
audio books on my playlist.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:45.380
I listen to probably two
or three books a week

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.040
just while I'm running.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.030
Yeah.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:50.790
And how do I stay motivated?

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.670
I always take on new challenges.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:56.700
So if I told you what I've
done in the last month,

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.430
I've run a marathon
every single weekend

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.460
on three different
continents in the last month.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.280
I fly from here to
Lisbon, Portugal.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.720
I'm going to run.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.270
And then on Saturday, I
fly to Washington, DC.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.240
I've got a 50 mile run.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.820
That night, I'm taking
a red-eye to California.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.940
And I have the Big Sur
Marathon on Sunday.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.290
So, I love my craft.

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:22.030
I love what I do.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:23.144
I get to see the world.

00:39:23.144 --> 00:39:24.310
And that keeps me motivated.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:25.950
But it's a very
different reality

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:31.090
than someone living in London
with a day job training,

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.067
especially in the winter.

00:39:33.067 --> 00:39:34.650
And that's why I
don't live in London.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:35.970
I don't know how you do it.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:36.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.170
Respect.

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:45.324
AUDIENCE: How do you recover?

00:39:45.324 --> 00:39:49.069
Or do you actually
let your body recover?

00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:50.860
DEAN KARNAZES: Recovery
is overrated, yeah.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.728
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.115
I don't stretch.

00:39:56.115 --> 00:39:56.990
I don't get massages.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:58.390
I don't use a foam roller.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:02.960
Yeah.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.820
Yeah.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.980
I guess which recovery
is kind of relative.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.260
When I'm flying, I can't
think about recovery.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.960
Because I'm flying so much.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.830
It's

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:19.150
The finish line for me is
still another three weeks away.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.900
Because I've got the
same sort of schedule

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.070
for three more weeks.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:24.790
And then I'll rest
for a day or two.

00:40:30.778 --> 00:40:34.494
AUDIENCE: Why all the running?

00:40:34.494 --> 00:40:38.330
DEAN KARNAZES: Well, you saw
where my ancestors come from.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.040
Maybe I'm just a
modern-day hemerodromoi.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.715
PAUL CARTLEDGE: Tell them about
Ikaria on your mother's side,

00:40:43.715 --> 00:40:47.360
because they might
not know about that.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.980
DEAN KARNAZES: Does anyone
know about the Blue Zones?

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.570
The Blue Zones are these
areas of the world where

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.940
the indigenous
population lived to be

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.430
the oldest and the healthiest.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:02.200
And my father is from mainland
Greece, the Peloponnese

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.420
Arcadia.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.170
PAUL CARTLEDGE:
Where Pan came from.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.040
DEAN KARNAZES:
Yeah, pandemonium.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.206
PAUL CARTLEDGE: Pandemonium.

00:41:08.206 --> 00:41:11.180
DEAN KARNAZES: And my mother is
from this island called Ikaria,

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.650
which is where Icarus--

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.300
the guy with the waxwings--

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.100
crash landed-- the boy.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.950
And in Ikaria, they
have more centenarians

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:22.640
in any place on Earth-- so more
people that lived to be 100.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.500
And I've been there
a couple of times.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.170
And I've gone up into these
villages up in the mountains.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:29.420
And these people are amazing.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.500
I remember speaking
to this woman.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.680
She was 104 years old.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.660
And she was an entrepreneur.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.120
But she was very disappointed.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.760
And I said, what's the matter?

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:45.050
She said, well, I walked
three miles down to the bank

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:47.990
to get a loan to
build my business.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:50.240
And the bank said, we're sorry.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.210
We have a policy.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.650
We don't loan money
to people over 103.

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:55.386
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:55.386 --> 00:41:57.911
So I walk three miles
back up to my house.

00:41:57.911 --> 00:41:58.910
And now I have no money.

00:42:05.176 --> 00:42:08.300
SPEAKER: I think
we are out of time.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.984
We are out of time.
