00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:14.146
<i> Barton: The guiding hand of
 natural selection in our world</i>

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:16.549
<i> is quite firmly
 holding a fork.</i>

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:20.186
<i> How we eat largely describes
 how this world is used.</i>

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:23.756
<i> Food nourishes a lot more
 than just our bodies.</i>

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:26.058
<i> It creates community
 and brings us together</i>

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:30.563
<i> and it certainly nourishes
 our soul and brings us health.</i>

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:34.366
<i> Not only does food describe
 to a great extent,</i>

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.303
<i> the biology of our existence
 here but through food</i>

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.340
<i> we are able to write the
 biography of our existence.</i>

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:46.278
( applause )

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:48.147
Barton Seaver: So, the first
thing we want to start off with

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:51.283
is just basic stories of
sort of restaurant madness.

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.887
Now restaurants are
a difficult business.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.522 line:0%
Each and every single
one of us in this industry

00:00:56.522 --> 00:01:00.693 line:0%
have experienced our
fair share of ridiculousness.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:04.163
What sort of stories would you
like to share with us?

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:06.599
Jamie Leeds: Well, actually I,
when I first opened

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.501
Hank's Oyster Bar in Dupont,

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.369 line:0%
you know,
I wanted to open a restaurant

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.504 line:0%
that was small enough
where I could do

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:14.774 line:0%
pretty much everything myself.

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.642
<i> In our first couple of weeks
 being open,</i>

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:20.346
<i> we were very busy
 and my manager quit,</i>

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.049
<i> and two of my shuckers
 didn't show up for work</i>

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.249
<i> on Saturday night.</i>

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:26.553
I have to cook the line,
I have to expedite,

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:30.122
I'm going to have to
seat people, and I am going
to have to shuck.

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:32.324
And I am thinking
'what was I thinking?'

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.826
( laughter )

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:38.965
So, fortunately, a guy named
Tony walked in the door,

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:43.269
looking for a job. Not only
was he looking for a job

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.139
he could start that night
( laughter )

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.475
and he was a shucker!
( laughter continues )

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:52.211
So, It was like
a dream come true.

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:55.481
So, you know, from
one extreme to the next,

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:58.217
and that's how the restaurant
business is for me.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:01:59.953
Michael Curtin: I think what
Jamie is saying

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.755
is in that business,
and I think you have to be,

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.123
those of you out there
that are in it,

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.524 line:0%
know that you have to be
a little crazy

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:07.092 line:0%
to get in in the first place.

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:10.396 line:0%
Right? And you work
really hard to be lucky.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.665
Like Jamie felt
she was that night

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.367
but she had worked
really hard.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.936
But I think that is something
that we all share.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:20.439
When I had worked for a
dozen years to get to a point

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.041
where I was going to open up
my own restaurant

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.277
and I thought this was
the culmination of my career

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:28.014
and this was, it was going to be
easy from here on out. Right?

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.985
I refer to my four plus
years now

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.653
owning and operating
my own restaurant

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.789
as my first experience in the
non-profit sector. ( laughter )

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.759
Before I got to the kitchen
but, the thing that,

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:42.528
the recurring thought
that I had everyday

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:43.663
when I woke up was

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.732
'whose job am I
going to do today?

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.867
Am I going to be waiting tables?
am I going to be tending bar?

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.369
am I going to be cooking?'

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.238
But the beauty of it was,
it was all about that

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.972
creating that community
and that service.

00:02:53.972 --> 00:02:57.076
And so whatever job you are
doing had meaning and importance

00:02:57.076 --> 00:03:00.646
and, it brought something else
to other people

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:01.980
and I think
that's a common theme

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.849
that we'll probably talk
about a lot tonight.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.985
But certainly,
we use through food,

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.022
in the power of community
that it creates.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.225 line:0%
Rock Harper: I remember at
B. Smith's one year,

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:15.828 line:0%
busiest weekend of the year
is Mother's Day weekend

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:17.830 line:0%
with Mother's Day
on Sunday, of course

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.732
and all the graduations.

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:22.401
My pastry chef,
her daughter,

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.803
her children worked there,

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:26.272
her husband
was the food runner,

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:30.476
her daughter-in-law was,
it was like seven of them

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.478
that... were in my kitchen,
out of 27 people.

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.280
So, that's a
significant amount.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.882
Saturday morning,
busiest weekend of my life,

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:40.052
that year,
they weren't there.

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:43.422
I found out that it was
because their visas had expired

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:47.760
and what we did, I spent
a quite a bit of money

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.629
and time at Costco that
morning and that weekend.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.732
And, I got to tell you, they got
some great chocolate cake

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:56.535
and some nice rolls.
( laughter )

00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:58.571
I am telling you!
It was a southern restaurant

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:02.608
and so rolls, corn bread,
huge for us

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:05.644
and, I, you know,
people didn't miss a beat!

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:07.913
I mean all those people,
they had no idea.

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:09.615
We got compliments and
we kept Costco

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:13.352
until we replaced the sous chef
but I mean, you know.

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:17.156
We did, and I got to be honest
with you, Costco doesn't,

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:21.527
we'll talk about
preservatives and sustainability
and GMOs, but...

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:22.962
They do an excellent
corn bread!

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.530
Everything,
they do a great corn bread!

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.033
I don't know what's in it.
( laughter )

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.336
Sorry, Barton, sorry.
I know that doesn't

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:34.273
fit in with your
whole shtick, but...

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:35.474
I am sorry.
I had to do what I had to do.

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:37.242
- It takes all kinds.
- Five minutes in and

00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:39.879
we are already off the rails.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.748
That really proved something
to me and my cooks at work,

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:44.984
the people that really
hung in there with me.

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.919
It was, you know,
I slept there that night

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.322
and I opened up the next.
All three nights,

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:52.258
I slept in my office.
My wife was not happy.

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:54.594
But I did it,
and I was proud of myself.

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:57.296
I am still. I love that...
I love it because

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:58.964
I know I can do it. And if

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:01.467
another pastry chef decides
she wants to

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.970
you know, her visa expires,
I can do it again.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.573
And I had one time
when I was running Hook,

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:08.941
we were really known
for serving

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.310
a huge diversity of seafood.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.845
We had a lot of
different fishermen

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:13.980
that we just dealt with.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.348
And, if you catch it,
we'll buy it, you know.

00:05:16.348 --> 00:05:18.718
That's great. We had more
Audubon guides

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:20.752
in my kitchen than we had
cookbooks because every day

00:05:20.752 --> 00:05:21.887
I had to figure out just
what the hell it

00:05:21.887 --> 00:05:23.422
was that I was serving.

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:26.892
And, one day
we had 600 reservations

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:29.028
on the books, Thursday night,
I mean, we were busy.

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:31.397
I was already stressed out,
the fish didn't come.

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:33.365
So finally the box
shows up

00:05:33.365 --> 00:05:36.435
and I call up my fish purveyor
and I was like, 'Michael,

00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:38.237
what exactly did
you send me?'

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:41.140
My language was of course
perfectly gentlemanly,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.607
proper and prim.

00:05:42.607 --> 00:05:43.909
And he said,
"Well, you know,

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.311
we had a bad day of fishing

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:48.847
but, you know, I didn't want to
leave you in the lurch, so,

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:50.583
we just sent you
all the left over bait.

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:51.851
I hope you can do
something with it".

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.954
- Jamie: Oh my God!
- ( laughter )

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:56.055
Oh my...

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:59.024
Pulled all my cooks off
the line and hey!

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:00.827
You know, flying fish!

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:03.129
Why not, we can, we can work
with this, you know,

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.963
filleting fish is already
an art form!

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:07.066
Why not throw a winged bone
structure to it.

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:08.468
No problem!

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:09.568
You know what
I told my servers?

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:11.069
I told them the absolute truth.

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.040
I took that flying fish,
filleted it up,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.042
little bit of tarragon,
lemon zest, olive oil,

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:19.812
rolled it up like rollmops,
rosemary skewered it,

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:22.582
two little things smoldered it
over an orchard wood fire,

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:26.018
250 smoky, sexy,
seductive degrees,

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:29.422
put it over Vidalia onion
and juniper broth

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:31.056
into which was
braised zucchini

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:33.125
and summer squash, laid it
there with a little bit of

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:34.293
herb salad on top of it.

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:37.730
I hope you all have had
dinner already.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.666
We sold out of flying fish
that night by seven o'clock.

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:43.636
And to this day
I still have people asking me

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.905
'Hey, when are you getting
more flying fish?'

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.341
I can't even get the fishermen
to send it to us but

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:50.609
the next topic
that I sort of want to get on,

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:53.078
because we are in the
midst of celebrity here,

00:06:53.078 --> 00:06:56.382
is the rise of the
celebrity food culture.

00:06:56.382 --> 00:07:00.820
And this has radically altered
the shape and nature

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.889
of our industry and
I want to point out first off

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:08.127
that Rock has really been one
early adopters of this

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:09.929
who has really been able to
take advantage of it.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:13.065
But also then to talk about how
this has changed our industry.

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:15.501
What it has done is given us
a larger voice,

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:21.040
so we have heroes
that can work at Harvard.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.275
I mean
that's pretty freaking cool.

00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:28.080
And talk about food and
how it impacts the globe

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.016
and how we can sort of
take this thing back

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:31.583
and really have some
huge impact.

00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:33.185
And 15 years ago,

00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:35.188
you tell someone that you
made something with cilantro,

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:37.289
they were amazed.
Now it's just like, listen,

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:41.527
I got an immersion circulator
in my basement, buddy.

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:43.095
When you come out
to the table

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:44.964
you better talk about to me
some real food.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.732
People are more educated,

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.268
they are informed,
they are empowered.

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:51.370
So, that's the one thing
I appreciate

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.972
and I am
extremely grateful for,

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:56.442
about the television aspect is
that it has given us a voice.

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:58.243
And now what we do
with that voice

00:07:58.243 --> 00:08:01.747
once we get on the stage
is totally up to us.

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.982
Michael: What's fascinating
for us at the kitchen, is,

00:08:03.982 --> 00:08:05.951
<i> I think,
 it's very fair to say that</i>

00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:08.954
<i> the kitchen was really built
 on the back of</i>

00:08:08.954 --> 00:08:10.889
<i> hospitality industry,
 restaurants,</i>

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:13.158
<i> in particular chefs.
 That's really how</i>

00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:15.628
<i> the whole thing started
 and if it wasn't for the</i>

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:18.697
<i> incredible support of that
 community and the belief</i>

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:20.832
<i> in what we were trying to
 create at that time,</i>

00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:23.235
<i> we would not be where
 we are now.</i>

00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:26.672
<i> And what's been incredibly
 rewarding for us</i>

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:30.810
<i> is to see these chefs,
 as their celebrity has grown</i>

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.479
<i> so too has their commitment
 to the community</i>

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:35.414
to really create good,

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:37.949
to create change
in the community in a way

00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:40.019
that I think benefits us all.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:42.521
Barton: My interview process,
you know, I'd ask

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:45.090
potential cooks
to cook something.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.793
Right? That's a pretty
reasonable expectation.

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.862
I was getting kids cooking

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:53.465
deconstructed beef stew with
sous vide beef with

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:57.169
carrot foam and
celery gelée and onions,

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:58.837
a spectre of onions!

00:08:58.837 --> 00:09:00.072
Jamie: Real food.

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:01.940
I was like 'What?
What is this? Wait.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.910
Do you know
how to construct beef stew?'

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.116
Not that there is not value
in that food

00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:13.953
but it's sort of all based
on foundation

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:18.123
and I found that,
that could be a detriment

00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:20.425
and sort of that willingness
to step over

00:09:20.425 --> 00:09:24.029
some of the such
fundamental processes of

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:25.831
building beef stew

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:28.300
before you learn
how to deconstruct it.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.370
Along those same lines,
chefs in the limelight

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.838
really have the opportunity

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:35.207
to create
incredible influence.

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:39.578
And I think the ultimate food
hero, Alice Waters.

00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:41.613
<i> 40 years ago, Alice Waters</i>

00:09:41.613 --> 00:09:43.816
<i> began to ask
 a simple question,</i>

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.750
"what is the food
that we are eating,

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.153
and what is it
doing to us?

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:49.722
What is it doing
to our community?"

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:53.225
And I think that's a question
that has certainly influenced

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:54.927
each and every person
on this stage

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:57.830
and I would love to ask
each of you to speak to

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.498
how she has influenced us

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:03.935
and how you in your own way have
sort of carried on that work.

00:10:03.935 --> 00:10:06.204
So, what I do is,

00:10:06.204 --> 00:10:08.607
I work very closely
with my oyster farmers.

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:11.043
We sell, we go through

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:12.811
thousands and thousands
of oysters a week

00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:16.014
and I offer six different
kinds of oysters every night.

00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:17.115
We change them every night.

00:10:17.115 --> 00:10:19.518
So, I have a lot of
different oyster farmers,

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:21.887
there are
a lot of local farmers,

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:25.090
small farmers that farm
just specifically for me.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.492
So, for me, she has
influenced me in that way

00:10:27.492 --> 00:10:31.363
where I am really looking
at the local product

00:10:31.363 --> 00:10:34.900
and trying to maintain
a sustainable

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:39.805
product and the fish, we try
to always use local fish

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:41.773
as much as we can.

00:10:41.773 --> 00:10:44.844
Abide by the Monterey Bay
seafood Aquarium

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:47.146
guidelines for
sustainable fish,

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:49.648
which I think is
very important.

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:53.919
At one point in my career
it was just like, listen,

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:55.421
people want steak,

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:57.056
they want steak,
they want beef,

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:58.523
they want chicken,
they don't care

00:10:58.523 --> 00:10:59.992
where it's coming from.

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:01.460
I don't want to hear that.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.631
Then, I am like,
'whoa, Monsanto is nuts.'

00:11:06.131 --> 00:11:08.300
I am not serving any of that

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.305
and I have done a lot of stuff
with the, Pew Charitable Trust,

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:16.708
antibiotic free and organic
and so I teetered.

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:19.511
And now, right now,
where I am now,

00:11:19.511 --> 00:11:22.314
I was speaking about
buying organic.

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:24.950
I was in a greater
Southeast Hospital

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.219
and speaking to people that

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.754
you know, food stamps
are being cut

00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:30.889
and talking about health week,
I was promoting my book,

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:32.258
and talking about
healthy cooking for kids.

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:34.192
They bought a
bunch of my books

00:11:34.192 --> 00:11:37.329
and I went to, because
I was out of butternut squash,

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:39.965
I went to the 'yes organic'

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:42.434
or one of the organic,
right on Pennsylvania Avenue,

00:11:42.434 --> 00:11:44.036
east of the river

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:49.341
and butternut squash was
like $8 for four ounces.

00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:51.143
And I went back to this demo

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:53.645
and I'm just like,
'you know what,

00:11:53.645 --> 00:11:57.182
you know, ok, we got to relax
for a moment here.'

00:11:57.182 --> 00:11:59.651
Local, local, local,
it's great, awesome,

00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:01.954
but we can have strawberries,
California strawberries

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:03.222
because of advances in

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:04.757
transportation and
refrigeration.

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:08.026
and things of that nature
and it's not a horrible thing.

00:12:08.026 --> 00:12:09.995
I know it can you know,
carbon foot print,

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:11.763
I get all of that jazz.

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:14.466
But we have made
probably scientists are like

00:12:14.466 --> 00:12:17.603
hey, you know,
we changed the world.

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:20.072
So I'm sort of, we have to
do it responsibly.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:21.974
And I know I'm, you know,
you're probably like,

00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:24.276
Barton's over there like,
'I am going to beat this guy up

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:26.511
when we get back to the
green room ( laughter )

00:12:26.511 --> 00:12:29.882
But I think that, I am saying,
you know,

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:32.151
I feel like we got to feed
a bunch of people.

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:35.120
and Americans, or people
in general need to eat,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.856
like to eat at the kitchen.

00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:39.224
Being the director of the
kitchen operations for

00:12:39.224 --> 00:12:41.794
a little bit am I going to say,
you know,

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:45.030
'no thank you' to
5000 pounds of ground beef

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.568
from a beef grower in Texas
that had an overrun?

00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:52.570
No. Because we got
5000 people to feed.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.674
I wish I could serve organic
beef and chicken all the time

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:59.110
but you all aren't paying
$42 for a chicken sandwich

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.345
at my restaurant.

00:13:00.345 --> 00:13:04.149
So, I think Rock is right
that it it's all about balance.

00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:06.318
We started a couple of
years ago a program

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:08.754
where we're putting local,
alright not local

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:11.356
but fresh fruits and
vegetables,

00:13:11.356 --> 00:13:13.692
whole vegetables,
value-added cut products

00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:16.395
into corner stores
in the city's food deserts.

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:18.597
We are servicing
64 corner stores

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:20.999
now mostly in wards seven
and eight east of the river.

00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:24.035
And sales are increasing
every month in these stores,

00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:26.438
where people thought
that would not happen.

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:27.973
You know, people would say,

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:30.342
'those people won't buy
fresh fruits and vegetables'.

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:32.411
Well, if they are not
on the shelves,

00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:33.979
they will be right
100 percent of the time.

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:35.581
No one will buy that

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:37.415
no one will buy
what's not there.

00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:40.118
And I was so excited
to tell Alice about this

00:13:40.118 --> 00:13:41.653
when I saw her last January.

00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:43.855
I just thought
she would be thrilled

00:13:43.855 --> 00:13:45.257
that this was happening.

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:48.293
And without missing a beat
she turns around and says,

00:13:48.293 --> 00:13:50.829
'And now we have to
make it all organic.'

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:52.230
You are killing me!

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.802
It's that, that is
It's an admirable goal to be,

00:13:56.802 --> 00:13:58.637
to go towards but a lot of

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:00.905
what we're buying locally
isn't organic.

00:14:00.905 --> 00:14:04.109
And we certainly want to create
opportunities not only here

00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:05.810
in the urban community
but extend

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.880
that to the rural communities
that we are supporting

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.414
through this local
purchasing program.

00:14:09.414 --> 00:14:11.216
So, again I think its balance

00:14:11.216 --> 00:14:14.419
and really figuring out
your impact

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:15.820
in the community.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.590
When I was just starting off
I was, you know,

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.291
passionate young man,
I loved food,

00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:23.228
I was travelling
all over the world and

00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:26.765
you know, just loved food.
I mean, it was fun.

00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:30.502
And then I was presented
the opportunity to take--

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:33.505
go run Café Saint-Ex
over on 14th street.

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:35.407
So, I got on the phone,
'send me striped bass,

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:36.775
send me blue fish,
I want oysters,

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:38.444
I want blue crab, woo-hoo!

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:42.648
This is going to be fabulous and
the guy on the other line said,

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:45.016
'Kid,
what are you talking about?

00:14:45.016 --> 00:14:46.785
We ate all those.

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:48.354
What else do you want?'

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:50.155
I realized right then and
there the guiding hand

00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:51.557
of natural selection in
our world

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.458
is quite firmly
holding a fork.

00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:55.260
And the way that we eat
largely describes

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.162
how this world is used.

00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:59.998
And so I set off in my career
to really think about

00:14:59.998 --> 00:15:02.368
how I as a chef,
as an individual

00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:04.369
buying one case of
organic chicken,

00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:07.072
buying one fish that
was new and different

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.641
and interesting, that
flying fish whatever it was,

00:15:09.641 --> 00:15:12.044
how we could have an impact
on our community.

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:14.880
How I could have an impact
directly on the oceans.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.515
But also just in terms of

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:18.784
revitalization
of neighborhoods.

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:20.485
We are not just talking about
the environments

00:15:20.485 --> 00:15:23.755
that sustains us,
but also the neighborhoods

00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:24.957
in which we live.

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:26.959
The neighborhoods
that sustain us.

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:29.594
You know this really is
almost the redemption

00:15:29.594 --> 00:15:30.862
of neighborhoods.

00:15:30.862 --> 00:15:33.132
I am sure there's issues
with gentrification

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:35.767
and other political issues
as well but

00:15:35.767 --> 00:15:37.469
there's really
a huge opportunity here

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:39.638
and that's what
I want to close on.

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:42.074
When I was First Chef
at Café Saint-Ex,

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:44.443
a man named Robert Egger
walked into my restaurant,

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:45.944
introduced himself.
And he said,

00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:49.614
'Hey! We are neighbors.
And wanted to meet you.'

00:15:49.614 --> 00:15:51.883
He was the founder of
DC Central Kitchen.

00:15:51.883 --> 00:15:54.352
In the course of 20 minutes
he convinced me

00:15:54.352 --> 00:15:57.489
that a chef is more than
just the sum of the ingredients

00:15:57.489 --> 00:15:59.691
that he or she puts
on the table.

00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:03.128
That a chef can be more,
the chef can be part
of a community.

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:05.797
A chef can be uplifting,
revitalizing

00:16:05.797 --> 00:16:09.101
and can bring opportunity
to those people

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:11.637
everywhere around us,
not just those we serve.

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:14.673
And that's what got me
introduced

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.742
to DC Central Kitchen.

00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:21.613
<i> I've went as far as taking
 everything from my family.</i>

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:25.484
<i> I've held people up
 at gun point.</i>

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:27.952
<i> But you know,
 I had decided in my life that</i>

00:16:27.952 --> 00:16:31.223
<i>I didn't want to live like that
 anymore. I was just tired.</i>

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:34.559
44 years old, I had been
doing drugs for 32 years,

00:16:34.559 --> 00:16:36.995
I smoked crack for 23.

00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:39.097
I've had two heart attacks.

00:16:39.097 --> 00:16:41.933
<i> I just decided that, you know,
 enough was enough.</i>

00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:44.503
In other words this is like
a second chance for me

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:47.406
to get my life back
and I will do so.

00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:51.877
<i> First day of every class,</i>

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:54.179
<i> you look out at the men and
 women who are coming in.</i>

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.981
<i> And they can look
 as hard as nails.</i>

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:57.549
<i> You know,
 but it's just a mask,</i>

00:16:57.549 --> 00:17:00.151
<i> they're terrified of
 what's ahead.</i>

00:17:00.151 --> 00:17:01.986
Hey, welcome everybody

00:17:01.986 --> 00:17:04.623
this is going to be the
21st anniversary

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:06.224
of the kitchen this week.

00:17:06.224 --> 00:17:08.660
<i> So much of what we do</i>

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.130
<i> in America in charity is about
 the redemption of the giver</i>

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.132
<i> not the liberation
 of the receiver.</i>

00:17:15.133 --> 00:17:17.669
<i> We wanted to turn it around
 so that everybody</i>

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:19.338
got liberated.

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:21.540
And that's what the kitchen
is about every day.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.908
<i> Everybody who comes in here
 gets served.</i>

00:17:23.908 --> 00:17:25.177
<i> Everybody!</i>

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:28.881
( music )

00:17:37.822 --> 00:17:39.724
Woman:<i> This is the
 first time in my life</i>

00:17:39.724 --> 00:17:43.361
<i> that I actually came and
 done something with myself.</i>

00:17:43.361 --> 00:17:46.164
<i> I am a changed person.</i>

00:17:46.164 --> 00:17:48.833
<i> And this little bit of time,</i>

00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:50.235
( sobbing )

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:53.872
my family they love me.

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:55.441
But they welcome me now!

00:17:56.775 --> 00:18:02.381
<i> And all blessings are coming
 to me that I cannot believe:</i>

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:05.150
<i> People,</i>

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.554
<i> places, things for me,</i>

00:18:11.089 --> 00:18:12.624
<i> for me.</i>

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:27.773
Barton: So with that I would
like Michael to talk about

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.841
what DC Central Kitchen is

00:18:29.841 --> 00:18:31.476
and some of the opportunities
it presents.

00:18:31.476 --> 00:18:33.979
Well, thank you Barton,

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:37.181
again for allowing the kitchen
to be part of this.

00:18:37.181 --> 00:18:40.152
I think we are
so incredibly blessed

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:43.288
again to be part of this
community.

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:44.990
We are serving close to

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.193
12,000 meals a day,
in this city.

00:18:49.527 --> 00:18:50.962
But we could be serving

00:18:50.962 --> 00:18:55.366
30, 40, 50, 60,
70 thousand meals a day.

00:18:55.366 --> 00:18:58.069
And people will still be
hungry tomorrow.

00:18:58.069 --> 00:19:03.075
What the kitchen is about
and what we are using food

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:07.212
as a catalyst for
is to create opportunity.

00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:09.914
To put people in a place

00:19:09.914 --> 00:19:15.553
to break this incredibly
destructive generational cycle

00:19:15.553 --> 00:19:19.458
of violence, addiction,
incarceration,

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:22.527
hunger, homelessness,
and ultimately poverty.

00:19:22.527 --> 00:19:26.565
And we just started our 98th
culinary job training class.

00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:29.067
Since the recession hit
in 2008,

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:31.603
we've graduated over
600 men and women,

00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:34.906
formally unemployed and homeless
who are now employed

00:19:34.906 --> 00:19:38.609
in the city's restaurants,
hotels, catering operations,

00:19:38.609 --> 00:19:41.779
institutional food systems.
You go to the museum downtown,

00:19:41.779 --> 00:19:43.648
you are going to see
one of our graduates.

00:19:43.648 --> 00:19:46.051
We have graduates
working at the NIH,

00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:48.953
in law firms around town,
in schools.

00:19:48.953 --> 00:19:51.489
<i> Now, they are part
 of this community</i>

00:19:51.489 --> 00:19:54.625
<i> in a very powerful
 and economic way.</i>

00:19:54.625 --> 00:19:57.496
<i> Many of these men and women
 that you saw in that video</i>

00:19:57.496 --> 00:20:01.766
cost this city millions and
millions of dollars

00:20:01.766 --> 00:20:06.571
in incarceration costs,
halfway house visits stays,

00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:10.374
shelter stays and what
we are trying to show is that

00:20:10.374 --> 00:20:13.845
with just a small investment,
not charity,

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:18.750
investment in this community
using food as that tool

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.586
we can create
economic opportunity

00:20:21.586 --> 00:20:24.422
and economic growth
and inclusion,

00:20:24.422 --> 00:20:28.860
inclusion for a vast majority

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.496
of the men and women
that want to be part

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:32.897
of this community.

00:20:32.897 --> 00:20:37.035
It costs $44,000 a year
to incarcerate someone in DC.

00:20:37.035 --> 00:20:40.438
It costs $12,000
to train them once.

00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:43.374
At which point they
become contributing

00:20:43.374 --> 00:20:45.410
members of the tax-base.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.979
They will take themselves out
of the welfare net of the city

00:20:47.979 --> 00:20:50.715
and actually begin
to contribute to it.

00:20:50.715 --> 00:20:54.019
For a $12,000 investment,
you get all of that, in return.

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:57.155
And that's the redemption story
but there's also the opportunity

00:20:57.155 --> 00:20:59.957
to prevent that and that's what
Central Kitchen has really

00:20:59.957 --> 00:21:03.061
moved on to and that's
what this video is about here.

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:11.970
Good morning. Welcome to
Shenandoah Valley

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.338
produce auction.

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:18.443
Good morning gentlemen,
how's everybody?

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:19.778
<i> Good!</i>

00:21:22.046 --> 00:21:23.615
<i> I never thought
 in my wildest dreams</i>

00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:25.283
<i> that I'd be doing
 what I am doing right now.</i>

00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:28.520
Transformation from destroying
lives to helping lives.

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:53.144 line:0%
<i> In 2007, I was on the streets,
 selling drugs.</i>

00:21:53.144 --> 00:21:57.415
<i> Two of my friends had just got
 killed and I escaped death.</i>

00:21:57.415 --> 00:21:59.784
<i> So I wanted
 another chance at life.</i>

00:21:59.784 --> 00:22:01.987
I seeked help with
DC Central Kitchen.

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:05.890
<i> I graduated from their
 Culinary Art program.</i>

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.525
<i> I'm here now at
 a school called</i>

00:22:07.525 --> 00:22:09.127
<i> Washington Jesuit Academy.</i>

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:11.496
<i> I am the sous-chef,</i>

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:13.331
making beautiful meals
for kids.

00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:15.667
This is something that
I always wanted to do,

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:17.102
work with kids.

00:22:32.917 --> 00:22:37.455
( auctioneer speaking )

00:22:37.455 --> 00:22:43.294
The auction this year has
roughly 450 registered growers

00:22:43.828 --> 00:22:46.297
<i> and on the buyer side
 we're probably</i>

00:22:46.297 --> 00:22:48.800
<i> up in the eight hundreds.</i>

00:22:49.734 --> 00:22:52.036
<i> DC Central Kitchen is
 very important</i>

00:22:52.036 --> 00:22:53.905
to the auction here because

00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:57.242
<i> they are one of our
 largest purchasers.</i>

00:22:57.242 --> 00:22:59.244
<i> I believe in what
 we do because</i>

00:22:59.244 --> 00:23:01.645
<i> it's just providing
 a good product,</i>

00:23:01.645 --> 00:23:04.349
<i> that's healthful and fresh,</i>

00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:07.819
it's not harvested
too far ahead of time

00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:11.622
<i> We feel very grateful that
 DC Central Kitchen</i>

00:23:11.622 --> 00:23:13.924
<i> wants to be a part
 of the produce auction</i>

00:23:13.924 --> 00:23:16.728
<i> and buy the fresh
 local produce from us.</i>

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:21.199
<i> If we can change
 somebody's life in the city,</i>

00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:23.235
<i> we are pleased
 to be a part of that.</i>

00:23:31.609 --> 00:23:32.710
<i> Look at what we do.</i>

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.613
<i> We feed kids
 healthy meals everyday.</i>

00:23:35.613 --> 00:23:39.884
<i> 3500 DC public school kids.</i>

00:23:39.884 --> 00:23:42.354
<i> Some of these kids, man,
 when they go home,</i>

00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:44.355
they're not getting meals.

00:23:44.355 --> 00:23:47.358
<i> At least they know
 when they come to school</i>

00:23:47.358 --> 00:23:49.961
<i> they're going to
 receive a good meal.</i>

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:53.764
Food here is always healthy
and is always good.

00:23:53.764 --> 00:23:56.601
<i> I always have a salad,
 vegetables.</i>

00:23:56.601 --> 00:24:00.572
I always have something
like calcium, protein.

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:01.907
How do you feel about it,
Cameron?

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:03.809
I feel great.
I love the fruit,

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:07.278
because every time we get
a fruit with every meal.

00:24:07.278 --> 00:24:09.648
Mmm, I love my apple!

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:12.783
I like to have a good meal
before I go to class,

00:24:12.783 --> 00:24:17.922
so I can be on task, I can be
ready to start my day.

00:24:17.922 --> 00:24:20.358
How do you like
the vegetables and the fruit?

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:23.928
the collard greens are a little
spicy and the pear's good.

00:24:23.928 --> 00:24:25.797
Their food is good, right?

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:29.100
My, man.
What's going on, Slim?

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.102
DC Central Kitchen
has changed my life

00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:33.437
and in the process I am
changing these kids' lives.

00:24:33.437 --> 00:24:37.542
( chatter )

00:24:45.249 --> 00:24:46.450
My name is Howard Thomas

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.420
and I am a graduate of
DC Central Kitchen.

00:24:54.125 --> 00:24:56.027
My name is Dennis Showalter

00:24:56.027 --> 00:24:59.030
and I am the manager here
at the auction.

00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:02.067
But only a small part
of the picture.

00:25:11.309 --> 00:25:13.778
<i> DC Central Kitchen is...</i>

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:15.547
Is the bomb!

00:25:18.716 --> 00:25:21.919
It is though. DC Central
Kitchen is the bomb.

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:24.889
In restaurants,
food preparation is...

00:25:24.889 --> 00:25:27.558
it's an honorable pursuit.
It's a pursuit...

00:25:27.558 --> 00:25:29.327
It's a human pursuit.

00:25:29.327 --> 00:25:32.363
Not only does food
describe to a great extent

00:25:32.363 --> 00:25:34.966
the biology of our
existence here but

00:25:34.966 --> 00:25:36.635
through food
we are able to write

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:38.402
the biography
of our existence,

00:25:38.402 --> 00:25:40.671
here as individuals and
as a community.

00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:43.407
It's an honor to serve you
in restaurants.

00:25:43.407 --> 00:25:46.444
It's an honor to create
community through restaurants.

00:25:46.444 --> 00:25:48.379
And especially
it's been an honor to share

00:25:48.379 --> 00:25:50.114
an evening with you
here tonight.

00:25:50.114 --> 00:25:52.216
So thank you all very much.
Appreciate it.

00:25:52.216 --> 00:25:54.386
( applause )

00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:57.789
( outro music )
