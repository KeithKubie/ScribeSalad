00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.880
We're asked to determine the
amplitude and the period of y

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.835
equals negative
1/2 cosine of 3x.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:10.210
So the first thing
we have to ask

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.300
ourselves is, what does
amplitude even refer to?

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.220
Well the amplitude of
a periodic function

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.180
is just half the difference
between the minimum and maximum

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.360
values it takes on.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.040
So if I were to draw a
periodic function like this,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.106
and it would just go back
and forth between two--

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:30.605
let me draw it a
little bit neater--

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:34.630
it goes back and forth
between two values like that.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.260
So between that
value and that value.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.890
You take the difference between
the two, and half of that

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.939
is the amplitude.

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:42.730
Another way of thinking
about the amplitude

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.760
is how much does it sway
from its middle position.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.700
Right over here,
we have y equals

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.810
negative 1/2 cosine of 3x.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.790
So what is going to be
the amplitude of this?

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.930
Well, the easy way
to think about it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.040
is just what is multiplying
the cosine function.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.140
And you could do the same thing
if it was a sine function.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.800
We have negative
1/2 multiplying it.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.280
So the amplitude
in this situation

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.450
is going to be the absolute
value of negative 1/2,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.350
which is equal to 1/2.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.970
And you might say, well, why
do I not care about the sign?

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.740
Why do I take the
absolute value of it?

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.310
Well, the negative just
flips the function around.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.920
It's not going to
change how much it

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.734
sways between its minimum
and maximum position.

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:40.400
The other thing is,
well, how is it just

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.840
simply the absolute
value of this thing?

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.540
And to realize the
y, you just have

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.630
to remember that a cosine
function or a sine function

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.070
varies between positive
1 and negative 1,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.610
if it's just a simple function.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.070
So this is just multiplying
that positive 1 or negative 1.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.414
And so if normally
the amplitude,

00:01:57.414 --> 00:01:59.080
if you didn't have
any coefficient here,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.460
if the coefficient was
positive or negative 1,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.440
the amplitude would just be 1.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.950
Now, you're changing
it or you're

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.510
multiplying it by this amount.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.240
So the amplitude is 1/2.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.450
Now let's think
about the period.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.190
 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.710
So the first thing
I want to ask you

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.760
is, what does the period
of a cyclical function--

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.880
or periodic function,
I should say--

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.530
what does the period of
a periodic function even

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.800
refer to?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.730
Well let me draw some axes on
this function right over here.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.840
Let's say that this right
over here is the y-axis.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.776
That's the y-axis.

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.650
And let's just say, for
the sake of argument,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.170
this is the x-axis
right over here.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.800
So the period of a
periodic function

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.030
is the length of the
smallest interval that

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.220
contains exactly one copy
of the repeating pattern

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.307
of that periodic function.

00:02:58.307 --> 00:02:59.390
So what do they mean here?

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.370
Well, what's repeating?

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.980
So we go down and then
up just like that.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.340
Then we go down
and then we go up.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.910
So in this case, the length
of the smallest interval

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.560
that contains exactly one
copy of the repeating pattern.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.250
This could be one of the
smallest repeating patterns.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.710
And so this length between here
and here would be one period.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.340
Then we could go between here
and here is another period.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.430
And there's multiple--
this isn't the only pattern

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.070
that you could pick.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.570
You could say, well, I'm going
to define my pattern starting

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.430
here going up and then
going down like that.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.547
So you could say that's
my smallest length.

00:03:42.547 --> 00:03:44.130
And then you would
see that, OK, well,

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.629
if you go in the
negative direction,

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.130
the next repeating
version of that pattern

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.660
is right over there.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.690
But either way you're going
to get the same length

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.690
that it takes to
repeat that pattern.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.290
So given that,
what is the period

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.750
of this function
right over here?

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.600
Well, to figure out the
period, we just take 2 pi

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.920
and divide it by
the absolute value

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.020
of the coefficient
right over here.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.029
So we divide it by the absolute
value of 3, which is just 3.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:21.540
So we get 2 pi over 3.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.650
Now we need to think
about why does this work?

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.890
Well, if you think about
just a traditional cosine

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.130
function, a traditional cosine
function or a traditional sine

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.890
function, it has
a period of 2 pi.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.290
If you think about
the unit circle,

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.380
2 pi, if you start at
0, 2 pi radians later,

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.020
you're back to
where you started.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.750
2 pi radians,
another 2 pi, you're

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.730
back to where you started.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.230
If you go in the
negative direction,

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.800
you go negative 2 pi, you're
back to where you started.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.460
For any angle here,
if you go 2 pi,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.540
you're back to where
you were before.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.630
You go negative 2 pi, you're
back to where you were before.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.672
So the periods for
these are all 2 pi.

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:08.130
And the reason why
this makes sense

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.400
is that this coefficient
makes you get to 2 pi

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.200
or negative-- in
this case 2 pi--

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.790
it's going to make you get
to 2 pi all that much faster.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.306
And so it gets-- your period
is going to be a lower number.

00:05:19.306 --> 00:05:20.180
It takes less length.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.805
You're going to get to 2
pi three times as fast.

00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:24.305
Now you might say,
well, why are you

00:05:24.305 --> 00:05:26.410
taking the absolute value here?

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.320
Well, if this was
a negative number,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.250
it would get you to negative
2 pi all that much faster.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.114
But either way, you're going
to be completing one cycle.

00:05:34.114 --> 00:05:35.530
So with that out
of the way, let's

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.100
visualize these two things.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:45.790
Let's actually draw
negative 1/2 cosine of 3x.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.870
So let me draw my axes here.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.220
My best attempt.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.750
So this is my y-axis.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.790
This is my x-axis.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.530
And then let me draw some--
So this is 0 right over here.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.940
x is equal to 0.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.410
And let me draw x is
equal to positive 1/2.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.400
I'll draw it right over here.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.820
So x is equal to positive 1/2.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.460
And we haven't shifted this
function up or down any.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.640
Then, if we wanted to, we
could add a constant out here,

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.550
outside of the cosine function.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:22.060
But this is positive 1/2, or we
could just write that as 1/2.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.440
And then down here, let's say
that this is negative 1/2.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.442
And so let me draw that bound.

00:06:29.442 --> 00:06:30.900
I'm just drawing
these dotted lines

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.170
so it'll become
easy for me to draw.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.160
And what happens when this is 0?

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.535
Well cosine of 0 is 1.

00:06:40.535 --> 00:06:44.500
But we're going to multiply
it by negative 1/2.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.420
So it's going to be negative
1/2 right over here.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.360
And then it's going
to start going up.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.516
 

00:06:55.516 --> 00:06:56.890
It can only go in
that direction.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:57.950
It's bounded.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.610
It's going to start going
up, then it'll come back down

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.650
and then it will get back
to that original point

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.980
right over here.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.310
And the question is,
what is this distance?

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.090
What is this length?

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.050
What is this length going to be?

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.490
Well, we know what
its period is.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.830
It's 2 pi over 3.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.200
It's going to get to
this point three times

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.840
as fast as a traditional
cosine function.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.500
So this is going
to be 2 pi over 3.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.840
And then if you give
it another 2 pi over 3,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.920
it's going to get back
to that same point again.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.200
So if you go another 2 pi
over 3, so in this case,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:44.277
you've now gone 4 pi over 3,
you've completed another cycle.

00:07:44.277 --> 00:07:46.110
So that length right
over there is a period.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.640
And then you could
also do the same thing

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.933
in the negative direction.

00:07:50.933 --> 00:07:57.540
So this right over here would be
negative, negative 2 pi over 3.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.092
And to visualize the amplitude,
you see that it can go 1/2.

00:08:01.092 --> 00:08:02.800
Well, there's two ways
to think about it.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.310
The difference between the
maximum and the minimum point

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:05.810
is 1.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.630
Half of that is 1/2.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:12.200
Or you could say that it's
going 1/2 in magnitude,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.570
or it's swaying 1/2 away
from its middle position

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.330
in the positive or the
negative direction.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.830
