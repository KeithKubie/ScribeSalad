00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.094
- [Voiceover] Let f of t equal either

00:00:02.094 --> 00:00:04.230
the 2t minus 2t squared,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.038
and h of t equal four minus 5t squared.

00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:10.081
The graphs of y equals f of t,

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:13.099
and y equals h of t, are shown below.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.396
So y equals f of t is here in green,

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:18.649
so this is really y is equal to

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:21.133
e to the 2t minus 2t squared.

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.967
We see f of t right over there.

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:27.026
And y is equal to h of
t is shown in yellow.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.117
All right.

00:00:28.117 --> 00:00:30.274
Now below that, they say,
"Which of the following

00:00:30.274 --> 00:00:35.246
"appear to be solutions of
e to the 2t minus 2t squared

00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:38.408
"equals four minus 5t squared?

00:00:38.408 --> 00:00:39.685
"Select all that apply."

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:41.102
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:43.191
and try to think about it.

00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:44.608
Now the key here is to realize

00:00:44.608 --> 00:00:47.278
that either the 2t minus 2t squared,

00:00:47.278 --> 00:00:49.368
that was f of t.

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:53.268
And four minus 5t squared is h of t.

00:00:53.268 --> 00:00:55.316
So another way of thinking about it,

00:00:55.316 --> 00:01:00.313
select all of the Ts for which f of t

00:01:01.757 --> 00:01:04.423
is equal to h of t.

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:08.533
So all of the Ts where f
of t is equal to h of t,

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.203
well that's going to happen
at the points of intersection.

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:13.842
So for example, at t1,

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:17.116
we see at this point right here, t1 y1.

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:19.461
So this tells us f of t1

00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.991
is equal to h of t1,

00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:26.218
which is equal to y1.

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:30.490
So f of t is going to be equal to h of t

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.880
at t is equal to t1.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.574
We see that there because
it's a point of intersection.

00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:38.863
Now let's keep on going.

00:01:38.863 --> 00:01:40.530
Well they have another
point of intersection

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.797
right over here at t4, t4 y4.

00:01:44.797 --> 00:01:48.326
If you took f of t4,
you're going to get y4.

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:51.832
Or if you take h of t4,
you're going to get y4.

00:01:51.832 --> 00:01:55.501
So f of t4 is equal to h of t4.

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.753
f of t4 is equal to h of t4.

00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:01.129
So if you took e to the two times t4

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:03.288
minus two t4 squared,

00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:05.216
and all the way, that's going to equal to

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:08.254
four minus five times t4 squared.

00:02:12.564 --> 00:02:15.768
Since f of t and h of t equal each other,

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.579
when t is equal to t4,

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.901
these two things are
going to equal each other,

00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:22.548
when t is equal to t4.

00:02:22.548 --> 00:02:24.028
And those are the only ones

00:02:26.198 --> 00:02:29.101
that are at a point of intersection.

00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:32.955
And so I think we are done.

00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:34.279
I can check my answer,

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.527
and I got it right.
