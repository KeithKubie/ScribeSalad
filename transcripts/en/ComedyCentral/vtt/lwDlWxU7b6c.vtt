00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.302
Instagram, the premier app

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.371
for seeing what your
ex-girlfriend's been eating,

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:07.341
revealed
their redesigned interface,

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.176
along with a brand new logo!

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.777
There it is!

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:12.145
It looks like the old logo

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.047
that someone puked a mimosa
up on.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.516
-Um... -Yeah.
-(laughter)

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.684
This actually... this looks...
I liked the other icon.

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:19.887
I mean, I guess I'm fine with
this, but it kind of looks more

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.989
like a beauty mark
on a unicorn's asshole.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.625
(laughter and groaning)

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:26.226
And you know,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.696
people on the Internet do not
enjoy change of any kind.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.231
And they are not happy
about this.

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:35.802
Like @LaMontiezIvy9 who said,
"That uglass Instagram update."

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:37.838
(laughter)

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.107
So, comedians,
since this logo is so uglass,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.608
what's a more...?

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:44.511
It is, like,
the uglassist, guys.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:47.247
What would be a more appropriate
Instagram logo?

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.383
-Jen. -Um, I think
everyone will agree on this.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.984
Just a white box, and it says,

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:53.053
"My life isn't actually
this good."

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.655
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Yeah. Points.

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:57.291
-(applause and cheering)
-Points. Right.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.928
Rory Scovel.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.796
Someone on their phone
in a crosswalk

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.632
-about to get hit by a car.
-(laughter)

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:05.732
-Points.
-(applause and cheering)
