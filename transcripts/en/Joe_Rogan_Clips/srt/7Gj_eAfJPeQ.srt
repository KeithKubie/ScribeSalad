1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,250
But you, but even if you train,
you put it on your back. Let's say,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,060
let's say if you put a lama in a backpack,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,650
say you got like a fucking
Cafaro backpack, good luck
stuff. The alarm in there,

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:15,000
you had the whole Lauw zipped
it in, had it, okay, go over
that fence. He'd be like,

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,060
well, my buddy who's a guide
in Alaska, my buddy Chad,

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,720
he said that they were climbing up this
mountain. It was a fucking nightmare.

7
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:25,770
Like they like just slogging up
this steep mountain just like,

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,150
and they were like looking up and they're
like, God damn, this is a nightmare.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,330
You know, you're making like inches. Just
like, ugh. Oh, and you got a backpack.

10
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:34,710
And it just like,
when is this going to be over?

11
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:39,600
And don't try not to think about
digging. Let's take a break, you know?

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,110
And they just hear this and they just
see this grizzly with an elk in its mouth

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,460
and it just bounds up the mountain.

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,330
It just goes Shagun Shagun right by
them with, uh, with, uh, with, uh,

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,290
and just goes up over the
mountain and over the ridge.

16
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:59,880
Just no problem in 12 seconds. And
they were like, well that's a grizzly.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,010
That's how strong a fucking girls
face. And this is me, Jesus Christ,

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,190
I don't want to get that's I'm
so terrified of, I'm terrified.

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,330
I don't want to fuck get fucked
up by a chimpanzee or sheep bones.

20
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,220
He will eat my face and my balls.
So I don't want that.

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,970
And I definitely don't
want to get attacked by a
grizzly because they'll start

22
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:21,390
eating you when you're still alive.
And that's a problem.

23
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:24,670
Most of the time grizzlies eat people
though or most of the time of grizzlies

24
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:25,504
kill people.

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,560
They're not killing someone because
they want to eat them or killing someone

26
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,820
because you startled them and
they're with their female,

27
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,970
the females with their cubs.
Oh that's most of what happens when,

28
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:36,250
what are you supposed to do
when a grizzly just pray?

29
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,740
Well if it's a female grizzly,

30
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:42,010
you are literally better off
letting her fuck you up, right?

31
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,550
It just curl up in a ball. You're supposed
to put your hand behind your neck,

32
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,330
lay in a fetal position and don't
let her get access to your organs.

33
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,270
Cause she wants to chew your
Oregon's apart. Jesus. Yeah.

34
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:55,180
It's one of the reasons why it's really
important to have a strong backpack.

35
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,680
He was strong. Backpacks will fuck up
that backpack while you're on on your,

36
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,110
you know, underneath, curl
up in a fetal position.

37
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,950
But that's assuming you can survive that
she's probably gonna break your arms.

38
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:10,120
She's probably going to snap your legs
bite into you in ways you can't imagine

39
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:11,890
the kind of force and
power she can generate.

40
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:13,750
I mean she's trying to immobilize you.

41
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,560
She wants to mobilize you as a
threat to our children. But a male,

42
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,250
if a male is trying to kill you, it's
usually because he's starving to death.

43
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,480
They don't recognize people as a
food source. They rarely people.

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,080
So that mail PR,
it probably has never eaten a person.

45
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,200
It's one of the reasons why it's safer
to be in a place where they hunt.

46
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:35,380
Grizzlies cause in a place where they
hunt Grizzlies Grizzlies, he's a person,

47
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:38,080
he goes, fuck this, they'll smell
you and get the fuck out of there.

48
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,670
But like Yellowstone, they haven't
hunt grizzlies there in forever,

49
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,940
so people still get jacked.
They're stupid.

50
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,270
They get jack there every couple
of years now it gets killed.

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,790
We have a gun with me.
You should,

52
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,980
but you might not be able to get to it
and you also have to be able to prepare

53
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:53,920
to pull it out and shoot quickly.

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,830
You can't think that just because you
have a gun you're going to be okay. No,

55
00:02:56,831 --> 00:03:01,420
cause you don't hear him coming up on you
come up. So they move so fast. They run,

56
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,010
they run fast as a dog and
they're huge. Is that true? Yes.

57
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,520
There they run fast as fuck man. And
they're huge. It's a giant animal man.

58
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,230
800 pounds.
Think about that.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,360
I just stumbled across a story about,

60
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:17,980
this is happening about bear spray didn't
work and it was attacking the guide

61
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:18,940
and the the,

62
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,150
the client went to grab the glock out of
a pack and it didn't fire and then the

63
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,200
bear came after him.

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,590
So he tried to throw the gun to the other
guy and then it didn't a deck I just

65
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:34,390
ran into. I guess I'll just have to
follow this guy who died. It doesn't,

66
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,680
I don't, I didn't find, no, I mean
it happens all the time. Yeah.

67
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,610
That story is Rinella. Story, uh,

68
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,480
Rinella and Remy Warren and Yannis
Portallis and uh, our friends, they,

69
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:50,100
uh, they got attacked while they
were in a fog neck island in Alaska.

70
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,240
Jesus. Yeah. Blog now.
Yes. Like two years ago.

71
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:58,080
And Remy came on here and told the
story and it's fucking terrible. God,

72
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:01,450
what happened? Well, they
killed an elk and um,

73
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,950
they had hung it in a tree and they
had taken some of the meat back.

74
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:09,300
Cause you know, you have to hike out of
fog. NAC is particularly dense. It's very,

75
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:14,110
very dense. Vich Mitch, like, remember
when we were on Prince of Wales Island?

76
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,910
We went on that intense dense. Yeah.
Well it's like that, but even worse.

77
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,270
Chrisleys everywhere. Yes.
Grizzlies everywhere with
this huge problem with that.

78
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,200
When we were on an island, that island had
black bears. Yeah. Which weirdly enough,

79
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:28,800
they're not as dangerous, but they
are more predatory towards people.

80
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:33,140
I want to try and spike Telmate and spiked
collar and I want my guns like close

81
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,430
clothes, iron man suit. That's right.

82
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,940
I want to be able to correct shoot
rockets out of my hands. That's right.

83
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,110
And I want to be able to electrify it when
the, when the thing bites, yes, kill it,

84
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,570
and then immediately cut its
head off and put it on a steak.

85
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,540
So all the other grizzly bears, no, not
to fuck. That's exactly right. Okay.

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,480
There you go.
We're on like a man.
