00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.072
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Vertical and horizontal lines are somewhat tricky. They go against our

00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:08.705
intuition. When we think of vertical lines, we usually think about the variable

00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:13.226
y. But the equation is actually x equals. It's because the x-coordinate for

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:17.589
every point on this line was 2. When we usually think about the horizontal

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:22.222
direction, we think about the variable x. But horizontal lines are always in the

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:26.617
form, y equals. All the points on this line have a y-coordinate of negative 3,

00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:31.227
that's why it's y equals. When math goes against our intuition, it's helpful to

00:00:31.227 --> 00:00:35.947
stop and think, what's true for all the points? What is this line really saying?

00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:40.772
The coordinates of each point can be a lot of information, and they help us find

00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:42.463
the equations of the lines.
