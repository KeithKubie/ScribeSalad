00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.033
 

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:06.440
(applause)

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.413
Thank you.

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:12.127
Thank you everybody for
coming in this evening.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.540
A renowned faculty member

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.830
in the School of the
Arts and Architecture,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.210
Cathy Opie, on of the
world's great photographers,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.050
and not just great
teachers of photography,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.320
has said many times a simple point:

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.900
Ideas always start with questions.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.700
That is the frame and the format

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.180
for the next 10 weeks in this course.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.090
If you'll allow me to take a few minutes,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.110
I'd like, as this is our first session,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.060
to briefly introduce the course,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.540
and then I'll turn to a short introduction

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.210
of tonight's session,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.130
and question and introduce
each of our terrific guests

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.550
here on the stage this evening.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.383
I'm Brett Steele,

00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:55.540
Dean of the UCLA School of
the Arts and Architecture,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.130
and here tonight, very
much as a faculty member,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.890
and a member of a larger
office that has done

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.090
a huge amount of work in
recent weeks to put together

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.360
what I know is gonna be a
terrific new kind of course

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.583
here on campus this quarter here at UCLA.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.020
It's a course that's been
designed with the input,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.840
thinking and advice of many people,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.950
not just up in my office,
but across the entire school,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.453
and I'll thank them at the
end of this introduction.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.113
Tonight's first session,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.440
which I'll introduce, I've
decided, not in total tonight,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.230
and maybe it's because
of several years' work

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.710
as an editor, and not
only author of books,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.010
but I like to sprinkle
an introduction across

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.230
each of the 10 weeks for our students.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.930
One of the things I've learned
as an editor is usually

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.310
an introduction is best
if it's written at the end

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.460
of all of the hard work
of putting the ideas

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.390
and content and materials together.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.619
But I would like to
offer two or three points

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.360
to get this course going.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.670
What I thought I would
talk about very briefly

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.050
is something of the form of this course,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.310
its format, and for our
students in attendance,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.150
a little bit about its
weekly organization.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.900
And I promise you only a few highlights.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.320
So, on the topic of form,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.110
this is a course that, by design,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.050
seeks to do one thing above all else,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.390
which is ask questions,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.793
questions that are
posed as a way to simply

00:02:26.793 --> 00:02:30.030
open conversations about the ways in which

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.640
important ideas and
important questions posed

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.370
from the vantage of the
arts can be thought about,

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.330
and work can be done on through the lens,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.590
the life experiences,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.250
the professional experiences,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.500
the ideas that each of our guests

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.010
will bring to that question

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.553
from their own lives and careers.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.720
For those of you up on this stage tonight,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.040
this is the first of, and
a new experimental format

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.470
that will bring together
40 terrific faculty members

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.660
across the entire campus,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.030
not just the leafy
north end of campus here

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.340
that we in the arts love so much,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.723
for the purpose of a larger conversation

00:03:12.723 --> 00:03:14.460
around these ideas.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.360
One of its important
ambitions you could say

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.610
is in fact to create
bridges of various kinds

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.170
here on campus.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.330
It's not a bad intent, I think,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.496
at a time in which so
many parts of the world

00:03:27.496 --> 00:03:30.720
talk about things like walls and borders

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.100
in more ways than we can imagine

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.820
really are being struck up
in new and unexpected ways.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.520
Those borders exist also
in things like campuses

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.520
in this day and age.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.740
Really wonderful, incredible
work being done within schools

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.660
too often operates in isolation

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.540
of the many other interesting schools,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.660
forms of knowledge and
fields of experience

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.780
that make up the amazing
city-state of a university

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.240
like UCLA today.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.270
It's a community of about 80,000 people.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.210
As you know, the smallest,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.070
I think most of you will know,

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.390
geographically the
smallest of the campuses

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.750
in the UC system,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.790
and owing to its population,
for that reason also,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.010
its densest.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.870
One of the things we would
like to take advantage of

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.057
is what that density might
offer to bring us all together

00:04:20.057 --> 00:04:23.234
periodically in unexpected ways around,

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:26.420
at times, unfamiliar questions that let us

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.090
think about our own work in new,

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.420
interesting and unexpected ways.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.280
Regarding the form of this course,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.130
and as a minor concessions
to the history of art,

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.310
there is a form of symmetry involved

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.743
in how we've designed it.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.570
Every one of these Tuesday evenings

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.530
will feature two members of our faculty

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.160
from the School of the
Arts and Architecture,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.510
and two members from the wider faculties

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.650
across all of the other schools,

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.800
and research settings
that will come together

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.520
to talk about these questions.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.345
- [Paul] Actually on
this field, (mumbles).

00:04:59.345 --> 00:05:00.178
- Yeah.

00:05:00.178 --> 00:05:01.011
That wasn't choreographed,

00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:01.844
(laughing)

00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:03.220
but, yes, there does seem
to be clear lines drawn.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.900
We'll work on that.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.740
I hope the conversation can do work

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.133
on that symmetry going forward.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.080
Okay, so the second important bridge,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.410
just to mention very briefly
as this is our first session,

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.890
that we're looking at doing work on

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.740
with the design of the course is in fact

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.810
two very different kinds
of audience members

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.640
here in terrific
auditorium in Kaufman Hall.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.840
The first audience
member here this evening

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.100
is, of course, the
students that have enrolled

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.750
in this course formally,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.020
and will be doing coursework

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.660
and work in fact beyond
these evenings every week

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.900
over the next 10 weeks
of this autumn quarter.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.610
For those of you students
that have come in tonight,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.950
thank you, and thank
you for taking time away

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.530
from that part of the day often directed

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.769
towards things like dinner,

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:53.347
cocktails with friends,

00:05:53.347 --> 00:05:54.180
(audience laughing)

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.940
Tuesday night football or whatever else

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.520
fills one's life here on campus.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.353
In all seriousness,

00:05:59.353 --> 00:06:02.620
thank you for taking time
and coming in for that.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.930
For you to also be aware,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.790
the students enrolled in this course

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.330
interestingly include not
just students enrolled

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.860
in one of the four facilities
here in the school,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.090
which includes architecture
and urban design,

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.800
art, design, media arts,
world arts, culture, dance,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.820
but in addition to those departments,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.120
departments in the two other
schools of arts here in UCLA,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.170
theater, film, television, and music.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.550
So we get an opportunity to bring together

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.420
students from those three
different arts schools

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.650
here on campus, and in
fact from further afield.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.760
As some of you students know already,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.130
we have students tonight
here in the session

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.260
that are enrolled and studying right now

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.290
in departments of neuroscience, biology,

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.450
French, political science,
many other departments,

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.610
including forms of knowledge

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.530
further afield than arts regularly,

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.780
like financial actuarial mathematics.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.890
So thank you very much for coming in

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.980
and being a part of this sort of audience.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.700
As a school, we take
very seriously the idea

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.150
in fact that a great school
of the arts and architecture

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.460
sees the making of audiences,

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.960
the choregraphy of audiences,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.130
as an essential part of its work,

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.540
and in fact it's embedded in
the history of this school,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.300
from the moment it opened in venues

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.690
like Royce Hall and others
over the last century,

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.010
in which the bringing
together of public audience

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.060
is understood as a really essential part,

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.930
not just of our mission as a university,

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.270
but of what a school like ours
does in training individuals

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.240
in various creative fields,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.670
where that work is always
best done in close proximity

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.976
and regular interaction with audiences

00:07:47.976 --> 00:07:51.440
where ideas are formed and play out.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.810
That's all about the form of this course.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.430
Regarding format,

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.050
really just one point to remind you all,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.343
each week one big question has been posed.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.530
That question will be
approached, as I said earlier,

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.620
from the different disciplines

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.900
and forms of expertise that'll be up here

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.200
on the stage every week.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.650
My job will be, as my day
job involves regularly

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.500
a moderating and facilitating
of the conversation

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.803
that I hope to be able
to keep going forward,

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.640
following on from each
of the introductions

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.160
that our guests will make at the beginning

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.293
of this session.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.060
And finally, as I said
earlier about the organization

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.500
of this course for you students,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.210
as a larger group, you of course will meet

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.720
in four smaller sessions,
sections, throughout the week,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.500
and in those sections, have an opportunity

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.500
to literally rehearse and
rework the kind of conversation

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.840
and discussion that'll
take place upon the stage

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.020
starting off that week,

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.540
with an idea that you will participate,

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.980
very much like our guests
that are up here on the stage.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.813
And that's really it,

00:09:01.813 --> 00:09:04.830
as a few words about the larger course.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.670
As this is the first
session of the quarter,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.090
if I could just take a couple
of minutes of everybody's time

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.660
to thank the big group of people

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.460
that have really made this possible,

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.930
and who confirmed for
us the extent to which

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.090
an event like this is simply one edge

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.810
of a much larger space of
activity and invention.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.570
A terrific group of
people have come together

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.150
to help make this sort of course possible.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.677
In addition to you all as audience

00:09:31.677 --> 00:09:33.070
and our guests here tonight

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.910
for taking the time of coming in,

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.590
two vice provosts here at UCLA

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.120
have been especially important
in making this possible.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.610
Tim Brewer, our Vice Provost

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:47.610
for Interdisciplinary Activities
and Cross-Campus Affairs

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.510
has been very supportive
in providing funding,

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.613
as had Roger Wakimoto, our
Vice Provost for Research,

00:09:55.315 --> 00:09:57.190
which has supported this

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.330
for his belief that in fact
the work we do as artists,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.570
the designers, performers,

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.410
is research of a different
and important kind

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.940
here on campus.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.980
We have four brilliant
TAs that our students here

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.300
will all get to know well this term.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.570
Jing Jing, Kyle, Haley and Anna,

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.679
thank you for taking
time out of your studies

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:21.900
to come together and be
a part of this course.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.810
From my office, Anne Marie Burke,

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.430
our Executive Director of
Comms and Public Relations

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.490
has played a huge part in
putting all of this together

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.460
in the same space and time.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.730
And in her office,

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.870
Louise Kale and Kylie Carrigan have done

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.560
a really important part of
expanding what will take place

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.850
here on the stage,

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.190
and a larger online digital space

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.550
that all of you students
in the wider audience

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.940
will have access to
over the next 10 weeks.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.950
Jennifer Wells Green,

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.210
our Executive Director of Development,

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.300
has played a really
important part of managing

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.740
the big audience of
people who wanna come in

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.010
and be a part of this event,

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:01.130
and Victoria Marks especially,
who is right in front of me

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.160
with a phone reminding
me it's time to finish

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.350
this introduction, and who
is, in addition to being

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.370
the Associate Dean of Academic
Affairs here in the school,

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.610
a brilliant choregrapher and
professor of her own right,

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.369
and, in fact, the person
who has choreographed this

00:11:17.369 --> 00:11:19.300
in such a tremendous way.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.720
We have a couple of media partners,

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.630
KCRT and KCRW,

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.240
who are a part of this
event in various ways

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.560
in supporting our activities,

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.360
and this bigger mission of taking this out

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.560
to a public audience.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.205
And finally, we have to thank

00:11:34.205 --> 00:11:37.010
our Department of World
Arts, Culture, Dance

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.710
for a huge amount of support

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.480
in not just providing us a lovely room

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.510
that I think we're gonna enjoy

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.120
over the next couple of months,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.090
but providing all of
the technical expertise

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.810
that does things like turn the lights on

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.730
and make these microphones
work in magical ways.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.160
So everybody, thank you
for coming in for this.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.150
I'm gonna now introduce briefly

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.799
tonight's guests and
tonight's first session.

00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:58.632
(applause)

00:11:58.632 --> 00:12:00.278
Thank you.

00:12:00.278 --> 00:12:03.035
(audience applause)

00:12:03.035 --> 00:12:06.210
For that, let me try and
do that from sitting down.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.510
One of our ambitions was to
take things like lecterns

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.300
and PowerPoint and other
modern appliances away from

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.800
a discussion of ideas and
forms of teaching and learning,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.360
so we're gonna try this sitting down.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.700
We'll work on our projection.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.990
Please tell us if we're
struggling in that.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.890
Tonight's question, What Is Space?

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.670
is the first of 10 questions

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.810
that this course is gonna
be organized around.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.950
Space is a concept, a term and a word

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.429
that particularly amongst
fields like architecture

00:12:36.429 --> 00:12:40.110
have been important to
signaling the very idea

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.403
of a modern world.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.020
It's not so much that space
didn't exist before modern

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.870
architects in the early
20th Century claimed it.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.620
It's that there was a realization

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.400
the construction of built space

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.520
became a means for thinking
about what the very idea

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.040
of a modern subject might be in our world.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.370
It's the only clue I'll give you

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.930
that an architect has helped curate

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.330
this series of questions,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.890
which will look at a number of
different areas very quickly

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.933
as we get through space this evening.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.527
Our guests tonight

00:13:13.527 --> 00:13:18.527
are four really amazing
faculty members here at UCLA,

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.350
and who will help us literally launch

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.410
what we hope is a multi-year effort

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.350
to extend these kind of conversations

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.240
from campus to Los
Angeles to the West Coast

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.487
to the United States and across the world

00:13:31.487 --> 00:13:34.060
in the coming years when we work through

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.700
iterations of this kind of a format.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.100
And if you'll allow me,

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.720
I'd just like to very briefly introduce

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.603
each of our four guests, who have agreed,

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.560
by means of a decision making
process I'm unfamiliar with,

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.880
a running order for who will speak first.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.710
But let me just first
introduce each of these

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.870
four guests very briefly.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.360
Dana Cuff on my right here.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.550

from the Department of
Architecture and Urban Design

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.250
here in the School of
Arts and Architecture.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.450
Dana is a professor

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.210
of Architecture and Urban
Design here at UCLA,

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.660
where she is also Director of cityLAB,

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.910
an award-winning think tank

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.600
that advances experimental
urbanism and architecture.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.690
Since receiving her PhD in
architecture from Berkeley,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.510
Dana has published and lectured widely

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.870
about spatial justice,

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.020
the architectural profession,
and affordable housing.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.710
She is the author of several books,

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.050
including The Provisional City,

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.790
about housing in Los Angeles,

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.600
and based upon cityLAB studies,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.920
Dana coauthored a
landmark bill that permits

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.798
backyard homes on
virtually all eight million

00:14:36.798 --> 00:14:39.920
single-family properties in California,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.430
enabling a doubling of
built density of the suburbs

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.480
across the entire state
here in California.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.480
(audience applause)

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.430
- Rodrigo Valenzuela joins us this evening

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.310
from the School of the

video, painting, and installation.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.560
His work constructs narrative scenes

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.310
and stories that point to the tensions

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.550
between the individuals and communities

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.380
that inhabit our cities and world.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.360
Much of his work deals with the experience

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.923
of undocumented immigrants and laborers.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:29.270
Rodrigo earned his MFA in Photo Media

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.780

and many, many others.

00:15:58.001 --> 00:16:00.251
(applause)

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.580
On my left and far left,

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.370
Andrea Ghez is Professor
of Astronomy and Physics

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.330
here at UCLA.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.160
Andrea is a world leading expert

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.730
in observational astrophysics,

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.260
and has used the Keck
telescopes to suggest

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.480
the existence of a
super massive black hole

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.700
at the center of our galaxy

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.260
with a mass four million
times that of the sun,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.993
which is big.
- Four million?

00:16:26.993 --> 00:16:28.317
- Really big.
- Very big.

00:16:28.317 --> 00:16:29.150
(laughs)

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.670
Andrea earned her BS in physics from MIT,

to a wide variety of audiences

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.150
through more than 100 referee papers

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.040
and 200 invited talks,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.610
as well as features in textbooks,

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.490
documentaries and science exhibits.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.370
Her numerous honors and prizes include

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.210
being the first woman to receive

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.960

and a UC Presidential Chair.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.590
Paul's interdisciplinary research group

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.130
includes chemists, physicists, biologists,

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.880
material scientists, electrical
and mechanical engineers

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.690
and computer scientists.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.660
Their work focuses on the
atomic scale properties

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.640
of surface and supramolecular assemblies.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.090
And I've been practicing
supramolecular in advance of this.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:45.923
(laughing)

00:17:45.923 --> 00:17:49.500
Paul received his SB and SM
degrees in Chemistry from MIT,

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.280
his PhD in Chemistry from
the University of California

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.510
at Berkeley.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.760
He was a postdoctoral member
of the technical staff

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.750
at Bell Labs,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.840
a visiting scientist at IBM
Almaden Research Center before

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.320
becoming Director of the
California NanoSystems Institute,

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.410
Professor of Chemistry and
Biochemistry here at UCLA,

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.210
and Fred Kavli Chair in
Nanosystems Sciences.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.430
With his students, Paul has
developed new techniques

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.940
to expand the applicability
of scanning probe microscopes,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.740
and works to advance nanofab
reaction to ever smaller scales

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.150
and greater chemical
specificity to connect,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.466
operate and test molecular devices.

00:18:27.466 --> 00:18:30.283
(applause)

00:18:30.283 --> 00:18:31.330
- Ready now?

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.380
- Paul will be our first speaker tonight.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.270
To remind you all,

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.810
we've organized this so
that each of our guests

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.081
will open the evening
with a short presentation,

00:18:39.081 --> 00:18:40.930
after which we'll have a conversation

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.803
around some of the things presented.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.723
- [Paul] Great.

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:46.880
Well, it's a fantastic honor to kick off

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.640
this series and first round.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.377
I thought, given the current times,

00:18:51.377 --> 00:18:52.210
(audience laughing)

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.928
we should start with beer,
politics and religion.

00:18:54.928 --> 00:18:58.460
(audience laughing)

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.270
Joseph Priestly really
ushered in the modern era

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.387
in chemistry, and he liked beer too.

00:19:05.387 --> 00:19:06.687
(audience laughing)

00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:09.680
He did something useful with it though.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.650
He discovered an isolated carbon dioxide,

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.870
and then he also invented soda water,

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:20.170
which our hosts were
kind enough to bring me.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.993
He didn't commercialize it though.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.397
His contemporary JJ Schweppes did,

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:27.810
and made a lot of money from it.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:32.810
So, really, the idea of
atoms came from Democritus

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.450
a couple of millennia earlier,

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:39.910
but there were arguments
over what made up matter,

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.720
us, everything around us,

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.210
and by isolating and identifying
individual molecules,

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.230
Priestly was able to settle that dispute

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.913
and usher in the idea of
atoms making up molecules.

00:19:54.191 --> 00:19:59.130
Shortly thereafter, that
theory of chemistry developed.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.010
We were able to make new compounds,

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.830
and in the thinking, and the
reason I wanna bring this up,

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.980
the thinking at the time was
about those component elements,

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.090
and because we didn't have
any way to visualize them,

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.530
but we couldn't do much else either,

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:18.340
we thought of atoms and
the things they made.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.070
That continued through
the early 20th century,

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.040
and the quantum theory and understanding

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.850
the orbitals of atoms and so forth.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.180
I should point out a few
other things about Priestly.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.773
He was the founder of
the Unitarian Church.

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:40.300
He considered Benjamin Franklin a hero,

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.710
but Benjamin Franklin also championed him,

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.620
and when his house was burned down

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.840
and he was in trouble in England,

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.730
Franklin helped arrange
for him to come to America,

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.040
and he spent the last
years of his life here.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.550
Okay, this pointer is
about to die by the way,

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.850
so it must need batteries.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.040
I wanted to say something
about orbitals and space.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.670
In what we do in nanoscience
and in chemistry,

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.150
we think about atoms.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.950
We don't think about the nuclei so much,

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.120
except under special circumstances.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.570
Those are 100,000 times smaller,

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:24.550
and not usually relevant
to the work that we do

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.850
in putting together the pieces and matter.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.060
There's some special cases where

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.680
we can use them to advantage.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.940
If you look in a...

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.843
Ah, this is advancing, right.

00:21:32.843 --> 00:21:34.190
(audience laughing)

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.940
Someone rearranged the buttons.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.606
What's that?
- [Crew Member] Is it on?

00:21:37.606 --> 00:21:38.730
- It is on.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:39.923
Yes, see.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.123
But you advanced it somehow.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.603
Okay, there we go.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.750
Back to here.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.910
So, nuclei are small.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.560
Those have a positive charge.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.060
The electrons around them
are what make up chemistry,

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.580
what we can visualize with the microscopes

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.900
that we've developed,

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.160
and they're the glue that holds molecules,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.620
materials and all of us together.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.790
So, up through the time that
we understood these orbitals,

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:10.300
everything was fine and
we thought this way.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.770
But as we developed new techniques,

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.890
as we made solids and looked at them,

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.480
we kinda gave up the idea in our head

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.860
that we could imagine
those individual atoms.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.440
And it wasn't until about the 1980s,

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.730
there were a few glimmers
in the '50s and '60s,

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.570
but really the '80s that
microscopes were developed

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.300
that could imagine individual atoms

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.428
by scanning a metal
needle across the surface

00:22:33.428 --> 00:22:36.320
and really feeling the electrons

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.833
of the atoms on the surface.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.360
We're missing something, I think, right?

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.690
Oh, no, sorry, right.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:44.871
This is...

00:22:44.871 --> 00:22:47.780
Some of you are old
enough to remember manuals

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.030
that had this page
intentionally left blank.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:54.130
This is saying we lost the
idea of individual atoms,

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.230
and we thought about things
in periodic structures

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.400
and so forth.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.460
Forget my own joke.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.256
That is not the end of
the slideshow, though.

00:23:01.256 --> 00:23:03.210
(laughing)

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.853
Can you fix the slides?

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.490
There's another one right after that.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.530
Okay, no problem.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.363
(laughing)

00:23:13.363 --> 00:23:15.740
So, this microscope is
developed that let us

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.210
image individual atoms,

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.930
and we were excited that all of the sudden

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.310
this nanoscale world opened up to us,

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.063
and it really changed our thinking back.

00:23:26.294 --> 00:23:28.220
It looks like you have...

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.380
Something got hidden?

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.213
No?

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.040
Yeah.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.320
Okay, I can talk.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.222
So...

00:23:35.222 --> 00:23:36.140
(laughing)

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.770
Never stopped me before.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:39.570
(laughing)

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:43.560
So not only could we
image individual atoms,

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.980
but we could look at the
orbitals in a sense, like...

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.890
There we go.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.000
Okay.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.910
This was hard to describe otherwise.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:52.408
So here's different scales,

00:23:52.408 --> 00:23:53.690
(laughing)

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:57.490
starting with red blood cells.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.420
We're at a few microns here.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.100
We can look at all these devices,

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.200
go down to DNA at a couple
of nanometers across,

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.280
where it's of course made
up of individual atoms.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.230
But when Watson and Crick
took Rosalind Franklin's data

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.940
and got the structure of
the double helix of DNA,

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.700
they didn't really get the
positions of all the atoms,

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.240
they didn't get the sequence
of the DNA and so forth.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.450
That came later, through
some decades of technology.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:29.090
I'll point out a couple
of related pieces here.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:33.200
A virus, we were just talking
about this in the prelude,

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.800
is made up of atoms.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.730
It's a precise structure
that nature builds

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.580
from the bottom up.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.610
My wife is a neuroscientist.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:44.090
She pointed out that the
brain has always been nano,

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:47.230
that technology and scientists are just

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:48.620
millions of years behind,

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.610
and our technology in
making semiconductor devices

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.600
has just now reached that same scale.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.500
And so a project that we have together

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.560
is to try and understand what a thought is

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.000
and what a memory is

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.570
by trying to listen in
on the communication

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.270
between cells and the brain,

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.260
listen in to the hundred
different chemicals

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.980
that are used for signaling.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:09.940
Now in nature,

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.240
these structures are
built from the bottom up.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.260
Chemistry, assembly,

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.890
these are examples of
supramolecular assemblies.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.890
In most of what humans
do, we use top-down,

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.260
or, essentially, direct ascendance
of wood and stone carving

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.680
that we've done for centuries.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.130
Bill Murray got to be pretty good

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:35.520
at ice sculpting in the
end of Groundhog Day.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.880
But one of the strategies we use now

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.425
is to say can we make precise
or functional structures

00:25:43.425 --> 00:25:44.810
from the bottom up?

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.420
Can we make bigger and bigger precise,

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.240
or sufficiently precise
structures to understand

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.880
and control their properties,

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.340
or, for instance, to
interact with the brain?

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.950
The scale of biology is the nanoscale,

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.940
and so we have this opportunity

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.783
to develop these interactions.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.800
Okay, now, a little bit
about how important space is.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:13.360
Carbon monoxide, the poison,
was also isolated by Priestly.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.180
He didn't know it, but he did
know that it was poisonous.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.680
He got CO2.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.440
In a steel mill, you may
know the last reaction

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.170
that produces energy is
taking carbon monoxide to...

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:31.010
Oh, okay, this didn't transfer correctly,

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.110
but I'll tell you it's only in
the third digit of precision

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.430
that the spacing of the
carbon and the oxygen atoms

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.460
are different between carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.050
There's a tremendous energetic
difference between those two.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:49.790
For those of you who take high
school or freshman chemistry,

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.730
have a look at the
difference between single,

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.000
double and triple bonds in carbon,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
things like acetylene, ethylene to ethane.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.040
There are very tiny differences

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.780
that are a factor of one, two and three,

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.620
in terms of those bond strengths.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.130
So getting those separations right,

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.400
whether we're understanding
them or replacing them,

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.870
makes a very big difference.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.919
That's all the chemistry
we need to know for now.

00:27:14.919 --> 00:27:16.460
Okay.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.250
Now, we can image individual atoms.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.300
This was from the time I was at IBM.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.750
This is a distorted image.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.010
This is a single xenon atom,

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.543
which turns out to be
my favorite rare gas.

00:27:30.433 --> 00:27:33.040
You know when you breathe
helium, it makes your voice high.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.320
If you breathe xenon,
it makes your voice low.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.990
It also has an anesthetic effect,

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.520
so if you do this during...

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.740
We're being recorded, that's okay.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.280
If you do this during a
freshman chemistry lecture,

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.100
you would have to pour
it out of your lungs

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.470
because it's too heavy to diffuse out,

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.270
and you risk passing out,

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:50.880
and so I always have TAs in the front,

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.120
ready to hold me upside down by my ankles

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.170
to drain it outta me.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.850
It has kind of an anesthetic effect too,

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:57.330
so it's no good to lecture.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.770
You do it right at the
end of the lecture. Okay.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:01.020
Back to xenon.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.930
So, this isn't the size of a xenon atom

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.340
that we know from other measurements.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.550
This is where the electrons
are around the xenon atom.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.830
And so for the physicists involved,

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.150
this seemed like something
of a disappointment.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.110
I'll point out that each one of these

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:21.310
very, very shallow
protrusions is a nickel atom,

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.590
and that's because the
electrons that form the bonds

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:26.030
between them smooth out so much.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.440
And we had to blow up this scale

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.220
just to make the figure interesting.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.550
Well, there's much more we
can do with these microscopes,

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.630
it turned out.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.610
So, I chose this particular
image because to me

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.254
it's the most important one ever recorded.

00:28:39.254 --> 00:28:42.210
It has two different
atoms, gallium and arsenic.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.530
You don't have to know anything about them

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.930
other than that arsenic likes
electrons more than gallium.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.960
And so all the electrons
that are involved in bonding

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.560
sit on the arsenic,

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.280
and all the orbitals on
the gallium are empty.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.750
And so with this microscope
we can send electrons

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.410
into the empty orbitals,

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.410
and take them out in two
different measurements

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.490
of the filled orbitals,

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.490
and really look at where the electrons are

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.650
and where they aren't,

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.640
kind of like no theater.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.120
And that turns out to be just
the way an atom or molecule

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.890
cruising along the surface
would see that surface,

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.320
and it lets us explore and
understand the chemistry

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.260
with better than atomic resolution,

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.030
as if we could put on goggles

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.790
that show us the chemistry of a surface.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.930
So that led to many,
many other capabilities.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:34.680
One of the things I did when I was at IBM

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.090
was I wanted to find out what
was underneath those atoms,

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.490
so I rewrote the software on a microscope

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.200
to slide them out of the way.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.815
I didn't spell anything,
that came after I left,

00:29:44.815 --> 00:29:47.560
but that let us position atoms

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.140
and formed these precise structures,

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.000
like this famous quantum corral image,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.860
where I'll point out all these waves

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.440
are not extra atoms.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.050
They're just the electrons
interfering with each other,

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.660
as if we threw a rock in a calm pond.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.050
And so we now understand
the chemistry that results

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:08.850
from having those extra electrons
right in the middle there.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.920
There will be a molecule
that would wanna sit

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.930
at that one particular point,

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:16.210
not because of any special
chemistry of what's underneath.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.005
Everything is the same, it's all copper,

00:30:18.005 --> 00:30:23.005
but we changed the chemistry
there by these manipulations.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.190
We can play a Newton's cradle game too.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.240
That's another story.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.060
There should be one more.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.240
Okay.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.180
We have a lot to learn from each other.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.980
Just as Muybridge, 130 years ago,

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.990
took these stop-frame images of a horse

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.470
to prove that all four
hooves left the ground

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.210
at any give time,

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.070
in what Professor Ghez does and what I do,

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.770
we get glimpses of what we're looking at,

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.880
and how we interpret
what happens in between

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.680
is all important to our understanding.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.560
So one of the great benefits
of being in a place like this

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.900
is I could work with a filmmaker

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.240
and go through what are
the rules of animation,

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.930
which Disney put together
in a bible some years ago,

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.280
so we could understand what
the possibilities were,

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:14.390
both in how atoms and molecules
move across a surface,

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:18.150
but also so that how
we could understand it

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.600
in our own heads,

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.270
how we would display it to control,

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:26.870
modify, inform our perception.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:27.703
Okay?

00:31:27.703 --> 00:31:30.220
And so, I think part of
this community that we have

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.590
is really an opportunity for us to

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.140
learn from each other and share,

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.970
and thank you so much for including me

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.817
in this wonderful event.

00:31:38.817 --> 00:31:39.866
Thanks.

00:31:39.866 --> 00:31:42.290
(audience applause)

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:43.485
- [Brett] Thanks, Paul.

00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:44.746
- [Paul] Thank you.

00:31:44.746 --> 00:31:45.646
- [Brett] Rodrigo.

00:31:46.555 --> 00:31:47.388
- [Rodrigo] I'm just
gonna play video first,

00:31:47.388 --> 00:31:49.023
and then I'm gonna talk.

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.290
Can you dim the lights now please?

00:32:03.704 --> 00:32:07.037
(narration in Spanish)

00:34:30.809 --> 00:34:35.809
So, I don't know if you get
everybody to see the subtitles.

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.450
I was thinking a lot about space,

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:42.050
and I think some of the
questions I sent people

00:34:44.071 --> 00:34:47.490
is probably is the less romantic version

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:49.560
of the conversation about
space that you can have

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.173
is when you have not enough space, right?

00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:56.450
It's like, as I think in the art

00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:58.710
and in many institutional spaces

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.810
as a person of color you feel like

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:02.660
there is enough space for one,

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.310
but two becomes a lot,

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:08.000
so it's like, how can rooms
become oppressively small,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.923
even if they are really large in size.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.870
How you find these spaces to become...

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:18.600
Like I'm translating any word that has

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.850
so much romantic charge
into something more simple,

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.290
most tangible, like saying room, right?

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.850
They don't have enough room

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.600
is something that you hear a lot.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.507
Like it's space is almost have like...

00:35:31.507 --> 00:35:34.260
I like to translate words
into something very simple

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.620
and very attainable.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:41.620
So I just want to show
you two examples of words

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.130
I've been thinking about
when somebody invites me

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:45.430
to do something in a room,

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:47.350
because basically it's like,

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.860
they invite you to fill up white walls

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:50.693
when you make art, right?

00:35:50.693 --> 00:35:53.330
There's like, put stuff there,

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:54.890
any stuff.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:59.397
Like we need this guy that
makes work about something else,

00:35:59.397 --> 00:36:00.310
you know, that...

00:36:02.292 --> 00:36:05.490
So...

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.137
The lights, can you turn the light out?

00:36:07.137 --> 00:36:09.560
Can you just put the lights out?

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.373
People don't need to see me for this.

00:36:11.373 --> 00:36:12.706
(audience laughing)

00:36:12.706 --> 00:36:15.123
So, thinking about the space,

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.890
I enter museums where

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:24.517
I feel my job is trying
to disrupt the harmony

00:36:25.808 --> 00:36:30.320
like European art have
had over the course of,

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.358
you know, a solid 600 years.

00:36:32.358 --> 00:36:35.350
(laughing)

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:37.080
You go to places where they tell you

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.910
you can have the whole museum
to make work, to put stuff,

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.540
and then, like, but
already have so many stuff.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.820
Can I just use your stuff?

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.343
And then it's my ideas?

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:51.243
And which also relate to the idea,

00:36:51.243 --> 00:36:53.340
it's like, what is the
work made of, right?

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.280
It's like, a lot of...

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.310
I mean, I'm guilty of this
where I'm busy all the time

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:00.590
and I don't have time to make new work,

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.000
and considering that moving
your hands is only the form

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.430
of labor that we appreciate,

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.430
the intellectual labor
is really hard labor.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:12.060
And your ideas, and the only
way that you can manifest

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.410
your ideas filling up spaces with stuff

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:15.990
is by moving your hands a lot.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:19.900
So you enter another conversation
about economic placement,

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.330
where how much worth are my ideas

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.340
versus somebody else's ideas.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:28.310
Like what is their space,
what is the collection goals?

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:30.030
Who owns those pieces?

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:34.250
Which other space is
this, and have it, right?

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.480
So in this museum they have...

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.750
I need to find the common
denominator for the spaces

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:40.820
to understand what I'm
doing in this museum,

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.690
in this case was at the
Jordan Schnitzer museum

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:45.700
in Eugene, Oregon.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.780
And basically every,
you know, we're lucky,

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.310
we have a very prestigious institution

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:51.690
where we have the hammer.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:53.970
They have an amazing collection,
and some (mumbles) art.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:57.600
But in general, every
university has their own museum,

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.850
and every small town have their museum.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.300
The only thing that they have in common

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.629
is that they all have terrible
American landscape paintings.

00:38:04.629 --> 00:38:05.462
(audience laughing)

00:38:05.462 --> 00:38:07.900
They all have the same thing.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.350
So, to me it was like,

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:15.040
how is when European guys
make a painting, it's sublime,

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.050
and Latinos make it,
it's picturesque, right?

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:22.880
This is how we access
that space of aspiration,

00:38:24.052 --> 00:38:28.329
aspirational, philosophical
concerns, right?

00:38:28.329 --> 00:38:30.333
How we can become that guy?

00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:31.666
So in this case,

00:38:34.533 --> 00:38:37.869
I grab the walls from a past exhibition,

00:38:37.869 --> 00:38:40.622
and I access the permanent
collection of the place,

00:38:40.622 --> 00:38:42.775
and I conceal all the permanent collection

00:38:42.775 --> 00:38:45.760
of these paintings in the space,

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.733
so I grab all the work that they own.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.610
And if you remember a little
bit of the script of the...

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:55.910
The movie, how I made it
is I shot it with people,

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.750
and I didn't know what
the work was really about,

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:03.250
so I went in this stream
of consciousness speech

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.240
where I was talking to a Microsoft phone

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.793
as I watched the movie,

00:39:10.432 --> 00:39:13.030
and the movie is about this...

00:39:14.231 --> 00:39:15.300
It's called Tertiary,

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.730
which is the third characters in a movie.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.960
Secondary characters is
the best friend, you know?

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.050
Maybe the guy that have one line.

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.430
But the other people are the
background actors, right?

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:30.260
The tertiary is the people
that have the job name,

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.630
you know, Cop One, Clerk One,

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:34.930
and usually those people are
the people of color, right?

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.950
They need to fill up the
movies with people of color

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:40.100
so the scene look real.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:40.933
Right?

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.890
But they have no talking parts.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.840
You know, so like in a way the movie

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.000
and this piece is about that.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.350
So it's like, I don't need to make

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.000
a better landscape than that.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.740
I just need to put it in front.

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.350
I just don't want...

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:55.960
Like, I don't need to...

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.080
There is plenty of mediocre
dudes there, you know?

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.500
Can I suck characters?

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.080
Can I suck for a little bit?

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.670
Can I go and make a mediocre landscape?

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.113
So it's like, but put it in front.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.730
So you have to see my
work through the walls

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:09.987
or through the other,

00:40:09.987 --> 00:40:12.820
so it's a matter of
priorities right now, to me.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.850
It doesn't need to be better,

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:15.660
it just need to be presented fierce.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.910
In the same way you have
placed the other guys fierce

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:18.790
all the time.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.960
Or like you have surrendered
the spaces of the walls.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.130
You have filled it up.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.310
There is balls of stuff

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:26.440
that they make no sense,
they have no meaning

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.450
beside that one guy wanted
to paint the landscape.

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:30.593
And it was sublime.

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:33.883
And he's experienced.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.860
So yeah, I went to Zabriskie
Point, I shot this.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:42.120
In another situation, I was in this,

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:46.993
where this actually was my
first museum show, in Seattle.

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.860
The Friar Museum, they have this beautiful

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.380
salon style permanent collection.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.250
Fucking amazing room, it's beautiful.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.080
It's the museum that
you take your grandma,

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.948
and you just have a lovely afternoon.

00:41:01.948 --> 00:41:03.110
(audience laughing)

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:03.943
You know?

00:41:03.943 --> 00:41:05.370
Look at the things, you know?

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.153
They are naked but they're
not really sexual, right?

00:41:07.153 --> 00:41:09.800
They're like, really, really, beautiful.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.270
And the walls are really nice.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.530
So basically, when I had the show,

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:14.880
you know, Seattle is changing a lot,

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.883
there is all this construction and stuff.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.810
So I decided, well, there
is a place that we go,

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:24.270
this space that we try to get knowledge,

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:26.730
and it's always look the same.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:27.940
So what I did,

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.160
I just transformed the whole space.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:29.993
There is the room.

00:41:29.993 --> 00:41:31.410
I just left the scaffolding,

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:34.400
I make graffiti on the walls,

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.640
and I made these images,

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.880
this city of forest
called hedonic reversal,

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.180
which is like searching pleasure for pain.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.930
That is what it means, hedonic reversal.

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.263
And so I just...

00:41:47.263 --> 00:41:48.420
This is the same room,

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:51.810
where I left the work, the
paper that they cover the floors

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:55.340
to protect it, I just covered
the whole place in graffiti.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.800
I left the scaffolding.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.660
And in some way, we want to go to spaces,

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.110
and we want to try to suck knowledge,

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.800
but not all gonna look
like this white cubes.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.170
They're not gonna be
alienating for people that

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.690
haven't historically belonged
to those white cubes.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:09.670
So I just wanna be able to go to places

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:10.609
and suck up knowledge,

00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:12.723
independently of how they look.

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:15.990
So yeah, that is the exhibition where I...

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:17.430
That is two examples,

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.330
and that is the theory, you know?

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:22.284
Where, again, I shoot photos,

00:42:22.284 --> 00:42:23.370
and I shoot in my studio,

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:24.210
no have a big studio,

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:26.283
so I shoot and re-shoot,

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:29.070
which is a different
conversation about space,

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:32.190
where the idea of space happen
in the photographic realm,

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.170
where things are...

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.380
The photo have a time that imply

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.100
in the time that you
spend with the other photo

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.410
that you re-photograph later.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.550
So you allow yourself to kind of

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:44.223
improve on the work that you did,

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:46.710
without changing space,

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:49.210
but still there is a
psychological space that you enter

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:50.310
when you look at these images,

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.630
because you know that time passed.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:54.160
You just don't know when.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.960
So those are kind of the
two samples of the work

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.040
that kind of follow the line of that video

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.060
in the way that I understand space

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:06.100
as seen as a place I wanted to fix,

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.300
and not consider that is a given,

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:09.830
you know, for you, but...

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.480
When I enter a space I think
how many Latinos there are,

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.897
how many black people there are,

00:43:14.897 --> 00:43:15.730
and then it's like,

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:17.200
and sometimes it's just not enough,

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.510
and sometimes it's just too many,

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.423
and who dictate those places?

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.370
It is a lot of the power
of the institutions,

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:25.850
and those are the things
that we all need to

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:28.200
keep accountable and
control and remind them

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.810
of the power,

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:32.360
the way that they control knowledge.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.000
So it's important for me to evidence that

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.033
with this project.

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:39.320
But yeah, that's it.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.153
- [Brett] Terrific.

00:43:40.153 --> 00:43:41.053
Thank you.

00:43:41.053 --> 00:43:43.303
(applause)

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.273
Dana.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:50.370
- [Dana] Here I go.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.399
Maybe.

00:43:52.399 --> 00:43:53.280
(laughs)

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.570
Let's see.

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:55.760
It's this one.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.900
Okay, yeah.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:57.880
All right.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.740
So, I'm gonna just stand up

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.763
because my neck is getting a
crank from looking behind me.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.490
Architecture is space.

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:11.070
In 10 minutes it's gonna
be about 700 years,

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:15.160
so that gives me about
1.3 minutes per century,

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.231
so it's gonna be fast.

00:44:16.231 --> 00:44:18.310
(audience laughing)

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:19.580
I have a little argument,

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.190
so that complicates my 10 minutes.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:25.140
And that is that there is no such thing

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:26.960
as architectural space,

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.120
except for as we think
about it historically,

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.450
and so I wanna take you from

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.590
the modern subject,

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.200
or modern space,

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.870
which is a really 20th Century idea,

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:41.893
to contemporary space in Los Angeles.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.410
I would say that that's
the movement through space

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:47.480
as abstraction.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.761
That's the modern era,

00:44:49.761 --> 00:44:54.761
that that goes into a post-war
space of transformation,

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.290
and that we're currently
in a period in which

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:02.053
we can think of space
productively, as reclamation.

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.057
What do I point out?

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.930
Okay. So, in order to do
that I have to give you

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:13.820
a slight pre-history because
the space of abstraction

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.280
doesn't mean much unless you
think about where it came from,

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.680
which was really the
Renaissance idea of space,

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.930
and it's Brunelleschi who either discovers

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:26.150
or rediscovers the idea of perspective,

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:29.870
and in that it turns
out that of course space

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:31.830
is a kind of mathematics,

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:36.260
and that we can actually
develop a science of space

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.070
through the process of its representation,

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:42.660
and that the construction
of three dimensions

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:43.810
into two dimensions,

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:47.330
which you see so beautifully
rendered in this etching,

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.500
actually helps in the construction

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:54.500
of particularly spectacular
and innovative buildings,

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:58.773
like the Duomo in Florence
that Brunelleschi himself made.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.543
During this period,

00:46:05.987 --> 00:46:07.680
Sigfried Giedion, who wrote the book

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.390
Space, Time and Architecure in 1941,

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:14.180
says that the ultimate example

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:18.880
of Renaissance and perspectival space,

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.040
is really the City of Paris,

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.770
with Haussmann's and Napoleon III's help.

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:26.530
And you see in this before and after image

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:30.580
how the city becomes a
kind of outdoor room,

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.890
a kind of space that you
would say is the city of form,

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:38.920
according to the architect
and urbanist Albert Pope.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.160
And you can think about that city of form

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:45.340
as being almost an excavation
through the mass of buildings,

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.840
out of which streets or
piazzas of plazas are made.

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.820
And so the city is almost a thick mat

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.720
in which space can be discovered,

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.500
or excavated.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:00.120
And in this reconstruction I
think it's important to note

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.780
we often think of Haussmann and Paris

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.760
as being its boulevards.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.250
But what makes the boulevard
is Haussmann's housing blocks,

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.050
the apartment blocks that he made

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.740
that became the urban filler in a way

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:17.740
to lead you to the perspectival
object of your affection

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.710
at the end of the vista,

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.120
or at the end of the
one point perspective.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.160
The other thing that's I
think worth noting in this

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.550
is that it brings the
subject into the view

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.260
because we have a single point of view,

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:34.260
we have a location in the
perspectival Renaissance city.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:39.090
You see this best standing
right in the middle

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:40.190
of the Champs-Élysées.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.623
Oh...

00:47:47.683 --> 00:47:48.983
Oops, the wrong direction.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:53.067
We need to get up in history.

00:47:53.067 --> 00:47:56.380
(audience laughing)

00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:00.120
Okay, so, here we are in modern space.

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:04.190
I think the contrast between,
say, what Haussmann in Paris

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:05.630
and Brunelleschi were making,

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:09.090
and this Bauhaus image
from the painter actually,

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:10.020
Oskar Schlemmer,

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:15.020
situates the figure as a
kind of abstract entity

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:17.140
in an abstract space

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.110
that extends forever in every direction

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:24.310
outward from him, I think.

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:26.640
And so that figure seems to be

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.100
both central and dislocated somehow,

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:34.640
in this space that is in fact the focus

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.613
as a form of abstraction.

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:40.703
I feel like...

00:48:40.703 --> 00:48:42.803
Hmm, this is unlikely to run.

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.525
Can you make that video run?

00:48:45.525 --> 00:48:46.358
- [Crew Member] It's going.

00:48:46.358 --> 00:48:47.191
- Ah, perfect.

00:48:47.191 --> 00:48:50.950
So here's the way Oskar
Schlemmer made that into a dance,

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:52.770
by showing that in fact...

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:53.930
This is called a pole dance,

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:56.240
you can imagine what else
I found on the internet

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:00.955
while I was looking for
this. (audience laughing)

00:49:00.955 --> 00:49:05.470
The figure is really erased
in order to become the vehicle

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:08.660
to demonstrate abstract space.

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:12.280
And this kind of beautiful demonstration

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.660
of the way space itself might look

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:18.470
is what Schlemmer was trying to achieve.

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:19.410
Can we go forward?

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:22.076
Yes, before the pole
dance ads come up after.

00:49:22.076 --> 00:49:23.010
(audience laughing)

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:25.990
So really the master
of modern architecture

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:28.620
as anyone in the room who's
an architecture student

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.890
would know is Le Corbusier,

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:35.890
who writes in a book called
The Making of Modern Space.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.260
Let me make sure I have
that title correct.

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.857
He writes, "A boundless depth opens up.

00:49:41.857 --> 00:49:46.656
"It faces the walls, drives
away contingent presences,

00:49:46.656 --> 00:49:50.890
"accomplishes the miracle
of ineffable space."

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:52.940
And I think even in that language,

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.500
Corbu was a beautiful
writer as well as architect.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:01.070
He portrays this notion of an abstraction

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:05.110
that the architect then
was there to try to capture

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:10.100
as this almost existential,
ineffable task,

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.220
which the Ozanne Pond Studio I think

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.700
is a perfect example of...

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.003
This is in the book
The New World of Space.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.060
But Corbu thought that the major arts,

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:31.824
which he defined as
architecture, sculpture,

00:50:31.824 --> 00:50:35.544
city planning, and painting or drawing,

00:50:35.544 --> 00:50:38.720
were in fact all united and major

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.060
because they were all about space.

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.270
And so you see in his Ville Radieuse,

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:47.690
the city itself is a plane of space

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.030
out of which architecture is situated.

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:53.400
The Villa Savoye which is the example

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.340
of spatial manipulation by the architect

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.910
that he's freed the ground
plane by raising it up

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:01.220
on columns or piloti,

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.620
that he's freed the
facade by separating it

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:04.600
from the structure,

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.260
and that he's freed the barrier

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.810
between the inside and outside
through the strip window

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:11.000
that distributes light evenly throughout.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.490
And that same freedom he
captures in that drawing

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:17.500
which is left open, and though a boundary,

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.093
is not at all bounded.

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.830
So if you think about modern space

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:26.150
as being the space of the city

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:29.203
and now I'm gonna leap from
the building to the city,

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:34.340
Los Angeles itself is part of the object

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.950
of modernist urban spatial thinking.

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:41.860
And Bunker Hill is probably
our best example of that,

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:46.200
which in fact, in the
50s and 60s and the 70s

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.090
was flattened and cleared,

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:51.610
turned into a tabula
rasa, or a clean slate,

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:55.230
so that the new modern abstract space

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:56.950
could be built upon it.

00:51:56.950 --> 00:52:00.690
This is just one plan of many,
many plans that were made

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:04.182
that would bring Los
Angeles into the modern era

00:52:04.182 --> 00:52:07.753
through its architectural composition.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.070
It's important to note even here though

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:14.660
that the freeways are part
of what is constructing

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.400
that space of the city.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.610
And probably the person who
brought that to our minds

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:23.200
most clearly was the British
architectural historian

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.270
Reyner Banham, who wrote the book:

00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:28.380
Los Angeles, Architecture
of Four Ecologies.

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.590
And he thought that the freeways,

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.570
of course he's writing in the late 60s,

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:33.730
publishes it in the 70s

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:35.770
when you could actually get
from one place to another

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:36.603
on the freeway,

00:52:36.603 --> 00:52:37.436
(audience laughing)

00:52:37.436 --> 00:52:42.070
that he writes that that's
his whole space of existence.

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:44.220
The freeway system in its totality

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.380
is now a single comprehensible place,

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:51.100
a coherent state of mind,
a complete way of life,

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.900
the fourth ecology of the Angelino.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.020
And I bolden the place,

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.630
because it's the way we have distinguished

00:52:57.630 --> 00:53:01.260
in most recent history,

00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:02.690
space from place,

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:05.030
that somehow space is
something that exists

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:08.070
and can be passed through
or extends abstractly

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:11.333
from this world, place
is a site of dwelling.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.120
And he was making the point

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.540
that in fact the freeways
were a site of dwelling.

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:21.070
What he didn't acknowledge
is that the freeways

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:24.420
wiped out dwellings everywhere they went,

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.810
and that that was their national task.

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:30.680
And in fact we can see that
the Boyle Heights neighborhood

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.800
has been particularly victimized

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.020
both by the East L.A. interchange,

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.300
but also by the 101,

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:41.380
as a means of eradicating
poor neighborhoods of color.

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:45.350
And so the politics of space
really starts to play into

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:49.494
this next era of both transformation,

00:53:49.494 --> 00:53:54.410
and of what we'll later call reclamation.

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:56.510
You see up at the upper right

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:58.830
the neighborhood of Boyle Heights

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:03.830
that sits under and
next to the 101 freeway

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:07.530
and this you can see in one short year

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:11.640
is in fact the transformation

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.160
into a new and modern
housing development design

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.830
by the son of Frank Lloyd Wright,

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:18.850
and some of his colleagues.

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:19.960
This is public housing.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.710
All public housing also had to be located

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:24.470
one for one elimination

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:27.070
on top of what were deemed slums,

00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:28.933
which was a political determination,

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.333
always disadvantaging
neighborhoods of color.

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.930
So now, with that hard history behind us,

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:43.500
how do we move forward in
the City of Los Angeles,

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.630
which if Paris was a city of form,

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:48.890
what Albert Pope has suggested

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:51.560
and I think we've seen
in the other images,

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.063
Los Angeles is a city of space.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.980
We basically live on a field condition,

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:03.817
a plane in which sprawl
has been the space of our

00:55:03.817 --> 00:55:06.430
transformation and production.

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:11.070
And now, finally, after
decades of asking for this

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:12.660
as an urbanist and architect,

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:14.490
we're building back in.

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:17.500
And what we're having
to do is reclaim space

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.400
that has otherwise seemed
not available to us.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.500
And I'm here just gonna
show you one project

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.910
that Brett alluded to in his introduction,

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:27.920
and that's this space
of the backyard home,

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.770
or the secondary unit,

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:31.290
which is a project that cityLab,

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.630
my center has been working
on for a dozen years.

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:37.370
So if L.A. can double the density

00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:41.380
of its single family neighborhoods
by adding backyard homes,

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:44.770
it will become a model
of a post-suburban city,

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:47.910
transformed through discovered space

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:50.700
for affordable housing
with no public funding.

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:53.140
Given the nature of our housing crisis,

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:58.140
the reclaiming of lost
space for our residents

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.493
is an absolutely critical
task for the architect.

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:07.673
Okay.

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:11.373
Can you change...

00:56:11.373 --> 00:56:13.030
Oh, perfect.

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:16.810
So, what we see is that there
is this kind of found space

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:20.093
that was in backyards that
can grow steadily over time.

00:56:20.093 --> 00:56:22.560
They can do that without
changing neighborhoods,

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.400
and that there's an increment,

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.780
a molecule of urbanism, if
my colleagues will allow me,

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:31.090
that something like the small house,

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:34.950
which itself is a didactic transformation,

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:37.880
or adaptation of the two car garage,

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.990
that we would in fact
decide to house people

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:41.080
better than cars.

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.865
And so that little house
that we built on the campus

00:56:43.865 --> 00:56:46.420
is exactly that same footprint,

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:51.223
and is intended to be a
reclaimed space for occupancy.

00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:00.840
And like the stacking in nanoscience,

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.910
I'm trying to make some
connections that'll maybe

00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:05.170
bring us together in our conversation.

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:06.823
Oops, we went one too far.

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:14.190
Those small increments
actually adapt a huge change,

00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:16.790
if there are eight million
single family houses

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:17.910
in California.

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:22.730
This is the most radical
transformation of our landscape

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:24.690
of the space of our state

00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:26.523
that's happened since World War II.

00:57:28.703 --> 00:57:33.690
There are many, many other
spaces to be reclaimed and found,

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:35.290
whether it's surface parking,

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:38.660
or underutilized school campuses

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:42.604
where it's still, again,
we can repurpose that space

00:57:42.604 --> 00:57:45.860
and reclaim it for making our
city a better place to live

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:47.350
for all of our residents.

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:48.488
Thanks.

00:57:48.488 --> 00:57:49.429
(audience applause)

00:57:49.429 --> 00:57:50.566
- [Brett] Thank you.

00:57:50.566 --> 00:57:55.566
Thank you, Dana.

00:57:56.246 --> 00:57:57.150
Andrea?

00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.983
- [Andrea] All right.

00:57:57.983 --> 00:57:58.816
Passing of the baton.

00:57:58.816 --> 00:57:59.649
(laughs)

00:57:59.649 --> 00:58:00.540
- [Dana] If you touch
just the forward and back

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:01.373
it seems to work.

00:58:01.373 --> 00:58:02.670
I think I was pressing the wrong button

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:03.960
at one time.
- Okay.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:04.793
Great.

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:10.602
Well, if you ask an
astrophysicist what space is,

00:58:10.602 --> 00:58:11.740
(audience laughing)

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.900
I'm gonna tell you three things.

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.327
It's really big (laughs),

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:19.820
it's very humbling,

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:21.980
and it's connected to time.

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:25.323
So those are the three things
I hope to share with you.

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:28.743
It's also, in astronomy,

00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:32.610
actually astronomy's one
of the oldest sciences

00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:35.893
because we have an amazing
ability to study space.

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.700
With just your eye,

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.360
which of course is one of our,

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.450
gives us one of our five senses,

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:46.820
we can see well beyond the
boundaries of our own galaxy

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.750
to the next closest galaxy.

00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:52.330
And if you compare that to
any of our other senses,

00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:54.100
that's rather astounding,

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.750
how far we can smell,

00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:58.180
how far we can taste,

00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.650
how far we can hear.

00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:02.580
But our ability of sight
really brings space

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.650
that's very large to us.

00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:07.990
Now, people have been studying astronomy

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:09.810
for a very long time.

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:13.390
But today, the study of astronomical space

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:16.050
as is carried out with
very large telescopes.

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:17.690
So I have to share with you

00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:21.338
one of the wonderful
aspects of being at UCLA

00:59:21.338 --> 00:59:26.260
is that UC owns the largest
telescopes in the world.

00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:28.563
These are co-owned by UC and Caltech.

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:32.270
They're not in a bad space here on Earth.

00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:33.730
They're out in Hawaii,

00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:37.220
so most of the folks here at UCLA

00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:40.450
carry our their work
with these telescopes.

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:42.380
So it used to be that we
had to go up to the summit,

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:44.660
but in fact now you can
control these facilities

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.370
here from UCLA.

00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:51.320
Now, telescopes allow us to see very far.

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:52.500
The bigger the telescope,

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.800
the larger the collecting area

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.560
so you can see things that are faint.

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.500
And in astronomy,

00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.560
faint corresponds to
things that are far away.

00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.370
So that's one aspect of distance.

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:04.180
Another aspect of distance,

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.630
because space we usually
think of as three dimensions,

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:08.410
but of course, if you're a
physicist, you might think:

01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:10.800
well maybe not, maybe
it's nine, 10, or 11,

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.240
and we can debate about that,

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.480
but we're gonna today stick
to three dimensions of space

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.990
and one dimension of time.

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:20.460
So my thinking about
space is four dimensional.

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.683
So we have distance,

01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:24.320
which is our distance away from us,

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.140
and then in a plane of the sky,

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.800
what we see out in the universe,

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.320
there's two dimensions of space,

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.570
and then of course there's time.

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:32.220
So we're gonna come back to time.

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:37.217
Now, this is the humbling part.

01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:38.813
(laughs)

01:00:38.813 --> 01:00:42.460
It used to be we thought we
were the center here on Earth.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.120
We thought space surrounded us

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.970
and that we were at
the epicenter of space.

01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:48.530
But of course, with Galileo,

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:52.260
Galileo who was committed to house arrest

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:55.300
for this radical notion that we were not

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.800
at the center of everything,

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.140
we now recognize that the Earth
is just one of many planets

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.750
that orbit the sun,

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.540
which in fact is quite ordinary.
So in fact we had a phase

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.360
where we thought the sun was special.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.370
But now we realize not even the sun

01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:10.500
that we orbit is special.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.080
Our galaxy is composed of roughly

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.210
100 billion stars like the sun.

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:20.112
The sun you can think
of as a middle age star,

01:01:20.112 --> 01:01:23.011
ready to go out and get
that red sports car.

01:01:23.011 --> 01:01:23.844
(audience laughing)

01:01:23.844 --> 01:01:25.240
It's five billion years old.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.260
It's halfway through its lifetime,

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:31.210
which is also another humbling
thought in terms of space.

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:34.740
Our sun, when it runs
out of gas, and it will,

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.530
in another five billion years,

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:37.810
is going to expand.

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:39.680
So we live in a dynamic universe,

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:43.870
and it will expand to envelop the Earth.

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:47.120
So if you ever forget what
order the planets come in

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.440
just remember the TV show
Third Rock From The Sun,

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.653
or Third Rock, because we are
the third rock from the sun.

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:55.860
So at some point the sun
will actually envelop us,

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.710
which actually I think really drives us

01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:59.780
to think about exploring space.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.990
Can we get off this rock and go further?

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:04.500
Because there will be a moment,

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.380
if we manage to survive,

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:09.510
where we will need to
explore the larger universe

01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:11.263
by moving.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.590
All right, so in our
universe, we not only,

01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:16.630
we have the sun, and
we said that there's...

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:18.000
The sun is pretty typical,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.610
and now we have the
ability to recognize that

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:26.060
the stage that the sun
is in is pretty boring,

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:29.120
actually it's pretty
static, fortunately for us.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.090
But there are some really
interesting and dynamic parts

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:34.600
of a star's life.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.080
Just like a human's life,

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.860
the most exciting parts tend to be

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.730
the beginning and the end.

01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:40.563
So in the beginning,

01:02:40.563 --> 01:02:43.220
this is a picture that shows
the beginning of stars' lives.

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.850
And if you go further with this analogy

01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:48.040
with a human lifetime,

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.580
the birth of a star

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:53.250
compared to the age of
a typical star's life

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:55.450
is like a human gestation period.

01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:58.480
So on stars' timescales,

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.070
this is a few million years of time passes

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:04.600
as the star goes through
the process of collapsing

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.100
from enormous scales,

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.873
down to the size of our
sun and our solar system.

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:11.890
So this is the beginning.

01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:15.990
Now, just like humans,
the end is also exciting.

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:18.679
We already alluded to the end of the sun,

01:03:18.679 --> 01:03:22.410
but in fact our sun is
a fairly small star,

01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:25.540
and it ends its life...

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.280
Well, while we say it's gonna be dramatic

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.460
because it's gonna envelop the Earth,

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.620
in an astronomical sense it's
actually rather non-dramatic.

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:35.830
The massive stars are
the ones that explode.

01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:38.470
This is a picture of an exploding star.

01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:40.380
So we have a dynamic
(mumbles) nervous again

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.230
because if we go from
things at the beginning

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:45.210
that are shrinking to at the
end where things are expanding,

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.100
and expanding quite explosively.

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.090
And in this explosion,

01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:51.470
it's actually where we get
the chemical complexity

01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:54.270
that we so appreciate here on Earth.

01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:58.940
Our universe starts off
with incredible simplicity.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.740
It's just hydrogen.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:03.070
And out of the inner workings of stars

01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:06.220
we can build up to more
chemical complexity,

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:10.880
up to iron, but in fact iron
is a pretty simple atom.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.410
And it's only in these
exploding massive stars

01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:17.570
that we get all the complexity
that we so appreciate here,

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:20.620
like gold, or anything
that your cellphones

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:23.320
are created from,

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.773
are created in these
explosions of massive stars.

01:04:28.388 --> 01:04:31.280
Now we've gone from a point where we said

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.990
the Earth was the middle, to
the sun that was the middle.

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:36.430
And then a mere hundred years ago,

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:38.510
and to me this is rather amazing,

01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:42.322
100 years ago we thought
our own galaxy was it.

01:04:42.322 --> 01:04:43.155
(laughing)

01:04:43.155 --> 01:04:46.600
And today, we recognize that our galaxy,

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.080
and if we could get outside
our own galaxy and look back,

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.950
this is what our galaxy would look like.

01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:52.923
We live about halfway out.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:56.170
It's just one of many, many, many,

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:59.109
billions and billions of galaxies,

01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.942
(laughing)

01:04:59.942 --> 01:05:01.890
as many others have said.

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:03.920
The galaxy that I was just
showing you a moment ago

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.020
is the one in the top left.

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:09.380
So today we understand that in fact

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:12.900
there's a universe that's on
a much, much larger scale.

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:16.800
So in the last mere hundred
years of our history

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.060
we've come to understand the
vastness of the universe.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.829
Now, (laughs)

01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:25.130
(audience laughing)

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:28.600
we collect this information
primarily through telescopes.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.130
We're collecting light, or photons,

01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:33.430
which are little light packets.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.800
And it turns out that these light packets,

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.590
these carriers of information,

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:40.560
do not travel at infinite speed,

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.180
but they travel at the speed of light,

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.990
which we actually think of
as the cosmic speed limit.

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:47.609
Nothing can go faster in our universe

01:05:47.609 --> 01:05:49.690
than the speed of light.

01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:52.870
But this means that as
we study the universe,

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:57.700
we're not seeing it as it is today,

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.710
but rather as it is when that photon

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:03.630
that you're collecting
was emitted from it.

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:08.630
And because we are now studying
scales that are so big,

01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:11.740
what we're really getting
is a history lesson.

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:14.600
And to give you a sense of this,

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.930
I study the center of the galaxy.

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:18.570
That's my favorite place
in the universe to look at.

01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:23.440
The light from the center of
the galaxy takes 26,000 years

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.910
to get from the center of
the galaxy to our telescopes.

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:29.790
So I have to say I'm very excited

01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:32.479
about an event that's happening,

01:06:32.479 --> 01:06:36.333
just culminating now
over the last six months.

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:40.830
But that six months
happened 26,000 years ago.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:44.730
Okay, so that's already
mind blowing to me.

01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:47.980
But that's nothing in astrophysics.

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:51.840
So once we get going to
the next closest galaxy,

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.840
we're talking two million years ago.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.160
That's the light that we're collecting.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.810
And when we talk about
the edge of the universe

01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:01.720
that we can see today,

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.200
we're looking back 14 billion years ago.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.110
So in fact we're not seeing
these places in space (laughs)

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:14.190
as they are today, but
as they were so long ago.

01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:16.430
So that's one way in which space

01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:18.863
is highly connected to time.

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:23.570
Now there's another way in which
space is connected to time,

01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:25.860
and that's if you get near objects

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.980
that have large gravitational fields.

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.960
My favorite subjects in
the universe to study

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.960
are black holes.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.500
Turns out there's a
super massive black hole

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:33.840
at the center of the galaxy (laughs)

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.900
or a million (laughs)
times the mass of the sun,

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:40.490
crammed into a space the
size of our solar system.

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:42.124
So, lots of mass, small space,

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:44.110
that's the proof of a black hole.

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:45.860
But why do we care about it in the context

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.360
of this discussion?

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:50.100
We care about it in the
context of this discussion

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:52.590
because when you get near black holes

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:55.750
or any object that has
a gravitational field,

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:58.900
you get this mixing of space and time.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.470
So if you go to any science museum,

01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:03.170
there's the classic gravity well,

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:06.650
and that's supposed to
represent the concept

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:09.760
of two dimensions of space being mixed.

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.580
They flatten that one dimension of space

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.250
with one dimension of time.

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:15.030
So, if you were to send your buddy,

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:16.430
or maybe not so much your buddy,

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:17.360
into the black hole,

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.000
(audience laughing)

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000
you would see your buddy
get slower and slower

01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:28.600
and then pause at a magic
distance from the black hole

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.660
known as the event horizon.

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:30.800
They'd just stop.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.630
And that's because it's
very hard for the photon

01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:35.700
that's the carrier of
information to make it

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.250
from them to us.

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:38.940
It's the mixing of space-time.

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:43.530
Your buddy, his experience,
or her experience,

01:08:43.530 --> 01:08:45.220
would be to get faster and faster

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.320
and go right through the event horizon.

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.310
So that is an aspect of space

01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:52.403
that I find particularly fascinating.

01:08:54.634 --> 01:08:57.142
I'm just gonna skip over these things.

01:08:57.142 --> 01:09:02.142
Just to share that our ability
to study space and time

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.130
is advanced by having larger
and larger telescopes.

01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:08.140
So UC has had the largest
telescope in the world

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:09.250
for 100 years.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:12.135
The Keck telescope is just
the latest and greatest.

01:09:12.135 --> 01:09:14.100
It's been around for 25 years.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.980
But we're in the middle of building

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:18.610
an even bigger telescope.

01:09:18.610 --> 01:09:20.833
It is a 30 meter telescope,

01:09:22.963 --> 01:09:26.300
which we hope will be built in Hawaii,

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.020
and it's a collaboration between

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:32.352
the University of
California, Caltech, Canada,

01:09:32.352 --> 01:09:34.870
Japan, China, and India.

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:38.421
So that brings is into
other connections of space,

01:09:38.421 --> 01:09:39.890
and connectivity in the world

01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:42.500
that brings us back to a human scale.

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.056
So thank you very much.

01:09:44.056 --> 01:09:45.579
(audience applause)

01:09:45.579 --> 01:09:48.819
- [Brett] Thank you.

01:09:48.819 --> 01:09:50.677
Thank you, everyone.

01:09:50.677 --> 01:09:52.950
Indeed, thank you, all four of you.

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:55.156
As an audience member
that was just awesome.

01:09:55.156 --> 01:09:55.989
(panel laughing)

01:09:55.989 --> 01:09:56.860
Really fantastic.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.200
I don't know, I arrived a little late

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.750
and I can't remember how
the order was sorted,

01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:04.018
but let me just say there
was some inspiration

01:10:04.018 --> 01:10:07.340
in this idea of going from the molecular

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:11.020
to the room, or gallery,

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.490
to the city, and to the galaxy.

01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:15.040
So our work is done.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.253
We have covered the spectrum.

01:10:16.253 --> 01:10:17.086
(audience laughing)

01:10:17.086 --> 01:10:18.180
That's really interesting.

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:22.340
And of course that would beg
follow on questions immediately

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:28.423
about the negotiating role of an idea

01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:34.690
of scale or size in relation
to a concept like space,

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:37.960
that I think each of you
touches on really interestingly.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:42.710
But to throw an immediate
question out for each of you,

01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:45.020
and maybe so that you can respond

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.040
to other things heard on the stage,

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.050
I'm struck by the way in which each of you

01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:54.050
touched on the importance
of a particular kind of tool

01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:56.380
from which you then spoke about space.

01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:59.820
So in some cases, a kind of
technology, a microscope,

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:04.820
a telescope, a tool in the
sense of an institution

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.060
or a museum as being
a vital idea of sight,

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.910
that then a project reacts to.

01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:12.358
And in the case of the city, Dana,

01:11:12.358 --> 01:11:15.370
the notion of a map or
a geography described

01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:17.803
through various
representational conventions.

01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:23.470
Could you say something
about your daily lives

01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:26.120
and routines around the
way in which the tools

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.090
that are clearly a part of your lives

01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:30.890
help you think about the
work that you're doing?

01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:32.630
Or does all that sort of sit on the side

01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:35.923
as we just sit in the world
of ideas and concepts?

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:44.890
- [Dana] Well, I can't think
without representational tools,

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.513
period.

01:11:46.513 --> 01:11:50.220
I mean, I have to have
diagrams that both reduce

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:55.040
the kinds of information that
is spurious and competing,

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.710
and that takes the scale of whatever it is

01:11:57.710 --> 01:12:00.710
that I'm looking at, and synthesizes.

01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:03.490
So, mapping has turned out to be a...

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:07.290
If you think of mapping broadly,
and the process of mapping,

01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:09.220
has turned out to be a really fundamental

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:10.603
part of my work now.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.800
I mean, it seems to me
that, Andrea, yours is,

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.113
you have to have the biggest tool,

01:12:18.113 --> 01:12:23.113
because that's, I mean, this
must be like a political act.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.120
My command of the tool is
also mostly in my power.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.010
But in your case it would seem like

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:34.520
it's absolutely outside your power.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.040
- [Andrea] We have a very
collaborative space (laughs).

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.530
- Yeah.

01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:40.550
- In working with these
very large telescopes,

01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:42.460
because it's a huge investment

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:46.763
so you have to share that tool.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.660
Another connection though
is our desire to map.

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:53.340
So we are definitely making maps,

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:58.340
and our ability to visualize
the information or the space

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.053
really affects your
ability to understand it.

01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:06.940
An animation that I skipped
was our ability to map out

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.070
these orbits that are in three dimensions,

01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:10.980
and see them from different perspectives,

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.280
because of course in two dimensions

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.240
you have a very different understanding

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.970
about the space between objects,

01:13:15.970 --> 01:13:19.030
which is enormous, but
they seem to overlap

01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:20.980
when you only look at it in projection.

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:25.073
- Most of our time is spent
building or fixing tools.

01:13:25.073 --> 01:13:25.906
(laughing)

01:13:25.906 --> 01:13:30.906
It's the feast at the end
of preparing massively

01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:34.560
for that time when you can record data,

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.110
or develop a new capability

01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:38.130
that you get to see from the outside.

01:13:38.130 --> 01:13:40.110
But, for instance, there is a microscope

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:42.822
we've been trying to make
work for 29 years now.

01:13:42.822 --> 01:13:44.770
(laughs) And we're getting closer,

01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:47.850
but the student who was
working on it just graduated

01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:48.990
so we'll start a new PhD.

01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:50.980
You know, you learn things along the way,

01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:54.729
but we come up with a
problem we wanna solve,

01:13:54.729 --> 01:13:57.880
and then we try and
develop a tool to do that,

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.160
whether it's understanding chemistry,

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.800
or light coming out of
an object and so forth.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:05.940
I mean, one advantage...

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.120
I have a very bad sense of direction.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.670
So, a nice thing about the nano scale is

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:14.170
we make it so everything
looks the same everywhere,

01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:15.370
so you can choose any part

01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:17.040
and sort of get the statistics you need.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.990
We don't have to find the
star that does this, or...

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:25.250
And so, we can find, you
know, here's the arrangement

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:28.750
we wanted to see many times repeated,

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:31.130
and then do the measurements and discover

01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:32.360
that they all behave differently,

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.440
and even individuals
could change over time.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.630
So the fun comes at the end,

01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:39.750
but there's a lot of work
that goes every day, yeah.

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:40.583
- [Brett] Rodrigo.

01:14:40.583 --> 01:14:41.853
- I mean, it's interesting being able to

01:14:41.853 --> 01:14:46.103
continually use tools
that look like the tool

01:14:46.103 --> 01:14:49.015
that is required for the job.

01:14:49.015 --> 01:14:54.015
I have to encounter a lot where
the tools I use to make art,

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.420
like I spend a lot of time
in Home Depot, and I spend...

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.700
All the things that you make work,

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:03.120
they have a patina that
they are not art, right?

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:08.120
And you conduct meaning from
things into something else.

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:15.090
Like in my space, I have white walls,

01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:17.863
and the only conditions
of the world I make there

01:15:17.863 --> 01:15:21.803
is that you need to be
able to leave the room.

01:15:21.803 --> 01:15:23.410
That's like, that is the
only condition of the world

01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:25.250
to be made inside the
studio that at some point

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:27.110
I have to get it through the door.

01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:30.622
And that is like the only
scale that is important.

01:15:30.622 --> 01:15:32.329
(audience laughing)

01:15:32.329 --> 01:15:33.670
So all the things that happen there,

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:36.040
and all the potential of the buildings,

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.014
the materials that I use,
I use a lot of clay...

01:15:39.014 --> 01:15:41.810
I'm a photographer but I use
clay, I use wood, I use metal,

01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:43.600
and as you saw I use graphite,

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.930
I use all the materials that they are made

01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:49.513
for other situations that are
not necessarily art sometimes.

01:15:50.838 --> 01:15:55.176
So it's interesting thinking
about how everything start

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:58.143
in art in a more unfinished way,

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:03.950
and you surrendered yourself
with cultural gravitas

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:06.540
or material memory,

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:10.000
things like that that will
make a work of art work,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.070
like be performing as a cultural object.

01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:14.990
Now, I'm interested in this, I mean,

01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:18.430
thinking about low income
housing, or you know those idea,

01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:20.570
they have a house project in Chile,

01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:24.590
the Chilean architect
that makes the houses

01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:28.080
after the earthquake, he gives half house.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.000
- [Dina] It's Aravena.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.530
- Yeah, like Aravena, yeah, right.

01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:33.570
And it's like something
that people can finish,

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:35.720
you know, it's like
something that people can go

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.660
and buy their own materials
to customize their house,

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:41.010
so you build it enough to
make a cheap but sustainable,

01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:42.400
and then you can just,

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.460
as you make money through your lifetime,

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:46.170
you can customize it and fix it.

01:16:46.170 --> 01:16:47.443
And it's a really interesting project,

01:16:47.443 --> 01:16:48.276
that you could just look at it,

01:16:48.276 --> 01:16:51.250
it's like, some of them not
an interesting piece of work.

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:53.510
You know, it's like,
and when they are empty

01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:55.220
they are full of potential.

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.090
So I like that about this point,

01:16:57.090 --> 01:17:02.090
but it's a place where they
have more potential than beauty,

01:17:02.098 --> 01:17:05.290
and that is usually an
interesting junction of art

01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:06.680
in some way.

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.200
- [Dana] It's interesting to think about

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.060
whether you can construct
a work that's not finished.

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:11.893
- Yeah.
- And I think

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:14.820
that's not been a long
history in architecture,

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:17.870
when you think of it having
to be somehow completed.

01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:22.050
But that project in particular
was kind of brilliant,

01:17:22.050 --> 01:17:25.597
in that it expected it to keep changing

01:17:25.597 --> 01:17:27.513
and evolving and growing.

01:17:29.191 --> 01:17:31.670
- Which is, as a comment,

01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:35.180
touches on this idea of
a space of production,

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:36.750
or a project's reception,

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:39.440
which I'm interested in
everybody's case here.

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.280
You all, other than this Tuesday evening,

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.920
are speaking to audiences

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:48.137
of a very different form than this one.

01:17:48.137 --> 01:17:51.090
I was gonna ask a question
about what it means

01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:53.977
to come to an audience like
this and speak about your work

01:17:53.977 --> 01:17:57.520
and your ideas about
a question like space,

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.150
versus what that audience is like

01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:02.600
in your daily working lives,

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:06.270
or the public efforts that
you make to explain that work

01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:08.090
to different kinds of audiences.

01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:08.923
- [Paul] Mm-hmm (affirmative).

01:18:10.828 --> 01:18:12.630
Shall I?
- Yeah.

01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:15.820
- Well, I mean, they're very
different groups we speak to,

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:19.250
so there are times when
it's, you know, clinicians

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:23.837
trying to edit genes, and we
have some efforts we do there,

01:18:23.837 --> 01:18:25.960
and that's a very knowledgeable community

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:29.900
on what they wanna do, and what
their current problems are.

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:31.720
There are other much more diverse groups

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:36.150
where it could be people
who come from any field

01:18:36.150 --> 01:18:40.031
and lack the chemical background

01:18:40.031 --> 01:18:42.910
where it's straightforward explanations of

01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:45.300
here's what we're trying to do and why,

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:47.830
a matter, here is what we like.

01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:50.470
We do a fair amount of public work too,

01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:53.120
trying to say we're exploring this world

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.070
where people haven't been before,

01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:58.770
and it just opened up in
the last 30 years to us,

01:18:58.770 --> 01:19:00.564
and there's still a tremendous
amount we don't know,

01:19:00.564 --> 01:19:01.750
and we don't know what it feels like.

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:03.140
Gravity doesn't matter.

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.670
Capillary forces do.

01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:08.179
What are the other rules
we don't understand yet?

01:19:08.179 --> 01:19:11.610
And that, just saying why we do what we do

01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:14.193
ends up being really a
part of the conversation.

01:19:15.433 --> 01:19:16.420
- [Brett] Andrea.

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.320
- Well I think astronomy
is an interesting field

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.810
because I often think of
it as the gateway science.

01:19:21.810 --> 01:19:23.810
It's the gateway drug, it's
the beginning (laughs).

01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:27.550
We live in a highly technological society,

01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:30.802
and yet, unfortunately,
we're also incredibly phobic

01:19:30.802 --> 01:19:32.750
of math and science.

01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:36.797
So I think astronomy and
astrophysics has this societal role

01:19:40.116 --> 01:19:44.480
in bringing the language
of science and technology

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.540
to the public.

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:49.030
So as a result, you see a
lot of astronomers who are

01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:51.871
incredibly committed to this
public engagement piece.

01:19:51.871 --> 01:19:53.729
- [Brett] Yeah.

01:19:53.729 --> 01:19:55.650
- So I engage in a lot of this

01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:58.010
not only because I think it's important,

01:19:58.010 --> 01:20:00.340
not only because I think
in terms of understanding

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.930
what a scientist looks like,

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:04.013
but also because these
telescopes are really expensive.

01:20:04.013 --> 01:20:05.079
(laughs)

01:20:05.079 --> 01:20:07.310
(audience laughing)

01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:09.750
And it's really important that we engage

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:10.940
a lot of different audiences.

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:13.450
And now, actually there's
another interesting issue,

01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:16.280
coming back to your other
question about space.

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:18.830
We wanna build this in Hawaii.

01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:21.410
And now there are communities in Hawaii

01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:24.180
that are no longer so
excited about being viewed

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:27.100
as a place of colonization.

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:31.290
So also astronomy has now taken
on this other, I'd call it,

01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:34.830
it's like a lightning post.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.900
It's a big project that symbolizes

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:42.393
this western kind of taking over.

01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.540
So all of a sudden astronomers

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.930
are being put in this
position of talking about

01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:49.855
why it's good to make these
investments in science.

01:20:49.855 --> 01:20:53.420
And as we use these
telescopes in different ways,

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:55.180
we are becoming more removed,

01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:58.500
which is removing us
spatially from that community.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.720
So now all of a sudden
we're spending a lot of time

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.510
thinking about how can we
get back into that space

01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:06.040
where actually the telescope is?

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.670
So I guess I find myself increasingly,

01:21:09.670 --> 01:21:11.440
while I spend a lot of
time obviously thinking

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.500
about the technical (laughs),

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:17.500
and speaking to scientists
and technical people,

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.350
this idea of public dissemination,

01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:23.073
public engagement is
increasingly important.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.570
- I'm gonna open it up to the audience

01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:27.620
in a couple of minutes time.

01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:28.890
One of the topics though that came up

01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:31.800
that I was really struck
by across the spectrum

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.210
of presentations is that a
different notion of space

01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:37.940
than had been foregrounded
in the larger question,

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:40.640
which is a space of collaboration,

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:42.020
and not just production.

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:45.340
I'm really struck by the
different ways that you gave us

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:47.400
glimpses into very
different ways of working.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.050
I mean, the expertise that
sits within your teams

01:21:50.050 --> 01:21:51.240
in the research lab,

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.340
your work geographically
across distances between tools,

01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:59.403
and in yourself, and collaborators
back in the laboratory,

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:03.090
the different constituencies
across the city,

01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:07.300
and I'm just wondering if any
of you would have comments

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:11.050
on the extent to which
your thoughts around

01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:13.630
the building of that
collaborative space is

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:16.853
in and of itself a kind of
project within your work.

01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:19.980
- [Dana] Well there is
no making architecture

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:22.120
without a giant collaboration.

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.610
I mean, we were talking
about whether what precision

01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:27.570
is like from nano scale
to architectural scale,

01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:31.020
and I think I might make
the case that the precision

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:34.410
in architecture is absolutely dependent

01:22:34.410 --> 01:22:36.070
on the collaboration.

01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:38.610
Precision meaning that
you'd like to implement

01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:41.350
the thing that you're
trying to create (laughs).

01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:43.090
And that that thing
you're trying to create,

01:22:43.090 --> 01:22:46.410
I mean, my first book was
about that being a negotiation,

01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:49.470
not something that comes
from the fountainhead

01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:52.200
of some individual creator.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:56.390
And I think that we don't
think about that space

01:22:56.390 --> 01:23:01.390
of collaboration as
creative practices enough.

01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:05.140
And in my experience,
really that's kind of what

01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:07.760
I've been most interestingly
involved with is

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:12.400
how you make something that's
really good and important,

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:17.400
with army, or crowd of actors.

01:23:18.330 --> 01:23:19.330
- [Brett] Yeah.

01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:20.163
Thank you.

01:23:20.163 --> 01:23:25.120
- I kind of envy Rodrigo's
ability to manipulate a room,

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.500
even although I think
your audience is something

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.450
you're constructing all the
time as a bigger collaboration.

01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:33.963
- Yeah, I mean, there is a
generosity that has to happen,

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.875
you know, as a...

01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:38.970
I mean, I don't know how it
is in your guys' discipline,

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:43.970
but I rely on the students,
or my assistants sometimes,

01:23:44.190 --> 01:23:48.610
or people to finish
the thought too, right?

01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:50.905
That you present the
possibilities and ideas,

01:23:50.905 --> 01:23:55.905
and there is so much I can
teach to students in art

01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:59.070
that they are like, it's
not already inside them.

01:23:59.070 --> 01:24:01.450
Like it's not within
them, their capacities.

01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:04.370
You know, I can't tell you,

01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:06.670
so you have to instigate
that curiosity for them

01:24:06.670 --> 01:24:09.030
to figure out where is there space.

01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:11.763
And the same with when I go these museums,

01:24:12.617 --> 01:24:14.810
you know, I cannot even
touch anything, right?

01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:16.420
There is a raised art, there is (mumbles).

01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.400
So you have to trust that
everybody else want you

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.545
to also execute this criticality
I have about the spaces,

01:24:23.545 --> 01:24:25.100
onto themselves.

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.067
You know, so you have to
first figure out how to

01:24:27.067 --> 01:24:30.350
you're gonna convince
them that being critical

01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:32.020
of the space where they work,

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:34.060
you're gonna be good
without getting fired.

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:36.970
So it's just like, it's
just this skill of finesse

01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:39.010
and talking about the ideas

01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:41.323
and how to contextualize them correctly.

01:24:45.217 --> 01:24:48.120
That requires a lot of
communication skills.

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:51.250
And a lot of the time just to let people

01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:52.800
throw your ideas to you,

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.800
and you're gonna respond more
than lecture and let people.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.093
- [Brett] Yeah, terrific.

01:24:59.093 --> 01:24:59.926
- [Paul] Mm-hmm, terrific.

01:24:59.926 --> 01:25:03.540
Yeah, that actually is
where nanoscience came from.

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:05.580
We didn't have a field,
so we brought in people

01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:09.210
from chemistry, physics, math,
engineering and medicine,

01:25:09.210 --> 01:25:11.557
and said, "What problems do you care about

01:25:11.557 --> 01:25:13.030
"that you can't solve?"

01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:14.587
And then, "What approaches do you take

01:25:14.587 --> 01:25:16.960
"and what tools do you
have and what do you need?"

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.800
And so the field developed
by teaching each other

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:22.210
language skills, and then--

01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:23.270
- [Brett] Between the disciplines.

01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:26.780
- Absolutely, yeah, and
between then experimental

01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:28.980
and theory skills, and math,

01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:31.550
we actually share not only the same math

01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:35.800
but the same mathematicians
on our projects.

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.290
But that's also led us
out of the nano scale.

01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:40.970
So, the brain initiative came

01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:43.094
from nano scientists proposing it,

01:25:43.094 --> 01:25:46.260
because we were curious
about how the brain worked.

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:49.460
And then microbiome initiative
also not really nano,

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:51.700
but we thought, well there
are a lot of missing tools

01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:54.020
for how bugs talk to
each other in our mouths,

01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:57.440
on our skin, in the ocean and the soil.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.740
And so it really developed from
collecting a group of people

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.030
who had the language skills,

01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:07.490
and then experts who had the
refractory problems to tackle.

01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:11.350
That's been really the impact of the field

01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:14.350
beyond making little things
and moving atoms around,

01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:17.470
and trying to understand how
motors worked in biology.

01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:19.380
- [Brett] And clearly a
capacity for translation

01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:20.503
between forms of knowledge of--

01:26:20.503 --> 01:26:21.513
- That's the sort of
interesting part of the--

01:26:21.513 --> 01:26:23.330
- [Brett] They truly allow communication.

01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:25.420
- Yeah, and hasn't happened in
other fields that we can tell

01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:26.720
which we don't understand.

01:26:27.903 --> 01:26:28.990
- Yeah, terrific.
- But it's part of the fun.

01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:30.550
- [Brett] I think I'm getting
a signal that we can...

01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:32.620
We have a couple of
microphones in the room,

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.200
and we really want this
to be an important part

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.180
of each of the sessions.

01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:37.193
We can open it up to some questions,

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.150
for the next several minutes.

01:26:39.150 --> 01:26:41.450
I don't know where the microphones are.

01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:42.283
There we go.

01:26:42.283 --> 01:26:43.893
And I see some hands coming up.

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:49.380
- [Student] Thank you
guys so much for the talk.

01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:53.283
What do you think spirituality's
relationship to space is?

01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:58.725
- Well, I'll take that one (laughs).

01:26:58.725 --> 01:26:59.558
(laughing)

01:26:59.558 --> 01:27:02.470
It turns out astronomers are
actually some of the most

01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:08.810
religious, spiritual of the scientists,

01:27:08.985 --> 01:27:10.660
and in fact there's an
interesting foundation

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:13.120
called the Templeton
Foundation that supports work

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.440
at the interface between
science and religion.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:20.630
I think it's interesting to really...

01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:25.390
I think the comment I made
about the humbling piece,

01:27:26.442 --> 01:27:28.440
that you definitely get the
sense of something bigger,

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.840
it's so much bigger than we are,

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:32.483
both in terms of space and time.

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:37.083
It can't but leave you with
that sense of something bigger.

01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:44.120
- On this side over here.

01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:51.400
- [Student] I'd like to address this both

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.973
to Professor Cuff and Rodrigo.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:59.450
You talked a lot about, you
didn't say the words exactly,

01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:03.810
but transformation
re-utilization appropriation,

01:28:03.810 --> 01:28:06.210
maybe those aren't the
right words, reclamation.

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:12.093
And the whole concept starting,
well, Hausmann, Corbu,

01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:15.050
Bunker Hill, et cetera,

01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:18.210
the freeways taking over
and so on and so forth,

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:22.210
and down to this concept
that you brought forth

01:28:22.210 --> 01:28:24.930
which is the backyard home,

01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:28.440
which is a space that was never used for,

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:31.130
well, it was used for a
garage to hold the car.

01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:35.180
But the fact that it was
brought up a long time ago

01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:39.800
but hasn't advanced very much, has it?

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:44.663
This whole concept of reusing space,

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:49.930
that you brought up, that
we need all over the world,

01:28:49.930 --> 01:28:52.490
basically, but especially here in L.A.

01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:55.850
- I'm not sure if you quite
understand what you mean

01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:57.480
by advanced very much,

01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.511
but I think the answer is no,

01:28:59.511 --> 01:29:01.180
(laughs) it hasn't advanced very much.

01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:03.540
And in fact, we learned about,

01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:08.350
I mean, anyone can learn
about that space's reclamation

01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:11.400
from watching what had
been going on in backyards

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.740
for the last 200 years, right?

01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:16.460
We learned it from bottom up practices,

01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:18.460
from vernacular practices.

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:21.670
There's really wonderful books and studies

01:29:21.670 --> 01:29:24.670
about how people in Bell Gardens,

01:29:24.670 --> 01:29:28.630
and other parts of the blue
collar life of Los Angeles

01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:32.590
have always used their
residential space as

01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:37.010
an income generating part of
their household economy, so--

01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:38.462
- [Student] I was asking about this,

01:29:38.462 --> 01:29:41.070
like how, with the number,
I don't know what that is,

01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:43.500
wasn't that some special
ordinance that just--

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:48.500
- Yes, yes, that's the state
bill that we co-authored

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:54.400
to make legal all these secondary units.

01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:56.000
- [Student] Because they
weren't legal before.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.240
- That's right.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.090
So they were all illegal.

01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:02.350
And now we're trying to
figure out how to legalize

01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:05.000
the ones that are already in existence.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.110
I'm sorry I didn't make that clear.

01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.973
There you go.

01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:10.474
Yeah.

01:30:10.474 --> 01:30:11.423
- Over here.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.730
- [Student] Again, thank you very much

01:30:14.730 --> 01:30:17.240
for a very, very great discussion.

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.720
I was wondering, you talked
about objects in space,

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:24.720
and on the micro level
and the macro level,

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:27.580
and about building in
space and defining space.

01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:29.640
I was wondering if you
wanted to talk about

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:32.610
the other part of it,
which is this space itself,

01:30:32.610 --> 01:30:35.700
which is the part the you're pinching on

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:37.483
of the objects existent,

01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:43.600
which is also the name of
the committee itself, space.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.640
I mean the focus of this.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:49.143
It is the other element, the
one we haven't talked about.

01:30:50.513 --> 01:30:52.523
- I mean, I think it's connected,

01:30:52.523 --> 01:30:57.190
because the spaces are so
predetermined by these ideas

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:00.980
that come from the anthology of the world,

01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:03.060
or the depending of what you are trying

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.170
to determinate as a space, right?

01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:08.270
Like, as somebody was asking
about the spirituality,

01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:11.150
there is often a space
where that happens, right?

01:31:11.150 --> 01:31:13.820
There is like, you go to
a place that have walls

01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:17.390
and that have a ceiling where
that spirituality happens,

01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:20.430
and that is already charged
with a political history,

01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:22.790
and a specific kind of traditions,

01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:25.100
so in some way you enter...

01:31:26.377 --> 01:31:29.193
There is almost any space,

01:31:30.225 --> 01:31:32.864
like the Rutger Chapel
out in Houston, right?

01:31:32.864 --> 01:31:34.563
It's full of paintings.

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:38.703
And you can enter, and I think,

01:31:40.497 --> 01:31:42.650
I don't know who profits more

01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:45.190
of the feeling of spirituality.

01:31:45.190 --> 01:31:48.860
Maybe the artists gets
charged with something

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:52.440
that necessarily is not
intrinsic to purple paint.

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:57.160
So it's like just the artists
don't have a spiritual home,

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.680
have God on them, they're
acting like they had...

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:04.680
The artist definitely is not
touched by any mystery force.

01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:10.550
So it's interesting when
the space is already charged

01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:14.200
before you even consider them
what's gonna happen there,

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.940
like there is a certain
amount of activities

01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:16.974
that can happen,

01:32:16.974 --> 01:32:19.560
and in some way when I
make movies like that,

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:21.230
when in most of my movies,

01:32:21.230 --> 01:32:24.270
I try to build the space
where actions can happen,

01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:27.010
rather than predetermine
the actors to do it,

01:32:27.010 --> 01:32:31.220
because people will
naturally respond to spaces.

01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:35.060
Like everybody in the elevator
have elevator face, right?

01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:37.286
They're like, you have
elevator conversations,

01:32:37.286 --> 01:32:38.119
(laughing)

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:39.728
and you have elevator attitude, you know?

01:32:39.728 --> 01:32:42.900
So like this, like this,
you're like, that's a space.

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.710
You know, there is no
such thing as small talk

01:32:45.710 --> 01:32:46.990
in the middle of the desert.

01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:49.480
You run into anyone in the desert,

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.350
and suddenly things become more profound,

01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:53.910
when you have a conversation.

01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:57.430
And any random comment that
some stranger will tell you,

01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:59.480
if you encounter in the
middle of the desert,

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:01.230
I don't know why you're
gonna get closer to that guy,

01:33:01.230 --> 01:33:05.806
but it will be like, "Holy
fuck, that means something."

01:33:05.806 --> 01:33:06.670
(audience laughing)

01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:08.710
And then you're gonna
walk around thinking,

01:33:08.710 --> 01:33:11.270
trying to search for the
meaning of that one line

01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:15.110
that some wandering guy give you.

01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:17.420
So the spaces are like,
even if doesn't have walls,

01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:21.057
are predetermined, and you
come conditioned to find

01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:26.920
either spirituality, or
social cultural context.

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:29.160
I think it's already,
when we say the word,

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.763
they're already charged.

01:33:30.763 --> 01:33:31.763
- [Dana] Mm.

01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:37.750
- [Student] So, I have
a microphone (laughs),

01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:42.070
so thank you very much
for presenting your ideas

01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:45.740
on all these different scales.

01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:47.430
My question was related to the question

01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:51.853
that just happened about what's
going on inside the spaces,

01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:57.780
so maybe we can expand to
hearing from the other speakers

01:34:02.452 --> 01:34:05.202
about how space effects these
things inside the spaces,

01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:13.610
in motion and direction and orientation,

01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:16.920
and, yeah, movement.

01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:20.922
We're in a place where there's
performances sometimes.

01:34:20.922 --> 01:34:22.440
- [Brett] Mm-hmm (affirmative).

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:25.140
- Andrea, one of your points,
it was really memorable,

01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:26.520
it was this idea that you get a glimpse

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.253
into a universe in motion.

01:34:29.486 --> 01:34:31.420
And that that isn't just a
motion in a room this scale,

01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.570
but in fact...

01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:34.570
- Well, yeah, you can
take this to the extreme,

01:34:34.570 --> 01:34:36.100
the whole universe is in motion,

01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:38.780
the idea that we started from a point,

01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:43.530
and there was a big bang that
set the universe in motion.

01:34:43.530 --> 01:34:47.040
I'll also leave you with
the thought of the fact

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.450
that most of space is empty.

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:51.490
There's actually nothing.

01:34:51.490 --> 01:34:55.320
So while we give tremendous
value to these objects,

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.683
most of space is empty.

01:34:57.790 --> 01:34:59.560
- Yeah, also--
- I'll give motion a go.

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:02.780
So, one of our inspirations is in nature.

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:06.020
There are motors that
can take chemical energy,

01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:09.950
and convert it in motion with
better than 99% efficiency.

01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:12.430
And there is nothing
humans make at any scale

01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:13.930
that comes close to that.

01:35:13.930 --> 01:35:18.370
And so, one of the goals in
my lab is to build structures

01:35:18.370 --> 01:35:20.100
where we know where every atom is.

01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.670
We go from quantum mechanics
to mechanical engineering,

01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:24.707
and experiment, theory, and simulation,

01:35:24.707 --> 01:35:27.712
and we figure out what
are the key components

01:35:27.712 --> 01:35:29.710
of that ability to move.

01:35:29.710 --> 01:35:33.150
So that's why we have these
smallest switches and motors,

01:35:33.150 --> 01:35:35.600
and we can operate them, and
we had to build microscopes

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.330
to look at their function,

01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:39.450
at the same time they
look at the structure,

01:35:39.450 --> 01:35:41.850
at the same time that they
do other measurements,

01:35:41.850 --> 01:35:43.967
and you alluded to
something in your question

01:35:43.967 --> 01:35:46.660
of what's going on underneath the surface.

01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:49.760
That turns out to be a hard
thing for us to measure,

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:52.170
but a goal for many, many years.

01:35:52.170 --> 01:35:54.701
And so we developed a whole
series of tools to do that,

01:35:54.701 --> 01:35:58.370
and we discovered this
sort of buried network

01:35:58.370 --> 01:36:01.460
that affects properties very greatly.

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:05.290
There are pieces that
line up, pieces that move,

01:36:05.290 --> 01:36:07.140
and we've come up with
ways to detect those,

01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:09.580
and that adds an additional level

01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:12.750
of interesting observations,

01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:17.750
but also ways to control
and to make structures

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.060
that we wouldn't be able to do

01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:24.820
just by putting two pieces
right next to each other.

01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:27.490
So it turns out to be a whole...

01:36:27.490 --> 01:36:31.630
You know, like uncovering
an ant colony or something.

01:36:31.630 --> 01:36:34.410
We've learned a lot about
what's going on underneath,

01:36:34.410 --> 01:36:36.800
and the dynamics, and
the structures that form,

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:38.562
and, again, not intuitive,

01:36:38.562 --> 01:36:41.303
based on the macroscopic world around us.

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.113
- Thank you.

01:36:43.113 --> 01:36:44.440
And Rodrigo has spoken on the topic.

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.380
Dana, you mentioned in your presentation

01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:48.490
the idea of this very
modern, late modern idea

01:36:48.490 --> 01:36:51.250
of the city in motion, the
freeway becomes a part of

01:36:51.250 --> 01:36:53.707
our discourse in thinking about the city.

01:36:53.707 --> 01:36:55.940
But it's clearly a very
different kind of motion

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.040
than might exist at either a chemical

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:01.680
or a physical universal scale.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:06.680
- Yes, but I think architecture
is really about the intimacy

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:11.660
between the life within and
the thing that houses it.

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:16.410
I mean, really that is the
art form which doesn't exist

01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:18.510
without the life within it,

01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:20.920
whether that's something
you wanna describe

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:24.180
as emotion or process.

01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:27.170
Maybe that's not quite
adequate to think about

01:37:27.170 --> 01:37:30.930
the robust nature of our inhabitation.

01:37:30.930 --> 01:37:33.463
But for certain,

01:37:35.136 --> 01:37:37.900
that space, I think
that's one of the things

01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:40.980
that is interesting in
looking at the history

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:43.140
of the notion of space,

01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:46.320
is really it's a history
about the notion of the life

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:49.053
within the walls that we construct.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.640
- Wonderful, we have a
couple of minutes left,

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.140
a couple of more urgent questions.

01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:56.420
Up here on the left we have one.

01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.326
- I found the whole concept of this,

01:37:58.326 --> 01:38:00.310
the 10 questions fascinating,

01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:03.450
because you picked words that
distilled, just like in the...

01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:06.960
If you wanted to pick the
smallest particle in existence,

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:10.720
in many ways, words are
sometimes the smallest particles

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:12.810
of existence, as long as
you pick the right words,

01:38:12.810 --> 01:38:14.230
and I think you guys have
done a pretty good job

01:38:14.230 --> 01:38:15.390
picking these words.

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:17.660
So my question is to the panelists:

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:20.930
when you heard this word first, space,

01:38:20.930 --> 01:38:23.050
did you have one idea in mind,

01:38:23.050 --> 01:38:25.860
one definition of that word, or many?

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:29.890
And how did you go
about picking the anchor

01:38:29.890 --> 01:38:32.945
that you were gonna latch
yourself onto for this discussion?

01:38:32.945 --> 01:38:34.840
(panelist laughs)

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.290
- Thank you, that's terrific.

01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:39.960
- I mean, I definitely
sent right way this idea

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.840
of knowing of a space.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:44.420
I always think in maybe negative terms,

01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:45.960
but, you know...

01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:49.300
I mean, seeing the roster and considering

01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:52.250
that there was people
that think about the space

01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:55.830
in a very big way,

01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:59.033
and the poetic connotations of space,

01:38:59.910 --> 01:39:03.200
and thinking about the people
that it's so attached to time.

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:05.250
But where my brain goes right away is,

01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:08.700
it's almost closer to Dana's research

01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:15.340
where there is a time
and a space that happened

01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:16.990
when you are poor, right?

01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:19.610
There is like, poor people
get punished with time.

01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:20.880
Longer commutes.

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.530
You know, like, more distance,

01:39:22.530 --> 01:39:26.480
or you could make even
within the panel or the age,

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.770
and the kind of course, like
how far do we live from work?

01:39:30.770 --> 01:39:34.340
And you can see the
social economic strategy

01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:36.660
will be miles more from like, where is...

01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:40.930
So there is a time and
a space is conditioning

01:39:40.930 --> 01:39:45.300
in a non-poetic way to
how we cohabitate society,

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:48.820
and to me it was the first one
when you think about space,

01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:51.579
and I was thinking, "Uff, not enough."

01:39:51.579 --> 01:39:52.412
(laughing)

01:39:52.412 --> 01:39:53.372
Not enough space.

01:39:53.372 --> 01:39:54.550
- [Brett] Okay, that's not enough.

01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:55.650
This is a great question.

01:39:55.650 --> 01:39:56.850
First thing you thought of.

01:39:56.850 --> 01:39:58.070
Andrea.

01:39:58.070 --> 01:40:00.373
You get the invitation
from us, what is space?

01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:04.755
- Well, beyond thinking
that's what I do (laughs)...

01:40:04.755 --> 01:40:06.260
(audience laughing)

01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:07.466
- This is great!
- Yeah (laughs).

01:40:07.466 --> 01:40:08.299
- Yeah, yeah.

01:40:08.299 --> 01:40:11.510
- I guess I thought it would
be interesting to talk about

01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:15.130
our reference, our position in space,

01:40:15.130 --> 01:40:17.300
our understanding of ourself
with respect to the space,

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:19.899
so that understanding
of not Earth-centric,

01:40:19.899 --> 01:40:21.500
not solar-centric,

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:25.320
just this increasingly
large scale that we actually

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.943
have the ability to comprehend as humans.

01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:32.950
- So, for me, it was trying to convey

01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:35.050
getting to that unexplored world,

01:40:35.050 --> 01:40:39.180
and yeah, I'll throw in
one thing and that is

01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:41.214
astronomy was my gateway drug,

01:40:41.214 --> 01:40:42.804
- (laughs) Excellent.
(audience laughing)

01:40:42.804 --> 01:40:44.790
- to science, and until
I was eight years old,

01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:46.600
my brother blew things up in the driveway,

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.280
and then I thought well, there
must be something interesting

01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:50.313
in chemistry too (laughs).

01:40:50.313 --> 01:40:52.465
(audience laughing)

01:40:52.465 --> 01:40:53.298
- [Brett] What do you think, Dana?

01:40:53.298 --> 01:40:54.470
- [Dana] I think I kind of panicked,

01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:57.490
because like Andrea, I
think, that's what I do!

01:40:57.490 --> 01:40:59.710
Like, I'm gonna explain in 10 minutes

01:40:59.710 --> 01:41:01.577
the whole of architecture
and about what I do that...

01:41:01.577 --> 01:41:04.603
And then I was like,

01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:07.890
I went into research mode.

01:41:07.890 --> 01:41:09.690
I started reading about Einstein,

01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:11.770
and then I started reading the newspaper,

01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:13.930
and thinking about silicone valley.

01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:18.467
You know, people say, "I'm
gonna develop that space."

01:41:18.467 --> 01:41:19.665
It was like--

01:41:19.665 --> 01:41:20.498
(audience laughing)

01:41:20.498 --> 01:41:21.360
How come everybody's got space?

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.308
I thought that was ours, in architecture.

01:41:23.308 --> 01:41:24.740
(laughing)

01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:25.573
So--

01:41:25.573 --> 01:41:27.510
- [Brett] And they call
themselves information architects.

01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:28.343
- Yes, I--
- That's even more...

01:41:28.343 --> 01:41:31.102
- And they're designers, and
they're really advertisers.

01:41:31.102 --> 01:41:31.935
(laughing)

01:41:31.935 --> 01:41:33.731
You know, the whole thing
is just a subterfuge.

01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:34.630
(laughing)

01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:35.824
- Thank you.

01:41:35.824 --> 01:41:38.543
Well, one more question I
think we've got time for.

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:43.570
Down here, please, down
front we've got a couple.

01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:44.840
All right, we'll try
and squeeze in a couple

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:45.990
of more questions here.

01:41:48.150 --> 01:41:49.820
- [Student] Thank you very much.

01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:51.710
Professor Cuff, I was
really struck by your use

01:41:51.710 --> 01:41:53.280
of the phrase lost space,

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:56.807
and I was curious maybe to hear

01:41:58.550 --> 01:42:01.010
from the other three speakers
if they have a thought

01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:03.690
about what lost space means to them.

01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:09.330
- Yeah, I'm gonna try to be really short.

01:42:09.330 --> 01:42:14.330
I think since we're in a
university, let's think very...

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:19.140
I mean, I work in a great institution,

01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:23.110
and most of institutions have
a diversity mandate, right?

01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:24.740
So if I apply to a job,

01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:27.690
or if I try to go to a place where

01:42:27.690 --> 01:42:32.690
maybe there's a limit for
the space of minorities.

01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:39.860
There's a limit for space for any kind.

01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:41.293
Like even if you have
too many white dudes,

01:42:41.293 --> 01:42:43.690
there's gonna be a limit right now.

01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:46.740
So it's like, when you
think about institutions

01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:51.600
or mandates about the limits of that,

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:55.510
it may be that there is, or maybe one,

01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:58.800
like if there was another
Latino photo professor,

01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.573
there is no chance I
can get this job, right?

01:43:00.573 --> 01:43:02.550
There's no chance I can get the job.

01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:04.370
So like, that is the limit.

01:43:04.370 --> 01:43:07.073
There is a limit of like
really what are the limits

01:43:07.073 --> 01:43:10.070
that the institutions have self-imposed,

01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:12.010
and the spaces have self-imposed, right?

01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:15.440
So, like museums have a collection.

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:18.133
The collection have
necessities to complete itself,

01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:21.320
like galleries have a roster,

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.850
there is enough artist of one kind,

01:43:22.850 --> 01:43:24.800
or not enough of another kind.

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:26.640
So you have, there is always a limit,

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:28.440
and I think that is how you can understand

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:31.400
a lot of the rooms where you enter.

01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:32.233
Where is the limit of them?

01:43:32.233 --> 01:43:35.190
- So lost space, limited space...

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:37.753
One of the points you made,
Paul, at the very beginning

01:43:37.753 --> 01:43:40.087
that was interesting,
it's this idea that you,

01:43:40.087 --> 01:43:41.420
and I believe it was when you were showing

01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:43.530
the Moy Bridge animation,

01:43:43.530 --> 01:43:47.170
this idea that you occasionally
get glimpses of space.

01:43:47.170 --> 01:43:49.200
There's a kind of active interpretation.

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:51.840
- Yeah, yeah, when we try in that,

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:53.850
we try and cover this,

01:43:53.850 --> 01:43:56.520
but the factor of 100 billion in time,

01:43:57.930 --> 01:44:00.140
without really being able to do that,

01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:03.790
so we have to come up with
clever ways either to fill in

01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:06.200
or take snapshots or something else.

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.730
I'll maybe go back to
your original comment

01:44:08.730 --> 01:44:09.970
on the campus though.

01:44:09.970 --> 01:44:12.460
So, one of the very
great advantages here is

01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:16.650
we are at very high density,
and we do have the arts,

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:20.360
and science and engineering
and medicine all proximate,

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:24.450
and that's at a very unusual
aspect of the university,

01:44:24.450 --> 01:44:26.410
and particularly of the
quality of the people

01:44:26.410 --> 01:44:28.060
we have across all different areas.

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:30.800
So I feel like I've hit
a lot of the sciences

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:33.060
and engineering and a piece of medicine.

01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:34.960
I have a few tentacles up here,

01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:37.070
but I do feel like I'm missing...

01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:41.010
I have a lot to learn as I mentioned

01:44:41.010 --> 01:44:42.070
with the filmmaker at the end,

01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:45.550
and some other
collaborations in that space,

01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:46.675
if you don't mind me...

01:44:46.675 --> 01:44:47.569
(laughing)

01:44:47.569 --> 01:44:49.570
- [Dana] Just was I was thinking of.

01:44:49.570 --> 01:44:51.410
- Yeah, I know, sorry (laughs).

01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:52.970
You put it in my head and it stuck.

01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:57.843
But I think we do have a
lot to teach each other,

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:01.680
and part of it is storytelling

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:03.340
and where we come from and why,

01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:05.010
and how we think about space.

01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:08.680
And I think you chose
very uncharacteristic...

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.990
I mean, we all look at
space in a different way

01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:13.700
than I think most of the
people in our fields do.

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:16.080
That became clear.

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.480
So, I'm representative,
in some sense, it's good,

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:21.700
it expands everything, but I
think we have this opportunity

01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:24.580
here at UCLA to reach out to each other,

01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:26.110
and do things that nobody else can.

01:45:26.110 --> 01:45:28.570
We found that in our technical work,

01:45:28.570 --> 01:45:33.080
but there's much more to it
than that yet to come, I think.

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:33.913
- Terrific.

01:45:33.913 --> 01:45:35.230
Andrea?

01:45:35.230 --> 01:45:36.750
- I guess when I hear this question

01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:40.530
I think about the windows
that we have into space,

01:45:40.530 --> 01:45:43.900
that we're highly biased
by our historical ability

01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:46.580
to get optical, what your eye detects.

01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:49.250
That's where the first
instruments were developed.

01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:52.900
But there are other windows
to different kinds of light.

01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:54.580
What UCLA's really good at

01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:56.400
is the detection of infrared light.

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.980
That's what we specialize in.

01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:00.640
But there are other windows.

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:03.850
X-ray, gamma rays, and
that's all focused on light.

01:46:03.850 --> 01:46:06.100
And now we're even opening up the concept

01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:09.620
that you can detect gravitational waves.

01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:12.110
So there are these different...

01:46:12.110 --> 01:46:14.290
Coming back to this concept of diversity,

01:46:14.290 --> 01:46:17.406
one needs a diversity of information

01:46:17.406 --> 01:46:19.560
to paint the full picture,

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:22.510
otherwise you have a very biased view

01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:26.180
on our understanding of the universe.

01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:27.013
- Terrific, thank you.

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:29.240
I'm gonna use that last
round of four responses

01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.400
to draw a close to this.

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.910
We've come to the end of the evening.

01:46:32.910 --> 01:46:34.390
Thank you, the four of you,

01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:37.730
thank you so much for being on
this side of the fourth wall,

01:46:37.730 --> 01:46:40.870
for all of you for coming in
and spending part of your week

01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:41.703
with all of us.

01:46:41.703 --> 01:46:43.368
Thank you so much, everybody.

01:46:43.368 --> 01:46:44.201
(applause)

01:46:44.201 --> 01:46:45.034
Thank you.

01:46:51.010 --> 01:46:53.520
Parts of this evening's
conversation touched upon

01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:57.090
next Tuesday evening, which of
course will be: What Is Time?

01:46:57.090 --> 01:46:58.550
Please come in and join us for that one.

01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:59.550
Thank you everybody.
