&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.490
I'm Stephanie Merry,
the Book World editor

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.680
at the Washington Post
which is a charter sponsor

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.990
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.330
First --

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.630
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Yey, wee [laughter]!

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.930
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
First, a word of thanks

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.200
to the Co-Chairman of the
festival, David Rubinstein,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.950
and the other generous sponsors
who've made this event possible.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.710
If you'd like to add

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.190
please note the information

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.960
We'll have some time after this
presentation for your questions.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.440
And I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.210

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.810
of this event which may be

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.050
Our guest this afternoon
is Alexandra Bracken.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.350
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Hello.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.440
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Alex sold
her first novel while still

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.740
in college.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.520
And she has since had a prolific
career publishing roughly a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.830
novel a year since 2010
including <i>The Dreadful Tale</i>

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.130
<i>of Prosper Redding </i>,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.730
<i>The Darkest Minds </i>which
was just turned into a movie.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.030
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: It was.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.330
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
And the novelization

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.630
of <i>Star Wars, A New Hope </i>.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.620
It is my extreme pleasure to
introduce Alexandra, Alex.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.920
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Alex.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.220
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Yes.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.520
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Thank you, guys.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.820
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Yes.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.120
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
This is my first time

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.420
at the National Book
Festival and I am like,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.720
"Wow, this is amazing!"

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.020
I feel it's so lucky,
this is right here.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.320
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Oh, I know.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.940
I'd love to start with sort of
the beginning of your career

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.550
because not many authors
[inaudible], you know,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.740
sell their first book
while still in college.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.920
So how did that happen?

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.880
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: So I was
one of those kids that knew

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.870
from a really, really young
age what I wanted to do.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.990
And then, I think like
one of the secrets

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.040
of being an author is
that you have to be

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.980
like a little bit deluded, like
you have to like have this,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.390
you know, just titanium
confidence because so much

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.990
of becoming an author and
writing is getting rejected,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.470
like you get rejected
from editors and agents.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.490
You get rejected by readers
who don't like your books.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.930
Like it's a lot of rejection
so you really have to love it

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.810
and believe in yourself and
believe that it's a possibility

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.710
in the face of very dire odds
of ever having a book published.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.060
But I knew from a really, really
young age that I loved writing

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.380
and it was because of
my third grade teacher.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.090
Did you ever have to
do something like this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.390
where you would write

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.350
like a little short
story and illustrate it?

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.020
And like my teacher stapled
it together and then bound it

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.640
with cardboard and
contact paper?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.940
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
Or laminated?

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.240
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.540
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Beautiful.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.840
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Like I wrote a book.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.140
This is amazing!

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.440
And I want to do this forever.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.740
So I knew from a really
young age but I wrote a lot

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.720
of fan fiction while I was in my
high [laughter], middle school

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.180
and high school phase.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.440
And then when I got to college,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.850
I had never written
an original novel

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.450
or original long-form
story before.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.510
And so, it was National
Novel Writing Month.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.910
How many of you guys
participated in NaNoWriMo?

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.730
Yeah. So I was like,
"I'm going for it!"

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.780
Like it's not already
challenging enough

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.500
to be a freshman in college
like I'm double major.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.960
I'm going to do the
NaNoWriMo too

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.250
and write 50,000
words in one month.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.950
And I just became
obsessed with it

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.410
and I really wanted
to make it work.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.480
I almost think I wanted
to prove my dad wrong

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.090
because he wanted me to be a
lawyer so badly [laughter].

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.230
And I went through.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.530
You guys, I went through.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.290
I took all the LSAT courses
and I was like, "Oh, okay."

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.100
Like my dad always says, you
know, you -- he's very --

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.590
he was very conservative
in that he wanted us

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.200
to build a solid
financial base first.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.230
Also, he's like, "Become
a lawyer and then later

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.530
in life, do what you love."

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.830
And I was like, "No!

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.730
I'm going to do it now."

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.220
But I wrote and wrote and wrote.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.710
And I finally sold my book
in my senior year of college.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.010
It was actually the second book.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.980
The first book got
rejected by everybody

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.280
in the kid lit industry.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.580
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: And that
was your NaNoWriMo book was the

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.880
first one?

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.180
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: That
first NaNoWriMo book was

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.740
like a, you know [laughter].

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.830
I feel like one of my friends
like very sweetly sent it off

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.280
to one of those -- I hate --
it's called Vanity Presses.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.290
But that's I think, the
actual term for it is

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.250
when you send it off and they
make it into a book for you.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.550
And I was like, "Why
did you do this?

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.170
I'm going to through
it on the fire.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.470
Get rid of this.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.770
No one should ever read this."

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.050
But yeah, it was -- it
was a really quick journey

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.080
but the reality of
being a writer is

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.920
that you cannot support yourself

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.260
on writing alone unless
you have this insane,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.910
crazy deal right
out of the gate.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.940
And so I worked in the
publishing industry

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.350
for about five years and would
write only on the weekends.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.240
I wrote the entire <i>Darkest
Minds </i>series that way,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.220
keeping really crazy hours
like I'd come home from work

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.700
at 6:00 P.M. and then
write until 4:00 o'clock

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.000
in the morning and
then go to sleep

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.300
and then write all day Saturday.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.540
That's how -- that's like
the level of delusion

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.890
that I had and determination.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.850
So one part delusion, one part
determination, one part love.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.930
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Yeah and
I want to hear a little bit

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.230
about the fan fiction.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.530
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Oh my God.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.830
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Because
you opened up that box.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.130
I mean, I didn't --

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.430
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: The worst
thing about the fan fiction is

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.320
that it's still online
because --

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.620
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
Everyone's like typing

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.920
into their phones right now.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.220
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: I know.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.520
Oh my God, you guys.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.220
It's because I used like a
Hotmail account and I forgot

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.520
that I would have to --

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.430
you know, the old Hotmail
account before Gmail

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.710
like I delete -- I think I
deleted that account and so now,

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.470
I can't access the
fanfiction.net account to go in

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.190
and like delete everything.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.910
So every once in a while, I'd
like wake up in a cold sweat

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.410
at someone discovering my

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.470
like terrible Sailor Moon
fan fiction [laughter].

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.700
I wrote a lot of Star
Wars fan fiction too

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.420
and a little bit
of Harry Potter.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.820
What else did I write?

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.120
Yeah.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.420
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Yeah.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.720
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
It was like a good mix.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.020
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: So how
long are you, you know,

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.480
sort of gestating these
ideas before you were getting

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.780
them out?

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.420
I mean, you are producing
books really, really quickly.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.720
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yes.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.040
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: So like for
the <i>Darkest Minds </i>, let's say,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.450
how long were you
sort of thinking

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.580
about the story before
putting it to paper?

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.520
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: So
I've gotten into this.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.500
I would say and I think a
lot of authors would agree,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.780
you're always working
on three books at once.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.440
You're always kind of
-- you're drafting one.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.810
You're editing another one

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.320
and then another one is
getting ready to be published.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.110
Like that's the --
that's the reality

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.410
of publishing a book a year.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.110
It's like, oh my,
this is so many books.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.440
So many words.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.550
But it depends.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.130
Sometimes, I really
have found that if I try

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.230
to write an idea too soon
before it has had enough time

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.940
to bake, it goes nowhere.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.570
I feel so frustrated with it.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.910
I don't understand it.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.590
I can't connect with
the character.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.610
And like connecting with the
main character is the most

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.910
important thing to me.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.690
If I don't relate to my
character on an emotional level

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.640
or understand their emotional
arc then the story feels

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.050
like a dud to me
and I give up on it.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.460
So with <i>The Darkest Minds </i>,
that series took me about --

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.200
there was a year between
when my debut novel,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.100
<i>Brightly Woven </i>which is now
out of print, RIP Egmont USA.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.400
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Oh no.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.100
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: It was
a very sweet little fantasy

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.830
that sold absolutely
nothing [laughter].

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.130
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
But it got you.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.430
It gave you a start.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.730
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Again,
that [inaudible] a delusion.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.030
I can do it.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.330
Like I can slay it.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.170
It's going to be fine.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.050
And so, it took me like another
year-and-a-half to like come

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.540
up with an idea that I really
loved and developed it enough

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.720
and that -- while I was working
on <i>The Darkest Minds </i>series,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.910
I was thinking about <i>Passenger</i>
and <i>Wayfarer </i>which was the

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.210
next series.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.130
So now they kind of overlap
and it's fun to kind of cheat

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.200
on the drafts that
you're writing

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.750
with like the new shiny idea
that you want to write next.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.340
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
And are you kind of --

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.030
are you kind of wedded
to the characters?

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.130
I mean, you were talking
about how you have

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.960
to really love the
main character.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.660
So how are you kind of
thinking about the characters?

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.040
How are you dreaming them up?

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.240
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Sometimes,
it sounds very frightening

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.200
like sometimes, there's
just a voice in your head

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.450
that just kind of
starts talking to you.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.200
It's like one line
and you understand

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.160
that character's
voice really well.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.690
With <i>The Darkest Minds </i>series,
and I have not experienced this

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.580
with any of my other books,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.110
it was like Athena
springing in from Zeus' head.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.430
They were like fully formed.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.260
I knew exactly, like I knew
weird details about their lives

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.820
like I had known
them as real people.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.260
I just have like
such a good sense

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.720
of who those characters were.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.710
But a lot of the time,
I really do sit down

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:10.390
and interrogate the
character and I love --

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.860
is anyone familiar with
John Truby, his work?

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.260
So he wrote a book
called <i>Anatomy</i>

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.760
<i>of a Story </i>and he really
changed the way that I think

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.710
about characters and setting up
a character arc because he talks

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.800
about two different needs
that the character has

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.660
which is a moral need
and a psychological need.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.400
And the psychological need is
how they're hurting themselves

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.800
without realizing it and
how they're interacting

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.100
with the world.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.070
And the moral need is how
they are hurting the others

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.650
around them without
realizing it.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.430
And that arc is like the
journey to the realization

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.210
of how they need
to change and why.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.870
So I think about
character a lot that way.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.170
Sometimes, I just like --

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.440
I love giving characters really
big arcs where they start

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.160
in one place and then end in
a completely different place.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.580
And oh, it just feels
so rewarding.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.730
But I don't know
about you guys, I --

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.900
characters are the
most important element

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.200
of any story to me.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.790
If I'm not connecting with
the character, it just --

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.070
like even when I, as a
reader, if I am not connecting

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.540
with the character,
I put the book down

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.200
and really have learned.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.980
Like I'm an Outlander
fan and I will

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.780
like follow those
characters through anything

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.330
at this point [laughter].

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.630
Like through the most
painful of circumstances,

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.890
it's been many years now, I'm
still reading those books.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.420
But it's because I
love the characters.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.440
So if you can hit upon a
character that people love,

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.120
it really makes a
huge difference.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.230
And I think that's why
<i>The Darkest Minds </i>broke

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.670
out where my debut novel didn't.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.720
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: And do
you know going into something

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.460
that it's going to be a
series and how do you know,

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.020
when you're doing a
series, like when it's over?

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.130
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.290
I still really love the trilogy.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.640
I think that's just the natural
way that we have ingrained in us

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.750
of thinking about story and
thinking about how to break

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.510
up the character's arc.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.320
But sometimes I know
like from the outside,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.860
I'm like this is only two books

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.570
and so duologies are really
a lot more difficult to write

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.470
than I thought they
were going to be.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:07.680
Just because you -- it's such
a different way of breaking

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.570
up the story and you really
almost do cut one major story

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.130
down the middle but then the
first half has to resolve itself

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.660
and the second half
has to pick up.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.540
It's a fine balancing
act with the duology

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.600
and I think you just have more
room to explore in a trilogy.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.610
But sometimes, I'm like
-- like with this book,

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.070
I was like, this
is a standalone.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.870
This is definitely a standalone.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.290
Her arc completes itself

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.830
but there are some [inaudible]
thoughts, you know, plot threads

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.420
that are still open but for
the most part, it's standalone.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.100
So sometimes, you get a
sense and then other times,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.510
you really are sort of
surprised when you reach the end

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.480
of the story, I would say.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.780
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.080
Do you normally know how
things are going to end

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.380
when you begin or is it --

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.680
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yes.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.980
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Okay.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.280
So you've had it mapped out?

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.580
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Yes, I love endings.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.880
Endings are my favorite
part of any book,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.770
not just because it's finally
finished but also because it's

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.540
like the culmination of all
of these emotions and all

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.140
of the action and then bringing
that character to the new place

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.010
and discovering who they are.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.880
So I have to know exactly how
the story ends because I have

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.690
to know what I'm building
towards and that --

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:15.370
it's usually I even know the
very last beat of the scenes.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.240
Sometimes, I'll go ahead and
I'll write that last scene

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.770
at the end of the Word document
and leave it there and just

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.240
like keep writing towards
it, eventually hit it.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.680
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Okay, so we
have to talk about the movie.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.980
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Okay.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.280
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: The
movie, very exciting,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.850
that you had a book
turned into a movie.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.150
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.590
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: And you
know, how did it come about?

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.410
Tell us a little about that.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.710
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: It's --

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.820
I'm still trying to figure out
how to describe this experience.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.140
It's very surreal.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.120
But it's like there are
wonderful aspects of it.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.470
There are horrible
aspects of it.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.900
It's just such a
-- such a unique --

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.000
words are failing me which is
not great because I write words

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.300
for a living [laughter].

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.330
It's just such a --
almost I need like time

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.410
to process it a little bit but
<i>The Darkest Minds </i>was optioned

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.750
by Fox and 21 Laps
all the way back

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.400
in 2011 before it was published

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.280
and for many years,
it just sat there.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.080
And they did nothing with it.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.770
And I will be the first
to confess that --

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.910
do you guys know what
a film option is?

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.010
Do you want me to
explain it very quickly?

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.030
So the difference
between a film option

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.390
and someone buying the rights is

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.020
that the film option is
essentially the studio

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.270
or the production company paying
to reserve the exclusive rights

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.730
to eventually maybe
buy the full rights.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.790
So it's sort of like a
way that they can pay less

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.740
but not let anyone else have it.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.410
And it's for a set
amount of time.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.020
And so the option, it's just --

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.220
it's really like six
months to 18 months?

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.290
Sometimes, the options are
really longer, like years long.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:45.590
But it's -- it's really a
gamble because you never know.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.220
And most authors, like myself,
do not have any sort of control

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.600
like you can be like, "Well, I
would like to have it written

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.440
into the contract that I
can review the script."

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.610
And they're like, "No."

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.830
Like you really don't
unless you're, you know,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.460
Suzanne Collins and
Stephanie Meyer.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.130
I don't think you have a
ton of negotiating power.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.580
So they optioned
it back in 2011.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.420
Everyone, literally everyone I
talked to including my agent,

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.700
my editor, other
writers, they were like,

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.020
"Well, it's -- that's great.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.540
But like a lot of
books get optioned

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.160
and they never see
the light of day.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.940
So just prepare yourself

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.730
for that emotional journey
and disappointment."

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.190
But again, delusion.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.490
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Yeah.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.790
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Like I don't know,

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.090
there's still a chance.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.390
Maybe I'll stay hopeful.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.190
And then they just kept renewing
the option over and over again.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.160
And I was very cautiously
optimistic.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.540
And then the craziest thing
was there would be like years

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.460
in between getting
little bits of news

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.210
about like Chad being hired as a
screenwriter and them, you know,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.510
going back to the studio.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.960
The studio is suddenly
interested again.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.940
And then when it
finally happens,

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.850
it all happens in
like five minutes.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.050
It just goes like this
and then it's like --

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.330
so you don't really have time
to process it in the lead up.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.950
But yeah, it was --
it took them five,

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.890
six years to eventually
make the movie.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.510
And then all of a sudden, they
decided that the time is now.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.400
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: And
did they consult you at all

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.110
when they were writing
the script or is it

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.910
like you have given your
baby to them and it's like,

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.400
"Okay, it's yours now."

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.750
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
So I early on,

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.380
I got lucky because Chad
Hodge, who's the screenwriter,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.680
you guys might know his work

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.690
from <i>Wayward Pines</i>
and <i>Good Behavior </i>.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.640
He adapted those for the screen.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.050
He and I had many
conversations very early

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.530
on about the characters and
the story and how it might --

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.650
it might break down on
the screen and he asked me

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:36.350
for my opinion on different
changes he was thinking about

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.650
and that sort of thing.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.520
And he did not have to do that.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.170
That was -- he wanted to do it
because he likes other writers

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.100
and feels like writers have to
protect other writers especially

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.510
in the Hollywood sphere
because as I've learned,

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.620
Hollywood writers
get treated horribly

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.930
in like their work can be
completely changed on them

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.310
and they still have
their name on it.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.110
And you're like, "Like I
didn't write any of this

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.860
because you guys
rewrote it all."

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.380
It's a very strange process.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.960
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: It makes
you appreciate writing novels,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.260
right?

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.560
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yes.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.860
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Yeah.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.160
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: And
so I -- he was like --

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.460
because the studio, okay.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.430
I feel like I had to prove to
the studio that I was not going

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.800
to like go ballistic on
them at the drop of a hat.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.990
Like I really had to prove
to them over the years

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.120
that I really had to prove
to them over the years

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.450
that I could be, I could
be accepting of changes.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.220
I felt like I had
auditioned as a normal,

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.780
sane person for them [laughter].

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.860
But it's really -- they
really didn't want me

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.980
to read the script so like it
was a fight through the script.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.880
Yeah, so this was -- I don't
think I even read their shooting

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.470
script which at that point,
had gone through so many drafts

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.800
and had gone through all
the notes from the studio,

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.350
all the notes from the
director, everything.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.740
I didn't read it until
like they started shooting.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.070
So this is the [inaudible]
of involvement

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.650
that I had at that point, yeah.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.950
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
And then, did you go --

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.250
were you able to go
to the set at all?

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.550
Or what's it like?

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.850
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
That's it but okay.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.910
So what, I'm trying to
remember who said this.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.460
It was number of [inaudible]
they were work adapted.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.130
What's his name?

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.430
I'll tweet it later [laughter].

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.890
I forgot. I feel I have
to source this quote.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.670
But he was like this --

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.610
Hollywood likes to
pretend authors are dead

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.170
until they absolutely can't
protect anymore [laughter].

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.860
So I didn't get invited to the
set until the last two days

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.570
of filming [laughter].

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.870
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Oh, why?

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.170
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Again,

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.470
I think they really
thought I was kind

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.770
of like lose it on them.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.230
But it -- but I loved the sets
and I loved meeting the crew.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.810
I really loved the
cast in the movie.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.810
They were wonderful and they
have really bright futures.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.610
But it was like, it was very
clear to me that I'm not going

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.880
to be involved until promotion
time comes [laughter].

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.180
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: My gosh,

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.400
did you get to at least see
it before like it came out?

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.870
Or did you take a bunch of
friends to the [inaudible]

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.800
like you know, premiere?

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.360
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: They did
not want me to see an early cut.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.680
And I'm kind of glad because I
guess early cuts are a hot mess

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.900
like I don't think I
realize that they really --

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.030
it goes through -- the story
changes a lot in editing.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.630
Film editing is really
interesting.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.160
And if you've ever -- have
you guys ever seen that movie

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.920
or not movie, the YouTube video

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.770
about how editing
saved <i>Star Wars </i>?

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.230
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
It's so good.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.630
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: It's so
interesting and I was like,

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.830
"Wow, this is a really cool way
of thinking about storytelling."

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.390
Anyway, tangent.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.690
They did show it to me early.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:19.260
They showed me the pretty much
final cut in April but it was

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.280
like the picture was
locked, as they say.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.510
So they're like, "We're
just tweaking sounds."

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.920
And I was like, "Oh, do
you want to meet me back?"

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.940
No, it's nope [laughter].

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.850
Like, cool.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.150
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: But you have

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.640
so many other things
on your plate.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.940
So it's fine.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.240
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Right.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.540
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: I mean,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.840
it's like you have this crazy
schedule where you're basically

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.720
like writing a book
a year basically?

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.040
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Yes, some years,

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.930
I've written two
books in a year.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.790
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Which
how are you doing this?

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.090
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
I don't want

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:49.720
to say a complete
abandonment of my social life

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.590
but like I get some
really rough patches

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.080
where because I love writing
so much, I'm willing to wake --

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.560
make it work and also,
I'm very prolific.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.980
I write very quickly and then
edit very quickly and I --

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.050
a lot of authors have a process
that takes them more time

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.290
and I finally, after
like 10 books in,

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.640
I finally have a process
where I am very efficient.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.690
You know, most of my
deadlines -- most of them --

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.540
sometimes, it's not my fault.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.270
But you know, it's
-- you really --

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.830
you get to a place where
it becomes pretty routine.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.790
And so, sometimes, I'm
working on a story, you know,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.830
two years before it's
published but it just happens

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.030
to be published in the
same year as another book.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.850
So I've overlapped
into like two books

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.650
in a year and that's crazy.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.100
I don't know how much
I love doing that.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.530
I don't really love doing that.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.070
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: So what's
the process that works for you?

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.790
Do you have like a certain
number of pages or words

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.590
or hours that you have to spend
every day or how does it work?

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.020
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Oh my
gosh, you guys, I don't know

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.320
if you've noticed this

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.620
but I write really
long books [laughter].

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.920
It's like [inaudible].

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.220
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: You
need to stop doing that.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.520
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: My
editor is a really slow reader

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.170
and I was like, "How
did we find each other?"

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.090
This is like not
a good situation.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.310
But I -- I just love long books.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.430
As a kid, I loved
reading long books.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.780
As a teen, I loved reading long
books so I feel like this is

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.000
for all of you out there
who feel the same and want

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.670
to like live in a
book's world for a while.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.420
My processes -- well, I used
to keep those crazy hours.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.720
I'm not even joking.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.870
I'm pretty sure I had a Mountain
Dew addiction like would go

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.850
to Mountain -- or would go to
Mountain Dew, I wish [laughter].

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.010
I wish go to the mountains and
to collect the dew [laughter].

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.290
I would go, I lived when -- this
is when I lived in New York.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.250
I would go to the CBS that was
right on the corner which is

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.790
like so dangerous when you
have a Mountain Dew addiction.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.090
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Oh yeah.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.840
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: It was a
24-hour CBS too so I don't know

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.580
if there's anything more
shameful than I'd be

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.640
in like 2:00 o'clock
in the morning,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.290
going to buy yourself a
Mountain Dew and nothing else.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:53.290
I [inaudible] so many kids in
that I felt like God was trying

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.550
to send me a message, "Just
stop drinking Mountain Dew."

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:56.910
This is another tangent,
you guys.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.400
I'm really sorry.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.380
Because I would have kids
come up to me while I was

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.740
like selecting my three
bottles of Mountain Dew

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.940
for the weekend, one per day.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.350
And they'd be like, "You
shouldn't drink that.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.650
That's going to rot
your [laughter].

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.260
It was a different child
every time [laughter].

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.910
And the guy tried three
times and I was like, "Nope.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.210
It's mine."

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:17.510
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: I
think one a day shows some

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:18.810
restraint actually.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.110
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.410
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
I mean, right?

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.710
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
So you're --

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.010
to answer the question about
how I write so quickly.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.310
It used to be Mountain Dew
and keeping very strange hours

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.790
when no one was on the
internet to talk back

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.090
to me on social media.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.220
But now, I keep very
normal hours.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.110
I have a dog who reminds
I have to [inaudible] him

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.560
and have other responsibilities
besides sitting in a chair.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.150
And the difference is I write
fulltime now which is --

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.900
was always my dream and I feel
very lucky to be able to do it.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.180
But it really, those
four years in New York

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.350
when I was working fulltime
and also writing fulltime

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.270
and traveling a lot for
work, I was willing to do it

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.700
because I wanted it so badly.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.000
And now, I'm like, "Oh, good.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.470
I can see my friends,"
because I don't have to write

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.890
from midnight to
4:00 A.M. anymore.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:02.190
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
What was the moment

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.120
when you realized you could
make that leap from work

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.310
in publishing and doing this
on the side to making this

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.630
like your fulltime job?

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.840
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Okay,
this is a little crass.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.550
So I feel like it's
impolite to talk about money.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.030
But it was when I made twice
as much money on my books

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.330
than I did at my day job.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:23.200
And I was like, "I really
love my co-workers but I also

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.370
and I love the health
insurance I have here."

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.670
[Laughter].

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.000
But it really were so then
like balancing income,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.070
it was like how much I
had saved at that point

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.610
in case I never sold
another book.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.450
My father made me
deeply paranoid

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.860
about that kind of thing.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.530
So I wanted to just save
a certain amount of money.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:44.000
And my stress levels had
gotten to like a toxic level

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.250
because I was traveling a
lot for work and my editor,

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.070
you know, it's like the
constant push and pull struggle

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.590
of me writing very long things
and her reading very slowly

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.490
and then that editorial timeline
condensing like very quickly.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:02.430
So it was -- it was a
balance of I need --

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:07.010
one of these things has to give
and I want to go for the thing

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.470
that I love and that
I've always dreamed

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.610
about doing even
though it makes me sad

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.110
to leave the co-workers I love

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.620
and to leave my health
insurance [laughter].

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.600
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Do you find,
is there some sort of community

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.670
of other writers so it
doesn't feel so lonely

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:19.970
or how does that work?

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.270
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Oh, yeah.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.570
Oh my gosh, so when I
still lived in New York,

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.630
there would be days
when I -- when I --

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:28.710
I spent a year in New
York writing fulltime

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.750
because I wanted to
experience New York as a person

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.010
who could actually go
out and see her friends

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.690
which did not happen that
much when I was, you know,

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.540
trying to hold those two
fulltime jobs and make

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.260
that [inaudible] your schedule.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.530
So I would just like go --

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.090
I would rotate between the
five Starbucks' that were

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.790
within like a two-block radius
and would interact with humans

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.860
at Starbucks and return home.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.100
But now, I've gotten much
closer to other author friends

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.600
and so we have just like a
constant chat going that we kind

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.200
of check in and out
of throughout the day.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.340
And that gives you
some interaction.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.640
And I feel bad for my UPS
delivery guy sometimes

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.570
because I'm like, "Wait, stay
a moment and chat with me.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.040
Where are you going next?"

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.020
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: I haven't
spoken to anyone in hours.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.320
I know.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.850
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah, I
can feel myself like especially

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.350
when you're on a really
tight deadline, you're like,

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.450
"I think I've forgotten
how to be human."

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.370
I just want to talk to people
for dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.470
Like just like word vomit
at them for many hours.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.770
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
We're here for you.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.070
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Thank you.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.210
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: I have to
ask you about the novelization

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.240
of <i>Star Wars </i>which is so --

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.540
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yes.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.340
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: -- amazing
to get that gig but also,

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.500
I mean, a lot of
pressure because --

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.800
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.100
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
-- talk about fans.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.400
They are --

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.700
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yes.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.000
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: -- crazy so
tell us a little bit about how

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.090
that came about, how it --
did you get a lot of support?

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.390
Were you terrified?

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:49.690
What?

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.710
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: I, okay,
so there's some backstory here.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.010
Sorry, guys.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.310
I'm a bit of a rambler,
if you couldn't tell.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.610
Hence why my books are
so long [laughter].

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:00.270
So my dad, from the time
I was in first grade

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.510
until the time he
passed away in 2012,

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.270
was a <i>Star Wars </i>collector.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.250
And he was a hardcore
<i>Star Wars </i>collector.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.450
We went to the very first
celebration when it was outside

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.370
in Colorado and it was
pouring rain in April.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.630
Like that level of devotion.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.680
And so I really grew up
with <i>Star Wars </i>and lived

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.770
in that world, in that fandom.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.730
Wrote a lot of <i>Star
Wars </i>fan fiction.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.140
From ages eight to 12, I
pretty much only wanted

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.580
to read <i>Star Wars </i>books.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.880
So that was a huge part

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.750
of my literacy was just
reading <i>Star Wars </i>books

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.050
over and over again.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.550
So I really have always
loved <i>Star Wars </i>.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:37.480
But I got offered
to write this book

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.320
because my editor knew I
could turn it in quickly

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.850
because another author had
been slated to write it

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:45.150
and she couldn't do it.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.050
And she backed out at
the very last minute.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.910
So they were like,
"Will you pinch in?

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.580
You're like somebody who we
know who can deliver it."

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.060
And also someone who knows <i>Star
Wars </i>and would want to do it

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.360
in the short amount of time.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.660
And I was like, "Me."

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.610
Well, actually, it
wasn't like that.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.030
Because when my editor
called me, I almost said no

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.080
because it's so much
pressure really.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.830
And like I said, I had grown
up reading <i>Star Wars </i>.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:11.430
And I was like, "I don't know if
I can live up to the standards

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.110
that I have for my -- like for
reading <i>Star Wars </i>books."

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.230
And the other thing was I hadn't
really watched <i>Star Wars </i>since

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.620
my dad had passed away
because I associated it

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.920
with him so strongly.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.220
And so, I was like, "Oh,

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.500
I feel like this is
going to be so painful."

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.860
And like having to deal with
the promotional aspect will be

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.450
painful, having to
talk about it.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.440
It was great because
if anyone of you,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.610
if anyone has lost a person
you know that like connecting

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:38.310
with the things that that
person loved is like a great way

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.760
to connect with them again
even after they're gone.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.480
So it had the opposite effect

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.590
and I'm really glad
I ended up doing it.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.190
But I did have to prove myself
to the <i>Star Wars </i>fans.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.760
They really are like I wrote,
ended up writing an essay

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.980
about my experiences
with my dad and growing

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.750
up as a <i>Star Wars</i>
collector and losing him.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:01.150
And I feel like after that,
people were a lot more sold

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.760
than they were before because
the <i>Star Wars </i>community is

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.840
very protective of the
characters that they love

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.140
and the story that they love.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.030
And then I think once they
recognized she is one of us,

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.330
not an interloper, it was great.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.960
But <i>Star Wars </i>fans, as a
whole, are wonderful, you know.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.260
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Yeah.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.680
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Some
fans are not wonderful.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.420
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Well, yeah,
well especially when you're

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.080
on social media too which I know
you're active on social media.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.270
And anyone can access
you at any time.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.900
And sometimes, it's great with
like these amazing people here.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.230
But sometimes, it's like
a crazy <i>Star Wars </i>fan.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.920
I mean, you never know, right?

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.220
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Wait, I don't know

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.740
if you're referencing this but
I just got attacked by a ton

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.040
of Kylo Ren [inaudible].

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.920
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Oh, I didn't
know that at all [laughter].

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.370
What did you do to Kylo Ren?

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:43.670
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Okay [laughter].

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:48.140
I tweeted something that
was a joke [laughter].

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.490
They really love Kylo Ren
and they are very protective

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.490
of Adam Driver and I was
like, "I love Adam Driver.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.210
I just don't love the
character of Kylo Ren."

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.790
And yeah, they are
-- that was a lot.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.430
I was like, "Wow,
this is like a hive.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.850
Like they just keep coming."

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.150
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.450
Once it starts.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:08.750
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: You know,
I had to mute the words Adam,

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.280
Driver, Kylo, Ren like
they're still muted

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.980
because I'm still getting
tweets from they've

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.270
like discovered the tweet
from a year ago and I'm like,

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.570
"Oh my God, you guys."

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:19.870
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Oh
my gosh, I'm so sorry.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.170
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: I get it.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.080
I know but it's like
that intensity of fandom

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.230
like on one hand, I'm like,
"Oh my God, you guys."

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:29.760
Like it doesn't hurt my feelings
that they're like, you know.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.840
I hope every project
you write from now on,

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.880
fails because you said this,
what we think is an awful thing.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.440
But you know, they
love it so much.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.740
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
I know [laughter].

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.960
What's the creative process
like with something like that?

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.370
Because you know, with <i>The
Darkest Minds </i>or your other

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.540
books, it's like you're
starting from scratch.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.950
But in this, you kind of
have to work within a rubric.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.560
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Yes, it was really --

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.550
it was such an interesting
experience.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.900
I asked them to send me the
style guide that they have

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.480
for all of <i>Star Wars </i>just
because I wanted to read it.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.150
That's the level of fan I am.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:02.650
I'm like, "I just want
to see how you guys

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:06.330
like classify everything
and break it down."

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:09.530
So they told me I could --

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:10.830
what they really wanted

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:16.300
with these retellings
were they wanted Tom.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.150
Okay, so Tom Angleberger
rewrote --

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.490
not rewrote, retold <i>Return</i>

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:23.670
<i>of the Jedi </i>and Gidwitz did
<i>The Empire Strikes Back </i>and I

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:24.970
did <i>A New Hope </i>.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.690
And so they wanted
us to approach it

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.510
or approach each
story in our own way

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.950
and put our own spin on it.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.740
So I was like, "What
does that look like?"

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.150
I thought about retelling it
from the perspective of someone

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.630
who worked on the Death Star.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:42.620
I thought about Adam retold
his in second person and had

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.040
like a really good spin
on it and all of that.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.490
And so I decided that
what I loved most

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.650
about <i>Star Wars </i>are the
characters so I was going

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:53.670
to do a really deep
dive into the characters

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:57.410
because like it's still
very surface and a new hope,

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.640
if you go back and
re-watch it, you're like oh,

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.660
like why isn't Princess Leia
crying when her whole planet

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.530
and everyone she
loves gets destroyed?

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.230
Like what explains her
strength in that moment?

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.010
Why is she comforting Luke

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.460
when he loses the guy he's
known for six hours, right?

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.990
And he's not comforting
her [laughter]?

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.000
So I wanted to really do fill
in those blanks and so I got

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.250
to pull directly from the
script, the film script.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.230
I got to pull from the
[inaudible] on the script

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.830
which is really interesting.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.130
I had to update some stuff

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.660
because we don't use
data tapes anymore.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.600
I had the Death Star
tapes, stealing the tapes

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.900
from their [inaudible].

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.570
Like okay, I don't think kids
are going to know what that is.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:37.260
And I got to actually
invent new scenes too

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.260
that also helped
fill in those blanks.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.460
And so my retelling is told

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.090
from a close third
person point of view.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.980
It starts with Leia telling
the story then Han picks it

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.160
up midway through and then
Luke finishes out the story.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.110
So it's an interesting
and fun challenge to play

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.670
with point of view on that one.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:56.380
And you get to work with
the Lucasfilm Story Group.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.080
They are the keepers
of the canon.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.380
Their level of knowledge

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.140
about the <i>Star Wars</i>
universe is insane.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.090
It is amazing.

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:08.480
The story that we always
tell is Adam wanted to know

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.560
if there were chickens in
the <i>Star Wars </i>universe.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.140
It's something you don't
think about, right?

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.350
So he wanted to know
if there were chickens

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.660
in the <i>Star Wars</i>
universe because he wanted

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:22.020
to write some sort of
new Jedi fable for it.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.620
And so, Pablo, who's one of the
story group division members,

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.060
he sort of like sat back and
like tapped into the database

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.240
in his mind and was
like, "Eleven."

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.830
It was like there are 11
chickens in <i>The Return</i>

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.130
<i>of the Jedi </i>script [laughter].

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.080
So he knew that off
the top of his head

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.830
which is like crazy to me.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.250
And he -- then he continues
on because this is --

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.800
I love the story [inaudible].

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.830
And you can also assume
that there are falcons

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.740
because of the Millennium Falcon
too somewhere in the universe.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.320
So they're wonderful.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.560
They, as I learned, are a
wonderful confidence boost

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.470
because they are not going
to let you fall on your face.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.160
They're like, "It is impossible

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.990
to write a terrible <i>Star Wars</i>
book because they are there

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.290
to help you and guide you.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.480
And the funny, the funniest
part of when I was working

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.680
on my book was I
wasn't able to --

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.650
I like filtered in a little bit
of the expanded universe stuff.

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:15.430
I kind of sprinkled it in for
my expanding universe fans now

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.770
<i>Star Wars </i>legends RIP.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.490
I sprinkled some
mentions in it just

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:23.270
to see what Lucasfilm Story
Group [inaudible] and get away

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.930
with since it wasn't
technically canon anymore.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.340
And I tried to use Han

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.890
and Chewie's previously
established back story.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:35.000
And they went in and they took
out all of the references to it.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.450
And like at the end, the
last one, there was just

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.320
like a smiley face and
it was like, "Nope."

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.790
Like you can't.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:45.180
And so I asked my
editor, I was like --

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.560
has anyone not seen <i>The Force
Awakens </i>before I say this?

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.860
Okay, good.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.160
Sorry in advance.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.460
It's been a couple of years.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.760
So I was like, "Are
you guys going

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.590
to do a young Han Solo movie?"

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.790
And he was -- my poor
editor is not a good liar.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.160
He was like, "No,
definitely not."

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.460
I was like, "Oh, no.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:05.040
This means Han Solo is
going to die in this movie

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.920
because that's the only reason
to do a Han Solo movie is

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.280
if he's gone from
the main storyline.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.520
And he was like, "No."

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.860
[Laughter] So I kept
the knowledge secret.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.700
It was like Obiwan in his cave.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:21.020
I knew something terrible was
going to happen [laughter].

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.320
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
I'm impressed, yeah.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.620
So I want to make
sure that we have time

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.300
for questions from the crowd.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.080
We have a couple of
microphones set up here.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.530
There is one over
here and there's one

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:31.920
over there, if anyone --

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.220
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Anybody have any question?

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.250
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Who
wants to ask any questions?

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.510
We have -- all right.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.400
Yes, please.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.700
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.000
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Hi.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.300
&gt;&gt; One, I understand your
Mountain Dew addiction

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.600
because I have the same problem.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.900
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.860
&gt;&gt; And I was also wondering who,
which character that you created

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.710
or even on the <i>Star
Wars </i>characters

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:53.280
that you relate to most?

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.890
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Oh,
that I related to most --

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.230
I think the thing about
characters is that inevitably,

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:01.430
each one kind of inherits
something from you.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.950
Like within the original
<i>Darkness Minds </i>crew like Ruby,

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.670
I was a really shy kid.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.840
So like a lot of her
introversion and a lot

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.460
of her feelings of
loneliness, I related to a lot.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.710
But like Liam got my sense
of humor and my taste

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.440
in music, that kind of a thing.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.440
So I think, I actually
relate to Etta

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.960
from <i>Passenger </i>quite a
bit because she was someone

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.920
who was also very driven
and had her mind set

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.430
on a specific career
and sometimes, you know,

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.700
it was very rewarding
and sometimes, it wasn't.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.980
So it was really interesting
to explore them on paper.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.580
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Thank you.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.470
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Maybe,
we'll swap over to that side.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.610
&gt;&gt; Oh, so you talked about
like ending stories and how

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:42.910
that was your favorite.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:47.420
But do you also feel that
like empty cone of death

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.530
after you finished
a book [laughter].

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.240
It's not, it isn't
just the readers

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.060
that have to deal with that.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.530
I'm like, what do I
do with my life now?

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:56.830
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Well,

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:59.350
I promise like I think
readers think that when we

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.630
like kill off a character or
something terrible happens,

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.380
we're like, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha [laughter].

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.940
I'm like maybe some others are

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.420
but I'm always like,
"I'm sorry."

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.970
Like [laughter] the one ending

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:12.600
that really got me was the
ending of <i>The Darkest Minds </i>.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.510
And I had finished it at like
4:00 o'clock in the morning.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.480
And even though I knew
what was going to happen,

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.230
I just like couldn't fall
asleep because I was so anxious

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.450
and worried about those
characters and I was like,

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:23.760
"Well, hopefully
if I feel this way,

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.140
readers will feel this way too."

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:29.430
But yeah, I do look for some
sort of like emotional punch

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:31.640
at the end of the book, just
in case you thought you were

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.740
in the clear [laughter].

00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.370
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Nope,
enter the cone of death.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:36.670
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.170
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: We'll kind
of come back to this side.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:42.240
&gt;&gt; Are you planning on making
another <i>Darkest Minds </i>book?

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.540
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
You know what?

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.840
I would love to.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.140
I was really happy
to finally come back

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.680
to the world after
how many years?

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.980
A couple of years.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.420
I needed a break because Ruby's
head is a very dark place

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.720
to inhabit.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.020
And I was like, "I
could use a breather

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.320
and I wanted to [inaudible]."

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.370
You know, I really wanted
to challenge myself to try

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.440
to write something
very different and new.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.810
But I do want to come back
and explore the world.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:07.210
I'm just -- I haven't made
any like official plans

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.320
or announce anything yet just
because I'm trying to figure

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.830
out what the best story
would be and find out,

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.420
figure out which emotional story

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:19.040
and which character
really compels me the most.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.970
So yes, hopefully soon.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.570
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Thank you.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.360
&gt;&gt; Can we get an update
on the scorpion saga?

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.660
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Oh my gosh.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.430
I'm sorry for anyone who
does not know what she's

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:30.730
talking about.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.010
So I grew up in Arizona.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.860
I lived there for 18
years before I went

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.650
to William and Mary.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:38.950
&gt;&gt; Hu!

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.250
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Yeah [laughter].

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:41.550
&gt;&gt; Go Tribe!

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.930
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Go Tribe,
[inaudible] bark upon the gale.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:48.140
I, never once in my entire
life, saw a scorpion.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.630
Flash forward several years.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:53.420
I moved back to Phoenix
and I live in Phoenix.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:57.090
I grew up in Scottsdale and
so I moved to a neighborhood

00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:00.520
which I did not realize
has scorpions.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.330
And so the first time
I saw one outside,

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.630
I did not know what to do.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.660
I just sort of -- I
tried to step on it.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.960
It wasn't working.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.260
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Oh God.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.560
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Scorpions play dead.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.860
They're so smart.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.160
They're terrifying [laughter].

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.460
They're -- and so my neighbor

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.840
across the street saw
me kind of [inaudible].

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.330
Like [inaudible] out
like a screaming moppet

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:21.430
around this very
tiny little scorpion.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:25.480
And she came over and showed me
how they kill them and was like,

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.520
you should, you know,
start spraying regularly

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.010
and so on and so forth.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:33.970
But then, this monsoon
season, we get really amazing,

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:37.360
terrifying thunderstorms
every summer

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.660
in Arizona called monsoons.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.600
And I did not realize that
the monsoons drive the

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.900
scorpions inside.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.220
And scorpions can fit into
any space that is as thin

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.410
as a credit card, in case you
would like a new nightmare

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:50.710
to think about [laughter].

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.420
So they come through
like light fixtures.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.720
They come through vents

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.420
that aren't sealed
properly on the walls.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.610
And so, I kept finding
dead ones in my house.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.000
And my dog is very small.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.300
He's only seven pounds.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.600
So I wasn't worried about me.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.900
I was worried about him.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.090
And I've hired a company
called Seal Out Scorpions.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.290
And they came and
sealed my entire house.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:13.300
It was the most intense day of
them going through every vent,

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.000
trying to find all of
the different places

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.550
where they could
enter into the house.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:19.390
And I haven't seen one in the
house since, knock on wood.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:22.840
But so far, it seems okay
and I'm really excited

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.020
for the weather to
cool off and for them

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.870
to like hibernate for a while.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.340
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: This
could inspire your next --

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.640
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: I know.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.940
You guys, scorpions
-- look it up.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.100
They're really -- so when they
were doing like nuclear testing

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.490
out in the desert, scorpions
were the only species

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:38.790
that survived that.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:41.380
That's -- it was so hard
to kill and they leave

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.680
like pheromone trails.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.180
So if one comes in, the
rest of them come in.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.910
Yeah, they're -- I
hate them so much.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.600
I thought I hated spiders and
now, I'm like, "Come, spiders.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.070
Kill the scorpions.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.490
Fight. Fight to the death."

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.500
I'm sorry, that was
such a long answer.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.710
So far, everything's okay.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.170
&gt;&gt; I'm glad.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.480
&gt;&gt; So as a young writer and
you published your first book

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.780
when you were 23.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.570
So do you have -- because I know
finding a publisher can be hard.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.100
How do you find an editor and
a publisher and just how does

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.900
that whole process work?

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.780
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: So
there is actually a very --

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.390
I feel like if we were
seeing younger authors now

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:21.760
because there is such a
wealth of information online

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.380
and there are -- it actually
is a really good breakdown

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.980
of how this process
works all online.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.810
And so it's given
people the ability

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.200
to then submit their work.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.060
And so, anyway, the process
is you write your book.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.360
You edit it.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.200
You get people to read
it, give you feedback

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.790
when you're like,
"Yes, it is ready."

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:42.660
You write something that's
called a query letter

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.540
which is essentially a pitch
letter and then you go online

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.110
and you research all
of the literary agents

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.550
who represent the age
group and the genre

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.690
that you're interested
in writing in.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:55.440
So what I did when
I was first looking

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.990
for my agent was I would look in
the acknowledgments of the books

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.190
that I really loved and
I would see which agent

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:03.510
that they thanked
because I'm like, "Well,

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.410
if they liked this work, I
think my work is you know,

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:10.360
like not the same but comparable
or this is my dream agent."

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.260
And you just send out those
pitch letters and you hope.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.730
It really only takes
one agent saying yes

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.560
and then it only takes
one editor saying yes.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.590
But now, I don't think --

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:24.340
I mean, I was an editorial
assistant and I can tell you,

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.590
it is very rare for
us to pull something

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:28.460
from what we call the slush pile

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.550
which is an unsolicited
manuscript

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.080
that gets sent to us in-house.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.460
We really look, I think,
public editors look

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.760
for agent submissions and they
read through agent submissions

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.200
and prioritize them first.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.730
And now, there's almost
more of the gatekeepers

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:46.740
and they are the ones who are
filtering out the manuscripts

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.670
that aren't strong
enough yet to be published

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:49.970
and so on and so forth.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.970
So your first step
is really looking,

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.390
finishing the manuscript,
getting it in good shape

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.940
and then looking for an agent.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.650
And I think Agent
Query is still online

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.220
and it's still a really
good resource for that.

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.550
That's so exciting.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.850
Good luck!

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.150
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.600
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.900
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Hi.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.990
&gt;&gt; Were there any
characters where you have

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:17.650
like specific actors and
actresses in mind for the movie

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:20.800
or were there any actors that
you just saw and you're like,

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.660
"They should play
this character?"

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.960
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: No.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.430
You know what's funny is
that you -- Ruby, I was --

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:32.170
when I was figuring out what
she looked like, it was like,

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.100
"She looks like Felicity of --

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:38.560
oh my gosh, why am I
blinking on her name?"

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.080
Felicity --

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.380
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Huffman?

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.120
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
No on Huffman.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.420
The other one [laughter],

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:46.960
who was in the <i>Theory
of Everything </i>.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.260
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
Felicity Jones.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.560
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Jones, thank you.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.860
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Jones, yes.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.160
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Oh my gosh.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.460
Sorry, Felicity.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.760
I love you [laughter].

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.060
I've just seen her in
[Inaudible], that adaptation

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.740
and I was like, I love her.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:00.880
And so, I was thinking of her
for Ruby but it was so long

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.600
between when it got optioned
and when it actually got made

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.300
that all of those actors
like completely aged

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.680
out that I had thought
about over the years.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.250
And every time they would
announce a new actor

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:13.870
for the project,
I was like, "Oh,

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:15.660
I never would have
thought of that person."

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.960
But they're kind of perfect.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.730
So I will never be a
casting director but yeah.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:22.490
No, I didn't really have
any favorites going in

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:25.700
and there was -- I'm
trying to even remember

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:29.380
if I suggested anyone to the
director when I talked to her

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.680
on the phone about it.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.980
Probably not.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.600
That was a disappointing answer.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.900
I'm sorry [laughter].

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.410
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:40.510
&gt;&gt; Hi, so what's your top
advice for aspiring authors?

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.280
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: My
gosh, what's my top advice?

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:48.160
I mean, I feel like this is
advice you've probably heard

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.800
before but read everything.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.090
One of the really
fascinating things

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:55.850
about reading different genres,
even genres you think you don't

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.170
like is that they teach you
things that you might not expect

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:01.720
or that you do expect
but in a very --

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:08.090
gosh, I don't want to say
this -- in a very pointed way.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.260
Like for instance, when I
feel like I'm struggling

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:15.080
with plotting or figuring
out how to plant clues

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.010
about a mystery within
the story, I'll go back

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:20.180
and read thrillers and read
mysteries and you know,

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.010
break down how they
pace out their reveals.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:26.070
And reading romance
teaches you a great deal

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:28.050
about creating a romantic arc.

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:29.570
Can you figure out
what works for you

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:30.990
and what doesn't work for you?

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:34.390
Reading nonfiction is a
great source of inspiration

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:37.030
and helps you develop your
own ideas about the world.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:38.690
So read absolutely everything,

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.740
even if you don't think
you're going to like it.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.740
Keep reading everything.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.040
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: We have time

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.260
for one more question,
over here?

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.030
&gt;&gt; So what's your number one
way to handle writer's block?

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.580
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
My number one way

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.940
of handling writer's block?

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.240
Was that the question?

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.840
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Okay.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.670
I -- so writer's
block is so pesky.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:03.570
It really -- you really
do almost have to figure

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:04.990
out your own way of handling it.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:07.200
But what I have noticed
for myself is

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.590
that when I hit writer's block,

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.420
it's because I am ignoring
something that is not working

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.050
in the story and I don't
want to like confront it.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:19.430
So I -- even though it's
counterintuitive, I stop working

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.670
and I go back and re-read
through what I have.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.810
And if -- and try to figure out
what it is that is not working.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:28.080
But sometimes, if it's just
I can't focus on that day

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.470
or I'm stumped about how
to write it, you know,

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.600
what to write next in
that particular scene

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.170
or for the dialogue, I switch.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:36.720
I switch mediums.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.030
I'll start writing by hand which
I don't know the psychology

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:42.930
of this but it kind of does
something to your brain

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:46.130
to either change the way
you're writing or move

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:47.450
like physically move yourself

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.080
to a different location
and write there.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.710
Sometimes, that shakes
things loose.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.010
You wouldn't think so but --

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:53.880
and sometimes, even
just free writing

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.500
in a journal is a great way
to kind of unstick yourself.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.800
So try those.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.140
Always keep like a -- I have my
little writer's block journal

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.410
where I just write
and write and write.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:05.880
And it's all nonsense
but it's a great way

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.790
to shake yourself out of that.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:10.090
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Thank you
for all the great questions.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:11.390
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:

&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: <i>The

&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.440
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Thank you.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.740

&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah,
