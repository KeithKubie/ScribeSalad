00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.080
At the beginning of this lesson we learned that

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.770
there are four major ABO blood groups. We have blood

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.780
group A, B, AB, and O. Now, we saw the

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.190
breakdown of these blood type groups in the US population.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.610
What's really intriguing is that this describes what we see

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.480
on the surface of the red blood cells. When you

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.680
go to the clinic they'll tell you "What's on your

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.510
blood cell? Do you have A type, B type, A

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.560
and B on your cell, or no type at all, O type. But you have two alleles for the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.980
ABO gene, two possibilities. You could be two A's or two B's or an A and a

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.800
B or maybe you're an A and an O.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.950
Right? And depending on those combinations together that will

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.920
result in which blood type you are. I want

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.000
you to tell me what the possible allele combinations

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.180
are for each of these different blood type groups. I'll

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.520
help you out with the first one to give you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.382
an example. To be blood type A we could have

00:00:58.382 --> 00:01:02.500
AA alleles. Or, we could have an A allele and an

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.780
O allele, because the O allele wouldn't produce anything, right.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.330
We get nothing. But the A allele would put the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.520
A antigen with the A carbohydrate, on the surface of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.510
our red blood cells, because the A allele codes for the

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.310
ABO protein. That will make and put the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.360
A carbohydrate on the surface of red blood cells.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.150
So these are the only two possible allele combinations

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.160
we could have. I want you to fill that

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.590
in for these other 3 options here. And see

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.120
if you can come up with the correct allele

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.170
combinations. Separate each combination with a comma, and also

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.050
remember that the order of the alleles doesn't matter.
