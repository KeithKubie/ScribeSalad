00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.540
 

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.150
Part C, find the
particular solution--

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.696
W as a function of t-- to
the differential equations,

00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:08.070
derivative of W
with respect to t

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.670
is equal to 1 over
25 times w minus 300,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.660
with initial condition, at
time 0, W is equal to 1,400.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.460
And the units in this problem,
it was 1,400 tons they told us.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.560
So it might seem strange to
see a differential equations

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.330
problem on an AP exam.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.970
You say, wait, this isn't fair.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.926
This isn't a differential
equations class.

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:33.050
And the thing to keep in
mind is if, on an AP exam,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.170
you see differential
equations, they're

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.461
really asking you to solve
a differential equation that

00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:38.640
can be solved using
the skills that you

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.730
would learn in an AP class.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.516
And the main class of
differential equations

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:44.890
that you could
solve are the ones

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.640
that are separable
differential equations.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.690
The ones where you can
separate the independent

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.331
and the dependent variables.

00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:52.580
And if you don't have any
idea what I'm talking about,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.496
I'm about to show you.

00:00:53.496 --> 00:00:56.030
So let me rewrite this
differential equation.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:04.069
We have dw, dt is equal to
1 over 25 times W minus 300.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.300
Now this differential
equation, we have W here.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.790
And we have this dt.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.700
But we don't have
t anywhere else.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.370
So what I want to do is I want
to get the parts that involve W

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.590
onto the left-hand
side, and I want

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.020
to get anything that deals
with dt on the right-hand side.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.740
So let's divide both sides of
this equation by w minus 300.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.417
So we would have 1
over W minus 300 dw

00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:31.250
dt-- the derivative of
W with respect to t--

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.880
is equal to-- I divide
this side by W minus 300,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.710
so it's equal to 1 over 25.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.050
Now I want to get the
dt's on this side.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.930
So let's multiply
both sides by dt.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.430
[INAUDIBLE] the
differential is just

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.210
a very, very small change in t.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.620
And so we get-- and I'm a little
bit imprecise with my notation

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.120
here.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.970
But this is one way that
you can think about it when

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.928
you are dealing with the
differential equations

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:58.040
like this, separable
differential equations.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.860
You have 1 over W minus
300 dw-- let me make sure

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.600
that the dw doesn't look like
it's in the denominator--

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.730
dw is equal to 1 over 25 dt.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.830
And now we can integrate both
sides, which is essentially

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.200
just saying that we're taking--
since this is equal to this--

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.950
that each little
increment of W times this

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.960
is equal to each little
increment of dt times 1

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.340
over 25.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.050
We can then say, well, if we sum
up all of the increments of W

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.360
times this quantity--
if we sum up

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.970
the infinite number of
infinitesimally small

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.320
increments-- that would be
the same thing as summing up

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.480
all of these characters.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.700
Because each of these
characters is really

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.260
the same as each of
these characters.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.390
So let's do that sum.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.360
We're essentially just
integrating both sides of this.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.260
And here, you might be able
to do this in your head.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.490
Or we could do the
formal u substitution,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.320
just to make it clear
what we're doing.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.010
If you said u is equal to W
minus 300, then what is du?

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.410
If you wanted the differential.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.159
So if you want to take
the derivative of u

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.660
with respect to W, you would
say du with respect to W

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.840
is equal to what?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.150
It is equal to 1.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.590
The derivative of this
with respect to W is 1.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.630
Or if you multiply
both sides times dw,

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.440
you have du is equal to dw.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.290
And so this left-hand side right
over here-- this integral--

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.490
could be rewritten as the
integral of 1 over u du.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.190
We define this as u.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.610
And we just saw that du
is the same thing as dw,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.560
so this could be
rewritten as du.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.540
And this is one of
the basic integrals,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.910
so hopefully we've learned.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.230
And this is equal to the natural
log of the absolute value of u.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.680
Or if you unwind
the substitution,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.820
this is equal to the natural
log of the absolute value

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.460
of W minus 300.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.697
So let me write this down.

00:03:56.697 --> 00:03:58.280
So the left-hand
side right over here.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.210
And you might be able
do that in your head.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.001
You say, hey, look.

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:01.190
You have W minus 300.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.840
Its derivative is 1, so
it's essentially there.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.660
So I can just take this
as if this was 1 over-- I

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.320
could just take the
antiderivative here and treat

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.235
this whole thing as a variable.

00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:13.610
So it would just be the natural
log of this entire thing,

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.910
or the absolute value
of that entire thing.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.480
So the integral of
the left-hand side

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.496
is the natural log of the
absolute value of W minus 300.

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:26.662
And the derivative of the
right-hand side-- and this

00:04:26.662 --> 00:04:30.360
is a little bit more
straightforward-- or sorry,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.170
the antiderivative with respect
to t on the right-hand side

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.045
is 1 over 25 t, or we
could say t over 25.

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:42.090
 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.160
And then these are both
indefinite integrals.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.460
You could have a constant
on both sides or one side.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.501
We could just put it on
one side right over here.

00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:50.440
You could have put
plus some constant.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.635
You could have added
some C1 over here.

00:04:52.635 --> 00:04:54.260
And then you could've
had C2 over here.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.426
But then you could've
subtracted C1 from both sides,

00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:59.094
and then just have a
C3 constant over here.

00:04:59.094 --> 00:05:00.510
But to simplify
it, you could just

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.130
say, look, this is going
to be equal to this

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.465
plus some constant.

00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:07.590
You could've put the constant
on that side as well.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.340
It doesn't matter.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.860
All the constants
would merge into one.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.150
Now we've gotten pretty far.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.950
We want to solve the
particular solution.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.760
Right now, we only
have this constant.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.350
And we also haven't written W as
a function of t just right yet.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.580
They're implicitly expressed.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.710
It is more of a relationship
than a function right now.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.480
So the first thing
we can do is try

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.140
to solve for C. We're told
in the problem that W of 0

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.590
is equal to 1400 tons.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.410
They told us that.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.610
That's one of our
initial conditions.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.010
So we know that the natural
log, that when t is equal to 0,

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.990
W is equal to 1400.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:06:00.450
So W is equal to 1,400 when
t is equal to 0 plus C.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.580
Or another way to
think about it is,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.314
the natural log of the absolute
value of 1,100 is equal to C.

00:06:08.314 --> 00:06:09.980
And obviously, this
is a positive value.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.370
So we could just say that C
is equal to the natural log

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.250
of 1,100.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.830
We can drop the
absolute value sign

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.990
because the absolute
value of 1,100 is 1,100.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.270
So now we can rewrite
this part right over here.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.940
Let me do it in yellow.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.790
Let me start--
that's not yellow.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.090
Let me start right over here.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.050
So we could write
the natural log

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.990
of the absolute
value of W minus 300.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.040
And actually, we know that
W is an increasing function.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.440
W starts at 1,400 and
only goes up from there

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.450
as t gets larger and larger.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.500
So if we're starting at
1,400 and only getting

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.420
larger and larger values
for W, this expression right

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.180
here is never going to get
negative for positive t values.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.534
And that's all we care about.

00:06:54.534 --> 00:06:56.700
And so we can actually drop
the absolute value sign.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.440
This will always be
a positive value.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.580
So we could say the absolute
value of W minus 300

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.380
is equal to t over
25-- and we've just

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.590
solved for our constant--
plus the natural log of 1,100.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.030
And now we can just solve
this explicitly for W.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.900
We can raise e to both sides.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.855
This value is equal
to this value.

00:07:20.855 --> 00:07:22.980
The left hand side is equal
to the right hand side.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.370
So e raised to this power
is the same thing as e

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.150
raised to that power.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.400
So we have e to the
natural log of W minus 300

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.310
is going to be equal
to e to the t over 25

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.600
plus the natural log of 1,100.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.050
Let me take this-- actually,
just to get the real estate,

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.020
let me delete that.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.520
All right.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.830
Now I can keep working
right below that.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.060
And so e to the natural
log of something

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.930
is just going to be
equal to that something.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.013
The natural log is what
power do I have to raise e

00:07:56.013 --> 00:07:57.850
to to get this thing.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.340
Well I'm raising
e to that power,

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.640
so I'm going to get this thing.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.510
So the left-hand side
just becomes W minus 300,

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.475
and the right-hand side,
we could rewrite this as e

00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:14.690
to the t over 25 times e to
the natural log of 1,100.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.352
We have the same base,
different exponents.

00:08:17.352 --> 00:08:18.810
If you wanted to
simplify this, you

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.268
would just add the
exponents, which

00:08:20.268 --> 00:08:21.730
is exactly what we did up here.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.380
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.820
e to the natural log of
1,100, that is 1,100.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.780
The natural log of
1,100 is a power

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.280
that you raise e
to to get to 1,100.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.669
So if you raise e to that
power, you get 1,100.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.409
So that is 1,100.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:46.780
So we get W minus 300 is equal
to 1,100 e to the t over 25.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.320
And then you just add
300 to both sides.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:56.220
W is equal to 1,100 e to
the t over 25 plus 300.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.430
And we're done.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.400
We have solved the
differential equation.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.400
We found the
particular solution.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.170
We had to solve for C to find
that particular solution.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:04.670
We're done.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.590
And we did it using
just basic integration.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.330
We didn't have to use any
of the fancy differential

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.690
equation solving
tools that you might

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.690
learn in a more advanced class.
