goal-setting is fascinating because it's

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200
goal-setting is fascinating because it's
 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.110
goal-setting is fascinating because it's
sort of a broken process in many

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120
sort of a broken process in many
 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.090
sort of a broken process in many
respects this is the way a goal works

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100
respects this is the way a goal works
 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.010
respects this is the way a goal works
you say to yourself when I achieve

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020
you say to yourself when I achieve
 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.379
you say to yourself when I achieve
whatever the thing is that's how I'll

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
whatever the thing is that's how I'll
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.029
whatever the thing is that's how I'll
know I'll have this I'll have succeeded

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
know I'll have this I'll have succeeded
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.770
know I'll have this I'll have succeeded
and I'm gonna do everything I can to get

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780
and I'm gonna do everything I can to get
 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.960
and I'm gonna do everything I can to get
to that point as quickly as possible

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970
to that point as quickly as possible
 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.160
to that point as quickly as possible
what that means is you exist in a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
what that means is you exist in a
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.080
what that means is you exist in a
failure State for a long time until you

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
failure State for a long time until you
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.370
failure State for a long time until you
reach that goal if it's a long-range

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
reach that goal if it's a long-range
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.730
reach that goal if it's a long-range
goal and so as you evaluate your process

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
goal and so as you evaluate your process
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.529
goal and so as you evaluate your process
all you get is the negative feedback of

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
all you get is the negative feedback of
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.020
all you get is the negative feedback of
not having achieved that goal perhaps as

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
not having achieved that goal perhaps as
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.369
not having achieved that goal perhaps as
you move closer to it there's some

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379
you move closer to it there's some
 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.800
you move closer to it there's some
positive feedback but if the goal is

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810
positive feedback but if the goal is
 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.210
positive feedback but if the goal is
really the end state that you're seeking

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220
really the end state that you're seeking
 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.340
really the end state that you're seeking
out there's a lot of failure before you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
out there's a lot of failure before you
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.020
out there's a lot of failure before you
get there and now here's the thing when

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
get there and now here's the thing when
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.370
get there and now here's the thing when
you do get there it's a massive

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380
you do get there it's a massive
 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.270
you do get there it's a massive
anticlimax

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
anticlimax
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.830
anticlimax
so there are people who achieve the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
so there are people who achieve the
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.380
so there are people who achieve the
highest highs people who achieve the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
highest highs people who achieve the
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.600
highest highs people who achieve the
highest highs in athletics in business

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
highest highs in athletics in business
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.340
highest highs in athletics in business
and if you talk to them and you destroy

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
and if you talk to them and you destroy
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.540
and if you talk to them and you destroy
it you ask them to describe what it's

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550
it you ask them to describe what it's
 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.979
it you ask them to describe what it's
like to reach their goals they say

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
like to reach their goals they say
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.709
like to reach their goals they say
things like I got there and it was an

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
things like I got there and it was an
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.410
things like I got there and it was an
incredible anticlimax I the minute I got

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
incredible anticlimax I the minute I got
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.090
incredible anticlimax I the minute I got
there I had to start something new I had

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
there I had to start something new I had
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.009
there I had to start something new I had
to find a new goal and that's partly

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
to find a new goal and that's partly
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:04.910
to find a new goal and that's partly
because there's something really

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
because there's something really
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.380
because there's something really
unsatisfying about the moment of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
unsatisfying about the moment of
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.300
unsatisfying about the moment of
reaching the goal unless it has its own

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
reaching the goal unless it has its own
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.980
reaching the goal unless it has its own
benefits that come from reaching the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
benefits that come from reaching the
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.080
benefits that come from reaching the
goal if it's just a sort of signpost

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
goal if it's just a sort of signpost
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.849
goal if it's just a sort of signpost
that doesn't do much for us it doesn't

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:13.859
that doesn't do much for us it doesn't
 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:15.770
that doesn't do much for us it doesn't
nourish us psychologically and what that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
nourish us psychologically and what that
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.359
nourish us psychologically and what that
ends up meaning is that we have to try

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369
ends up meaning is that we have to try
 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399
ends up meaning is that we have to try
and find something new so really if you

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
and find something new so really if you
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.289
and find something new so really if you
look at life as a series of goals which

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
look at life as a series of goals which
 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.870
look at life as a series of goals which
for many of us it is it's a period of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
for many of us it is it's a period of
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.879
for many of us it is it's a period of
being unsuccessful in achieving the goal

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:25.889
being unsuccessful in achieving the goal
 

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:27.609
being unsuccessful in achieving the goal
then hitting the goal then feeling like

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619
then hitting the goal then feeling like
 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.959
then hitting the goal then feeling like
you haven't really got much from that

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969
you haven't really got much from that
 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.419
you haven't really got much from that
goal going to the next one and it's a

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429
goal going to the next one and it's a
 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.219
goal going to the next one and it's a
sort of series of escalating goals a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
sort of series of escalating goals a
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.039
sort of series of escalating goals a
really good example of this is say smart

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049
really good example of this is say smart
 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.999
really good example of this is say smart
watches or fitbit's or exercise watches

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009
watches or fitbit's or exercise watches
 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.589
watches or fitbit's or exercise watches
people when they get those watches a lot

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:42.599
people when they get those watches a lot
 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.599
people when they get those watches a lot
of them hit on the number 10,000 I want

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609
of them hit on the number 10,000 I want
 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:47.800
of them hit on the number 10,000 I want
to walk 10,000 steps when you do that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810
to walk 10,000 steps when you do that
 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.269
to walk 10,000 steps when you do that
the thing will beep you'll feel pretty

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:50.279
the thing will beep you'll feel pretty
 

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:51.859
the thing will beep you'll feel pretty
good about it for a minute but then that

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
good about it for a minute but then that
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.539
good about it for a minute but then that
feels a little hollow and the goal

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
feels a little hollow and the goal
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.519
feels a little hollow and the goal
escalates over time people will describe

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:55.529
escalates over time people will describe
 

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:58.370
escalates over time people will describe
going from 10 to 11 to 12 to 14 thousand

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380
going from 10 to 11 to 12 to 14 thousand
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.199
going from 10 to 11 to 12 to 14 thousand
steps to the point where they're moving

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209
steps to the point where they're moving
 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.999
steps to the point where they're moving
through injuries through stress-related

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
through injuries through stress-related
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.209
through injuries through stress-related
injuries because the goal is there they

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
injuries because the goal is there they
 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.069
injuries because the goal is there they
respond to the goal more than they do to

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079
respond to the goal more than they do to
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.820
respond to the goal more than they do to
their internal click cues and and

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830
their internal click cues and and
 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.720
their internal click cues and and
basically there's something really

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
basically there's something really
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.160
basically there's something really
unfulfilled about that the reason the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
unfulfilled about that the reason the
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.840
unfulfilled about that the reason the
goal keeps escalating and becoming more

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850
goal keeps escalating and becoming more
 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.760
goal keeps escalating and becoming more
and more intense

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770
and more intense
 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.050
and more intense
is because when they achieve the goal

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060
is because when they achieve the goal
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.370
is because when they achieve the goal
they don't actually get anything for

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380
they don't actually get anything for
 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.010
they don't actually get anything for
that achievement and so goals generally

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020
that achievement and so goals generally
 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.930
that achievement and so goals generally
I think are in many ways broken

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940
I think are in many ways broken
 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.970
I think are in many ways broken
processes I think part of the problem

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980
processes I think part of the problem
 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.040
processes I think part of the problem
with goals is that they don't tell you

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050
with goals is that they don't tell you
 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.540
with goals is that they don't tell you
how to get to where you're going a

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550
how to get to where you're going a
 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.480
how to get to where you're going a
better thing to do is to use a system so

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490
better thing to do is to use a system so
 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.010
better thing to do is to use a system so
the idea behind a system rather than a

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020
the idea behind a system rather than a
 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.510
the idea behind a system rather than a
goal is that a system is saying things

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520
goal is that a system is saying things
 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.100
goal is that a system is saying things
like I'm a writer

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110
like I'm a writer
 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.080
like I'm a writer
my goal is to finish writing this book

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090
my goal is to finish writing this book
 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.400
my goal is to finish writing this book
but I'm not not gonna think about it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410
but I'm not not gonna think about it
 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.320
but I'm not not gonna think about it
that way eventually I'll have a hundred

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330
that way eventually I'll have a hundred
 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.270
that way eventually I'll have a hundred
thousand words but what my my system

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280
thousand words but what my my system
 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.070
thousand words but what my my system
will be that for an hour every morning I

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080
will be that for an hour every morning I
 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.450
will be that for an hour every morning I
will sit in front of my computer screen

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460
will sit in front of my computer screen
 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.580
will sit in front of my computer screen
and I will type it doesn't matter what

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590
and I will type it doesn't matter what
 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.180
and I will type it doesn't matter what
that looks like

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190
that looks like
 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.650
that looks like
I'm not going to evaluate the number of

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660
I'm not going to evaluate the number of
 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.540
I'm not going to evaluate the number of
words I'm not going to set some

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550
words I'm not going to set some
 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.430
words I'm not going to set some
benchmarks some artificial number or

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440
benchmarks some artificial number or
 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.320
benchmarks some artificial number or
benchmark that I should reach what I'm
