00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.934
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For our last question on absolute value equations, I want you to try to solve

00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:07.619
when one absolute value equals another absolute value. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can put your

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:11.562
answers here. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know this problem is a little more difficult than the others,

00:00:11.563 --> 00:00:12.425
but do your best.
