JOSH LIVNI: --this week's
Maps Developer

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.310
Relations office hours.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.450
My name is Josh Livni.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.410
I want to introduce here Paul
Saxman, a relatively new

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.510
member of our team here on
Maps Developer Relations.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.200
And we're going to cover a few
things this week starting out

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.980
with a review of some of our
launches at Google I/O.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.200
So every year, we have this
large Google I/O conference.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.350
Tons of things get announced.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.850
It's easy to miss one or two,
so we wanted to give some

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.150
details on some of the things
that relate to the Maps API

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.470
specifically and
the Places API.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.950
So just a quick recap, there's
quite a few people at Moscone

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.360
Center in San Francisco, lots
of people watching globally.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.700
You can watch most of the
videos already up at our

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.810
YouTube channel and
I/O website.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.950
And we're going to go ahead and
roll through some of the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.470
features starting now that we
post about on the blog and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.550
give a little bit
of extra detail.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.990
So why don't we get started
with our Places API?

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.920
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.920
So we announced four major
enhancements to the Google

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.050
Places API, Google I/O.
One of the big ones--

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.380
and this is all in response to
what developers were really

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.130
asking for.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.480
So hopefully, we hit
some of your most

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.500
favorite feature request.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.390
Google Reviews was one of the
enhancements that we added.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.860
The Reviews are actually
available in

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.850
two different forms.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.510
One is actually in the Place
search response.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.820
You can tell if a place is
actually open at the time of

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.950
the request.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.840
And that's just actually a
Boolean flag that's past.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.880
It's open now.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.050
And the other one is actually in
the Places detail request,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.280
which gives you actually
hours of operation.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.140
So you get an array back that
actually gives you the full

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.990
hours the place is open.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.630
Text search is another thing
that we announced at Google

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.070
I/O. Text search is a little
different than keyword search

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.410
in that text search is actually
good for actually

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.200
voice input.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.740
So if somebody is saying
something like sushi near

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.780
Sydney or pizza in New York
City, we actually process

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.230
that, determine what you're
searching on and where you're

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.070
searching, and then issue
the query from there.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.155
So the results look a lot like
the place search results.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.440
Oh wait.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.850
So I got that backwards.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.080
So Google Reviews said the
opening hours are actually

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.650
part of the search
and the details--

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.260
places search and
places detail.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.140
Reviews are also in there now.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.570
Reviews are only in the
place detail search.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.500
You get those back as
an array as well.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.830
I believe you get in there, you
get the ranking and the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.695
actual comments that
the user provided.

00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:42.300
JOSH LIVNI: The five most
popular reviews, the reviews

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.210
that we think give the best
impression of the place.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.900
So it should you a good idea of
how people like it or not.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.360
PAUL SAXMAN: Right.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.930
And the last one I'm going to
mention, this is actually one

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.750
of my favorites, pagination.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.850
So a lot of people were
a little worried--

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.760
you only got 20 results back.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.410
We allow developers now
to paginate and get

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.710
back up to 60 results.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.830
And the way that works is you
issue the places search query,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.980
you get back 20 results.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.500
And you get a key that you can
use to actually get the next

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.280
20 results.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.715
And when you get the next
20, you get another key.

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:17.480
You use that key to
get the next 20.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.800
So you get up to 60 total.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.580
There's slight delay between
when you can make those.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.620
So you don't want to just
try to pull down

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.610
all 60 at one time.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.710
Wait just a short
period of time.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.910
JOSH LIVNI: Maybe we should give
a couple of demos of what

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.370
the actual results
look like here in

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.800
some of the new features.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.540
Here, we have a place search for
my neighborhood, Glen Park

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.122
in San Francisco, looking
for some tea or coffee.

00:03:44.122 --> 00:03:48.200
Tea, in this case, is
a keyword search.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.330
And yup.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.500
We get our usual places back.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.460
And you can see the big
difference here is the opening

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.880
hours, not sure if you
guys can see that.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.260
I'll just make it even bigger.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.230
And you're just going to Boolean
here, is it open right

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.165
now, which is super useful.

00:03:59.165 --> 00:04:02.565
So you can get back your 20 or
60 places and easily filter

00:04:02.565 --> 00:04:03.855
for ones that are open or not.

00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:06.540
PAUL SAXMAN: And the structure
here is actually the same as

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.095
you'll see in the places details
results for open now.

00:04:11.095 --> 00:04:13.060
So if you go to the open--

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.340
JOSH LIVNI: Here's the
coffee shop I got my

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.580
coffee at this morning.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.910
And if we scroll down, we can
see we have our new opening

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.170
hours here which fall
the various days.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.990
So the day [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.220
I believe Sunday or Monday?

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.155
PAUL SAXMAN: I believe so.

00:04:28.155 --> 00:04:30.630
JOSH LIVNI: I think Sunday.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.510
And they have different hours
for the various days, which is

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.240
again, super useful.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.910
PAUL SAXMAN: All of our

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.250
documentation has been updated.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.390
So if you go to the Google
Places API documentation, all

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.400
this information is in there.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.240
So if you're trying to parse
this, it should be pretty

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.375
straightforward.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:51.340
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.940
And I think we've already
mentioned this in the past

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.260
hangout, the three-dimensional
Zagat ratings here that you

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.200
can get, the different aspects
of the different businesses.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.130
So it's super useful there
as well with the reviews.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.200
So yeah, check out the new
features of Places API.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.130
PAUL SAXMAN: Yup.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.370
Do we have the--

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.960
This one has some comments
in it as

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.095
well, the Google Reviews.

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:12.750
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.840
So you get the sort of
full text of the

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.435
review and pretty useful.

00:05:18.435 --> 00:05:20.260
PAUL SAXMAN: And you get
user's rating as well.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.490
So you get their ratings.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.430
You get their comments.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.045
And then you get a link to
the author information.

00:05:26.045 --> 00:05:28.000
JOSH LIVNI: Yup.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.990
All right.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.220
I think that covers it.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.705
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:32.466
I think that's everything.

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:33.960
Now on to--

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.440
JOSH LIVNI: Oh yeah.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.390
We have a little demo here.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.702
I guess we could the
same thing here.

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:37.350
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.810
So this is actually
on the blog.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.780
So we cover a lot of
the announcements

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.010
on the blog as well.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.600
And what you should be seeing
now is actually just a quick

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.730
demo of using the API in
a web application.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.290
JOSH LIVNI: Take the coffee
shop, and you could lay it out

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.525
more nicely from the JSON
response, of course.

00:05:55.525 --> 00:05:55.940
All right.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.240
Yeah.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.650
So Places API, scrolling down.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.800
Next one is Styled Maps, a
couple of new features there.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.840
Styled Maps, you all should be
using Styled Maps for sure

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.020
change our default base map.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.270
So we've optimized it well
for maps.google.com.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.750
But you probably have
a different story.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.800
Perhaps faded out to get
some overlays on top.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.810
Perhaps make some things
more prominent.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.420
Perhaps remove some features.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.440
So in addition to the existing
granularity of all the things

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.550
that you can subtract from the
map and change, we've added a

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.090
few key new features.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.930
The main ones are the ability
to set the color directly.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.250
Previously, you could
set the relative

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.620
hues, saturation, gamma.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.010
But you couldn't specify
an RGB value.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.880
For example, I want the
rows to be exactly

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.410
this color of red.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.240
And so now you can.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.220
And that's very,
very powerful.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.300
So it's much easier to have
the map match your brand.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.970
If you have a logo, you already
know your colors.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.320
You have a set of palettes that
you like to work with.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.580
You can easily choose the custom
colors for the map to

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.350
match your site.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.250
So that's really nice.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.160
The best way to do this, and
I'll show you the features

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.390
here in a demo, is as always,
use our Styled Maps Wizard.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.370
Let's see if I can figure
out how to open

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.610
Styled Maps Wizard here.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.890
I usually just do it by typing
in Styled Maps Wizard in a

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:13.180
search engine.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.480
You should get the result
pretty quickly.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.000
And here, we have a
tool that lets you

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.880
create the Styled Map.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.630
So for example, I often
like to turn

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.590
everything off right away.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.350
So I'll just go ahead and
turn everything off.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.730
It's not a very exciting map.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.000
I'll add that style.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.550
And then I can start turning
some things on.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.480
So for example, it could
turn on Roads.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.210
Turn them on.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.200
I won't see anything right
now because I'm

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.280
not zoomed in enough.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.280
But if zoom to say, Seattle,
I should see

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.610
some roads for Seattle.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.890
So what's cool now as I go here
is I can say I just want

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:47.780
the geometry of the roads.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.900
And also, here's
a new feature.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.080
Choose just the fill or just
the stroke of the roads.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.240
And each of those can be
styled individually.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.650
So the fill and the stroke
have separate

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.080
styles, pretty powerful.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.970
And the other feature that we've
added is the ability to

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.000
change the weight.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.590
So I can take the weight and
make, for example, really kind

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.830
of cartoony fat roads, which is
kind of fun, or really thin

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.500
roads if I just want things
more faded out.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:17.470
So I could, for example, take
some really thin roads and get

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.240
a really subtle style.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.975
And then maybe if I want to
emphasize the transit, get

00:08:23.975 --> 00:08:28.320
some really big transit.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.420
Now, I have a map that kind
of minimizes the roads,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.630
emphasizes the transit.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.460
Not a very pretty map,
but you get the idea.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.289
There's a lot of ability to
really not only turn things on

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.710
and off, but really emphasize
and deemphasize in a much more

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.360
subtle way with the ability to
weight the stroke and the

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.059
fill, and set the color.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.820
So check out the newest
Styled Map features.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.350
You can really make some
amazing stuff now.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.905
PAUL SAXMAN: Can I use this
to do 8-bit maps?

00:08:49.905 --> 00:08:52.210
JOSH LIVNI: Not quite
the 8-bit maps.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.200
We're getting closer.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:54.900
One day.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.200
PAUL SAXMAN: Can it do
a Middle Earth map?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.360
Can you make it look like--

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.670
JOSH LIVNI: I've definitely seen
some people start to get

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.840
a little bit more of those
old-style map fields with

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.190
their own custom icons and
so forth on top, fading

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.920
things in and out.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.500
But yeah.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.260
We're adding more and more
features to the different

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.260
types and styles.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.990
So keep them coming.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.920
Your feature requests
are super helpful.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.700
We look at those as always and
look forward to seeing you

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.310
guys implement some pretty
nice-looking styled maps here.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.220
Oh yeah.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:26.920
Next.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.530
These are really exciting
features to the Maps API, the

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.940
Symbols and the Heatmap.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.220
The Symbol Edition is probably
my favorite thing I saw

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.610
launched at I/O this year.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.350
Super powerful.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.315
I'm just going open
up a tab here that

00:09:40.315 --> 00:09:44.680
shows some marker symbols.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.830
You can apply the symbols to
polylines or to markers.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.310
If you apply them to the markers
here, you can see that

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.010
cool animation effects.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.750
What we're playing here
is opening of

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.270
Walmart stores over time.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.610
So a lot of them opened.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.780
It's pretty impressive.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.600
PAUL SAXMAN: The data is as
amazing as [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.035
JOSH LIVNI: And it really has
a lot of [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:07.990
I'm just throwing a lot of
markers on the map to call out

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.860
with an animation effect, which
is really easy to do,

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.770
where they're opening.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.470
So they don't get lost in the
noise in the East Coast there

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.470
and then recolor
them over time.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.090
Get rid of that message.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.330
And yeah.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.990
So I definitely recommend
checking out the Symbols.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.950
They're done with SVG.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.750
So it works on most
modern browsers.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.720
And then, let's take a look at
the kind of thing you can do

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.200
with the polylines here.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.550
PAUL SAXMAN: A quick question
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.850
So it's SVGs and animations,
right?

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.800
So you specify multiple SVGs to
get an animation, or you do

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.880
transitions?

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.500
JOSH LIVNI: I'll show you
right here in the code.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.860
What you do--

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.900
it's not too much code.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.085
Actually, this one is a
little more complex.

00:10:46.085 --> 00:10:47.750
It's mostly has to
do with the time.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.680
But yeah, you can probably
use it just to go in the

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.150
documentation, look at
the property there.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.680
But you can set the
radius, the color.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.480
And what we do is we make the
radius a little bit bigger for

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.460
just a second or so and then
fade out the opacity.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.980
And so you can dynamically
change the stroke, the fill

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.560
color, the radius, and of
course, the opacity.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.320
And with a combination of
those effects, you get a

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.710
pretty nice looking
transition there.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.170
So that's how that
one was done.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.200
And on Polylines, it's
even more impressive.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.580
This is not any particular data
set but just showing that

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.470
we can set the symbols along a
polyline animated, works on

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.890
geodesic lines like
you can see here.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:28.210
And you can do arbitrary SVG
paths that you can define,

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.070
allowing you to do complex
symbols, arrows that are

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:38.880
custom, set the distance they
are along the lines in pixels

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.390
or in percentage of the line
like we have here, and then

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.420
again, animate them.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.350
So you could imagine a set of
airports with planes flying.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.060
Not too much code.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.160
Get some really, really
beautiful animations here.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.970
So definitely check
out the Symbols.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.220
Very, very cool stuff.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.870
And similarly, the Heatmap,
it's the same data set.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.510
So it'll take a little while to
get started but can accept

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.470
tens of thousands of individual
Lat/Longs.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.590
And then, there's a bunch of
parameters on the heatmap.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.570
So here, we see the same
Walmart data set slowly

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.430
growing up over time.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.140
And I'll just quickly show you
what it can look like with

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.400
some of the options here.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.860
So here's some GPS traces
through San Francisco.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.760
You can imagine already if
you were to show these as

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.310
individual markers, it would be
a little less interesting

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.830
and doesn't show you that
relative density.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.460
But we have some ability
to change the

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.630
colors really easily.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.370
You just set a gradient for
how you want that to look.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:39.290
You can change the radius of the
heatmap, so if you want to

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.560
emphasize or deemphasize if you
have relatively large or

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.710
small number of markers, and
of course, the opacity.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.330
So playing with these values,
you can get a

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.290
really nice data set.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.605
And as you can see in the
example back here on the blog

00:12:50.605 --> 00:12:54.760
post of the Walmart stores, just
dynamically adding a new

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.960
Lat/Long to your array will
change the heatmap.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.400
So you create a pretty dynamic
heatmap story as well.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.650
PAUL SAXMAN: That's very cool.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.150
Obviously, that's a styled
map as well, right?

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.060
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.840
And as always, there's just
no excuse for using a

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.700
default-based map.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.410
You should use the styled
maps for sure.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.210
In this case, we just faded out
the background, because

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.000
the story we want to tell
doesn't need to emphasize

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.520
where the freeways are,

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.880
And the last major release
was Transit Directions.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.960
So this is available--

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.490
all the places that we have
transit for maps.google.com

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.610
with the exception of Japan.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.760
So that's a very large
number of major

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.710
cities around the world.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.740
So very, very cool, the number
one feature request in Maps

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:51.290
API that we finally were able
to get all the data for and

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.960
provide to you.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.130
So we're really excited
about it.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.450
I won't go into all the details
of what you get back

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.830
in the Transit API.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.790
But it's available as
a web service and to

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.930
the JavaScript API.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.220
And you basically make a
directions request, except

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.380
choosing your mode as transit
instead, for example, driving,

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.540
or walking, or bicycling in the
United States or Canada.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.920
So you choose the transit.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.460
And if it's available in that
metro, we will give back to

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:22.050
you quite a lot of detail
including the upcoming times,

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.250
similar to walking directions if
you have to walk there, how

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.560
long you have to wait for, if
you miss the bus or whatever,

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.230
actually I think about 40
different types transit types,

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.680
not just buses, of course, the
expected wait time for the

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.800
next one, and just a ton of
information that you can use

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.500
to build up a really nice
display for the user.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.650
Or you can use the standard
directions panel renderer.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.980
And we'll give you something
that looks like this that

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.140
looks pretty good and is
familiar to Maps users.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.015
So yeah, this works
really well.

00:14:57.015 --> 00:15:01.090
And I think it will allow a
lot new mashups and people

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.600
using these transit
directions.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.160
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.890
And the departure time, I think,
was definitely key from

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.460
a user interface perspective.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.090
I mean a lot of people actually
change the window for

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.200
when they're having
that in the API.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.900
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.420
So you can set any
starting time.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.690
We give you back when the trains
are coming in your

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.740
local time in UTC.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.920
Yeah, it's a very
flexible API.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.210
And I hope you guys make
good use of it.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.840
I think that's it for our
major features here.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.970
Oh, one other thing on the
Transit API, we've also made

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.420
available a transit layer,
just as we have a weather

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.870
layer, bicycling layer, a
traffic layer, and so forth.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.810
There's now a transit layer,
which you can add just two

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.730
lines of code by instantiating
a new transit layer and then

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.905
setting the transit
layer map to Map.

00:15:48.905 --> 00:15:51.020
You now get that custom
transit layer

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.880
background as well.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.200
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.520
These were the main
API announcements.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.410
But we also had a few non-API
announcements, for example,

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.815
the new 3D MyApps or 3D--

00:16:02.815 --> 00:16:03.770
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.250
So that was pretty
exciting stuff.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.790
It's not directly applicable
to developers today.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:12.620
But in Google Earth, we are now
modeling major urban areas

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.800
in automated way using
computer vision.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.490
And some of the aerial photos,
the oblique imagery, we're

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:24.400
able to automatically create
these really beautiful 3D

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.820
models that give
you a much more

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.380
natural feel to the landscape.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.410
So definitely check out
on your Mobile.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.250
This was the first time, I
think, in Google Earth that

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.170
we've launched on
mobile first.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:41.180
So on your iPad or Android
device, you can download the

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.220
latest Google Earth and zoom in
to, I think it was about 12

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.640
cities launched now.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.400
I'm not sure what they
all are off hand.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.940
Rome, that's a really
cool one.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.260
Check out the Coliseum and the
surrounding area, or as usual,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.600
San Francisco, always a must
on the launch list.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.940
Just a really, really nice
continuous, beautiful 3D set

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.280
of buildings.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.016
That's very, very cool.

00:17:03.016 --> 00:17:04.290
PAUL SAXMAN: And there was also

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.139
Coordinate that we'll probably--

00:17:06.139 --> 00:17:06.890
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.000
I think we're going to have
an upcoming Office

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.160
Hours focusing on that.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.079
We have an entirely new product
and associated API

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:19.410
that lets you manage teams of
people, workers, and jobs.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.349
Won't get in too much detail
today, I think.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:24.930
But check it out searching
for Google Coordinate.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.060
And you can see it if you have
that kind of business use

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.730
case, a super powerful feature
for tracking where groups of

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.050
people are, managing it,
allowing them on their mobile

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:39.310
device to take upon certain
jobs, and get instantaneous

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.750
real-time feedback on
a set of dashboards.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.870
But we're going to go in more
detail of that another day

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.990
PAUL SAXMAN: Right.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:51.060
I see it's actually applicable
beyond just like work.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.740
I mean you can actually
coordinate events and that

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.330
type of thing as well.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.395
JOSH LIVNI: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:54.395 --> 00:17:57.090
PAUL SAXMAN: It's a pretty
cool product.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:57.860
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.660
Anywhere you really have an
interest in groups of people,

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.875
where they're at, and things
they're doing [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:07.240
PAUL SAXMAN: Most of my dogfood
requests were meet

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.730
here for coffee.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.850
Those were my jobs.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:10.210
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.920
We had some fun testing that
before running around for

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.690
random jobs we were
supposed to do.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.830
I had to get a burrito
in a hurry.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.020
PAUL SAXMAN: Nice.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.790
JOSH LIVNI: It worked
out pretty well.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.920
PAUL SAXMAN: Burrito for you.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.860
You weren't a gopher,
were you, getting

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.338
burritos for everybody?

00:18:23.338 --> 00:18:26.570
JOSH LIVNI: I ended up
getting two burritos.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.000
So I think that pretty
much covers.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.850
Do we have any questions
on the moderator?

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.115
Should we check that
really fast?

00:18:31.115 --> 00:18:32.860
PAUL SAXMAN: Let me double
check really quick.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.200
So a lot of people were asking
about the slides in videos.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.490
Oh, we do have one
that came in.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.870
So the question we got from
Jeremy in London, will we be

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.920
able to use the Styling Wizard
with terrain in the future?

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.840
We really need terrain, but
it does not seem to style.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.790
JOSH LIVNI: So there's two
ways of looking at that.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:55.910
One is can you change the style
that we do to terrain

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.930
itself, for example, hypsometric
shading or the

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.780
altitude that we use, and the
sun angle, and so forth, doing

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.810
grey scale hill shade?

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.780
And the other is can you apply
all of the styles that we

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.230
currently have with our roadmap
on top of the terrain?

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.870
So the first answer is no.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.410
We currently pre-render all
of the terrain tiles.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:20.010
And so as of today, that's the
base terrain that you get.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.690
But the answer to the second
question is yes.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.530
I'll just open up the Styled
Maps Wizard again here.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.150
Start over and bring
up the terrain map.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:33.350
Let's see if there's a demo
here on the terrain.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.150
And by default, for example,
you could see we have the

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.420
labels and so forth.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.890
But we can easily go ahead and
take this administrative

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.370
stuff, turn it off.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.040
I can hit the Off button
and Style.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.610
All the administrative
features go away.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.740
PAUL SAXMAN: So you
can style the map.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.170
You can't necessarily
style the tiles yet.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:52.970
JOSH LIVNI: Exactly.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:53.240
Yes.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.820
So the base terrain
tiles, you can't.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.520
But if you wanted to have
the terrain with--

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.680
let's add this one and turn
the roads off, you can

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.520
certainly do that.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:07.370
And so all of the other things
such as the width and all the

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.940
other values that you can do
in regular styles, you can

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.830
also apply to terrain,
is really powerful.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.440
So you get all the features that
you want associated with

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.140
the terrain.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.935
But yeah, the base, the hill
shade, we currently don't let

00:20:19.935 --> 00:20:21.446
you style today.

00:20:21.446 --> 00:20:24.710
PAUL SAXMAN: And so one question
we got quite a bit

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.370
coming out of I/O was a lot of
people want the videos and

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.390
slides from I/O. And Josh
already mentioned--

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.130
just a little more detail
is that they're

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.170
all on the I/O website.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.505
So if you just search for Google
I/O 2012, you go to the

00:20:36.505 --> 00:20:38.070
I/O website.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.580
You can look at the sessions
for Google Maps.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.790
And each of the sessions, the
videos should all be up by

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.990
this point.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:49.760
And the slides are actually
coming out this week,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.810
hopefully by the end
of the week.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:52.800
So stay tuned.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.960
And if there's a particular
slide that you're looking for,

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.530
and it's not up there yet, just
let us know in Google+--

00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:59.180
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.610
We'll send you a link,
absolutely.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.610
PAUL SAXMAN: We'll
get to you guys.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:04.720
JOSH LIVNI: I think
that covers us.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.810
Thanks for joining us again.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:09.140
We'll be back in, I think,
two weeks from Sydney.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.020
So probably won't be us.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.070
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.310
PAUL SAXMAN: Not
any time soon.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:17.310
JOSH LIVNI: So our Sydney
colleagues will to be up in a

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.880
couple weeks.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.270
And we look forward
to chatting with

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.050
you more next time.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:20.650
Cheers.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.900
PAUL SAXMAN: Take it easy.
