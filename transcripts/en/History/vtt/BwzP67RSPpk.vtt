00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:05.538
NARRATOR: Winter is
lion season in Montana.

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:06.906
JAKE HERAK: They're
here, ready to hunt.

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:09.142
NARRATOR: And Jake Herak is
determined to get his hunting

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.044
pack running in top form.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.312
JAKE HERAK: I'm going
to take 'em down

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.080
and put 'em on the
start of this drag.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.014
Come on, dogs.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:15.915
Good boy.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:16.616
Hunt 'em up.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.784
Hunt 'em up.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.552
NARRATOR: Tracking
drills hone their senses

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.989
and are critical to making
sure the dogs chase predators,

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.158
and not the cattle
they're paid to protect.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:29.562
JAKE HERAK: It likes Lefty's
caught on to the scent here.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.931
NARRATOR: Jake prepped the
area with a raccoon hide,

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.234
to simulate a track and chase.

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:35.769
JAKE HERAK: He got
to the corner where

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.774
I did a whole 90-degree back
towards the wood line here.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.276
It looks like they're
kicking butt on it.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:45.578
See how they're running
parallel along there.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.480
They're paying no attention
to the bulls, which

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.215
is exactly what I want to see.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.584
That is a very, very good sign.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:52.552
I'm going to move in on 'em.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:53.420
[dogs barking]

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:57.190
You can hear 'em treeing.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.359
It looks like the
whole pack's there.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.628
So that's a good thing.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.463
Good boy!
Good boy!

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.169
[inaudible] actually
at the tree now.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.838
She's acting like
the other dogs.

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.273
Yeah!

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.974
And this is what
I'm looking for.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:16.810
At the end of the
day, these drags

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.945
like this is what
keeps these dogs

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:24.584
top notch, performance-wise,
and in damn good shape.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.786
Good dogs!

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.988
We got us a little tug
of war going on here.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.494
A lot of people might think
this training here might

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:36.029
seem a little bit barbaric.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.699
But what it comes down to
is these predators out here,

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:40.767
they're the real deal.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.402
And when you call me
and tell me there's

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.371
a mountain lion on your porch,
and I show up with the dogs,

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:48.441
this is the reason why they
perform the way they do,

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.777
is this right here.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.011
It's a great
feeling, watching all

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.847
your hard work coming together.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.315
It's time to get 'em out.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:59.452
They're pushing hard, kicking
ass, and taking names.
