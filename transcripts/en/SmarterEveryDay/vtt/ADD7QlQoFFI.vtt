00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:01.492
(Destin) Looks good to me.

00:00:02.712 --> 00:00:03.792
Nice.

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:06.490
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.517
So I'm gonna show you something today that's fascinating.

00:00:08.517 --> 00:00:11.241
If you take a normal piece of dry spaghetti.

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:12.321
you can do this in your home,

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:14.788
and you bend it right up until the point it breaks,

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:16.998
it doesn't do what you think it should.

00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:20.624
It doesn't break into two pieces, it breaks into three.

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:23.636
It happens almost every time. You see that?

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:24.859
That broke out of the middle.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.651
Today on Smarter Every Day we're gonna wait till the kids

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:28.800
finish their dinner and then we're gonna break out the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.420
Phantom V1610 and record this at a quarter million frames per second.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.944
And we're gonna unravel the secret of why spaghetti

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:38.118
shatters the way it does.

00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:39.313
You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:40.805
[music]

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.432
If you haven't already run to the kitchen

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:48.289
do that now. Grab some spaghetti and goggle up,

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.860
cause science is about to happen.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.608
One at a time, grab a noodle on both ends and bend it until it breaks.

00:00:53.608 --> 00:00:57.296
You'll notice that the majority of the noodles break into more than two pieces.

00:00:57.296 --> 00:00:59.395
Now you might not think this is a big deal.

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:01.339
But it's a really big deal.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.066
You see it's really easy to understand why bending

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.926
a rod makes it break into two pieces.

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:08.809
The bottom is in compression and the top is in tension.

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:11.142
When the tension on the top exceeds the maximum

00:01:11.142 --> 00:01:13.561
allowable tensile stress, it rips it in half

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.760
and you're left with only two pieces of the rod left.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.839
So why is spaghetti different?

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:20.472
Something else is happening here.

00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:22.789
The simple act of snapping spaghetti has stumped

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.638
brilliant scientists for years, including Richard Feynman,

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:28.038
who as you might know, was on the theoretical physics

00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:29.998
team during the Manhattan Project and also won a

00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:32.371
Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965.

00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:34.556
Everyone accepts that Richard Feynman was a genius

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:36.763
so it's no surprise that his theory about why

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.394
spaghetti snaps into multiple pieces makes a lot of sense.

00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:42.279
If you tried it by now yourself, you know that when you snap it

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:44.835
you feel this little vibration in your fingers.

00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:47.189
He thought that this vibration, if it was significant enough,

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.715
could excite the remaining spaghetti sufficiently

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:53.238
so that it would cause a secondary fracture on down the rod.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.902
To test this theory Feynman and a friend decided to snap

00:01:55.902 --> 00:01:58.598
spaghetti under water to dampen out this vibration.

00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:01.608
They were surprised to find out that when they snapped it under water

00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:04.237
it still seemed to break into multiple pieces.

00:02:04.237 --> 00:02:05.296
So here we are.

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:07.933
If a smart dude like Richard Feynman can't figure this out,

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.725
what chance do we have?

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:11.265
So we're gonna figure this out in my kitchen.

00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:12.299
This is what we're doing.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.868
My wife brought home all kinds of different pasta for me,

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:17.003
at my request.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.729
I've got them taken out here and we're running an experiment

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.157
with this high speed camera, it's a Phantom V1610.

00:02:23.157 --> 00:02:26.396
We have a lamp set up and we're just gonna sit and

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.191
break pasta and observe.

00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:32.005
I looked all over the internet and the fastest research imagery I could find

00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:34.024
was 4000 frames per second.

00:02:34.024 --> 00:02:35.656
So in order to further science,

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:39.061
we're gonna start out at at least 18,000 frames per second.

00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:40.790
Which surely should tell us something right?

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.224
[slowed snap]

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.882
Woah.

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:48.149
That was fast.

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.729
OK I couldn't even tell which fracture happened first.

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.699
We'll zoom it back in and go frame by frame.

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:55.885
[snap]

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.952
Yeah it's way too fast.

00:02:58.421 --> 00:03:01.727
Both fractures happen at what seems to be the same time.

00:03:01.727 --> 00:03:03.835
Let's look at another piece that breaks up even more

00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:06.371
and see if it sheds some light into what's going on here.

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:08.495
[snap]

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:10.315
What?!

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.517
It's like all the fracture points are happening at the exact

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:15.057
same time which is crazy because we're well below a

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:16.991
millisecond time scale here.

00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:19.230
I'm not really sure what the researchers were seeing

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.437
at 4000 frames per second, but I'm not seeing it.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:25.132
So let's bump this thing up to 40,000 frames per second

00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:27.884
which is ten times faster than any research paper I've read.

00:03:29.484 --> 00:03:30.638
[snap]

00:03:33.977 --> 00:03:36.000
Hmm. OK so we're starting to learn something.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.725
I can at least tell that the right side broke first.

00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:41.060
But both still seemed to be happening within 100 microseconds

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.527
of each other, which is really really fast.

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:47.155
Also, let's start to watch the rotation direction of the broken pieces.

00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:50.334
Let's watch another one and see if vibration has anything

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:51.998
to do with that second fracture.

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:55.396
[snap]

00:03:57.557 --> 00:03:58.226
No.

00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:00.426
In fact it appears that the longer rods aren't even

00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:02.651
vibrating on the same time scale.

00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:03.826
Here's something though.

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:06.701
If you look, the smaller broken pieces when they start to rotate,

00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:10.268
always seem to rotate away from the first fracture.

00:04:10.268 --> 00:04:13.381
The back however appears to be breaking downwards.

00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:16.294
It's almost as if the spaghetti is trying to straighten itself out

00:04:16.294 --> 00:04:18.796
but it can't overcome its own mass.

00:04:18.796 --> 00:04:21.295
Buckle your seatbelt cause we're going to a quarter million

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:22.636
frames per second.

00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:27.261
[snap]

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:32.261
Man, we had to go way faster than I thought we would to get this answer

00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.290
but there it is.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.890
I mean it's not vibration.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.162
It's the curvature of the spaghetti as it straightens out.

00:04:38.162 --> 00:04:39.921
Think about it this way.

00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:42.529
The entire spaghetti rod is under torque, right?

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.027
Because of this torque, it bends in a curve.

00:04:45.027 --> 00:04:47.668
And when a break occurs, the side near the break is now

00:04:47.668 --> 00:04:49.159
free from torque.

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.170
But there's still this counter-torque built up in the rod.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.058
So it starts to straighten itself out from left to right,

00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:57.870
rotating up and straightening out along the way.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.869
Because the spaghetti on the left is already straightened out

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:01.566
and the spaghetti on the right is still curved,

00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:04.036
the point where they meet is now even more curved,

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:07.401
which causes the spaghetti to bend beyond the minimum failure radius.

00:05:07.401 --> 00:05:09.035
This results in a fracture.

00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:11.662
It's like one side doesn't get the message fast enough.

00:05:11.662 --> 00:05:14.966
If the whole rod were to release at one time it'd be fine,

00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:15.832
but it doesn't.

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:18.364
It breaks itself apart along the way.

00:05:18.364 --> 00:05:20.965
Every time you have a new break the process starts all over again.

00:05:20.965 --> 00:05:25.061
This physical phenomenon is called a cascading fracture.

00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:27.206
Until recently the math behind this phenomenon wasn't

00:05:27.206 --> 00:05:28.690
very well understood.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.809
But I did find a really cool French research paper on the topic

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:35.804
as well as a neat simulation created by some Norwegian petroleum engineers.

00:05:35.804 --> 00:05:39.462
To my knowledge though, the video that we just watched gives more insight

00:05:39.462 --> 00:05:42.571
into this physical phenomenon than anything else that's ever been done.

00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:45.623
We just did it at a quarter of a million frames per second,

00:05:45.623 --> 00:05:46.454
which is amazing.

00:05:46.454 --> 00:05:47.696
So there you go.

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:50.901
The secret of snapping spaghetti is not just a party trick.

00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:52.703
The next time you boil spaghetti,

00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:56.064
be careful because you are about to explore the very edge

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.932
of scientific knowledge.

00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:00.940
So thank you very much for watching this episode of Smarter Every Day.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.796
If you would like to get a book that talks about all the things

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:06.970
that Richard Feynman studied, I recommend an Audible book

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.693
called Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman.

00:06:09.693 --> 00:06:12.805
I'm listening to it right now and it's really good.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.345
If you would like to support Smarter Every Day

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:17.362
go to Audible.com/smarter and download

00:06:17.362 --> 00:06:19.970
Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman and you would

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.365
support Smarter Every Day and I would

00:06:21.365 --> 00:06:22.543
greatly appreciate that.

00:06:22.543 --> 00:06:23.513
So thank you very much.

00:06:23.513 --> 00:06:24.536
I'm Destin,

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:25.858
you're getting Smarter Every Day,

00:06:25.858 --> 00:06:27.329
have a good one.

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:28.163
(kid) Woo!

00:06:28.163 --> 00:06:29.192
(Destin) You ever heard of Richard Feynman?

00:06:29.192 --> 00:06:30.727
(Kids) No. No idea.

00:06:30.727 --> 00:06:31.623
- No idea?

00:06:31.623 --> 00:06:34.862
- I have no idea who he is but it sounds fine.

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:36.533
- [laughs] Well he is.

00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:41.034
He's a little different than daddy but he's a pretty smart awesome dude.

00:06:42.404 --> 00:06:43.480
Three.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.367
At least four.

00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:50.277
I hope this video earned your subscription.

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:52.564
If not, just enjoy this confused fish.

00:06:52.564 --> 00:06:53.499
Thanks.
