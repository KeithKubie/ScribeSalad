00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.850
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.390
It's Bill Burr his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.640
August fucking 27th,
August 27th.

4
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:14.970
What's going on?
How are you?
Um,
as you know,

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.960
I don't have a lot of guests on a,
on my podcast.

6
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:22.320
Every once in a while I'll have someone that interests me,

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.720
a middle leather chair.
I'm not like constantly fighting here.

8
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:26.400
I'm just adjusting my weight.

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.170
I have one of my oldest friends in this business.

10
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:35.100
I've known this man since 1995 when we were a couple of,

11
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:39.980
nobody's going around fucking New York trying to get spots.
He has his name.
Oh,

12
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:43.590
I just introduce you.
Unbelievable comedian.
Mr Tom Pop.

13
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:47.520
Everybody nice to be here.
Bill 95.
That's amazing.

14
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:51.000
So I was only doing stand up for two years when we miss that.
Right.

15
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.510
You were already really good.
93.
I wasn't good.
I was loud.

16
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.380
I was loud and fast.
Well,
I remember,
uh,
Geraldo rest,

17
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:02.040
his soul used to tell me that the way you used to stand on stage,

18
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.620
you were in some sort of like warrior one or warrior too.
I was sort of weird.

19
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.180
Lean.

20
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.590
<v 0>I wa I called it the lens was that lunch.
I would like lean.
Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:16.790
I would kind of like bend my one leg and kind of lunch that way and talk to that

22
00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:19.580
part of the audience.
Then I would lunge the other way,
talk to them about it.

23
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:23.270
Got Laughs.
So yeah,
I thought they'd probably be like,
he's a character.

24
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.960
He's thinking of character.
We can build a sitcom around this guy.
Look at,

25
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.990
he's a young guy.
Like back then that was the whole thing.
Long bushy curly hair.

26
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.780
Ah,
um,
uh,
probably about 25 pounds heavier than I am now.
Oh,
you were heavier?

27
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.380
Yeah.
And uh,
are you a party in back then?
Who was like my crazy,
uh,

28
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.330
my wife calls it when she saw a tape of it.
She didn't know me back then.

29
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:47.270
She saw me probably 10 years after that.
And when she saw,

30
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.750
I don't know if you have like a good tape of you when you first started,

31
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:54.620
but there's like,
they're all so classic and uh,

32
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.760
she sighed and said,
it looked like my crazy brother showed up in,

33
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:03.090
came to town and started doing comedy.
You're Roger Clinton showed up.
Right?

34
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.390
And say I did kind of look Roger Clinton this had,
they kind of a,

35
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.030
almost a mullet,
but not really.
I got one in a,

36
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.330
<v 1>I forget where the hell I was.
I was doing some local Boston show.
Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.690
I mean it was taped.

38
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.020
Someone's gotta have the tape somewhere and I was wearing basically the clothes

39
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:25.380
that I wore to the dental office that day.
I was still working them.

40
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:27.370
I was definitely wearing the pants here.
Right.

41
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.930
So I had like powder from the rubber gloves and God knows how much germs on me

42
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.210
cause I like the only way to make the Gig was I had to work and then just jump

43
00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:39.370
in my car and go.
So I brought a chair,
a chair,
I brought his shirt.
So I had,
uh,

44
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.890
I had on navy blue Docker's Oh.
And then I had a shirt.
Uh,

45
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.160
it was navy blue stripe and like,
like pea soup,

46
00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:50.770
green horizontal stripes.

47
00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:55.771
I had a big red afro tucked in and a shirt tucked in now no grunge had already

48
00:02:57.131 --> 00:02:58.300
hit at that point.
Nice.

49
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.660
So I in [inaudible] 92 so it was already like Roger's already going.

50
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.550
So it was like if he tucked in your shirt,
you were part of the 80s.

51
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.080
So the show I believe was on tucked,

52
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.940
might not have been now that I think about it,
but I was,

53
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.680
I just remember I was pointing at the crowd when I every like,

54
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.320
like Annunciation,
I was doing this thing.
You remember when Trump did that thing,

55
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:20.350
you're fired that little snake thing here with his hand and they made fun of it

56
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:24.860
so much he stopped doing it.
Right.
Um,
which is kind of funny to think about now.

57
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.210
That's interesting though.
You with the pointing as you're telling the jokes.

58
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:30.430
I mean with the lunging.
Yes.
Uh,

59
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.030
because the two guys that I want it to be kind of bad ass,

60
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:35.500
like I didn't want to be like them,

61
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:39.520
but I can look back and think like Bill Hicks and Denis leary.

62
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.630
We'd get in the audience's face and they would kind of like jab at them kind of

63
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:46.330
that way.
Oh,
okay.
Are you watching those guys at that time?

64
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.620
I didn't even know who bill Hicks was until after he died.
Oh really?
Well,

65
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:54.370
I mean because Bill Hicks was not getting on mainstream stuff.

66
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:57.010
He had done a couple of letterman's,
but back then,
you know,

67
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.580
if he didn't know to look for them,
if you missed his letter in spot,

68
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.690
you just missed it.
I found them by mistake on Caroline's comedy hour.

69
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.140
Oh,
okay.

70
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.850
To Caroline's comedy hour when Caroline's was down in another location I think

71
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.970
by the seaport or something before our time.

72
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.920
And I saw him and he would get like right in their face.

73
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.980
He would at the edge of the stage,
he bend all the way down with a cigarette.

74
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.950
Right.
Someone's face and yell about Britney Spears or whatever.

75
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.270
No,
he was gone before Britney spears.

76
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:28.420
I just felt at that time like you have no materials so you just,

77
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.100
you know you're funny but you have no real skill.
You got some stuff,

78
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.500
but then it's just pure energy.

79
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.070
It's just what I think that that's because I was totally like introverted,

80
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:42.700
but saw that that was me just sort of,
I think it was just,
that was me.

81
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:44.830
I was miming throwing shit against the wall.

82
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.830
I think every job that I was doing,

83
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.820
but then as we came up through the ranks,

84
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.840
what amazed me about you was the way that you could like always worked.

85
00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:01.720
Totally clean and like you,
I mean,
you know,
we came up,

86
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:04.600
you know SD would be given us the light spots.
That's how it is.

87
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.400
You've got to earn,
you got to earn the earlier ones.
Yeah,
and I am.

88
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.580
You'd go on after Godfrey crushing,
you know all of these guys.

89
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.050
You go on at the my filth and you'd go out there and just totally sport coat on,

90
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.310
squeaky clean.
Well and just boom,
you just killed.

91
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.200
I did go through some phases when,

92
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.670
especially when it got to the seller where I was,
you know,

93
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
going up after it's hell where for a good month I thought I've got to be

94
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.760
dirtier.
I've got to,
yeah,
I've got to do something.

95
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.090
So I started coming up with filthier stuff and I'm telling you,

96
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.150
just the audience knew.
They don't know me at all.

97
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.890
That is not this guy.

98
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.900
They knew I was not the guy saying these were like,

99
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:54.310
it wasn't,
it did not fit.

100
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.070
And you know what's funny is what you're saying right now is all you had to say

101
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.810
after Dave.
Yeah.
Like I'd like to continue right in that dark world,

102
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:05.890
but look at me folks.
I'm not that guy.
Yeah,

103
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.460
you didn't have the courage or like the,
the,
the wherewithal to do that.

104
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:15.461
So my only cure for it was don't watch anybody before I go on,

105
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.780
just to completely stay alone and wait for them to come and get me like last

106
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:23.360
minute.
Like,
Hey,
they're calling your name and then go down.

107
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.130
Isn't that amazing note.
But I think people that are successful will find ways,

108
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.730
you know,
in situations like that they actually come up,

109
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:35.330
they'll come up with their own sort of exercise.
Yeah.
To be all right.

110
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:39.290
Well if I just don't see it then I don't have to like deal with it.
Yeah.
And um,

111
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.050
some way to preserve whatever you got to kind of do.

112
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.940
I did something last week when I was on Conan.
Right?
Uh Huh.

113
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.290
I did something that I learned at the comedy cellar.

114
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.710
It was a comedy cellar is small as it is.
Yeah.

115
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.880
It always seems so gigantic to me because it was like this place you wanted to

116
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.280
get into st would be watching your sets.

117
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.960
The fucking wait staff would report back to management and shed energy and you

118
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:04.400
just never felt like,
you know,

119
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:07.760
it takes a good eight years before you feel like you're in it.
Totally.

120
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.200
So I remember Patrice had done something on stage.

121
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.000
I don't know what happened.
He had done something,
so they called a meeting.

122
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.200
It was,
this is fucking hilarious.
They call this meeting to at the comedy cellar.

123
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.950
Okay.
And the three people showed up on all the comics.

124
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.810
It was me and Bobby.
I was living with Bobby Kelly.
Bobby's like,
dude,

125
00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:33.180
we gotta go to the meeting.
She's going to take away I spots.
And I'm like,
I know.

126
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.880
And we both went down there fricking frack to Boston guys.
We'd go down there.

127
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.510
It was us two and David Tell,
oh my God,
Patrice,

128
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.540
who the whole fucking meeting was about,
didn't even show up of course.

129
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.250
And everybody else was kind of in and they say,

130
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:47.990
I got get a fucking going down there.
But anyway,

131
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.980
we went in there and I remember waiting for a SDN Manny to get their rest,

132
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:54.980
his soul.
And I just was,
I was absent.

133
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:58.820
It was the middle of the day and I could not believe how small the club was.

134
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.370
Right.
And I was just like,
oh my God.
I mean I could literally,
yeah,

135
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.670
move all the chairs out of here in 11 minutes by myself.
It is.
Yeah.

136
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.490
Sometimes I'll go down to,
to go to use the restroom even now,

137
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.000
and you go down there and it's just empty and everything's pushed aside.

138
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:19.001
So they can mop and it really is like a closet and it's because when,

139
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.460
I don't know what it is about that room,
when it gets full,
it's and yes.

140
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.030
And it just,
it,
it becomes this other,

141
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:32.690
this energy thing that you just saw.
And then when it's,
everybody's gone.
Yeah.

142
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:36.450
And they're like going like,
this is this place.
It's like,
you know,
so anyways,

143
00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:36.950
so I went,

144
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:41.330
I had to go to Conan and I just so happened I was ready for once before the,

145
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.670
you know,
right as the guy got there to pick you up.
Uh,

146
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.400
so I got there like 15 minutes early.
There was nobody there,

147
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.060
so I was like,
you know,
I always just walk out there.

148
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:52.250
Why don't I just walk out and take a look at it?
Yeah.

149
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.560
Just so I can really have in my head how big it is.
Oh.
You know,

150
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.190
it was still pretty big and that's,
yeah,
that's that smell.
But I mean,

151
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.290
but it wasn't like it's your space.
I wanted to be more grounded.
Right.

152
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:06.330
So I went up,
I looked at the drum kit and stuff,

153
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:10.410
sat down and played for like two seconds and then like walked around and talked

154
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:12.970
to a couple of people.
A few people said hello.
Yeah.

155
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.160
And then it just kind of felt like,
and I was just looking at smart.
Yeah.

156
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.450
That's so smart.
Yeah.
So cause even when you leave,
you've done the show a bunch,

157
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.730
but when you could walk back out it feels new again.
It's not your home.
Yes.

158
00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:29.460
So I did the new again thing before the cameras were on.
Nice.

159
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.540
And then so then when I went out there I felt like I was,
you know,

160
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:34.710
the most present.

161
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.870
I didn't have that same outer body experience where afterwards I had all would

162
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.080
always look at Andy and be like,
was that good?
Like,
like basically what happened.

163
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.180
I totally,
because the whole time you're doing it,

164
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:47.790
you're thinking like nowadays too,
it's like,

165
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.030
then I just end my fucking career right there.
What did I say?
You know,

166
00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:54.380
is this group going to come at me?
Or fat people going to say this?
Like,
ah,

167
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.590
you know all of that shit.
So anyway,
speaking of careers,

168
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:03.120
yes you are on this podcast.
Not because you like me.
Wow.

169
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.210
Not because she wanted to come over here and smoke a cigar afterwards with some

170
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:09.830
finding out you don't have time.
Oh,
I with Tom Papa.
Um,

171
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.960
not only an incredible comedian.
You also bake your own bread.
Yes,
I do.

172
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.760
What you've been doing for years on end you,

173
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:21.210
you were actually nice enough to offer to teach me and I've just never found

174
00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:24.450
time to get over there.
And I brought you bread.
Oh you pick a year ago.

175
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.000
You remember I brought it to like two times.

176
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.240
I vaguely remember cause it's gone that quick and it brings it over in a little

177
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:34.030
basket with this old lady.
Little towel over the top of it and you're like,
ah,

178
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.850
like you don't even need butter.
You made us a,
uh,
what did you make us?

179
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.350
I always get a sour sour dough.
Yeah.
Ah,
good stuff.

180
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.101
I got good on me.

181
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:47.580
And Nia basically ate the whole loaf talking about what we were going to eat it

182
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.400
with that night.
And we,
we're just not the whole thing.
We were like,

183
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.290
we got to finish this.
So now all of a sudden,
yeah.
Um,
your,

184
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:59.880
your professional and your hobby life have now blurred here and you have a new

185
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:04.560
cooking show coming out today,
I guess,
right?
Monday a week.

186
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.820
A week from Labor Day.
Oh,
Labor Day.
So a week from today,
what's the exact date?

187
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.480
Uh,
September,
third,
Thursday,
10 o'clock at night.

188
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.200
10 o'clock east called baked.
It's called baked.
And No,

189
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:21.180
you're not putting any wheat in the bread,
man.
Hey Man.
Um,
uh,
yeah,

190
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:25.650
it's not really a cooking show as much as a food show.
Like I'm not going to,

191
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.860
well I guess I,
I guess I am cooking basically what I did.
Well,

192
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:34.110
it's not going to be eight episodes of watching you cook bread now.
Okay.
Exactly.

193
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.680
That's,
uh,
that's kind of what I thought it was going to be.
And they're like,

194
00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:39.270
this is going to be over in an episode.

195
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.110
Do you have a hundred different kinds of loaves of bread?
Right?
You can make,

196
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.070
so we can get there to syndication.
So what I was doing,

197
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.300
I started baking it.

198
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.990
I started getting really good at it and when I would travel around on the road

199
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.540
doing stand up during the day,
I would visit bakeries.

200
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.170
I would go check them out and I was just trying to learn like see what flower

201
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:03.070
they were using,
talk to them,
that kind of thing.
Yeah,
you got into it.

202
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:08.130
I got into it and they caught wind of it and thought it would be a cool show

203
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.210
because I'm already doing it.

204
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:13.450
I'm going to these places and then you know I'm going to learn.

205
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:16.780
I'm super curious about it and they didn't have any show that just dealt with

206
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:19.960
baked goods.
Can you back up for a second?
How did they catch wind of it?

207
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.380
I got that Alexis in your fucking house or something.

208
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.610
How do they catch wind and I are a comic killing a day and you're going to

209
00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:32.110
bakeries because I started talking about it on social media as asked about an on

210
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.520
Rogan's podcast.

211
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.820
I talked about it on Conan and in the New York Times did an article on people

212
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:47.080
with sourdough starters.
You know,
the sourdough starter is the literal mother,

213
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.850
the mother.
I hate that.
I hate this.
I saw the thing,
there's,

214
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.270
there's like a thing in France that some of them have,
they're like a,

215
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.200
they're like a couple hundred years old.
Yeah.

216
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.290
Like you just keep feeding it some sort of bacteria or,
no,

217
00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:03.640
you just keep feeding it flour and water and it eats,

218
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:07.270
it stays alive yet it's the act of yeast in there.

219
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:09.520
And so you've got to feed it flour and water and it eats it.

220
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:12.640
And so it's like they've had a goldfish that they'd been feeding for like the

221
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:16.660
last since like the early 18 hundreds.
Yeah.
And it's a little vague,

222
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.240
like when people say it's a hundred years old,
I mean,

223
00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:23.720
cause you like nobody ever spelled it.
It has its origin.
Like it has it,

224
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.310
you will have,
it will connect to however long you've been feeding it,

225
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:30.850
but you're dumping a lot of it and then new flower and water's going in.

226
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.080
But it's just a cool story.
Yeah.
You know,
and uh,

227
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.750
now I feel like a novice,
like people do care about it.

228
00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:42.280
People do like hang on to them,
pass them down to other people in their family.

229
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:47.281
And it is a thing like you might have two of them and they're in my refrigerator

230
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:49.150
and I've been on the road now for a week.

231
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:54.270
I just got home today and I know when I leave you I'm going to go home and feed

232
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:56.590
them cause it's been a week.
If you don't feed it,

233
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.780
it slowly starts to become less active.

234
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.840
It has no food to eat and then it starts creating its own alcohol and that's it.

235
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.021
When you come back,

236
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:08.590
there'll be like a layer of alcohol on top of it now sold your Looch,

237
00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:10.750
you're like a microbrewery.
Yeah,
exactly.

238
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.340
Oh it's literally calls who literally how pure alcohol booze that called hooch.

239
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.690
Yeah,
it's a fermentation.

240
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.920
This is already the most informative podcasts I've ever done.

241
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.840
That's fucking awesome.

242
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.580
So the New York Times did an article on people with their sourdough starters and

243
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.930
just,
you know,

244
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.860
I've been doing it for like a year and they came into my house and took pictures

245
00:14:32.861 --> 00:14:36.040
of me with my starter and I was in the food section.
This is,

246
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.350
I'm not doing anything,
show busy with this.

247
00:14:38.351 --> 00:14:40.150
I'm just baking bread with my daughter have,

248
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:41.760
isn't that always how it comes about when you're,

249
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.650
when you're not trying not at all.
And uh,

250
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:50.130
my friends back east slope in the New York Times and the calling me that day,

251
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:54.710
like,
what are you doing?
What's,
why are you in the food section?

252
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.700
So it just became a thing

253
00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.720
<v 0>and then people started sending me things on Twitter and Facebook or whatever,</v>

254
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:06.760
uh,
showing me that there are attempts at baking like,

255
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.870
<v 1>and that's a massive subculture yeah.
Of,
it's not even just people who bake,</v>

256
00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:16.190
like specifically bake bread.
Yeah.
People who are into bourbons.

257
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:20.420
Like there's all these subcultures thing that when you all of a sudden get into

258
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:23.330
it.
Totally.
Yeah.
You just feel like open the door a little bit.

259
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:25.550
All of a sudden you see those like,
you know,
a million people in.
They're like,

260
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.040
yeah,
yeah.
You're like,
wow,

261
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.160
look at all these Instagram accounts of people doing what I'm doing.

262
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.340
<v 0>So is it just kind of,
uh,
took off and was super fun.</v>

263
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:41.540
And I also,
at the same time that I started baking it,

264
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.370
I also started getting on this kick of,
uh,
this is,

265
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.430
why are we the first generation it bread has been around for thousands of years.

266
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.700
Why are we the generation that's being told we shouldn't eat bread?

267
00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.320
Why all of a sudden are we now like,
no,

268
00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:03.830
you're the new human beings that Cammy bread.
And I was like,

269
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.530
there's something wrong here.
And then we started baking this bread.

270
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.220
It's just flour,
water,
salt and yeast.
That's all that's in it.
And with the bread,

271
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:14.360
I would buy,
my daughter's in the supermarket trying to get them good bread,

272
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:19.340
had 30 ingredients in it,
right?
Chemicals,
sugars,

273
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:20.500
glucose,
all this other

274
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.540
<v 1>isis,
isis,
it was all in there.
Yeah.</v>

275
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.950
Russian poisoned [inaudible].
And

276
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.290
<v 0>I started giving that bread to my friends that have problems with eating bread.</v>

277
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.430
And they had no problems.

278
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.300
We were eating a lot of bread and we weren't getting fat.
And I was like,

279
00:16:40.301 --> 00:16:42.910
this is the pure thing.
This is what bread really is.

280
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.980
So then I started going off on this kick in my acts and it started,

281
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.050
you know,
a permeating other parts of the Bible.

282
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.270
It was in my book where I was just like,

283
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.600
we should be allowed to celebrate in life.

284
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.140
<v 1>You should be allowed.
Can I pitch in episode?
Yes.</v>

285
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.830
An episode cause you got eight already in the can.
Okay.
You're next season.

286
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.750
[inaudible] Tom teaches bill how to bake bread or even just great.

287
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.900
Even just for the website.
That would be awesome.
I would love,

288
00:17:10.901 --> 00:17:14.830
I am on this new diet that I've been doing for like the last three weeks and

289
00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:15.850
I've been,
you know,

290
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.870
keeping the muscle and dropping all the fat and I love how I look and
everything,

291
00:17:19.871 --> 00:17:22.980
but it's just like I,
I,
you know,
and I come,

292
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.930
I got to have a piece of bread every once in awhile.
Every once in awhile.

293
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.540
And you eat,
you what?
Okay,

294
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.990
I'll do this shit that I used the [inaudible] part of my generation.

295
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.370
You might always wonder bread,

296
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
my son stay comes on Wonderbread and the grease would be going through the bread

297
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.080
.
You have to eat it quick before we went through.
Oh yeah,

298
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.660
you're going to like a fork or something.
I um,
and I stand by dude.
I,

299
00:17:45.661 --> 00:17:49.470
I had that today.
I would have to take a nap immediately,

300
00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:53.490
but it would be effing delicious and a child's sense.
Memory Foam,

301
00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.530
but your stuff.
Yeah.
Um,
Ihs,
your brand.
I was like,

302
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:02.490
I got to call my parents.
I mean it was just,
it was just like,

303
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:07.230
it was like a wholesome,
yeah.
Holidays,
everything that like,
you know,
when,

304
00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:11.250
when all the bs slows down in life,
right.
You know,

305
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.890
you just got passed something or maybe it's the holidays,

306
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.600
you've got a few days off,
you just have time,

307
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:19.470
but you actually have free time to hang with the people in your life.
Like,
oh,

308
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:23.700
this is what it's and so could be.
Right,
exactly.
This is what it could be.

309
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:27.150
And it's not every day.
I mean these are special moments in your life,
you know?

310
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:27.570
I mean,

311
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.080
basically the way the show goes is I just pictured you talk in your family,

312
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:35.600
like don't get Yoast today.
It's special thing.

313
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.270
There's bread in the house all the time now.
Like when I go on the road,

314
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:44.060
if I'm gone for a while,
they get for the first time they call me.
They're like,

315
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.970
when are you coming back?

316
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.030
And it's not because he want to see if you realize your kids,

317
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:53.300
they're going to talk about you like some like grandmother from the early 1900

318
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.350
stones.
There was always the smell of bread in our house.
That's right.
I'm out.

319
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.120
I'll always remember her.

320
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:05.150
I remember her when she passed the casket smelled like east east to discuss the,

321
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.420
sorry,
I should've said bread.
It just took a whole nother angle on there.

322
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.100
So what's your favorite?
Uh,
so,
so,

323
00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.490
so basically I go around to all these different cities.

324
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:19.490
I come into a city and I visit five of the best baked goods I can find a bakery.

325
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.630
I'm a sandwich place with amazing roles,
a pizza place,
whatever it is.

326
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:29.930
What we're dealing with doe and that kind of thing and you quickly realize this

327
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:34.410
back to it being special,
you quickly realize there doesn't,

328
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.400
there is no need for a bakery in a town.
You know what I mean?
Like there's,

329
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.850
you need the cops,
you need the fire department,
you need the power,

330
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.820
you need the the water,
you need all this stuff.

331
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.880
A bakery is a special little place that's just happens to be at the town that

332
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.310
when you want to treat yourself or get something nice for your family,

333
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.900
that's when you go to the bakery.

334
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:59.490
It's this nice little celebration in your everyday life.

335
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.980
You don't go there every day,
you know most of the time.

336
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.970
So all these people are creating this really special stuff and you go in there

337
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:13.620
and you feel good and that you should be celebrating your life like this is it

338
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:17.520
like this.
We're not going to this.
This is prime time.

339
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.490
This is when we're really going to enjoy ourselves.

340
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.170
You take your daughter and walk into a bakery and give her a cookie.

341
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.570
That is a special moment.
That's a special thing.
You know when she,

342
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.350
when she turned a year and a half last month,
I actually,

343
00:20:31.351 --> 00:20:35.370
I went to a bakery and I bought her a cupcake and put one and a half candles in

344
00:20:35.371 --> 00:20:39.420
it and sang happy one and a half.
Yeah.
Years old.
Yeah.
God,

345
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.740
she just looking at me like,
when can I eat the seat?

346
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.380
Nice song that I don't know what's going on here and get [inaudible] Lincoln.

347
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:50.140
I have the,
yeah,
this is special for you,
but I really feel like,
uh,

348
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:55.000
it's,
it's just,
it's a celebration.
Life should be a celebration.

349
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.150
You don't eat this stuff all the time.
You don't want to,
you know,
you,

350
00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:02.530
you want to be in shape.
You don't want to get diabetes,
but you should enjoy it.

351
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.140
We'll do an episode.
I'll teach you how to make a pie crust.

352
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:07.690
You teach me how to make bake some bread and there would be great.

353
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.010
We should do it now.
I gotta be honest with you.
Like I,
I just,
uh,

354
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.570
the whole idea of having a comedian who bakes,
you know,

355
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:20.320
it's weird right now I'm just saying,
I'm like,
what a home run for a show.

356
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.350
Oh right.
And then you're going to go check out all these cool bakeries.

357
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:25.580
Like I dunno,
like,
Hey,
I've had diners drive it and the tides,

358
00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.760
it just seems like everybody's always eating like the Burgers,
the Tacos,

359
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.800
the Burrito's,
the pizza.
Yeah.
They've had all of those shows,

360
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:37.450
but I haven't seen a guy big through the bakeries now and like,
you know,

361
00:21:37.451 --> 00:21:39.790
for years.
Yeah.
I've been,
you know,

362
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:44.140
sort of like a gay bashed in a way that I actually know how to bake and make

363
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:48.360
pies and stuff.
And I'm like,
why?
It's awesome.
And Women Love Ya.
I remember,

364
00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.970
do you know how to bake?
Like they love?
Oh completely.
There's a whole,

365
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:55.630
there was a whole article about a women that get turned on by these guys that

366
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:58.730
bake bread.
Remember you.
Absolutely.
It's like,
it's,

367
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.830
it's like having a saint for me cause I'm such an asshole.

368
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:07.090
It takes down a lot of my shit that I do.
You know what I mean?
Fuck.

369
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.260
You know that's the edge off.
Yeah.
Like make a scene.
It's a supermodel.
He yells,

370
00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:13.670
he's cutting people off,
but he makes a hell of a pot.

371
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.110
Even your voice changed and thanks a hell of a fun.

372
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:22.690
Take some of the edge off you.
Uh,
you brought up pie.

373
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.770
Was it last Christmas?
Was it around the holidays?
I can't remember.

374
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.740
Brought me a pie and the center wasn't cooked.

375
00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.400
And you always show you were so bummed out.
I'm gonna tell you why.

376
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.420
Because we will renting a house.
Can I email my shit hole one fixed up?
Yup.

377
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:41.200
And what happened was the door was slightly ajar.

378
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.760
Let the heat out.
No,
I bet you I'm still remember,
send me a picture of it.

379
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.240
I made sure.
Yeah.
Cause I felt so bad.
I made you a,
uh,

380
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.660
pumpkin bread for Halloween and it's the easiest fucking thing.
Yeah.

381
00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.630
It's just a concoction.
You pour it in the thing,

382
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:59.530
you throw in the oven and you're done and you leave it.
Yeah.
And it wasn't done.

383
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.500
So I had to tell you to put it back in.
And you were able to fix it though.

384
00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:06.850
But I was,
I was so embarrassed.
And then the fact that you're like this,

385
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:09.180
you know me is such a good baker,
you're in,

386
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.190
you're in the food section of the Times.

387
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.320
I get a couple of hits on Facebook when I make a pie,
but,
but you know what,

388
00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:20.740
that I remember distinctly like we just ate around the raw part and it was

389
00:23:20.741 --> 00:23:23.350
delicious.
And like that's the cool thing.

390
00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:25.690
Like you don't realize you messed this stuff up.

391
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.760
I'll still screw up reds because it takes,

392
00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:30.640
it's a three day process and if you mess up along the way,

393
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.620
you're gonna get a flat frisbee.

394
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:37.120
But I'm telling you the flat Frisbee is delay still is.
Yeah.

395
00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:41.410
Just cause it doesn't look good.
Just put some butter on it.
You just,
Oh yeah.
God.

396
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.440
What have you been up to as far as,
uh,
you've been traveling the road,

397
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.800
promoting the show,
you've been doing some dates.
What he'd been up to head a uh,

398
00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.230
<v 0>yeah,
it's,
it's not really slowed down.
I have.
Um,</v>

399
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.620
I had five jobs from April until just recently where I was doing my standup,

400
00:24:00.851 --> 00:24:03.790
of course.
And then I had a book come out,

401
00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.980
so I had to tour around with the book.

402
00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.510
I took over the writing for live from here,
which was prairie home companion.

403
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.440
The garrison retired and,
um,

404
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.580
Chris Lee took over as the host and,
uh,

405
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:21.190
I took over the comedy of it and the writing of it.
And,
uh,

406
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.820
I also do a monologue each week on it.
And then,
um,

407
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:29.350
and then I had my podcast when I come to Papa podcast and radio show for Sirius

408
00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:34.690
and uh,
and then baked.
And then when they,
when the red show came,

409
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.520
you know,
as happens in production,
they,

410
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.040
<v 1>they are like,
yeah,
we might make it,
we might make it.
And they're like,</v>

411
00:24:42.041 --> 00:24:43.870
we want eight in a month.

412
00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:49.120
So on top of touring with the radio show and with my standup and the book tour,

413
00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.750
the bread show got thrown on top of it.
So on the bread show,

414
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.160
you're probably thinking of saying,
I can't get to go.

415
00:24:54.161 --> 00:24:56.230
It's a fun little thing that'll do.
It's fine.

416
00:24:56.231 --> 00:24:59.290
We'll do the pilot wrote me a couple of bucks.
This is cool.
We'll do a pilot.

417
00:24:59.291 --> 00:25:01.570
Who knows?
You know,
I wasn't,
I the,

418
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:07.050
the beautiful part of this is I have no show Biz anxiety about this.

419
00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:11.950
I still don't,
I still don't.
I everything else,
you know,

420
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.370
you make stuff,
you sell it,
you try and get it on the air.
You push.
Yeah.

421
00:25:15.371 --> 00:25:18.940
But I also think if you towards a comic and you have your own podcast,

422
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:24.400
you're making enough money that I don't have any showbiz stress where I love

423
00:25:24.401 --> 00:25:27.280
doing my TV show.
Absolutely love doing it.
But like,

424
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:32.140
I'm not like in the unemployment line,
you're right.
If it doesn't go.
Yeah.

425
00:25:32.141 --> 00:25:36.210
If it doesn't go,
what's your help?
It goes by the way anybody's listening.
Yeah.

426
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.510
Yeah.
And just treat drone out there.
Here's not appreciating her,
Cheryl.

427
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.610
Um,
yeah,
but this show I completely,
I'm like,
look,

428
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.390
we can do a show about it.
That'd be great.
I'd love to share it with more people.

429
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.210
That's awesome.
If you don't make a show about it,

430
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.120
I'm still gonna go to the bakery in Cleveland when I get there.

431
00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.090
You know what I mean?
So how much time did she say did you buy?

432
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.030
Did you have to carve out,
spends a schedule to keep doing it?

433
00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:04.900
<v 0>I just threw it on top of everything else.
So while I was doing the book tour,</v>

434
00:26:04.901 --> 00:26:06.760
while I was doing the standup,
but I was doing all this other stuff.

435
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.510
I was doing episodes of this show,
uh,

436
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.070
that are going to start airing.

437
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:17.400
And I literally have not been in my home for a full week since April.

438
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.320
Oh my God.
Yeah.
It was just,
it just all,
it was like a tsunami.
Everything,

439
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.770
a perfect storm.
It all just hit at the same time.
How do you handle that?

440
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.083
I just go,

441
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.040
I just go and having a family is,
uh,

442
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.190
end up,
you know,
I want to be with them.
I literally built,

443
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:40.690
my kids are 16 and 13 now and I was like,
I literally,

444
00:26:40.691 --> 00:26:44.520
before all of this stuff hit the fan.
I literally said to myself,

445
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.500
I'm going to be smarter about how I tour.

446
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.790
These are the only a couple more years here before everybody starts taking off

447
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:55.050
on their own.
I'm going to be around a little bit more.
Yeah.
And boom.

448
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.270
As soon as I said it,
I was gone.
Oh,
okay.

449
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.010
<v 1>And so that's,
that's the industry.</v>

450
00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.890
I know you young people in the industry just say out loud.
You know what?

451
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:04.710
I'm going to move back east.
Just say that now.

452
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.750
The show Biz Unifor universe will let you move back east and it'll get you

453
00:27:09.751 --> 00:27:12.750
something after you've given up your apartment and all that.
Do that.

454
00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:17.070
Just tap into,
was that just happened?
A Dean Del Rey?
Oh yeah.
Dean del Ray's.

455
00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.580
I'm getting all these cs by coastal announced,

He's going to come back.
It's hilarious.
He's actually,

459
00:27:30.631 --> 00:27:33.390
he's on Conan tonight with Mark Marin.
Oh,

460
00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:35.300
I'm going to try to go over there for the,
uh,

461
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.550
<v 0>for the taping.
Yeah.
That'll be fun.
These,
he's such a good guy.
He's got,</v>

462
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.670
and Dean,
uh,
you know,
I haven't watched him that much,
but over the last,
you know,

463
00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.890
several years he just got you just,

464
00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.780
some guys just turn the corner.

465
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.180
They just know exactly what they're starting to do.

466
00:27:52.181 --> 00:27:54.760
Like he got so tuned into his voice.

467
00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:59.410
<v 1>Yeah.
He's just,
he's Dean onstage and offstage.
Yeah.
He's,
he's a killer now.</v>

468
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:00.810
Now he opens from me.
He gets,

469
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:05.400
he gets like sustained rounds of applause when he's done through an,

470
00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:07.300
I had to go on after him and Todd rex,

471
00:28:07.301 --> 00:28:11.020
you have to go on at the Todd rex fucking monster.
Oh really?
Yeah.

472
00:28:11.021 --> 00:28:14.680
And both taught as this thing.
What did people love him?
Yeah.

473
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.540
Like he's one of these,
these like a big kid.
Love them adult's level.
Right.

474
00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:24.010
And he is like,
he's like a legit headliner.
Wow.

475
00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.870
And put both of those guys on before you,
yeah,
I did want it.

476
00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.940
But what's good is all,
but then people come out like a,

477
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.110
and they get to see like a full show rather than some like,
you know,

478
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.000
some cupcake you put on in front of you that's up there.
Hey.
Uh,

479
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.310
I know there's been crazy here.
You will notice with raindrops,

480
00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:46.450
some are bigger than others.
I did a show last night

481
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:51.040
<v 0>in,
uh,
in or the other night in,
um,
a Michigan,</v>

482
00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:55.840
northern Michigan and it was as a performing arts center,
this Nice Theater,

483
00:28:56.410 --> 00:29:00.850
beautiful place up in like,
I've never been that bakery,
nice bakery.

484
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.550
Uh,
no opener.
No,
I just walked out and just did it.

485
00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:10.120
It was kind of lonely,
like hanging out during the day and stuff.
But um,

486
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.690
I have to say it was kind of,
you have to do more time.
You know,

487
00:29:13.691 --> 00:29:17.900
you're doing more like an hour and a half,
but,
uh,
I

488
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.390
<v 1>really liked it.
Yeah,
we'll do that.
Yeah.</v>

489
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:27.190
Well I do like 90 minutes anyway on top of those guys.
Yeah.

490
00:29:27.191 --> 00:29:30.860
But if I have one guy who does like 15,
if I have two guys who both to 10.
Oh,

491
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:34.570
okay.
And I'm trying like,
but you ever just walk out,

492
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.870
you ever just go with nobody?
Yes.

493
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.970
Have I done nobody on the road?
I,
I'm only a times.
Yeah.
Am I,

494
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.460
it becomes a different thing.
It is a different thing.

495
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:49.820
I think it would be weird at a club.
Uh,
yes.
Just because of what the club,

496
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.230
there's so much commotion going on.
Yeah.
And there's so many drinks.

497
00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:53.951
She got to get out.

498
00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:58.240
So much food to get out and all the fuck all that pomp and circumstance has to

499
00:29:58.241 --> 00:30:01.570
happen.
There's a lot going on.
And then when the headliner comes on it's like,

500
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.760
now we have your undivided attention until we drop all the checks.
Yeah.

501
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.360
So there's always commotion going on with the clubs,

502
00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:09.430
but they're like in a theater I think,
um,

503
00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.110
if he comes in evening with rather than yeah.
Show like I saw,

504
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.480
uh,
who did I see?
I saw Billy Connolly.
Uh Huh.

505
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.600
I saw him in New York about 10 years ago and if I remember,
yeah,

506
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.790
cause he did like two hours.
Yeah,
he did two fucking hours.

507
00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:29.650
It was unbelievable.
And like that.
At that point,

508
00:30:29.651 --> 00:30:32.230
that's when guys were kind of like,
if you did like an hour,
it was like,
wow,

509
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:37.750
do you ever want headlining was 45 minutes.
Everybody did 45 45 yeah.

510
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.090
Insane fucking joke.
Same.

511
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:44.740
I feel like now if I don't do like an hour and 20 I'm ripping them off,
you know?

512
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.830
And I know.
Yeah.
It's weird thing.

513
00:30:47.831 --> 00:30:52.780
You know what's weird about it too is that it's kind of like when you do pushups

514
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.450
,
like if you say you're going to do 20 pushups,

515
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.790
18 1920 are really hard.

516
00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:02.970
If you tell yourself you're doing 25 all of a sudden 2124 25 or art like

517
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.990
external about that 80 to 90 to heart 25 is going to see like a fucking zillion

518
00:31:10.511 --> 00:31:14.440
miles away.
But I know we just mean you're shooting yet.
It just your head,

519
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.160
your head does something.
You say,
I'm going to go do an hour and a half tonight.

520
00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.680
Yeah.
That's just the way it is.
If you say you're doing an hour,

521
00:31:20.681 --> 00:31:23.380
all of a sudden you're panting to get to an hour.
Alright.
Hey,

522
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.390
you want to answer some questions here?
If you want to help me out,

523
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:28.180
I give people advice on this,
this podcast.
Yeah,
of course.
You know,

524
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:32.050
if any of this is gonna ruin your bread shelf,
they just let me know.

525
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:37.300
I'll give you the last week I uh,
somebody mentioned that,
you know,
I actually,

526
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.190
my dumb ass I went on like,
I was like,

527
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:42.850
let's see what's going on in the world and know and um,

528
00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:45.970
I don't even know if I want to drag you into this,

529
00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:50.971
but like Trump said that said they're killing white farmers in a,

530
00:31:51.441 --> 00:31:55.150
in South Africa,
which has been happening.
If one,
I never condoned it.

531
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.250
I didn't say it wasn't a big deal.
I would just,

532
00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.930
I was talking about what he pays attention to,
which,
you know,

533
00:32:01.931 --> 00:32:05.440
I don't think if they were Puerto Rican farmers he would give a fuck.

534
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.160
And I am,
call me a reverse racist.

535
00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:14.161
But I am basing that on the fact that when there was regular people and then neo

536
00:32:14.501 --> 00:32:17.110
Nazis involved,
he was sitting there going like,
well,
you know,

537
00:32:17.111 --> 00:32:21.190
you can kind of see both sides of the story.
Yeah.
So anyways,

538
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.730
uh,
so this guy wrote,
he wrote in from Cape Town,

539
00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:28.720
so we've got a bunch of people from Europe.
All right.
Saying,
oh,
but blub,
blub,

540
00:32:28.721 --> 00:32:31.840
blub,
blub,
blub,
blub.
They're just like,
mate.
Then they're not there.
Right.

541
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.440
So we didn't listen to them.
All right,
so this guy is from Cape Town right there.

542
00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:40.010
Uh,
how's it going,
Billy?
Uh,
I'm from,
I'm from Cape Town Africa.
I'm a big

543
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.480
<v 2>fan.
I listen to podcasts every week.
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
Care for a visit.
Yeah,</v>

544
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:45.950
I'd love to.
I'd love to go there.
I'd go there.

545
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.950
I have two topics I want to put out there.
First by country.

546
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:53.300
Got some air time in the news last week due to a tweet by the Donald Guy.
Now,

547
00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:55.580
just to recap,
I don't know what this guy's tone is,

548
00:32:55.581 --> 00:32:57.140
but I've read some of the other ones that are all like,

549
00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:01.070
why didn't you fucking read about it with Ilp?
Your mouth.
All right.

550
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:02.211
Now just to recap,

551
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:07.211
he basically mentioned investigating far murders in land expropriation without

552
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:11.960
payment in South Africa based on race.
Why are we getting involved in this?
Yeah,

553
00:33:11.961 --> 00:33:13.680
I know.
Why are we getting involved anyways?
Yeah,

554
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.660
I bet one of the farmers was going to sell him land to build a golf course.

555
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.770
We have to stop it.
All right.
News outlets like BBC,
CNN,
etc.

556
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.680
Were quick to point out that these claims were baseless.

557
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.580
And then if you look at the crime statute,

558
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.400
actually see a decline in the farm based attacks.
Though I don't live,

559
00:33:29.401 --> 00:33:34.250
I don't watch.
He got into it because a Tucker Carlson did a thing on it.
Oh I,

560
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.650
you know what I should cause I don't watch the news.
Yeah.

561
00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.200
Cause all it does is give me eggs.
It's just,
it's a half hour.

562
00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:42.950
Bangs it with no solution.
Then all this shit that I wasn't worried about,

563
00:33:42.951 --> 00:33:45.590
I now have to add to this shit I already was worried about.

564
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.710
So why would I do that to myself?
And you're powerless to do anything.
All right.

565
00:33:48.711 --> 00:33:49.790
Just to set the record straight,

566
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:53.720
I can tell you that if you search deeper and speak to the average South African,

567
00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:54.950
they would tell you a different story.

568
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.340
Being a farmer or a farmer worker is by far the most dangerous job you can have

569
00:33:58.341 --> 00:34:01.820
around here due to the number of attacks and the cold bludder blooded barbaric

570
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:04.550
nature of these attacks.
Uh,

571
00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:07.860
there is no doubt that the number of attacks has grown in number and in

572
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.260
brutality in recent years.

573
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:12.080
Yet these attacks are not widely reported in the accuracy.

574
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:16.760
The statistics on the farmers have been appointed dispute ever since the end of

575
00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:19.370
apartheid.
Anyone you talk to?
Uh,
yeah.

576
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:24.460
The whole fucking thing is there was brutal attacks to get the land and then a

577
00:34:24.981 --> 00:34:29.600
brutal form of government and now there's a brutal reaction to it is my limited

578
00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:32.480
understanding to it.
And I'm not saying any of that was right.

579
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.800
I was just saying it's interesting what,
oh,

580
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.280
the orange headed lunatic decides to pay attention to.
Right,
exactly.

581
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.560
He's all I'm saying,
I mean this is,

582
00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.690
and I've even said the last election was 2:00 AM at a bar.

583
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.160
You had to go home with somebody you didn't want to leave with either one,

584
00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.330
but you had to leave with somebody.
So I am not,

585
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.410
I am not picking a side politically arrange shit.
Anyways.

586
00:34:54.411 --> 00:34:57.380
Anyone you've talked to can tell,
tell you have multiple,

587
00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.700
multiple of their close friends or relatives who have been attacked,
uh,

588
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.400
had been affected by an attack regardless of rate race.

589
00:35:04.401 --> 00:35:09.080
Yet this is not helped by the fact that many political rallies or met with

590
00:35:09.081 --> 00:35:12.680
chance of kill the Bora,
the farmer kill the farmer.

591
00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.700
These political parties are basically garnering support on the false promise of

592
00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:19.550
land and wealth to everyone.
Yay.
Communism.

593
00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:23.240
What do you mean gay communism that happened in our country?
Yeah.
Yeah.

594
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.940
We got to rebel against these English guys and then all the rich Fox,

595
00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:29.030
once we kicked him out and moved into the rich guys houses,
right.

596
00:35:29.031 --> 00:35:33.650
And continues to taxes.
This is,
I love when they blamed forms of government.

597
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:35.840
Yeah.
Is there a form of government that works?

598
00:35:35.841 --> 00:35:38.100
I don't think there is because every cause you get

599
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.760
<v 1>at the end,</v>

600
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.260
you have human beings with unchecked power on some level at the top and it just,

601
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.460
that's right.
So we are,

602
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:48.360
some people taste the good life and they don't want to give it back.
No,
no.

603
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.340
That's what's going on in Nicaragua right now.

604
00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:52.200
What's going on about someone else's problems?

605
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:56.490
It's basically the students are rioting and trying to take the government back

606
00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.450
and the guy who they're trying to take the government back took the government

607
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.880
for the people when he was a student,

608
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.100
but then he got fat and happy and now he's like the dictator who doesn't want to

609
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:11.070
let it go.
Yeah.
Whenever.
Whenever you taste the good life,

610
00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:15.750
nobody wants to let it go.
Now you get the extra food,
you get the best booze,

611
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:20.900
the best women.
Oh my God.
All of that.
And it's just big nice silk robe.
Yeah.

612
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.630
People are cooking your meals.
He's sitting in the hot tub.
Yeah.

613
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.220
You going to get out of that thing to go help somebody less fortunate than you?

614
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.530
No,
that's not how people are wired.
No.

615
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:37.270
They put up gates around their home and they say,
I'm going to keep this.
This is,

616
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.830
I'll read,
I'll read more about this stuff.
I,
I'll,

617
00:36:39.831 --> 00:36:42.840
I'll definitely look up and I know,
but why,

618
00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:47.160
but back to your thing about the orange guy pointing this out and bringing us

619
00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:50.910
into like,
I understand that's a big problem when you read about it,
it's like,

620
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:55.190
Ooh boy,
this is a mess.
Don't we have her own messes?
Like the aren't,
aren't,

621
00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:59.070
aren't like why do I have to jump into this one?
I mean there's stuff like that.

622
00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:03.930
No human being to human being yet you're supposed to care.
You do care,

623
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.590
but I can't,

624
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:09.150
how much time you know you could care about everything we get into the Nicaragua

625
00:37:09.151 --> 00:37:11.460
thing is a huge thing.
I mean it's,
I don't even know what's going on there.

626
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:16.290
All I know is this country is fucking bankrupt and because we're fighting a war

627
00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:21.291
that has no set ending and you're not allowed to ask about it.

628
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.940
And I don't want to bring this shit up.
Boy,
you got a fucking show coming out.
Um,

629
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.670
it's just one of those things where it's just like,

630
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.960
I don't understand why if I ask like,
hey,

631
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:33.570
how are we going to pay for this?
Hey,
when are we coming back?

632
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.930
All of a sudden I don't support the troops.
I'm not American.

633
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:42.140
And I just became like,
I just got my,
I'm,
I'm part of Isis now.
Yeah.

634
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:45.060
I can do that with us talking about it.
I love the Patriots.

635
00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:47.280
I can sit there and be like,
what the fuck are we doing?

636
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:49.080
Why did we draft that guy?
People just go,

637
00:37:49.081 --> 00:37:54.030
don't go like you're not a patriot fed you like the jets.
You're a piece of shit.

638
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:58.590
So it's a very weird,
it's a weird time that you yeah,

639
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.040
because there's a bunch of people are afraid to say stuff that everybody kind of

640
00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:03.510
agrees with.
Yeah.

641
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.740
But don't you think also that there's a lot of real like reasonable people that

642
00:38:07.741 --> 00:38:10.350
are thinking the same thing you are on whatever issue,

643
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.100
thinking the same thing and when you do bring it up they agree.

644
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:16.500
And quietly go about their day.
Like normal people,

645
00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:19.980
they come up after the show after they didn't laugh and say,
yeah,
I,

646
00:38:19.981 --> 00:38:23.100
you're 100% right on the Bobo.
I totally agree with this.

647
00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:25.890
Or I a dad just like that or whatever the fuck that you were talking about that

648
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:28.530
made the crowd required.
It's uh,
I,
I,
you know what it really is.

649
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.980
I can't believe how many people are afraid to get in trouble.
Yeah.

650
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:36.520
Like basically get yelled at on Twitter.
Right?
By who?

651
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:41.080
By who?
Yeah.
Just the loudest,
loudest one.
Right.
It's just,

652
00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.370
that's what I'm saying.

653
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:46.570
There's so many more people that aren't tweeting hateful stuffed at you.

654
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.510
I think most of it has to do with a corporation.

655
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:54.540
God forbid if one extra nickel that they could have made rolled out the fucking

656
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:58.150
door,
that's the only time they do the customer is always right,

657
00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:01.450
is with that shit.
Right.
Everything else you can go fuck yourself.

658
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:04.960
You can go to the website and stare at the screen and try and figure it out

659
00:39:04.961 --> 00:39:07.990
yourself and maybe you'll get a portion of a refund or something.

660
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.440
I don't want to get all gloom and doom here with this stuff.
So let's,

661
00:39:11.441 --> 00:39:13.630
let's talk sports,
man.
Um,

662
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:18.610
I was really watching the red sox and,
uh,
then I just a duty,

663
00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:21.790
I have to tell you what,
like this is the regular season man.
I know,

664
00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:26.520
but it has been such a,
I'm a Yankee Fan.
Right.
And it has been,

665
00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:30.760
by the way,
congratulations.
It's been,
must have been a fun ride your whole life.

666
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.990
It wasn't when I was a kid.
Well,
I had a little Greg nettles,

667
00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:38.980
Reggie Jackson when I was really little and then I had to go the whole eighties

668
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:41.280
without his world series.
It was,

669
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.950
do you realize if you guys don't win it this year or next year,

670
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.110
that is the only second time.
You haven't won a world series during a a decade.

671
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:55.120
Yeah.
The level of success that,
that is fucking ridiculous.

672
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:57.430
Not to mention,
I think two decades.

673
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:02.140
You want at least half of them in the forties and 50s.
Well.
Yeah,

674
00:40:02.141 --> 00:40:03.320
but I mean I can't,
I,

675
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.910
who knows what was going on back then and there was a Bobby socks and Frank

676
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.310
Sinatra one during my time.
Right.

677
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.690
We went through horrible periods when they were like trying to buy people and we

678
00:40:13.691 --> 00:40:18.250
never [inaudible] was always messed up.
But the Jeter years,
homegrown kids,

679
00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.410
Great Ronnie,
because you guy got,

680
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:23.590
guy got kicked out of baseball and he would've got rid of half of them.

681
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:26.470
I don't think cheater and I don't think he would have known what are you would

682
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.540
Mariano Rivera was going to be because nobody did.

683
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.310
Cause you guys had them pitch in like no,
but it'll relief.
I'll,

684
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:34.390
oh Neil would have been gone.
Bernie Williams would have been gone.
Well O'neil,

685
00:40:34.391 --> 00:40:36.760
you got from the reds eat the,
they wouldn't,

686
00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:40.380
they would not have hung onto these people.
He was,
but it was homegrown.
It was,

687
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:42.610
it was pure.
I have a guilt.

688
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:47.230
I have guilt as a Yankee fan when you buy in,
you know,

689
00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:50.560
you've got Johnny Damon and all of a sudden any of the outfield.

690
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.880
I don't like that money part of it all.
We did,

691
00:40:53.881 --> 00:40:56.430
we went right over the cliff with you.
We're like,
all right,

692
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.520
well they're in our division.

693
00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.580
This is how you play and now you guys are doing it the right way.

694
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.520
We're doing it the right way and it's not a great season.
I Love Baseball,

695
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.940
my favorite sport and I'm enjoying the hell out of us.

696
00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.570
Young guys scraping,
enjoying it.

697
00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:16.080
The second best record in all of baseball and we can't get close to the red sox.

698
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.890
I want to.
This is what's great though.

699
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:26.190
What is so great is the greed of baseball where now they have to have 9 million

700
00:41:26.201 --> 00:41:30.040
rounds.
Like back in the day.
If we slept,
swept you in August.
Yeah,

701
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.240
that would've been a big thing.

702
00:41:31.241 --> 00:41:33.290
But back in the day I was sort of been as a red sox fan.
Like okay,

703
00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:35.270
how are they going to fuck it up this time?
Cause they always did.

704
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:39.740
But that would immense something.
Yes.
That didn't really mean anything because,

705
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.540
because it doesn't mean anything.
Yeah,

706
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:43.710
because you guys are going to get the wild card.

707
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:49.180
We'll get one game play off against a Oakland or something and we'll lose them.

708
00:41:49.231 --> 00:41:53.690
Be Out in one game of,
Oh,
why aren't you know,
I don't like the one.

709
00:41:53.691 --> 00:41:58.000
What's the one game thing?
Well,
you have the one game,
the one game playoff.
Oh,

710
00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.860
so they added that and then there's the three game and then the forest and then

711
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:05.840
the for the right.
But guys doing up there white to never,

712
00:42:05.841 --> 00:42:10.100
you never lose.
You never lose.
How many wins do they have?
Uh,

713
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:14.480
last I checked the same way with like 91 and 41 or,
yeah,
we just got lucky in 41,

714
00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:18.080
three.
So,
but no,
we were,
uh,
tonight.
I didn't,
I didn't,
I didn't,
well,

715
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.080
I'm taping this Sunday night too,
so don't confuse or you guys as good.

716
00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:25.550
Are you guys as good as a,
as this record?
Sure.
No,
no.

717
00:42:25.551 --> 00:42:26.420
Nobody ever is.

718
00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.750
Your regular season record is never as good as you are because you're,

719
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:32.480
you're rolling up all these stats on people who aren't going to be there in

720
00:42:32.481 --> 00:42:35.420
October.
So what you have to do is you've got to look at like we just played,

721
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:37.280
we just played uh,

722
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.390
the Indians who I think Terry Francona is still the best manager in baseball.

723
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:42.650
Everybody sleeping on them.

724
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.720
Nobody gets more out of their place in this fucking guy.

725
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:46.730
And we played a four game series,

726
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:50.810
we split it the first two games he made us look like a five on a ball club and

727
00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:55.460
then our big free agent guys,
you know,
sale and price came in,
shut up,
down.
Right.

728
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.190
Okay.
Now here's the thing,

729
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.560
you fucking like Houston,
they got four landed to get all those guys did it.

730
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:06.480
Offending world series champion.
Nobody's talking about it.
They're so good.

731
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.050
Exactly.
And they probably had a couple of injuries and whatever,

732
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:13.250
blah blah blah blah blah.
All I know is come October were all zero and zero.

733
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.430
I think clearly there might pick to,
to take it again.

734
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:21.460
And what ESPN does about regulus seasons is what the news does about like Isis

735
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:28.010
where in my head isis was powerful enough to come over here,

736
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.570
attack this country and overthrow it.
Right.
Until I actually sat down,
I was like,

737
00:43:32.571 --> 00:43:35.790
they don't have a plane or a boat or uniforms.
Right.

738
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:41.180
This is not Germany and Japan again.
Okay.
So,
uh,
it's fucking,

739
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:44.360
um,
they do the same thing with,

740
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:49.450
they basically said the race was over when we swept you guys four games in a

741
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:53.690
fucking wrong knowing.
Do we have like 12 games left?
Yeah.

742
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:57.170
Injuries happen to try and get to the one on the 18th or nine.

743
00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:00.980
[inaudible] so I've,
I've Dude,
I've done this too many times.

744
00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:05.060
He is a sports fan to know to try to put my feet up in August.

745
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.350
I eman say anything's over.
I watched his blow a 12 game lead.

746
00:44:09.351 --> 00:44:13.010
Like I dunno how many years ago,
four,
five years ago.
I watched this blow,

747
00:44:13.011 --> 00:44:16.630
that classic 18 game lead and 78.
Yeah,
I've,

748
00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.810
I've seen the tuck rule.
I've seen the,
the fucking,
uh,

749
00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:23.810
I've seen it all during this fat and roughing the passer.

750
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.960
There's still that insecure.
I've been beaten by my,

751
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:30.830
I've seen Paul's role through guy's legs is so great.

752
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:36.060
I was at dinner with my brother in law and his wife the other night and a red

753
00:44:36.061 --> 00:44:40.230
sox fans and there's,
they would literally,
when we were talking,

754
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.660
we were still nine and a half up,
but yeah,

755
00:44:42.661 --> 00:44:45.540
it was the Cleveland and they've lost the first game of Cleveland and the

756
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:49.830
Yankees won that night and we got a half game up and I was like,
here it comes.

757
00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.640
Here comes the slide here.
This is the beginning of it again.

758
00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:57.480
And I was just talking out of my ass because they're,
they're so solid.

759
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:01.890
But the fear in my brother in law's eyes like,
Oh man,
it really is.

760
00:45:01.891 --> 00:45:05.090
This is the beginning of,
because he's gone through it,
like passing.

761
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.370
You get millennials.
They'd be like,
yeah,
fuck you.
We got this Yankee stuck.

762
00:45:08.371 --> 00:45:11.160
They don't even,
they don't know.
No,
they don't.
Oh No.

763
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:14.880
I went to Fenway for the first time this year in the beginning of the season.

764
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:18.840
Horrible,
rainy night.
But,
uh,
that was my first time there.

765
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:22.350
I've watched so many games at Fenway on TV.

766
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.940
It was so surreal.
I felt like I had been there before.
Oh yeah.

767
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.540
When you're sitting in the thing,

768
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.550
like when you're walking through and trying to get food.

769
00:45:29.551 --> 00:45:32.640
And so when I go back now,
it's not the ballpark I went to as a kid.

770
00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.160
I mean they got like a mall in the right field and got people sitting up on the

771
00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:38.490
green monster.
Right is so different from when I left the Green Moss,

772
00:45:38.491 --> 00:45:40.470
which it didn't have any advertising,
anything.

773
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.460
I think it looks way better with the advertising and it's really in Ted Williams

774
00:45:44.461 --> 00:45:47.340
days or pre Ted Williams,
dom dimaggio days or something.

775
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.180
I believe they had advertising there.
So it's gone through like a bunch of stuff.

776
00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:53.610
But uh,
dude,
I was just thinking all this shit that I've seen,

777
00:45:53.611 --> 00:45:57.000
I've seen the Celtics and a game seven with the Lakers scene.

778
00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:01.050
The rest call thirtysomething files on them and like 15 on the Lakers in a game

779
00:46:01.051 --> 00:46:04.580
seven.
I literally watched the Lakers beat us from the foul line and they,

780
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.990
and they,
these weren't,
we wasn't we out there hacking people.

781
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:11.280
It was so fucking anticlimactic of brutal.

782
00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:15.930
I've seen too many men on the ice.
I,
I've,
I,

783
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:19.170
I've too many.
Like,
I don't give a fuck how many games are up until,

784
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:23.790
but they also had taken out of your ball and you had the little snow plow to

785
00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:27.090
give a thing for the guy who's shaken.
The every team has had those things.
All,

786
00:46:27.091 --> 00:46:31.440
all of that shit.
Yeah,
that that too.
I have to tell you that deflate gate

787
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.110
is up there with any like as far as like the music man,

788
00:46:37.111 --> 00:46:41.250
you could redo the music man with deflate gate.
They like to study.

789
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:46.280
Literally found that like the cults also had like three balls that were slightly

790
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.370
under inflated.

791
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.990
Espn did a study that showed that the ball actually got there a little bit
later.

792
00:46:51.991 --> 00:46:53.700
So be an advantage to the defense defense.

793
00:46:53.701 --> 00:46:57.540
So of course they pulled that immediately and a bunch of pats fans had recorded

794
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.190
at goal but they don't want you to know.
Right.
So why so why,
what?

795
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:05.430
Looking back now I feel like,
was it they don't do,

796
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.830
they did something they fucking,

797
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:12.600
cause we were in with with good Dell and then something happened and then we

798
00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:15.590
would just fucking out.
I think part of it was I,

799
00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:19.630
well I think part of it was when they under suspended ray rice,
uh,

800
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.690
and they were just like,
yeah,

801
00:47:21.691 --> 00:47:24.720
a couple of games and then they tried to say that they didn't see it.

802
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.260
Then you found out they sought and then Goodell,
he's making like 35,

803
00:47:28.261 --> 00:47:30.880
36 million a year.
Um,

804
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:34.690
then I think he just started over suspending everybody.

805
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.860
And do you think it's like if we go after the golden boy that'll kind of take

806
00:47:38.861 --> 00:47:43.060
the heat off of the whole league?
No.
What I think what ended up happening,

807
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:44.830
I think we in the combination was that,

808
00:47:44.831 --> 00:47:47.320
and then we had some sort of falling out with the guy and then we took them to

809
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:51.010
court in a court of law.
I mean the,
it got laughed out of court.

810
00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.840
That judge actually yelled at the NFL for wasting their time.

811
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:57.730
Really?
So a lot of people forget that.

812
00:47:57.731 --> 00:48:01.480
So then he played the next year not suspended.
So then what,

813
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.280
you know now you can't have double jeopardy.

814
00:48:03.281 --> 00:48:04.630
You can't get tried for the same thing.

815
00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:09.340
So the NFL went back and changed their argument and said,
and said,

816
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:13.270
is the NFL a corporation?
And they said yes.
And they says,

817
00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:17.950
does a corporation have a right to suspend an employee?

818
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:23.470
And they,
and they,
if they feel fit.
And they said yes.
And they said,
well,

819
00:48:23.471 --> 00:48:28.150
Tom Brady is an employee of our corporation and he is,
he is suspended.

820
00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.000
And they couldn't mess with that.
So that's what we got.
That's easiest.

821
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:38.010
So he sat down for four games because if Tom Brady and the Patriots took the NFL

822
00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:42.010
to court and won and reversed it,

823
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:45.640
that was going to open the floodgates every time helmet to helmet head and

824
00:48:45.641 --> 00:48:49.270
suspension,
all this could potentially,
you know,
our corporation thinks like,

825
00:48:49.271 --> 00:48:49.990
oh my God,

826
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:53.770
the amount of money in legal costs we'll have then not flooding the nut house.

827
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.680
They had to fucking suspend them.
Right.

828
00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:01.110
So that is my totally bias patriots.
Yeah.
You know,

829
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:05.170
as far as like we take an air out of the ball,
we tried to steal signs.
Yes.

830
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:09.760
As is everybody else.
Which is why when you watch a college football game,

831
00:49:09.761 --> 00:49:12.280
my favorite thing ever when you watched them,
when they send in to signals,

832
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:16.390
there's like four guys doing it right?
Somebody holding up a picture of Urkel.

833
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:20.230
But guys,
you know fucking pop lockin you know,

834
00:49:20.231 --> 00:49:23.860
and I also love to like that whole idea that if you film somebody,

835
00:49:23.861 --> 00:49:24.850
you know what they're doing,

836
00:49:24.851 --> 00:49:28.690
like they're miming throwing the ball or handing it off for punting it.

837
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.700
You still have to figure it out.

838
00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:35.760
And as much as we were guilty with the of of the spy gate thing,

839
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:39.190
I mean if you're going to sit there and say,
oh yeah,
first of all,

840
00:49:39.191 --> 00:49:40.210
everyone else's pure,

841
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:43.480
well the thing about that is is that was the first game that that was illegal to

842
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:46.870
do that.
What do you mean those are not well that that was legal.

843
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.960
You are allowed to,
Jimmy Johnson even said,
he goes,
I came in the league,

844
00:49:49.961 --> 00:49:50.890
they say,
okay,
what do I do?

845
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.040
He you to get a camera pointed at their guy looking at halftime,

846
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:57.610
whatever you can steal,
steal.
Oh really?

847
00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.140
So I think it just looked bad after awhile.

848
00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.730
So the rule was to just that you couldn't have a guy on the field.

849
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:07.660
You can still have a guy up in the booth.
There's something called a Zoom Lens.

850
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:13.240
It's still doing it.
Yeah.
Everybody is still fucking doing it.
So it's funny.
Yeah.

851
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:14.290
So if you're going to spend any money,

852
00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:18.760
you're going to say steal in science than we should have to forfeit World War
II.

853
00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:24.880
You have a college team that you like or you're like,
yes,
yes.

854
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:28.640
I have a bunch that I like,
but Lsu is my adopted one.
That's your adopted,

855
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:33.610
I just loved the a sec.
Uh,
this was 10 years ago,
about 2008 I was after on.

856
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:38.620
Nick Saban was there and I was into a les miles and you know,

857
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:41.480
he would keep it just to that ship,
you know,
it was almost like he was,

858
00:50:41.481 --> 00:50:46.310
his offensive mind was where the people in the upper deck was where they like go

859
00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:50.360
forth
and he would just do it.
Yeah.

860
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:53.180
And it worked for a little while.
The LSU,
they're big.

861
00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:56.930
They're big thing is they've never,
they,
and since I've been watching them,

862
00:50:56.931 --> 00:51:01.640
they haven't had a quarterback that they've believed in enough to let him play

863
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:02.451
the full game.

864
00:51:02.451 --> 00:51:07.451
And they are literally playing a lot of times the stereotypical like old school

865
00:51:07.861 --> 00:51:10.580
stereotypical white quarterback,

866
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:13.700
a black quarterback thing where it's like it's a passing down.

867
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:17.070
Get the white guy in there.
Right.
So running the,

868
00:51:17.071 --> 00:51:18.560
we could maybe run the option here,

869
00:51:18.561 --> 00:51:22.910
get the black guy in there and it's just like,
dude,
that's hilarious.

870
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:27.200
Pick one.
Go and let them get into the,
the,
the,

871
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:32.000
the feel of the game as it,
it'd be like,
Hey Tom,
I never liked hosting.

872
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.520
Yeah.
Cause it's like you get,

873
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.870
I'm going to get him gone and then you've got to bring somebody up at such an

874
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.030
art and then you sit down,
you fucking,
you know,

875
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.220
thinking about your day the next day and it's like,
Oh fuck,

876
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:42.890
I've got to run back and do another five minutes.
Yeah.
Um,

877
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.200
my favorite thing and hosting was we're going to,
yeah,

878
00:51:45.201 --> 00:51:47.740
we're going to keep the show moving right along and bring the next guy up.

879
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:52.370
That was my favorite thing.
Posting.
I'm not going to do any time in between.

880
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.413
Are we going to keep this?

881
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:57.000
I'm just murders or is it going to keep the show going?
Yeah,
I kind of,

882
00:51:57.001 --> 00:52:00.650
I really like,
uh,
have the comedy store doesn't have a host.

883
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:04.730
I really like,
yeah,
how they,
they just bring everybody up.

884
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.470
You just bring each other on.
I didn't,
I didn't think I was gonna like that.
It's,

885
00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:13.100
it's pretty awesome.
Oh,
you want to talk about a place that just turned around?

886
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.360
I don't know if you ever,

887
00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.420
I was living out here in the late nineties and when you went down to the comedy

888
00:52:17.421 --> 00:52:20.930
store,
I mean also no one knew who I was.
I was struggling to get spots,

889
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:25.610
but that place,
first of all,
there was nobody there.
No Spooky.
Yeah.

890
00:52:25.611 --> 00:52:30.590
And it was like,
oh,
to the vibe.
I was like,
it was like,

891
00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.910
I was like a fucking haunted house.

892
00:52:31.911 --> 00:52:34.250
Like you went in there and there was all of these guys,

893
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.660
these guys that were on TV and they were big names and they would come in and

894
00:52:38.661 --> 00:52:42.410
just burn the light.
They would just stand there.
Yeah,

895
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.940
having not done the work now,
didn't write anything new.

896
00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:48.560
We're just standing there leaning against the Mike Stang.
Yeah.

897
00:52:48.561 --> 00:52:50.990
So what else is going on but blah,
blah blah,
blah,
blah.

898
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.740
And you're sitting back there,
you know your spots pushed back.
Five minutes,

899
00:52:54.741 --> 00:52:57.890
10 minutes,
40 minutes,
an hour and a half,
two hours.
I'm going home.

900
00:52:57.891 --> 00:53:01.790
I can't go home if I go home.
They don't know me.
So I,
I you just have to,

901
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:04.520
would have to fucking stay there group.
And um,

902
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:08.540
and all these young kids were learning.
Some day when I get on his shelf,

903
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.450
I'm going to do that.
And I,
and I remember

904
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:18.010
being here in [inaudible] 98 it was right as Seinfeld was wrapping up and Jerry,

905
00:53:19.461 --> 00:53:21.470
the first time ever,
all these years I had been out there,

906
00:53:21.471 --> 00:53:26.040
he popped in at the Improv and I was like,
Holy Shit.
Right.
It's the king.
Right.

907
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:31.410
And he went on stage,
was supposed to do 15 minutes.
He did 15 minutes,
right.

908
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.690
He started with the killer job.
He ended with a great job.

909
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:38.010
Even better joking in the middle.
He tried out as new stuff and I just,

910
00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:42.390
I just clicked.
I was like,
that's the way you do it.
That's a fucking pro.
Right.

911
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:46.180
And that other shit is just ego and oh that's all it is.

912
00:53:46.181 --> 00:53:50.160
I got a show going and oh yeah,
yeah,
no that place was spooked.

913
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.640
I remember going there,
the store back then and there was like,

914
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:57.930
this is not going to be a help me.
Like this isn't going to make me depressed.

915
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.980
It was,
it was,
there was fucking hostile.
It was really was.
It was hostile.

916
00:54:01.981 --> 00:54:06.360
And I remember,
uh,
there was a couple rays of light over there,
rogue.

917
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:10.200
And I remember meeting Rogan for the first time at the laugh factory and I

918
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:13.890
rolled over yet.
Of course he had this fucking Badass,
cool car,
Korean words.

919
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.870
That's really what I remember about those days.

920
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:20.280
It was just watching Joe come in a really cool car.
Like wow,

921
00:54:20.281 --> 00:54:24.120
that guy's really got it going on.
Yeah,
he did some sick ass tail fin.

922
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:27.180
There was some sort of Japanese sports car,
I can't remember.

923
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:32.570
So some turbo powered something and we went over there and this and he basically

924
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:37.900
gave me like a pep talk.
Oh yeah.
On the mindset you hit,

925
00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:38.880
but it wasn't split,

926
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:44.190
wasn't specifically pointed at the comedy store and it was just the La comedy

927
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:47.070
scene.
Right,
right.
Like how you had to be,

928
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:52.230
don't fucking listen to anybody,
get in there,
do your job and just like,

929
00:54:52.231 --> 00:54:52.981
it was like a real,

930
00:54:52.981 --> 00:54:57.981
like it was like an eight point powered Joe Rogan PowerPoint thing that's great

931
00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:02.760
on the mindset and that like,
and he was like,
he was young.
Yeah.
Joe.

932
00:55:02.761 --> 00:55:04.950
So he was like,
it was like,

933
00:55:04.951 --> 00:55:07.610
is this Guy gonna like help me a fucking rip my head off.

934
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:12.260
Like he was like the most amped up dude I'd ever fucking been around.
Uh,

935
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:16.080
and uh,
fortunately he turned out to be like just a sweetheart of a guy.
Yeah.

936
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:19.710
And really the kind of the heart of what turned that place around.

937
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:23.010
Like he will do him calling out fucking Mitsui and all that.
Like,
dude,

938
00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:24.630
I always like it was,
it was fucking ridiculous.

939
00:55:24.631 --> 00:55:28.470
I was like coming in there with a big can of raid and just bring it all across

940
00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:33.480
the whole comedy store.
It was unbelievable because like the terror that you had,

941
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:37.650
yeah.
You believe,
Hey,
he pulled in,
he pulled in the thing and you're like,
fuck,

942
00:55:37.651 --> 00:55:41.340
I'm going on next.
And all the work you wanted to do you could not do.

943
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:45.000
You could not fucking do.
I mean I want to start that shit up again,

944
00:55:45.001 --> 00:55:48.480
but like it's amazing now.
I mean when you walk in there now,
it just,

945
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:53.010
just the original route just to go and have a place to really work.

946
00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.500
Like you really are going to get work done.
Yeah.

947
00:55:55.501 --> 00:55:58.470
And what's funny is looking at Rogen,
look how big Rogan is and what does he do?

948
00:55:58.471 --> 00:56:01.110
He does it like Seinfeld you 15 he goes up,

949
00:56:01.111 --> 00:56:04.920
he does 15 tries out the shit he wants to try out.
He kills,
you know,

950
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:06.360
work on your stuff and go.

951
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:11.540
But it's amazing though that usually wants to place or a scene goes bad like

952
00:56:12.301 --> 00:56:15.750
that.
It's very rare that it comes.
Yeah.

953
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:20.100
It's like a movie in a movie that happens.
I know,
but triumphs over evil.

954
00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.330
Yeah.

955
00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:25.870
But similar to what you were saying about seller being like that special room

956
00:56:25.871 --> 00:56:27.390
and something just happens there.

957
00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:32.510
Places have something to them.
Yeah.

958
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:35.140
The laugh factory is always going to be the laugh factory.

959
00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.520
The sellers always going to be the seller.
You know what I mean?
Like,
you know,

960
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.230
it was unreal,
man.
You may dip and have bad times,

961
00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:44.260
but that room is begging to be good again.
Yeah.

962
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.160
You don't really know what the one that I remember way back in the day,
uh,

963
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:48.730
in the 90s we were coming up,

964
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:53.470
if you on the nine o'clock show Saturday night at the comic Strip,
Oh my God.

965
00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:54.740
I made it with,

966
00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:58.570
so it was like you'd come off and think you are the greatest comedian of all

967
00:56:58.571 --> 00:57:01.570
time.
Yeah.
I'm ready to do Letterman.
Yeah.
That room,

968
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:06.850
the energy of that square room,
that centered stage.
Yeah.

969
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:10.960
It was unreal.
Yeah.
On that one and that route.

970
00:57:10.961 --> 00:57:11.960
And that's a club that's,

971
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:16.270
that's gone in the toilet and it's just waiting to come back.

972
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:17.500
You put the right person,

973
00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:21.880
booking it and start attracting the good guys back again cause that room,

974
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:26.380
the architecture,
the energy when up when human beings are in it,

975
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:29.200
it's waiting to be great.
I was still in New York,

976
00:57:29.201 --> 00:57:32.470
I would still go there even if it's going through a bad period.

977
00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:36.100
It's just like just to keep it going.
Yeah.
Then you got to use,

978
00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:39.400
we use whatever juice you have to key cause of.
How does that help comics?

979
00:57:39.401 --> 00:57:42.160
If there's one less room,
forget about a room like that,
which you do that.

980
00:57:42.161 --> 00:57:46.830
That room was fucking crazy.
Crazy,
crazy.
Do you remember when uh,

981
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:51.040
over the,
where the names,
the team red Johnny and the Round Guy.

982
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:54.640
Oh God.
When they would go up at the comic strip,

983
00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:00.100
I mean I had to follow him at the fucking Boston Comedy Club.
Nothing was bigger.

984
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:05.190
Nothing was bigger that they would just rip the roof off that place.

985
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:08.580
I mean to,
what do we,
we don't like when they,

986
00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:12.160
when they used to be down to the fucking Boston comedy club and they,

987
00:58:12.161 --> 00:58:15.420
and they would do the fucking the,
that it takes to,

988
00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:19.700
well it takes two to make a thing go right.
And one of them is gone.

989
00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.480
And then remember Matt Frost,
who's now at CIA,

990
00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:25.610
he would be flicking the lights fucking on and off.

991
00:58:25.611 --> 00:58:29.750
Like it was a nightclub and the place would be going nuts.

992
00:58:29.751 --> 00:58:32.780
They were some show,
it was some joke that they did yeah.

993
00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:36.050
About going to a dance club and feel like an asshole.

994
00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:40.820
And they just like when they went into that bit,
uh,
it was like,

995
00:58:40.821 --> 00:58:43.790
you are at a fuck.
It's like you started watching a movie.
Yeah.

996
00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:47.360
And you'd be shocked.
I remember just standing there going like,
I have nothing,

997
00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.920
nothing,
nothing in my arsenal in my whole career.
Never.

998
00:58:51.921 --> 00:58:53.600
You could take all of it and slam it together.

999
00:58:53.601 --> 00:58:56.900
I have nothing that could follow that.
And Oh my God.

1000
00:58:56.901 --> 00:59:01.901
And going up in that fucking room after those guys and bombing was the loneliest

1001
00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.010
fucking thing.
Like,
I mean I,

1002
00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:09.520
if I ever saw comics start crying and that I wouldn't even judge them.

1003
00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:14.350
And now that was back to when the club where all the comics sat in the back.

1004
00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.420
But you had to walk to the front of the stage and go up in the middle before

1005
00:59:17.421 --> 00:59:20.810
they had that side.
Yes.
And they would just be back there.
And I remember I was,

1006
00:59:20.811 --> 00:59:24.340
this kid came down from Boston,
nobody gave a fuck.
Yeah.

1007
00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:27.820
I remember running into Todd Barry Cohen like going like,
ah,

1008
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:31.130
how do I get any like asking you that fucking question where there is no answer.

1009
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:35.090
How do I get in at the clubs?
He's like,
yeah,
I dunno man.

1010
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:39.763
<v 3>Just keep doing it.</v>

1011
00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:43.260
<v 1>Yeah,
just you got to hang out.
I said,
I know.</v>

1012
00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.530
And I now I know what he was thinking.
Like,
hey dude,
I'm trying,

1013
00:59:45.531 --> 00:59:46.770
I'm still trying to get it,
you know,

1014
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:50.180
and you'd sit back there and you'd watch like a towel and Kevin,
Brandon,

1015
00:59:50.181 --> 00:59:53.090
all these guys that were like already made men.
Like in the end,

1016
00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:57.800
everybody had an edge and there was no like joy of like come on along the,

1017
00:59:57.801 --> 01:00:02.801
I'll show you the way it was just mean tough guys who got a spot and you weren't

1018
01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:08.270
taking it from them and screw you to this day member to stay til two o'clock in

1019
01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.720
the morning and let me,
I dare you to complain.
Yeah,
I dare you.

1020
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.930
And it was a bunch of comics they used to hide uptown cause they didn't want to

1021
01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:16.250
go downtown and get there.

1022
01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:20.450
They went down there once it takes two to make it take you already.

1023
01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:25.070
Fuck that shit.
I am not going below fucking 23rd street and they they,

1024
01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:28.700
it was scary.
It was scary down there.
It was a,

1025
01:00:28.701 --> 01:00:30.780
it was like Armageddon and the,

1026
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:34.280
but I used to walk by the Boston during the day when it had that shit read

1027
01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:36.320
awning that looked turned pink.
Yeah.

1028
01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.680
It looks like an old peep show bill fucking front.
I used to,

1029
01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:43.040
I used to get sick to my stomach when I would look at it and I and I,

1030
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.090
and that was the main Dredd where I was just like I have to get over this

1031
01:00:47.091 --> 01:00:49.820
fucking feeling or I am not going to make it in this city.

1032
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:51.380
I know cause that is fucking not,

1033
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:55.550
I'm just walking by the building and it's like that bully I have to fight.
Yes.

1034
01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:58.460
Completely.
I remember saying to Kevin Brennan,

1035
01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:02.390
we were up at the standup New York and uh,
he's like,

1036
01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.210
was talking just about this and I said yeah,
but you know,

1037
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.370
we gotta keep going cause it's making a stronger,
right.

1038
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:11.990
We got to go cause it makes it a stronger Kevin goes,
it's,
it's comedy.

1039
01:01:11.991 --> 01:01:14.210
I mean how fucking strong do we have to be?

1040
01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.313
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1041
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.230
<v 1>I remember this comic to bitch and say that they should,</v>

1042
01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:22.380
they should be no heckling.
This should be no heckling.
He's like,

1043
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:25.290
you go to a Broadway show,
there's no heckling and I don't want to be like,

1044
01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:29.490
well fucking gold.
Fucking get a job on Broadway then do.
Cause I,

1045
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.590
I don't think that there should be any heckling that's like,

1046
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:34.680
I think that's what makes stand up so fucking cool is that yeah,

1047
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:39.180
that is actually,
you know,
that's part of it that somebody is going to do that.

1048
01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:41.420
Yeah.
That there's the energy that something's get it,

1049
01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:45.180
that this is going to be different tonight than it was last night.

1050
01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:46.830
And I will say because of me,

1051
01:01:46.831 --> 01:01:49.470
it might be cause the audience maybe because of the Moon,
who knows?

1052
01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:53.930
And the fact that people heckle is also what keeps a lot of people from never it

1053
01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.260
weeds out a lot of people.
Yeah.
Which is a gun belt on both sides.
Yeah.

1054
01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:00.800
I don't want to keep you here too long.
I know you're,

1055
01:02:00.801 --> 01:02:05.730
you're onto a bunch of other podcasts to promote your show.
I stay here all day.

1056
01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:09.150
Um,
we'll also,
we want to have enough time for going to fix the guard.
Maybe.

1057
01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:13.170
Who knows?
Start one.
Finish it at home.
Yeah,
he could do that.
All right,

1058
01:02:13.171 --> 01:02:16.710
let's do that.

1064
01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:38.670
our buddy Jim Gaffigan steps by a doughnut shop while I'm there.
Oh,

1065
01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:40.550
that's awesome.
Yeah,
it's great.
All right.

1066
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.170
I've already pitched myself for the second season.

All right dude.

1067
01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:46.920
So happy for your success buddy.
Thank you buddy.

1069
01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:55.771
I apologize to all the people that wrote in above the farmers down there and,

1070
01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.720
uh,
South Africa.

1071
01:02:58.721 --> 01:03:02.980
I'm going to read up on that and I will read the rest of that guy's email.
Um,

1072
01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:09.900
um,

Okay.
That's my promise.
Now if you know me,
I'm scatterbrained,

1073
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.240
so I might forget.
Okay.
But,
uh,

1074
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:17.110
I don't take innocent people dying anywhere lightly.

1075
01:03:17.111 --> 01:03:20.050
It had nothing to do with that and do the other bullshit.
All right,
with that,

1076
01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.640
let's,
uh,

1080
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:44.170

1081
01:03:44.171 --> 01:03:48.820
wireless build down to just 15 bucks a month.

I wonder if they make like those power suits that Hillary Clinton war for the

submit your measurements way for your customers suit to arrive in just a few

1184
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.350
weeks,
and then he got accustomed suit.

1185
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:17.810
So if you show up where everybody else has a suit on,

1186
01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.170
they just bought it off the rack,
they don't got their initials there,

1187
01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:24.260
then I'll get that snazzy lining that you're going to have right.

1188
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:28.530
Visit a showroom or shop online@indochino.com uh,

1201
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.160
from fucking innocent people.
Where does it end?

1202

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.750
All right bill.
It didn't Ryan,

I thought it was pretty good on the fly.

1208
01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:43.650
You know the fun comfy undies that feel as good as they look to those of you who

1209
01:11:43.651 --> 01:11:45.210
haven't tried them yet.

You get incredible underwear sent to your door with me on these meaning no more

1211
01:11:49.201 --> 01:11:54.201
hunting around for the perfect pair at a crowded store and eventually settling

1212
01:11:54.691 --> 01:11:55.321
for good enough.

1213
01:11:55.321 --> 01:11:59.440
Just picture you walking around and your skivvies drop in trial is a trial.

1214
01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:02.220
I was always dropping trout for the longest time,

1215
01:12:02.221 --> 01:12:05.310
but it's travel like you putting the,
you're taking down your trousers,

1216
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:10.320
which always reminds me of that Louis Ck joke when he was talking about calling

1217
01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:14.820
up a phone sex line and you always get that old woman talking dirty to them.

Me undies are made what they sustainably sourced material from beechwood trees.

1221
01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.260
This is how confident these guys are.

1222
01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:31.680
They're putting trees in their underwear and somehow it's still more comfortable

1223
01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:32.963
than cotton.

1224
01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:37.770
There's naturally sought fiber makes a fabric that won't sag down or the rep,

1225
01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:40.920
trust me,
I got a pair of these that all of this is true.

Hiring used to be hard.
I don't know who to pick.
Moon.

1245
01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:51.630
Multiple job sites.
Stacks of resumes,

1246
01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:56.400
a confusing review process.
Jesus Christ.
Where does it end?
But today,

1247
01:13:56.401 --> 01:14:00.600
hiring can be easy and you only have to go to one place to get it done.

1248
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:05.100
Zip
recruiter.com/burr.
Uh,

1249
01:14:05.101 --> 01:14:09.060
when you go to zip
a,

1250
01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.770
they send you your,
uh,
zip recruiter,

1251
01:14:11.771 --> 01:14:16.030
sends your job's to over 100 of the web's leading job boards.

1252
01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:19.120
They don't stop there.
Most people would stop there,

1253
01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:22.070
but not ZipRecruiter with their power from matching technology,

1254
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:23.380
zip ZipRecruiter's scans,

1255
01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:28.120
thousands of job resumes to find people with the right experience and invite

1256
01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:32.020
them to apply for your position.
As applications come in,
zip

1257
01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:38.590
analyzes each one and spotlights the top candidates.

1258
01:14:38.591 --> 01:14:41.560
So you now you don't have to fuck around with people who aren't qualified,

1259
01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:42.850

Time is money.
Ziprecruiter understands this was with results like that.

1263
01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:58.330

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:05.400
code is the highest rated hiring site in America right now.

01:15:28.011 --> 01:15:32.960

1285
01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:25.250

any class,
the mail,

1286
01:16:25.251 --> 01:16:26.600

No need to lease an expensive postage meter and there are no long term

1292
01:16:45.321 --> 01:16:48.650
commitments.
I use stamps.com to send out all my posters,

1293
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.860
which I really need to advertise better.
I have autographed posters,

1294
01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.460
these amazing posters that people have told me I could sell for 40 bucks at a

1295
01:16:55.461 --> 01:16:58.910
show,
but you know what?
I'm a man of the people.
All right?

1296
01:16:58.911 --> 01:17:01.190
I only sell them for 20 bucks.
Their autograph there,
right?

1297
01:17:01.191 --> 01:17:05.060
Every one of my goddamn shows and people keep walking out and then they texted

1298
01:17:05.061 --> 01:17:08.780
me after,
hey man,
I want to see the poster.
Where is it?
It's out there in the,

1299
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:13.040
I don't know where.
All right,
I'm sidetracked,

1300
01:17:13.041 --> 01:17:15.350
but I use stamps.com to send these fuckers out.
Alright.

All right.

1305
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.940
By the way,
as I mentioned before,

1306
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:42.970
my great Buddy Dean del Ray's doing his first talk show as a standup comedian,

1307
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.943
uh,
tonight,

1308
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:51.050
Monday night on Conan O'brien with the great and brilliant Mark Marin is one of

1309
01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:56.030
the guests.
Um,
please tune in and uh,

1310
01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:59.220
and check it out.
And after that it says they got a ton of emails,

1311
01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:04.250
tons of emails about,
uh,
from South Africa.
So I have to read these.

1312
01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:08.480
I can at least read the rest of this guy.
Um,
his thing here,

1313
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:12.140
I forgot where I left off.
Look,
let's just pick this up,

1314
01:18:12.141 --> 01:18:16.910
which brings me to my second point.
Now.
I don't follow all the news on Trump.

1315
01:18:16.911 --> 01:18:20.900
Frankly,
I don't care anymore because it's exhausting.
I agree.
I agree too.

1316
01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:24.140
Everybody's screaming and yelling and flipping the fuck out and nobody has a

1317
01:18:24.141 --> 01:18:27.860
solution.
Uh,
but the message I get from the media is still the same.

1318
01:18:27.861 --> 01:18:32.540
They hate him and we'll blow up any small thing just to take them down and

1319
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.930
basically,
you know,
something that is a problem in this country.

1320
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:37.700
Ever since Bill Clinton,

1321
01:18:37.701 --> 01:18:42.350
no one has been allowed to be president without being constantly under attack.

1322
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:46.730
And I really think it hurts to position Democrat,
Republican,

1323
01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:51.590
or Libertarian,
whatever.
You got to let the person try to do the fucking job,

1324
01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:54.260
you know.
Anyways,
they hate him and we'll blow up anything you'd dedicate.

1325
01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:58.250
Basically they're saying Trump has chosen debate,
team Ei,

1326
01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:02.480
therefore we will choose opposing team.
Be A,

1327
01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:05.540
that is true with CNN and Fox.
They both do it.

1328
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:10.570
Everybody is making a big deal over every bombshell in quotes.

1329
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:11.460
Uh,

1330
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:16.460
in the Mueller probe of he must have known and this lawyer knew about that shit

1331
01:19:17.211 --> 01:19:18.740
and pleaded guilty.
Really?

1332
01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.250
Do you want to tell me Hillary Clinton or any other politician would have the

1333
01:19:22.251 --> 01:19:23.810
same kind of,
uh,

1334
01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.920
at that you've wanted to say wouldn't have the same kind of during,
yeah.

1335
01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:28.100
Hillary would have been getting attack the entire fucking time.

1336
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:33.020
They all played dirty.
I would never have expected otherwise.
So my point is,

1337
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:37.340
yeah,
but they don't all play dirty.
Bernie Sanders did not play dirty,

1338
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.860
which why I don't think it's a waste of a vote to even know the guy's not going

1339
01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:45.020
to win to a vote for somebody like that because you're trying to encourage more

1340
01:19:45.021 --> 01:19:48.740
people by seeing the amount of votes that you can get by being a good fucking

1341
01:19:48.741 --> 01:19:53.090
person.
A people say you wasted your vote.
Anyways.

1342
01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:58.370
Um,
so my point is Trump actually noticed a problem in South Africa that requires

1343
01:19:58.371 --> 01:19:59.204
attention,

1344
01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.530
but we probably won't get the attention we need because the dumb ass media is

1345
01:20:03.531 --> 01:20:08.340
too busy writing South Africa hit back at Trump articles.
Uh,

1346
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.680
that's true.
They tried to take down everything that he's doing.

1347
01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:12.030
But the thing about it is,

1348
01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:18.000
is he only seems to notice problems that hit white people.
Okay.

1349
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.340
That's the fucking problem.
Okay.
And,

1350
01:20:20.341 --> 01:20:25.341
and in as much as our media definitely would have attacked any republican that

1351
01:20:25.711 --> 01:20:29.640
went in there,
the the left wing media would definitely do that.
I mean,

1352
01:20:29.641 --> 01:20:32.880
I think when you look at Neo Nazis and go,
yeah,

1353
01:20:32.881 --> 01:20:37.080
well I mean did you know people were being aggressive on both sides.

1354
01:20:37.081 --> 01:20:41.010
You kind of lose a lot of credibility is all I'm saying.
All right.

1355
01:20:41.011 --> 01:20:44.580
But I understand also what you're saying.
Okay.
Continuing.

1356
01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.800
Um,
wow.
You read it all the way up to here.
Thanks.

1357
01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:53.250
Go be an inspiration to all the other hairless ginger's out there.

1358
01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:56.483
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1359
01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:02.000
<v 2>Um,
all right,
so there's another one from South Africa.</v>

1360
01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:06.200
Bill Clinton's balanced budget myth.
All right.

1361
01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.700
So it wasn't balanced.

1362
01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:12.470
Now I have to want like where did this come from now is this people on the

1363
01:21:12.471 --> 01:21:16.880
right?
Yeah.
You don't know where any of this is from.
So now I have to,

1364
01:21:16.881 --> 01:21:20.420
I'm just supposed to read this and I'm supposed to look at you and assume that

1365
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:24.380
you're as this guy down the middle,
that votes on both sides.
I will,

1366
01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:27.380
I will read this.
You guys are making me more informed,
I think.

1367
01:21:27.381 --> 01:21:30.290
Or maybe you're swaying me like that guy who wrote in from Russia,

1368
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.350
but I don't know if that's the guy from Russia who's hacked into the Twitter

1369
01:21:33.351 --> 01:21:37.430
shit.
I don't know where any of this shit's coming from a shark theft.
Hey,

1370
01:21:37.431 --> 01:21:41.060
bill just wanted to share this ridiculous story about this guy that stole a

1371
01:21:41.061 --> 01:21:43.430
fucking shark from an aquarium in Texas.

1372
01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:48.700
He dressed the shark is a baby and put it on a push chair and just walked out.

1373
01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.370
His justification was,
he was concerned for the sharks welfare.

1374
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:56.120
Well,
he probably wanted to put it back in the ocean,
but,
uh,

1375
01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:59.150
once he takes it out of the water,
I think the shark was like,
hey man,

1376
01:21:59.151 --> 01:22:03.530
I don't think that aquarium was,
was so bad.
Granted,
it's not as big as the ocean,

1377
01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:07.400
and I'm no longer to live freely as a living thing on this planet.

1378
01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.440
<v 3>But,
uh,
you know,</v>

1379
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:16.340
<v 2>if the shark went to rescue you and stuck you dressed you as a baby and put you</v>

1380
01:22:16.341 --> 01:22:20.630
in a fucking carriage and then took you under water,

1381
01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:23.010
I think you'd be like
[inaudible]

1382
01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:28.030
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1383
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:30.100
<v 2>Oh,
there is still some due process in this country.</v>

1384
01:22:30.101 --> 01:22:34.690
The fact that the article says a man man accused of stealing shark.
I mean,

1385
01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:36.190
I think the fact that he had it,

1386
01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:38.453
<v 3>you know,</v>

1387
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:40.160
<v 2>oh,
I thought this was like,</v>

1388
01:22:40.161 --> 01:22:42.890
I thought that was part of the gift bag after you went to the aquarium that you

1389
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:47.960
could take one of the fish home.
All right.
Robin Leach,
uh,

1390
01:22:49.090 --> 01:22:52.880
Billy Benz,
uh,
you're old enough to remember lifestyles of the rich and famous.

1391
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:56.030
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
That was great.
That's one of the first,
uh,

1392
01:22:57.170 --> 01:23:00.770
the sort of MTV cribs before MTV cribs.

1393
01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:05.890
This Guy Robin Leach and they glorified in and was just all like,

1394
01:23:05.891 --> 01:23:08.380
and when they sitting at the pool,
there is,

1395
01:23:08.381 --> 01:23:12.910
don't sit at the pool they eat as cargo.
I love watching it.
Uh,

1396
01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:15.580
do an impression for the kids who don't know what he sounded like.

1397
01:23:15.581 --> 01:23:16.990
I can't do an impression of him.

1398
01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:20.140
I haven't seen it long enough and I'm not good at impressions unless the persons

1399
01:23:20.141 --> 01:23:25.120
in my life,
um,
like I can imitate,
I can imitate.

1400
01:23:25.210 --> 01:23:29.350
I'm working on a Dean del Rey,
then I'm going to get like a,

1401
01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:34.030
he always comes back from concert.
Hey Dean,
how was it?
Ah,
dude,

1402
01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:38.740
it was cute.
He always goes down or if he's talking about some of the,

1403
01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:43.600
there's an asshole.
Oh,
they're gay.
Okay.
That guy's a garbage can.
All right.

1404
01:23:43.630 --> 01:23:48.040
The first show to really give you a look at how filthy rich some people are,

1405
01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:50.590
was the lifestyles of the rich and famous.

1406
01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:55.090
I remember seeing an onyx black bathtub and just thinking that all rich people

1407
01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:59.080
had black sinks and bathroom fixtures.
All right?

1408
01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:00.880
For those of you who didn't grow up in the 80s,

1409
01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:03.490
if somebody had an all black bathroom,

1410
01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:07.450
they were into cocaine on an entirely different level.

1411
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:10.510
They were going,
uh,
Kleinfeld.

1412
01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:16.740
You remember Kleinfeld Manuel the most underrated Sean Penn character of all

1413
01:24:17.111 --> 01:24:20.920
fucking time a car in Carlito's way.

1414
01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:22.720
You gotta check that out where he was.

1415
01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:27.130
When I love when Pitino said that lie lawyer.
