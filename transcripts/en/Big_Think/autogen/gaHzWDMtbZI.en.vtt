well I think the recession is doing two

well I think the recession is doing two
 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.560

things first it it cuts the volume of

you give up in bad times is building a

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120
you give up in bad times is building a
 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.029
you give up in bad times is building a
new building you know you got to eat you

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039
new building you know you got to eat you
 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.740

kind of do certain other essential
 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.340
kind of do certain other essential
things but building a building for most

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350

is an optional thing and so when times

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770
is an optional thing and so when times
 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.040
is an optional thing and so when times
are tough you give it up it's both

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050
are tough you give it up it's both
 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.430
are tough you give it up it's both
optional and unbelievably expensive so

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440
optional and unbelievably expensive so
 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.549
optional and unbelievably expensive so
therefore it's the first thing to go

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559
therefore it's the first thing to go
 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.439
therefore it's the first thing to go
that's the bad effect obviously of the

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449
that's the bad effect obviously of the
 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.450
that's the bad effect obviously of the
recession the good effect though is it

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460
recession the good effect though is it
 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.910
recession the good effect though is it
it kind of can cleanse a lot of the crap

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920
it kind of can cleanse a lot of the crap
 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.489
it kind of can cleanse a lot of the crap
out of a system I mean we've just come

it will have been a social good in some
 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.469
it will have been a social good in some
way actually that's not too I don't mean

to be flippant about it obviously there

to be flippant about it obviously there
 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.960
to be flippant about it obviously there
is more social ill to a recession than

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970
is more social ill to a recession than
 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.750
is more social ill to a recession than
social good but somewhere within all the

the recession's affected architecture at
all levels I think because there's not

all levels I think because there's not
 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.399
all levels I think because there's not
much money to build remember a

building much commercial developers are

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569
building much commercial developers are

not building much about the only amount

not building much about the only amount
 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.600
not building much about the only amount
of building that you do see is some

for a long time have raised a lot of the

you know with construction way down this
is actually a good time because they can

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160
is actually a good time because they can
 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.860
is actually a good time because they can
build it at a cheaper price and they

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870
build it at a cheaper price and they
 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.420
build it at a cheaper price and they
might if things come back in a couple

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430
might if things come back in a couple
 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.910
might if things come back in a couple
years so they're going ahead with a

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920
years so they're going ahead with a
 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.910
years so they're going ahead with a
certain number of projects but an awful

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920
certain number of projects but an awful

lot of stuff is not happening in that

category as well as other categories so
 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.830

it's it's way down at at all levels well

it's it's way down at at all levels well
you know we're coming out of this period

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120
you know we're coming out of this period
 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.849
you know we're coming out of this period
when architecture has been incredibly

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859
when architecture has been incredibly
 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.699
when architecture has been incredibly
ambitious and sometimes too ambitious

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709
ambitious and sometimes too ambitious
 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.729
ambitious and sometimes too ambitious
even but although far be it from me as

even but although far be it from me as
 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.590
even but although far be it from me as
an architecture critic to say there's

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600
an architecture critic to say there's
 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.120
an architecture critic to say there's
such a thing as architecture being too

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130
such a thing as architecture being too
 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.680
such a thing as architecture being too
ambitious but in fact sometimes it has

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690
ambitious but in fact sometimes it has
 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.870
ambitious but in fact sometimes it has
been it's tried too hard it's sort of

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880
been it's tried too hard it's sort of
 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.430
been it's tried too hard it's sort of
acted as if it was going to solve all

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440
acted as if it was going to solve all
 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.379
acted as if it was going to solve all
the world's ills by a bunch of fancy

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389
the world's ills by a bunch of fancy
 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.870
the world's ills by a bunch of fancy
buildings any case I think we are

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880
buildings any case I think we are
 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.660
buildings any case I think we are
pulling back on a lot of that stuff and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670
pulling back on a lot of that stuff and
 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.129
pulling back on a lot of that stuff and
there there's both a good and a bad side

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139
there there's both a good and a bad side
 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.690
there there's both a good and a bad side
also the good side is sometimes of

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700
also the good side is sometimes of
 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.069
also the good side is sometimes of
things are being done just in a more

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079
things are being done just in a more
 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.000
things are being done just in a more
simple clear basic way without a lot of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010
simple clear basic way without a lot of
 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.660
simple clear basic way without a lot of
unnecessary frills and fuss you know it

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670
unnecessary frills and fuss you know it
 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.430
unnecessary frills and fuss you know it
kind of maybe we'll get back to a

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440
kind of maybe we'll get back to a
 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.650
kind of maybe we'll get back to a
respect for kind of modernist purity

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660
respect for kind of modernist purity
 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.879
respect for kind of modernist purity
sometimes and that's all to the good the

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889
sometimes and that's all to the good the
 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.710
sometimes and that's all to the good the
other hand if things are just done more

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720
other hand if things are just done more
 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.620
other hand if things are just done more

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630
cheaply with crappy junkie materials
 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.690
cheaply with crappy junkie materials
that's not to the good and I think we're

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700
that's not to the good and I think we're
 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.710
that's not to the good and I think we're
seeing some of both of those things

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720
seeing some of both of those things
 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.200
seeing some of both of those things
right now
