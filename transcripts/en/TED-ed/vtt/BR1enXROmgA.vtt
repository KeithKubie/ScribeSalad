00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:09.378
They're long and slithery,

00:00:09.378 --> 00:00:11.045
and they're not very colorful.

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:14.252
But they do have a strange beauty of their own.

00:00:14.252 --> 00:00:16.003
Their sinuous, nocturnal movements

00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:16.961
through the water

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:18.878
are mesmerizing to watch.

00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:21.176
And though they may resemble underwater snakes,

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:25.293
eels are, in fact, a very interesting type of fish.

00:00:25.293 --> 00:00:26.763
There are several things about eels

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:28.127
that make them unique

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:31.294
besides their elongated shape and limbless bodies.

00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:32.211
For one thing,

00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:35.731
eels have the ability to breathe through their skin.

00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:37.360
Some can even leave the water

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.069
and move over land for short periods.

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:42.044
And, unlike most migratory fish,

00:00:42.044 --> 00:00:43.127
such as salmon,

00:00:43.127 --> 00:00:44.574
which spawn in fresh water

00:00:44.574 --> 00:00:46.658
but live their adult lives in salt water,

00:00:46.658 --> 00:00:48.794
eels of the genus Anguilla

00:00:48.794 --> 00:00:50.746
migrate in the opposite direction,

00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:53.258
spawning and breeding in oceans and seas,

00:00:53.258 --> 00:00:55.127
while spending most of their intervening time

00:00:55.127 --> 00:00:56.961
in fresh water.

00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:59.173
If we were to take one such fresh water eel

00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:00.961
and follow its life story,

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.759
it would be born in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean,

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:06.461
about a thousand miles east of Bermuda.

00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:08.795
This area, called the Sargasso Sea,

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:10.350
forms the western part

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.044
of a subtropical gyre,

00:01:12.044 --> 00:01:15.199
a giant whirlpool in the middle of the ocean.

00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:17.564
Our eel, let's call it Eli,

00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:21.235
would begin as one of ten to twenty million tiny eggs,

00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:23.238
carried by a female eel,

00:01:23.238 --> 00:01:25.711
hatching into a transparent leaf-shaped thing

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:29.211
that looks nothing like an adult eel.

00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:31.294
Eli starts to drift in ocean currents,

00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:33.247
predominantly the Gulf Stream

00:01:33.247 --> 00:01:35.259
towards either Europe or North America,

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.461
depending on its particular species.

00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:40.045
Upon reaching the coast,

00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:41.876
Eli is about two inches long,

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:44.510
looking more eely but still transparent,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.262
known at this stage as a glass eel.

00:01:47.262 --> 00:01:49.044
But within a couple of days in fresh water,

00:01:49.044 --> 00:01:52.100
Eli's skin becomes pigmented a brownish-black,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.354
now looking more like that of an adult eel.

00:01:55.354 --> 00:01:56.395
You might notice

00:01:56.395 --> 00:01:57.648
that we haven't mentioned anything

00:01:57.648 --> 00:01:59.462
about Eli's gender yet.

00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:01.294
That's because this is only determined

00:02:01.294 --> 00:02:03.109
once an eel enters fresh water,

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.323
though nobody is sure exactly how that happens.

00:02:06.323 --> 00:02:08.907
Most of the eels that stay in the estuaries

00:02:08.907 --> 00:02:10.826
and brackish water become males,

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:13.163
while those that go upstream become females,

00:02:13.163 --> 00:02:15.211
growing up to two to three times bigger than

00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:17.465
their future mates.

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:18.417
In this case,

00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:22.339
it turns out that Eli was actually short for Elaine.

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:23.424
As a female eel,

00:02:23.424 --> 00:02:25.008
Elaine will be quite solitary

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:26.794
for most of her life in the stream,

00:02:26.794 --> 00:02:28.845
eating whatever falls in the water:

00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:31.349
grasshoppers, crickets, small fish,

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.236
insect larvae, frogs, baby birds,

00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:37.128
almost anything she can get her mouth around.

00:02:37.128 --> 00:02:38.688
And she will grow quite big,

00:02:38.688 --> 00:02:40.230
up to four feet long

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.377
and weighing as much as thirteen pounds.

00:02:43.377 --> 00:02:44.877
We don't know exactly how

00:02:44.877 --> 00:02:46.277
fresh water eels know when it's time

00:02:46.277 --> 00:02:47.912
to return to the ocean,

00:02:47.912 --> 00:02:49.617
but something calls to them.

00:02:49.617 --> 00:02:50.908
And their fall migration

00:02:50.908 --> 00:02:52.744
is one of the largest unseen migrations

00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:54.579
on the planet.

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.497
As Elaine leaves fresh water for the ocean,

00:02:56.497 --> 00:02:59.626
she undergoes a shocking metamorphosis.

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:02.127
Her eyes enlarge by about ten times,

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:03.711
her skin gets thicker,

00:03:03.711 --> 00:03:06.044
and her fins get larger.

00:03:06.044 --> 00:03:07.759
These are most likely adaptations

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.593
for their upcoming ocean travel,

00:03:09.593 --> 00:03:11.680
and Elaine seamlessly makes the transition

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.627
from fresh to salt water,

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:16.711
which would be toxic for most other fish.

00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:18.936
Once Elaine leaves the mouth of the fresh water streams,

00:03:18.936 --> 00:03:22.189
she will disappear completely from human view.

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.732
No one has witnessed,

00:03:23.732 --> 00:03:25.151
or been able to follow,

00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:27.111
an adult eel on their migration,

00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:29.905
nor do we know how deep they spawn.

00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:32.659
But it's assumed that they can follow some signs

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.162
that they can detect,

00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:36.453
such as a thermal barrier between ocean currents

00:03:36.453 --> 00:03:37.953
or a salinity front,

00:03:37.953 --> 00:03:40.309
in order to return to the same area of the ocean

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:42.178
where they were born.

00:03:42.178 --> 00:03:44.084
Because we don't even know exactly

00:03:44.084 --> 00:03:46.006
what happens during an eel's migration,

00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:49.126
we can only imagine what the actual breeding looks like.

00:03:49.126 --> 00:03:50.711
But the common hypothesis

00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:52.462
is that Elaine and thousands,

00:03:52.462 --> 00:03:53.763
or hundreds of thousands,

00:03:53.763 --> 00:03:54.711
of other eels

00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:57.127
gather in large, intertwined masses

00:03:57.127 --> 00:03:58.794
and release their eggs and sperm

00:03:58.794 --> 00:04:01.896
in a giant orgy known as panmixia.

00:04:01.896 --> 00:04:03.905
A couple of days after the eggs are laid,

00:04:03.905 --> 00:04:04.811
they hatch,

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.608
and the cycle begins again.

00:04:06.608 --> 00:04:08.044
And because we've never seen

00:04:08.044 --> 00:04:10.655
the adult eels returning up the fresh water rivers,

00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:11.878
we must assume that,

00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:14.408
having completed their long and roundabout journey,

00:04:14.408 --> 00:04:16.702
these amazing and mysterious creatures

00:04:16.702 --> 00:04:18.295
finally die there,

00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:20.572
in the same place where they were born.

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.000
Goodbye, Elaine!

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.709
It was a pleasure knowing you.
