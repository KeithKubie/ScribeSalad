00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.450
 In the last video, we talked about the different ways 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.920
 to present the central trend or the average of a plurality of data. 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.690
 In this video we will look at this more broadly, 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.170
 to understand how they are distracted 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.830
 data. 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.200
 Let's just think a little about this. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:27.780
 Let's say we have 10, 0, 10, 20 and 30. 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.090
 Let's say that there is one set of data there. 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.290
 Let's say the other set of data is 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.640
 Let's now calculate the arithmetic mean for both 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.880
 sets of data. 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.690
 Let's calculate the average value. 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.270
 When you become more familiar with the statistics, you will 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.130
 you understand the difference between 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.780
 aggregate and sample. 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.830
 I assume this is all 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.050
 a set of data. 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.240
 So we will have an average value for the general population. 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.000
 We will have a job, as you will see, 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.300
 with the measures of the general population for dissipation. 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.890
 I know all these are complex words. 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.950
 Next, you will not have all the data given. 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.810
 You will have some extras from them 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.420
 you will try to calculate things for the whole 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.790
 general population. 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.370
 I do not want to worry too much about this now. 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.170
 But if you go on with the statistics, 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.910
 I want to make this point. 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.690
 The average value of the aggregate or the arithmetic mean of that 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.790
 a set of data here is -10 plus 0, plus 10, 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.730
 plus 20, plus 30 on - we have 5 data points - on 5. 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.530
 How equal is this? 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.620
 Minus 10 is truncated with plus 10, 20 plus 30 is 50, 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.290
 divided by 5 is equal to 10. 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.720
 What is the average value of this data set? 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:56.470
 8 plus 9, plus 10, plus 11, plus 12, the whole on 5. 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.160
 The way we can look at it is 8 plus 12 is 20, 9 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.770
 plus 11 is also 20, so we have 40 then 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.890
 we will have 50 there. 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.710
 Add 10 more. 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.690
 Again we will have 50 on 5. 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.380
 So it has exactly the same average of the general population. 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.440
 Or if you do not want to use the word cluster or 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.830
 sampling and all that both sets of data have 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.690
 exactly the same arithmetic mean. 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.360
 When we take the average of all these numbers and divide by 5 or 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.570
 when we have the sum of these numbers and divide by 5, 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.950
 you get 10, some of these numbers and divide by 5, 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.390
 you also get 10. 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.310
 But it is clear that these sets of numbers are different. 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.810
 If you just look at this number, 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.270
 that maybe they are very similar to each other multitudes. 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.760
 But when you look at these two sets of data, you can 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.710
 to notice something. 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.790
 All these numbers are very close to 10. 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.300
 I mean, the farthest number here is 2 out of 10. 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.120
 12 is just 2 out of 10. 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.840
 Here these numbers are more than 10. 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.990
 Even the closest ones are at a distance of 10, and these are at a distance 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.920
 20 of 10. 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.660
 So this multitude of data is here 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.160
 more scattered, right? 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.730
 This data is at a greater distance than the average 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.610
 of the average. 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.630
 Let's think about the different ways we can measure 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.840
 the statistical scattering or the distance we are from 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.070
 center, on average. 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.130
 One way, this is a kind 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.170
 the simplest way is the span. 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.840
 You will not see it used very often, but it is in a sense a lot 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.850
 a simple way to understand at what distance is the distraction between 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.850
 the largest and the smallest number. 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.760
 We literally take the largest number, which is 30 c 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.020
 the example and we deduct the smallest number. 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.280
 30 minus -10, which is equal to 40, which shows us, 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.530
 that the difference between the biggest and the smallest 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.830
 the number is 40, so for this set of data we have a 40. 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.570
 Here the range is the largest number, 12, minus the smallest 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.840
 a number that is 8, which is equal to 4. 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.150
 So here the span is actually a good measure for 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.990
 statistical scattering. 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.370
 We say well, both sets have an arithmetic mean of 10. 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.620
 But when I look at the wobble, it's got bigger 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.660
 which shows me that it is a more scattered crowd. 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.360
 But the scale will not always give you a complete picture. 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.820
 You may have two sets of data with exactly the same width 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.840
 where, based on how the numbers are grouped, 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.230
 may nevertheless have a very different distribution 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.180
 of the numbers. 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.150
 The thing you will see most commonly used, 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.400
 is called variation of data. 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.390
 In fact, we will see the standard 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.390
 deviation in this video. 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.960
 It is probably the most commonly used, but there are many 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.040
 close relationship with the coefficient of variation. 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.466
 The sign of the variance - as will 

00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:49.180
 we are dealing with variation of the general population. 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.470
 Once again, we assume that this is all the data 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.650
 of the whole population that we have not only a sample, 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.630
 we do not have just a piece of data. 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.730
 The sign of variation is literally this sign sigma, 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.020
 this Greek letter, square. 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.260
 This is the sign of variation. 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.540
 We will see that this letter sigma is actually the sign 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.260
 for the standard quadratic deviation. 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.670
 That's why. 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.630
 But in any case the definition of variance is, 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.890
 that you take each of these points with data you find the difference 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.580
 between them and the average value, you raise them squarely 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.560
 then calculate the average of these squares. 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.840
 I know this sounds very complicated, but when 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.620
 actually calculate it, you will see that it's not that bad. 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.680
 Remember that the average value here is 10. 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.210
 So I take the first data point. 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.470
 I'll write it here. 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.700
 I'll roll a little down. 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.360
 I get the first data point. 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.680
 Minus 10. 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.150
 From it I will take the arithmetic mean and 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.840
 I will raise him to a square. 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.210
 I just found the difference from the first data point to 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.580
 the average value and raised it to a square. 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.820
 This essentially makes it a positive number. 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.950
 Plus, the second data point, 0, minus 10, 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.050
 this is the average value; we have this 10 here is a square plus 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.590
 10, minus 10 per square - we have this 10 here in the middle - 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.110
 plus 20 minus 10 - that's 20, square 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.770
 plus 30 minus 10 per square. 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.630
 This is the square difference between each 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.280
 number and arithmetic mean. 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.490
 This is the arithmetic mean. 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.960
 I find the difference between each data point and 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.200
 the average value, I pick up a square and collect them, then 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.020
 divide the number of data points. 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.170
 I therefore calculate the average of these numbers, 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.920
 from squares to squares. 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.060
 When you say it aloud, it sounds a lot 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.520
 complicated. 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.820
 But you take every number. 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.570
 The difference between it and the average value you raise in a square 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.790
 and calculate the average of them. 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.320
 So there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, divided by 5. 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.950
 How will this be equal? 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.580
 Minus 10, minus 10 is minus 20. 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.460
 Minus 20 per square is 400. 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.780
 0 minus 10 is minus 10, squared is 100, so we have plus 100. 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.740
 10 minus 10 per square is simply 0 per square, which is 0. 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.740
 Plus, 20 minus 10 is 10 per square, which is 100. 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.030
 Plus 30 minus 10, which is 20, the square is 400. 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.750
 All this on 5. 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.870
 What do we have here? 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.460
 400 plus 100 is 500 plus 500 plus 1000. 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.930
 It equals 1000/5, which equals 200. 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:42.520
 So in this situation the coefficient of variation will be 200. 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.250
 This is the measure of distraction here. 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.850
 Let's compare it to this set of data here. 

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.720
 Let's compare it with the coefficient of variation 

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.420
 of this less scattered set of data. 

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.680
 I'll turn a little to get some space, 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.930
 although it ends me. 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.370
 Maybe I can scroll up. 

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.200
 Here. 

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.740
 Let me calculate the coefficient of variation for this set of data. 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.210
 We already know its average value. 

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.990
 The coefficient of variation for this set of data will be 8 

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:21.340
 minus 10 per square, plus 9 minus 10 per square, plus 10 minus 10 

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:26.470
 square plus 11 minus 10 - let's roll a little up - 

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.640
 per square, plus 12 minus 10 per square. 

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.059
 Remember that 10 is the average we calculated. 

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.850
 You must first calculate the average value. Partitioned - we have 1, 

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.630
 2, 3, 4, 5 elevated squares. 

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.679
 So this will be equal to - 8 minus 10 minus 2, 

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.760
 the square is plus 4. 

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.090
 9 minus 10 minus 1, square plus 1. 

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.800
 10 minus 10 is 0 per square. 

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.050
 You also get 0. 

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.730
 11 minus 10 is 1. 

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.380
 You pick him up in a square and get 1. 

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.710
 12 minus 10 is 2. 

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.930
 You pick him up in a square and get 4. 

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.960
 And how is that equal? 

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.100
 All this is on 5. 

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.390
 We have 10/5. 

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:09.160
 So we'll have 10/5, which is 

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.350
 equal to 2. 

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.420
 So the coefficient of variance here - let me make sure that I got it right. 

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.480
 Yes, we have 10/5. 

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.970
 The variation of this less scattered set of data is 

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.820
 much smaller. 

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:26.150
 The coefficient of variation of this data set here is only 2. 

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.630
 So that gives you some idea. 

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.540
 It shows that this is definitely less scattered 

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.300
 a lot of data than that there. 

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.780
 The problem with the coefficient of variation is that 

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.680
 you have the difference between these numbers and 

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.390
 the arithmetic mean by lifting it in a square. 

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.910
 This gives you a little arbitrary number and if 

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.460
 you're dealing with units, let's say 

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.160
 if these are distances. 

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.700
 It's minus 10 meters, 0 meters, 10 meters, that's 8 

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.110
 meters and so on, then when you lift up a square, 

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.250
 you get the coefficient of variation in terms of square meters. 

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.740
 This is a strange set of units. 

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.550
 That's why people like to talk about the standard 

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:20.770
 a deviation that is just a square root of the coefficient of variation 

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.510
 or a square root of a square sigma. 

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.470
 And the standard sign 

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.200
 deviation is simply sigma. 

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.990
 Now that we find the coefficient of variation is very easy 

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.250
 to find the standard deviation of both 

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:33.720
 sets. 

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.390
 The standard deviation of the first 

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:42.660
 multiple data will be a square root of 200. 

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.300
 Square root of 200 is how much? 

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.780
 Square root of 2 in 100. 

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.480
 This is equal to 10 square root of 2. 

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.210
 This is the first set of data. 

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:58.410
 The standard deviation for the second set of data 

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.820
 will be just the square root of its coefficient of variation, which is 2. 

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:08.300
 So the second set of data has 1/10 of the standard deviation of 

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.170
 the first set. 

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.540
 This is 10 by root of 2, and it's just a root of 2. 

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:18.935
 This is 10 times the standard deviation. 

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.480
 Let me give you a slightly better idea. 

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:29.960
 Let's think of it. 

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.160
 This has a 10 times higher standard deviation than that. 

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.480
 Let us remember how we calculate it. 

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.330
 With the coefficient of variation, we simply take every set of data at what distance it is 

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.680
 of the average, we raise to a square 

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.020
 and we calculate the average of them. 

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.490
 Then we calculate the square root, really just to look 

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.260
 units well, but the end result is that we say the first one 

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.850
 a set of data has 10 times the standard deviation of 

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.290
 the second set. 

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.980
 Let's look at the two sets of data. 

00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:07.170
 This has a 10 times higher standard deviation, which makes sense 

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.790
 intuitively, right? 

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.210
 I mean, they both have 10 here, but each one of them, 

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.520
 9 is only a unit distance of 10, 0 is at a distance of 10 

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.640
 of 10, by 10 less. 

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.860
 8 is just 2. 

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.990
 This is at a distance of 20. 

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.770
 So we average 10 times longer. 

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.410
 So the standard deviation, at least for me, gives us 

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:29.090
 a much better idea of ​​what distance on average 

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.960
 we are from the arithmetic mean. 

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.560
 In any case, hopefully find this useful.
