00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How do we charge an object? Well, there are actually several ways.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One way is we can charge by friction.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And if you've ever rubbed your feet on the carpet and then touched your friend

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
who was standing nearby and giving them a shock you have charged yourself by friction.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And what's going on here, the rubbing between two objects actually causes one

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to steal the electrons of the others.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now, it doesn't steal the protons because protons are well relatively

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
gigantic compared to electrons.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Electrons are tiny, tiny little guys.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And so it turns out that just simple rubbing can actually cause an exchange of charge

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
leaving one object positive and one negative.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In fact, this sort of charging happens in cumulonimbus clouds

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and these are the sorts of clouds that cause lightning.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And what happens is little drops of ice or water are constantly moving around

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in this cloud and as these droplets pass through the cloud rubbing against each other

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and passing through different regions of the cloud they gradually either accumulate

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or lose electrons depending on what they're moving on and the details

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
of the actual situation but what this does is it creates a motion of charge.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Whether this is positive or negative.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Whether it's going up or down. It doesn't really matter.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What happens is charge separates and what that usually leads to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is chaotic motion of particles.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
There's a buildup of minus charges in the bottom of the cloud and positive charges at the top.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now we've already shown that these minus charges

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
lead to corresponding positive charges building up in the ground.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We're starting to really understand lightning here as well as electricity.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We can use charging by friction to create a charged object.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Let's say we've created a positively charged ball.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
A good way to do this is by rubbing something metallic with let's say rabbit fur.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Anyways we have this positively charged ball.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and we know that if we bring it near to this ball we'll induce some polarization.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Negative charges on this side and positive on that side. Fine.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But what happens if this ball touches that ball?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We bring this over and let them touch and remember they're both conductors.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
All in all, what do you think will happen when I touch this ball to that?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Do you think nothing will happen?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Do you think that some positive charges will flow from ball B to ball A?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Do you think that some negative charges will flow from A to B?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Or do you think that all the positive charges on ball B will flow to ball A?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Think about what it means.

00:02:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
There will certainly be a conductor, and then give this question a shot.
