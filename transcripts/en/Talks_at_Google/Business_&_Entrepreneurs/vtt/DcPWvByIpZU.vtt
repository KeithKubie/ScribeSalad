[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:08.559
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:09.600
ANDREW HORN: Hey, Google.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.720
Can you guys hear me?

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.767
ANDREW HORN: We're on.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:13.350
Rock and roll.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.520
Hi, guys.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.530
Welcome.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.280
Awesome.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.950
So as you can see, we're here
to talk about human connection

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.630
in the digital age.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.470
Thank you guys for taking
the time to be here.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.802
So I want to start by thanking
you all, because being

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:28.260
at Google, I know
that you could be

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.510
getting a massage for free,
lunch for free, haircut

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.732
for free.

00:00:34.732 --> 00:00:36.690
A lot of other things,
but you're here with me,

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.457
and that makes me happy.

00:00:39.457 --> 00:00:41.790
And so what I want to promise
you before we dig in today

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.737
is that we're not just going
to talk about human connection.

00:00:44.737 --> 00:00:46.320
We're actually going
to talk about how

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.010
to connect in a digital age.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.010
And so my goal is that
you guys walk out of here

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.540
with tangible
techniques that you

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.750
can use to connect with
the people you want

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.310
and the people that
you want to know.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.105
How's that sound?

00:00:57.105 --> 00:00:57.730
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.396
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:00:58.396 --> 00:00:59.650
ANDREW HORN: Rock and roll.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.320
So you guys, before
we dig in, this talk

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.440
is going to be broken up
into three specific sections.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.140
So stories about how I was
able to take this deep yearning

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.950
for connections, curiosity
about relationships,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.060
turn it into this business
that has helped 100,000

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.790
people to give what we think
is the most meaningful gift

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.870
in the world.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.490
We're going to talk about stats.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.340
How do strong social ties and
relationships affect our brains

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.990
and affect our bodies?

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.750
And we're going to talk
about tangible takeaways.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.490
So how we can actually
communicate to connect.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.990
So those are those
three components.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.070
And before we start, it's always
nice to actually establish,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.860
what is human connection?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.910
And my favorite definition
is this one by Brene Brown.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.000
"I define connection as energy
that exists between people when

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.940
they feel seen, and
heard, and valued;

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.910
and when they can give and
receive without judgment;

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.760
and when they derive
strength and sustenance

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.390
from the relationship."

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.350
A beautiful articulation
of that energy

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.650
that exists between two
people when we feel connected.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.070
And at Tribute, we've actually
broken that down even further.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.810
So we've created
a construct that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.300
can allow people to evaluate the
depth of their relationships,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.690
that which they have an
abundance of, that which

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.070
they're really seeking.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.990
And we call that AVS.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.030
So AVS is a mutual feeling
of A, appreciation,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.690
mutual recognition
of the other person.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.770
Do you see that person?

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.990
Do you appreciate who they are?

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.330
Needs to exist for
human connection.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.530
Second, vulnerability.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.720
Can I be honest
with this person?

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.630
Can I be truthful
with this person?

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.320
Can I be fully myself
with this person?

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.340
Vulnerability is the
bridge to connection.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.057
Next is support, and
support's a beautiful thing.

00:02:47.057 --> 00:02:49.140
And the way you think about
it in human connection

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.929
is a natural call to
support and be supported.

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:55.470
And so these are
the three components

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.550
that we can break down when
human connection truly exists.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.230
An easy way to evaluate
your friendships, as well as

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.280
those new relationships
that you're adding depth to.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.060
That's our definition
of human connection.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.910
So we all know that
human connection

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.630
is important to experience,
to have fun, to magnify joy.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.150
But I also want to introduce
you to why we should really

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.315
care about our social
ties, our relationships.

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:19.440
And to do that, I'm going
to introduce you to a guy

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.720
named Dr. Robert Waldinger.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.960
So Dr. Waldinger did the
longest study on happiness

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.150
in our history.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.200
It's a 75-year longitudinal
study of 750 people.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.102
When they released his research,
he gave this famous TED Talk.

00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:36.060
And also, as I was perusing
through the results

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.310
of that research,
there was one statement

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.200
that they literally
highlighted and bolded

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.000
to emphasize its importance.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.550
And that statement was this.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.650
"The clearest message
we got from this study

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.520
is that good relationships
keep us happier and healthier.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.170
Period.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.560
Good relationships keep
us happier and healthier.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.790
Period."

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.940
So from this research,
we can assume

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.274
that strong social ties,
investing in our relationships,

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:04.023
is probably the smartest
investment we can

00:04:04.023 --> 00:04:05.370
make in our overall happiness.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.394
But it goes beyond
just happiness.

00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:08.310
What about our health?

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.300
What about our brains?

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.340
What about our bodies?

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.500
So recent research
also shows, people

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.320
who have strong social
ties, the medical term

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.550
to connotate relationships,
have longer lives, stronger

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.640
immune systems, literally higher
levels of white blood cells

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.390
to fight off disease, lower
levels of stress and anxiety,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.640
and they're less likely
to dive into bad habits

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.610
like smoking or drinking.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.420
An alarming study I
recently ran into said this.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.470
Having weak social ties is
as harmful to ongoing health

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.410
as being an alcoholic and
twice as harmful as obesity."

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.990
So again, when we
have weak social ties,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.420
it's not just a detriment
to our happiness.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.290
It's a detriment to our health
and our mental well-being.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.166
So it's something that
we need to care about.

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:00.540
And so now I want to tell you
guys a little bit about how

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.250
I got into this
line of work, how

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.337
I was able to study
human connection,

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:06.420
start businesses that are
bolstering relationships

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.370
and gratitude in the
world, and started

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.170
when I was 10 years old.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.600
The first job I can remember
is selling these books

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.040
in a back of a room for my mom.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.840
My mom's an eight-time
published author.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.930
She talks about communication,
networking, articulating

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.650
the value of your ideas.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.530
So this thread of
communicating to connect

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.460
was something that was ingrained
in me at a very young age.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.580
And so one of the common
threads through my childhood

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.660
was sports.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.640
It was how I connected,
playing basketball, football,

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.770
and lacrosse.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.290
Right before I graduated,
I was enlightened

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.870
to the power of
adaptive athletics,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.000
helping young people
with disabilities

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.131
to unite with their
peers through sports.

00:05:44.131 --> 00:05:45.630
And that inspired
me to start dreams

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.120
for Kids DC, a community
that brought kids together

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.450
to play all these incredible
things you see up here.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.880
Water skiing, outdoor
adventures, hockey, lacrosse.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.499
Using sport as a facilitator
of human connection.

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:59.040
Then I got really
interested in tech,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.290
and I started to look at
bigger problems affecting

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.970
the people with disabilities
in their community.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.810
And so we built Ability
List, an online platform

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.460
that allows people
with disabilities

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.820
to share the resources they
know about and that they need.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.260
So again, building community
with an online platform.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.100
So this passion for
connection, this curiosity

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.190
about communication took a
step up to the next level

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.320
when I was 27 years old, and
it all started with a gift.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.890
So my fiance Miki is in the
back of the room right now,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.840
and on my 27th birthday,
she took me out

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.674
to dinner in Brooklyn
where we live.

00:06:35.674 --> 00:06:37.590
We come back to our
apartment, and I'll always

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.210
remember that I swing the
door open, thinking that we're

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.930
going to have a low-key night.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.110
Then there's a silence.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.892
And then three, two, one,
all these people jump out.

00:06:48.892 --> 00:06:50.850
She had planned this
incredible surprise party.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.933
So I'm hanging out with
all of our favorite people

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:53.680
in the apartment.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.180
Halfway through the party,
Miki jumps up on a chair

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.780
and she yells, (YELLING)
everyone in the living room!

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.460
So everyone runs
into the living room.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.260
She sits me right in
the back, and she had

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.240
rented this projection screen.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.250
So she puts it up on the wall.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.450
I have no idea what's going
on, and I would soon find out.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.130
So Miki had taken
the time to reach out

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.830
to 25 of my closest friends
and all my family members.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.580
She asked each one of them
to submit a one-minute video

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.120
telling me why they love me.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.551
Even telling you this, I get
goosebumps over my entire body.

00:07:26.551 --> 00:07:28.300
So as I sat there in
the back of the room,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.102
these videos started to stream.

00:07:30.102 --> 00:07:32.310
My best friend in New York
calling me his best friend

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.780
for the first time ever.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.580
My brother telling
me how grateful

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.770
he is that we're
finally friends again.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.480
My mom telling me how
proud of me she is.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.390
And that was about
the moment that--

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.230
what Alan Watts would call tears
of wonder joy started to flow.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.490
Not even a cute little cry, but
like a big, ugly, like, massive

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.900
drops coming down.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.280
One of those cries.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.380
And I did that for the
next 20 minutes straight.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.500
So I remember when it
stopped, the first thought

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.690
I had in my head was, wow.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.740
I just watched my
eulogy at 27, which

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.280
is a much better time to watch
your eulogy, in my opinion.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.197
So I needed a break, and I
walked over to the next room,

00:08:11.197 --> 00:08:12.780
and I just looked
at Miki, and I said,

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.220
that was the best gift
I've ever received.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.470
And I said, how did you do it?

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.261
And she just looks back
at me and she says,

00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:20.280
well, it was terrible.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.047
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:24.630
And so she says
again, it was hundreds

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.970
of emails to remind people
to submit their videos,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.880
collecting files through
Dropbox, drive, text message.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.720
And last but not least, editing
everything together in iMovie.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.270
So it took her about 15 hours.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.190
It was then and there, I had
this innate understanding

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.299
of the power of this gift.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.048
And I realized the
only reason more people

00:08:41.048 --> 00:08:44.610
didn't get it was because of
how difficult it was to create.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.730
So then and there,
Tribute was born.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.380
And so Tribute is
our website that

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.450
automates the
process of building

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.100
one of these gratitude-filled
video montages.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.220
It automates the process
of inviting your friends,

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.630
of collecting videos.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.240
And we built the first web-based
collaborative video editor

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.520
to easily put these
things together.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.990
And it started as
a simple mission

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.690
to share that joy, those
tears of wonder joy

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.130
that I felt in the back of
the room with the world.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.890
And the last two years
have been really fun.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.010
So over 50,000 tributes in 40
countries around the world.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.790
Yep, that's Regis, checking
us out on "The Today Show."

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.580
That was appearance number
two, which was very fun.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.310
But most importantly,
what we're most excited

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.680
about is that we feel
that we're deeply

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.592
ingrained in this digital
intimacy movement.

00:09:28.592 --> 00:09:30.300
It's that we are on
a mission to leverage

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.410
the power of video to spread
gratitude and human connection

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.450
in the world.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.530
It's, how can we
build technology

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.780
that adds significant
value to our users'

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.497
offline relationships?

00:09:43.497 --> 00:09:45.330
And we think that this
is not only something

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.580
that we are personally
passionate about, but something

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.310
that is incredibly
relevant right now.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.910
Because as a society,
we are more connected

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.680
than we have ever
been, and we are

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.810
quantifiably lonelier
than we have ever

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.880
been at the same time.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.090
In 1980, AARP ran a study
of their entire membership,

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.550
the Association for
Retired Persons.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.780
In 1980, the number of people
who identified as lonely

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.370
was 20%.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.110
That's a lot.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.690
They did that same
study in 2010,

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:18.710
and the number had
doubled to 40%.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.530
40% of their entire
membership identifying

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.080
as lonely, at the same time
when they were identifying

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.570
more connections and
more acquaintances

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.590
than they were in 1980.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.680
So next, an even
more alarming study

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.460
talking about in 1985, the
"American Sociological Review"

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.500
did a study.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.690
And what they found
was that in 1985,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.707
the average person
had three confidantes,

00:10:44.707 --> 00:10:46.790
three people that they
could confide in, that they

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.280
considered close friends.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.770
When they redid
that study in 2004,

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.150
that number dropped from a
three to one close confidant,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.090
to one close friend.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.330
And to put it in even
more perspective,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.390
of the people that
they surveyed, 25%

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.400
said that they didn't
have one person

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.470
that they could confide in.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.320
25% are saying that
they essentially

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.770
don't have one person they
consider a close friend,

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.300
and that matters.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.490
We just talked about what
happiness-- or excuse

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.620
me-- what relationships
do for our happiness, what

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.930
it does for our health.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.670
When people don't
feel they belong,

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.340
they'll do crazy
things to fit in.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.960
So this is a human
connection crisis.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.110
This is something that
matters, something that

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.570
deserves to be looked into.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.300
So what's the role
of technology?

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.999
Here at Google as an
entrepreneur, as a designer,

00:11:41.999 --> 00:11:43.790
how can we think about
tech's role in this?

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.950
And when we first started
seeing social media explode

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.270
onto the scene, there
were a lot of surveys

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.280
that correlated
loneliness and depression

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.756
with increased exposure
to social media networks.

00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:53.380
More research coming
out today actually

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.370
has conflicting reports,
whether it's actually

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.260
lonely people,
depressed people who

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.330
spend more time on social
media and on the internet.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.060
And so I want to
move beyond that,

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.450
and I want to focus on one thing
that the research does back up,

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.880
and that is that we get
out of the internet,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.767
we get out of social
media what we put into it.

00:12:12.767 --> 00:12:14.600
And the clearest example
I can leave for you

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.030
guys is that if you're on
Facebook, if you're browsing

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.490
your friends'
profiles passively,

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.280
if you're taking what we
call the one-click actions

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.710
attribute, if you're
just liking a photo,

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.470
if you're sending one on your
friend's birthday to trigger

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.760
that birthday message
that both of you know

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.450
took no thought, no
effort, you are not

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.969
adding to your social capital.

00:12:33.969 --> 00:12:35.510
You're going to
leave that experience

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.057
feeling more isolated.

00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:38.765
But if you're going
onto these platforms,

00:12:38.765 --> 00:12:42.510
if you are composing messages,
if you are being thoughtful,

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.330
sending authentic
birthday messages,

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.310
sharing the articles
that you're discovering,

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.770
then you are going to leave
those experiences more

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:49.760
connected.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.880
So at Tribute, what we think
about our design ethos is, what

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.910
are the human values of the
people that are using Tribute,

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.760
as opposed to the traditional
KPIs of a tech product

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.180
of virality, of interactions,
of growth, of revenue?

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.270
How do we quantify the
values of our users?

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.810
And that's why we
have metrics like TOJ,

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.450
which literally tracks
the number of recipients

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.450
who cried tears of joy.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.780
And guess what that
number is today?

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.650
80%.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:23.240
80% of those 50,000 reported the
recipient crying tears of joy,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.280
quantifying the
number of people who

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.740
said I love you in their
videos, quantifying

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.350
the percentage of people
who feel more connected

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.570
after giving their tribute.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.850
So we move from things
like more interaction to,

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.120
what is a meaningful interaction
quantified by our users?

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.900
Looking at ease and focusing
more on thoughtfulness.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.510
What is a thoughtful
interaction for our user?

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.940
And looking at more connections,
the number of invitees,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.310
the number of friends, and
actually understanding,

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.760
what does a deep
relationship look like?

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.590
And how can we move towards
those relationships?

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.240
And so if we
understand that we need

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.750
to help people make these
thoughtful, thoughtful

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.240
decisions for themselves,
that's the role of technology.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.060
That's what we can do to
help people as technologists,

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.100
as designers, as entrepreneurs.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.320
And so at Tribute,
we really believe

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.500
in the power of communication,
the power of communication

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.970
to help us connect.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.080
And like I promised in
the beginning of the talk,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.380
I really do want to
help you guys walk away

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.970
from today with
tangible techniques,

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.730
things that you can use
in everyday interactions

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.750
with friends, family, networking
events, everything you've got.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.520
So the first thing
we want to talk about

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.920
is sharing gratitude.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.320
Sharing gratitude may seem
like a simple thing in theory,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.660
but as we talked about
when we defined connection,

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.640
appreciation is that
first cornerstone

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.560
of meaningful connection,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.750
And appreciation is
powerful for a few reasons.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.050
Number one, it
allows the recipient

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.390
to see those qualities in
themselves that they sometimes

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.710
may deny.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.230
Second, it reinforces
those feelings

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.820
of appreciation and
gratitude that we

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.517
have for that other person.

00:14:59.517 --> 00:15:01.600
So it's literally like a
mini gratitude meditation

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.925
when you actually say and
articulate your gratitude

00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:05.050
out loud.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.030
And third and most
beautifully is

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.190
when we share a
compliment with someone--

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.020
and recent research
backs this up--

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.570
they're not only more likely
to reciprocate with us,

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.640
but they're more
likely to give someone

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.400
a compliment in your
local community.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.550
So it creates this beautiful
chain reaction of gratitude

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:25.744
every time we tell someone
why we appreciate them.

00:15:25.744 --> 00:15:27.160
And so now I want
to introduce you

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.490
to a few of our favorite
sharing gratitude techniques.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.640
And so the first
is not, I love you.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.235
The first is, I
love you, because.

00:15:37.235 --> 00:15:38.860
And one thing that
we should understand

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.240
is that it is not our
articulation or sentiment

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.850
of affection that
impacts the recipient.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.950
So when I walk out
the door, it's not,

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.720
I love you, Miki, that
truly impacts her.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.590
It's, I love you, Miki,
because you inspire me,

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.650
and you support me as
much as anyone I know.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.320
It's not saying, thank
you to your coworker.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.670
It's saying, thank you.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.410
I was going through
a really tough week,

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.990
and this really helped me out.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.680
It's when we go beyond that
simple sentiment of affection

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.640
that the recipient truly feels
the meaning, the intention

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.770
of what we want to express.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.370
It's that simple transition
of, I love you to, I

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.930
love you, because.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.850
Use that one word and
watch how it transforms

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.520
the way that you communicate.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.400
The next is the idea of
the power of the prompt.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.300
And I was just talking about
with Florian in the front row.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.860
And it's the idea that
sharing our gratitude

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.110
can sometimes bring on
a little bit of anxiety.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.610
We don't want to tell someone
how they've impacted our lives

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.780
or that we love them,
because we don't know

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.580
what they'll say back to us.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.350
We don't know if
they'll reciprocate.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.700
We don't know if we'll
make them uncomfortable.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.100
And when we don't
know those things,

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.490
oftentimes, we don't
push our boundaries.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.740
We just don't do it.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.150
And so oftentimes, we
need these prompts.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.160
We need to help
people by giving them

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.320
a question that helps
them to articulate

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.180
their appreciation for someone.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.480
So the way that we do this on
Tribute is every campaign we do

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.410
is based around
prompt questions.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.030
So it's not, what do
you love about Katya--

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.040
or sorry, it's not, send
Katya a birthday message.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.740
It is, what do you
love about Katya?

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.319
It is, what's your
favorite memory with Katya?

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.619
How has Katya
impacted your life?

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:27.010
So prompt questions allow
you to unify the conversation

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.569
for an individual.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:31.180
It automatically plants
an emotional sentiment

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.480
in someone's brain.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.000
So if you ask
someone a question,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.920
now they already
have this feeling,

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.980
as opposed to giving someone
an open slate and saying, film

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.820
a birthday video.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.680
Tell them you're
grateful for them.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.470
It's really when you provide
that context for creativity

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.975
that people are more comfortable
and compelled sharing.

00:17:47.975 --> 00:17:50.350
So the challenge here would
be, the next time that you're

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.200
at a birthday dinner, or the
next time someone is taking off

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.755
or they just landed
a huge project,

00:17:55.755 --> 00:17:58.600
be what we call a
conversation catalyst.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.520
Be the person who stops
the dinner and says, hey.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.860
We're all here for Heather.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.860
Let's go around the table
and everyone tell her,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.650
what's your favorite
thing about Heather?

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.890
Be a conversation
catalyst, and watch

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.720
how that unites your
group, your community,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.980
and how impactful that
will be on the person

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.866
that you focus on.

00:18:16.866 --> 00:18:17.740
Does that make sense?

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:22.990
Awesome.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.550
So the next one is
another simple one,

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.380
and it's the idea
of being nice first.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.380
It's that so often,
we wait for permission

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.800
to share that kindness that we
feel, the gratitude we feel,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.020
the thanks that we feel.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.940
And the way that I
want to kind of ground

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.250
this in your memory
banks is to think

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.320
about that saying that
we all heard a thousand

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.779
times growing up.

00:18:45.779 --> 00:18:47.320
So you tease a kid
on the playground.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.278
Your mom would see you.

00:18:48.278 --> 00:18:50.010
She'd come over to
you and she'd say,

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.188
if you don't have
anything nice to say--

00:18:53.188 --> 00:18:54.560
AUDIENCE: Don't say it at all.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.390
ANDREW HORN: Don't
say it at all.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.430
So watch this.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.610
If you look at those two
don'ts and you get rid of them,

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.190
you know what it becomes?

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:09.350
If you have anything
nice to say, say it all.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.870
It's this simple
idea that whenever

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.110
we have a kind
feeling, a compliment,

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.180
we feel thankful
for someone, there

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.870
is no good reason to ever
keep that inside of your head.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.320
Just think about any time you've
ever received a compliment

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.550
and said, gross.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.970
Never happened.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:33.670
So if you have anything
nice to say, say it all.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.592
So next, I want to move
into our second part

00:19:38.592 --> 00:19:40.800
of the communication
techniques, and that's something

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.239
that we call the art of
meaningful conversation.

00:19:44.239 --> 00:19:45.780
Before we move into
this, does anyone

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.840
have any questions about
that first element of sharing

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.974
gratitude, articulating our
gratitude, and appreciation?

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.259
We'll open up for questions
at the end as well.

00:19:57.259 --> 00:19:58.800
So the art of
meaningful conversation

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.860
is grounded in the idea
that human connection

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.080
starts with communication.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.630
So the art of
meaningful conversation

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.700
is about overcoming anxiety.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.560
It's about adding
value in conversation.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.690
It's about listening
attentively.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.070
It's about connecting
and feeling

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.180
confident in any
social interaction.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.590
And we can think about it
broken up this way, FAM.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.820
Finding your authentic voice,
asking better questions,

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:29.134
and the metamorphic two-step
to translate presence.

00:20:29.134 --> 00:20:30.550
So before we get
into that, I want

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.270
to address something that is the
biggest deterrent and barrier

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.250
to human connection
in my opinion,

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.700
and that is social
anxiety and shyness.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.090
And so again, I want to define
social anxiety in clear terms.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:48.120
Social anxiety can be defined as
the fear of negative judgment.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.631
So social anxiety is the
fear of negative judgment.

00:20:51.631 --> 00:20:53.380
And another thing that
I want to establish

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.880
is that recent research shows
that about 60% of all people

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.360
say that they are dealing with
some issues of social anxiety

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.500
or shyness.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.030
It is not rare.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.110
And when we were dealing with
social anxiety or shyness,

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.480
we have an aversion
to social interaction.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.879
It's going to keep
us from dating

00:21:11.879 --> 00:21:14.170
the people we want to date,
from meeting the friends we

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.711
want to be friends
with, from getting

00:21:15.711 --> 00:21:17.750
the job that we deserve.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.620
And so again, if social
anxiety is simply

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.324
the fear of being
negatively judged,

00:21:22.324 --> 00:21:23.740
some people leap
to the assumption

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.500
that we should just stop
caring what people think.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.870
But that is not the
path to connection.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.944
That is an easy path to
narcissism, and sometimes

00:21:32.944 --> 00:21:33.610
the White House.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.352
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.800
So we can start by finding
our authentic voice.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.520
And the authentic voice
is this deep understanding

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.950
of who we are, what we care
about, and what we want.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.930
And the reason this
is so important

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.930
is that if we don't
know who we are,

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.630
what we stand for,
we will constantly

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.590
revert to seeking
validation from others.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.340
It's that we will
need other people

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.520
to tell us what is
acceptable, what is cool,

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.775
as opposed to being driven
by our own intuition, morals,

00:22:10.775 --> 00:22:11.275
values.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:17.387
And there's a simple test that
you can use in any situation,

00:22:17.387 --> 00:22:18.970
whether you're in a
meeting at Google,

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.345
whether you're in a party,
whether you're at Thanksgiving

00:22:21.345 --> 00:22:22.730
dinner with your family.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:27.100
That simple test is
this one question.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.490
Am I doing this
because I want to be

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.430
or because I think
people will like it,

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.889
or think it looks cool?

00:22:35.889 --> 00:22:37.930
And the clearest example
I can give you of this--

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.300
and we've all been there, don't
even lie that you haven't--

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.180
is you're at a party.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.370
Your friends haven't showed up.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.995
And then you pull out your phone
and you're just looking at it,

00:22:44.995 --> 00:22:46.930
doing absolutely nothing.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.870
Like, everyone just smiled,
so we've been there.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.160
You don't want to just
do nothing on your phone.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.380
You're doing that
because you're worried

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.838
about the perception of other
people thinking you're weird,

00:22:55.838 --> 00:22:57.127
or whatever it might be.

00:22:57.127 --> 00:22:59.210
And the easiest construct
that you can think about

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:03.490
in these moments is, am I being
driven by internal motivation

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.130
or external motivation?

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:07.840
Internal versus external.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.200
Why am I doing what
I'm doing right now?

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.960
Always ask yourself and
remind yourself to revert back

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.535
to that internal motivation.

00:23:16.535 --> 00:23:17.410
And we can all start.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:18.850
Here's another challenge.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.910
How to find your
authentic voice starts

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.760
by articulating your
answers to these questions.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.640
And to many of them,
I hope that you do.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.860
You have a feeling, an
understanding of these.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.960
But when you actually take
the time to answer them,

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.290
to put the words that
these questions deserve,

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.600
you'll go into
social interactions

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.740
with more power, a higher
understanding of yourself,

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.950
and it will translate to
greater presence and greater

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:45.946
connection.

00:23:45.946 --> 00:23:47.320
And one of the
beautiful things I

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.236
think about when I look
at questions like this

00:23:49.236 --> 00:23:54.340
is that, the answers will
always change, and that's OK.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.870
That's a beautiful part of life.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.060
The questions will
remain the same,

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.150
but just the mere fact that
these answers will change

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.210
is not an excuse for
not having an answer.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.190
So meaningful conversation
starts with us,

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:10.330
and establishing that
understanding of self.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.770
So the second is to
ask better questions.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.240
And one thing that
we can establish

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.650
when we think
about asking better

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.290
questions as a path
to human connection

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.060
are these two things.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.850
It's that when we are asking
questions and listening

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:29.260
attentively, we will always
leave a good impression

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.820
on our counterpart.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.450
And beyond that, we will
always make them feel valued.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.700
So if we are asking
questions and listening,

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.790
you are always going to
leave a positive impression

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.040
on the person that
you're speaking with.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:46.030
On top of that, questions
are the most effective path

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.080
for learning and growth.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.780
If we are learning,
if we are growing,

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.170
there is always fulfillment
to be had there.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:56.740
And as our pal Gandhi
said, "When you talk,

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.560
you are merely
repeating what you know.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.814
When you listen, you may
learn something new."

00:25:03.814 --> 00:25:05.230
And again, I love
these constructs

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.750
that allow you to
evaluate how you're

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.470
being in any given moment.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.290
And another question
that you can think about.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.530
Whenever you go into
a meeting, before you

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:19.850
go to your next conference,
ask yourself this one question.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.260
What am I most excited to
learn about this person?

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:27.280
It's actually taking 60 seconds
before you hop on that call

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.790
and just identifying, what
am I most curious about?

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.890
When you establish a
foundation of curiosity

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:34.990
to take into any
social interaction,

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:39.070
you now have a virtuous path
through that entire interaction

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.170
because of those two things
we established before.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.450
Articulating our
curiosity will lead us

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.930
into virtuous connection
in every interaction.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.526
We can trust that.

00:25:47.526 --> 00:25:49.150
Here's another one
of those constructs,

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.694
the idea of being
interested over interesting.

00:25:52.694 --> 00:25:54.610
And it actually should
be an equal sign there.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.650
It should say that if
you are interested,

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.590
you are interesting, and
you will be received well

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:00.816
by other people.

00:26:00.816 --> 00:26:02.690
And again, this incredible
quote by Einstein.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.150
"I have no special talent.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.460
I'm only passionately curious."

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.010
And the idea of going through
life to understand people,

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.690
to understand the
world, in my opinion,

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.170
is just one of the best
ways to experience life,

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.620
and something we can
all aspire towards.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.750
And you can also help
yourself by giving

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:23.740
a foundation of questions
that I call your go-tos.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.180
Is that, give yourself a leg up.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.596
I've been talking about human
connection and relationships

00:26:27.596 --> 00:26:30.560
for so many years, but
at the end of the day,

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.247
I revert back to
the same questions,

00:26:32.247 --> 00:26:33.580
because there is a through line.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.460
There is a theme to what I want
to understand about the people

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.450
I meet.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.550
So if you think about
these questions,

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.230
you can trust
yourself to fall back

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.870
to these, these more virtuous
paths of communication

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.580
and conversation in
any given moment.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.830
So think about what yours are.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.630
Here's a few that
I've always loved.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.220
What are you most excited about?

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.750
What's most
challenging right now?

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.150
Because when we talk about
challenge and struggle,

00:26:55.150 --> 00:27:00.067
we open up an opportunity to
support and to be supported.

00:27:00.067 --> 00:27:01.400
What's your focus at the moment?

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.250
What's important right now?

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.360
What's the dream?

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.850
Identifying what people
really want to do.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.460
And do you guys want to talk
about your dreams or your day

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.260
job?

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.085
Well, you guys work at Google,
so it's probably very cool.

00:27:12.085 --> 00:27:14.530
But at the same time, talking
about our dreams, what

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:17.050
we really want is
where we can find

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.550
that energy, that
passion, the stuff

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:20.440
that we really
want to connect on.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.850
What do you care about?

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.040
That simple question
to get to what

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.470
is important to people,
which is an incredible thing

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.170
to understand and
get to know someone.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.000
So the next is probably
the simplest step

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.500
of all these things
that we're going

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.969
to talk about in the art
of meaningful conversation.

00:27:35.969 --> 00:27:38.260
And so the reason that we
need this is because presence

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.794
is tantamount if we want
to connect with people.

00:27:40.794 --> 00:27:42.460
If we have a negative
internal dialogue,

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.001
if we're thinking
about other things,

00:27:44.001 --> 00:27:45.760
if I'm not right
here to talk to you

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.680
and to look you in
the eyes, I'm not

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.690
fully capable of
articulating myself.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:51.740
I can't listen to you fully.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.530
And so presence is important.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:57.610
And another thing to identify
is that our brain's priority

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.780
is not to connect.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.267
Our brain's priority
is to keep us safe.

00:28:01.267 --> 00:28:03.850
And our brain is really good at
telling us all the things that

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.050
are going to go wrong.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.000
Our brain is really good at
taking us into the meeting

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.290
and telling us why
this person's not

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.502
going to invest in us,
about why this person's not

00:28:10.502 --> 00:28:11.210
going to like us.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.320
They're not going
to think I'm smart.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.903
They're not going
to think I'm pretty.

00:28:13.903 --> 00:28:15.260
Whatever it might be.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.890
And so we need to
remind our brain what

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.740
feeling good looks like.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:25.250
We need to remind our brain
what we want to happen.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:29.080
And so it's, again, this
simple two-step process

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.120
that I learned from
a hypnotherapist

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:31.840
in New York City.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.640
I remember, I
walked into a party.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.890
I met this guy.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.200
and I said, so what do you do?

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.360
And he's like, well,
I'm a hypnotherapist.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.890
And I stopped and
I said, I'm going

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.140
to corner you and ask
you a hundred questions.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.220
Are you OK with that?

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.810
And he was like, yes.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:45.580
And so the first
thing I asked is,

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.806
so what's the number one thing
that people try to get rid of?

00:28:48.806 --> 00:28:50.180
And what do you
guys think it is?

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.040
AUDIENCE: Smoking.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.360
ANDREW HORN: Smoking is
the one everyone says.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.380
That's what I said too.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.820
But it is not smoking.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.394
He said, self-doubt.

00:28:57.394 --> 00:28:58.810
Self-doubt is the
number one thing

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.299
that hypnotherapists
are asked to cure.

00:29:01.299 --> 00:29:03.340
And so then I went down
this line of questioning.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.930
I said, so if you
want to cure someone

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.740
of self-doubt, what do you do?

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.430
And he said that the
first step is articulating

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:11.200
the undesired state.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.740
So putting words to
this negative feeling,

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.910
because then it has
less control over us.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.910
So it's, again, before
you go into that meeting,

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:20.380
it's actually saying,
what's going to go wrong?

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.550
How do I not want to feel?

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.580
Those things that we
just talked about.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.750
They're not going
to think I'm smart.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.030
They're not going to think
I'm experienced enough.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.190
We're not going to connect.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.700
That's the undesired
state of being.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.020
And so this one little
question in step two

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.060
can change everything,
and will take you

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.890
15 seconds before you go into
any meaningful interaction.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.290
How do I want to feel?

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.150
How do I want to feel?

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.820
So before I step foot in this
room today, I ask myself,

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.990
how do I want to feel?

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.610
And I said, I want
to be passionate.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.230
I want to be myself.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.720
I want to feel loose.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.820
So happy, passionate,
loose, HPL.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.199
Now I have three things.

00:29:56.199 --> 00:29:58.240
And whenever I have any
sort of doubt or anything

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.800
that takes me out
of the moment, I

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.660
have these three
desired states of being

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.570
that I can tap into right now.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:08.350
I am here as Andrew, the
way that I want to be.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.000
I promise you that if
you just ground yourself

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.600
in the metamorphic two-step
before any important meeting,

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.060
it will transform your
ability to connect

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.320
in that conversation.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.630
Does that make sense?

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.000
How do I want to feel?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.770
Awesome.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:25.630
So we're about to close.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.200
And before we do
that, I want to invite

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.800
you guys into a quick
60-second gratitude meditation.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.260
So if you guys
will just sit back

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.165
in your chairs,
literally 60 seconds.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.690
And you can close your eyes,
you can open your eyes.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.610
Whatever you're most
comfortable with.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.640
So what I'd like you to
do is close your eyes,

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.050
if you'd like to.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.820
And on the count of
three, we're going

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.180
to take one big breath in.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.389
One, two, three.

00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:58.856
[INHALE]

00:30:59.834 --> 00:31:02.279
[EXHALE]

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.740
And now with your
eyes closed, just

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:10.030
feel the sensation of
your breath as it goes in,

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:13.030
as it goes out.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:15.520
And now I'd like you to
think about one person

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.550
that you're grateful for.

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:23.000
Who is one person that's
had an impact on your life?

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.770
Whether it's a mom,
a dad, a best friend,

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.390
a significant other.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:33.200
And just imagine that person
sitting right in front of you.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.750
They're just looking
right back at you.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:40.000
And now I want you guys to
remember, I love you, because.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.720
And I want you to articulate
why you're grateful for them.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.090
Why do you love them?

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:52.020
And sit with that for a moment.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.430
And on the count of three,
we're going to open our eyes.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.958
Three, two, one.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.630
And I want you to take a look at
what's on the screen right now.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:12.930
If you have anything
nice to say, say it all.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.691
There is no reason to
keep that kindness, that

00:32:15.691 --> 00:32:17.940
gratitude that you feel for
that person who's impacted

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.220
your life, in your head.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.530
It's that life is
an incredible gift,

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.920
and to experience it
with the people we love

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.780
is an even greater gift.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.790
So my last challenge
and invitation to you

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:33.270
guys today as we close out is
if you'd like to at some point

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.060
today, right after
this talk, is text

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:38.220
that gratitude to this person.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.380
See how it makes you feel.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.450
See how it makes them feel.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:46.200
And hopefully, you take this
into your life moving forward.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.546
Thank you so much, guys.

00:32:47.546 --> 00:32:52.306
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:55.162 --> 00:32:58.140
Oh, and we actually
have one final thing.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.650
So this is John, Tribute's
community manager in the back.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.260
And so in the vein of
Google and free stuff--

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:03.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.401
--we're going to
give you guys a gift

00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:08.420
card to create your first
Tribute on the house.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.712
So there's probably about 70
of you guys that are here.

00:33:10.712 --> 00:33:12.878
So I want to make sure that
you guys get to do this,

00:33:12.878 --> 00:33:15.500
whether it's for a birthday,
a wedding, a bar mitzvah,

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.100
anything special coming up.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.340
And for those of you that
are online watching this,

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.250
if you tweet out we
tribute and this talk,

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.560
we'll also reach out to
you with a free $19 gift

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.800
card to create your
first DIY tribute.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.990
Awesome.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.582
And if there's any
questions, I think

00:33:31.582 --> 00:33:33.290
I'll look at Katya to
see how we do that.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:36.500
But I'd love to field
any questions about kind

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.170
of our research in the field
or how we got Tribute started.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:40.450
Whatever's on your mind.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:41.240
KATYA: So here.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.573
There's a microphone right here.

00:33:45.484 --> 00:33:46.150
ANDREW HORN: Hi.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:46.920
AUDIENCE: Great talk.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.390
Thank Thank you.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:48.340
AUDIENCE: I love that.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.506
So before I came to Google,
I was a school counselor

00:33:50.506 --> 00:33:55.150
at a high school in the Bronx,
working with teenage girls.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.070
And a lot of what
you said kind of

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:00.520
makes me a little nervous
for the younger generations,

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.800
just because this
style of communication

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.880
now is all they know.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.790
And I think for a lot of
us in this room kind of

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.030
got the best of both worlds.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:12.040
So we have the ability to tap
into a lot of what you said.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.290
So I'm just curious if you've
thought at all about how

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.479
to reach a younger
audience, or how

00:34:16.479 --> 00:34:17.770
to kind of tackle those things.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.244
Because I found it really
hard for the girls to,

00:34:20.244 --> 00:34:24.610
A, be vulnerable, and that
whole, like, self-doubt thing.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.520
They had no confidence
in themselves.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.610
So I was just
curious, like your--

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.979
I don't know-- ideas on
targeting a younger audience.

00:34:30.979 --> 00:34:33.520
ANDREW HORN: Yeah, you know, so
Tribute's target demographics

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.290
and where we focus on
is on the 18 and above.

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.679
So where people kind of
have a little more emotional

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:41.270
intelligence and are capable
of articulating these things.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.710
So it's not where I've spent
most of my time at Tribute,

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.210
but it was where I spent a great
deal of my time with Dreams

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:48.159
For Kids.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.659
And I think that
what we always lead

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.600
with when it comes to kids,
again, are some of these values

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.300
that we talked about of leading
with kindness before we get

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.980
to the communication aspect.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.530
It's establishing that as
the foundation of interaction

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.180
between people of just
being able to ask yourself,

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.770
is this a kind thing?

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.850
And so I mean, when we
were at Dreams For Kids, we

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:10.390
had this thing that we embraced
at any one of our events,

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.420
because we were dealing with a
lot of kids with disabilities,

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:18.760
is if you're ever unsure,
the general consensus

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.770
was that you just
go over and you ask.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.840
And everyone just
seeks to understand.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.910
And it was basically
setting this baseline

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:28.266
of understanding between people
rather than making judgments,

00:35:28.266 --> 00:35:29.390
and all these other things.

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:31.960
So I think, again, you know,
I don't do a lot of work

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.930
directly with kids.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.350
But I think that establishing
that understanding

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.930
of seeking to understand
your counterpart

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:41.290
and asking questions will still
be a virtuous path, right?

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.571
I mean, when you think about
your time as a counselor,

00:35:43.571 --> 00:35:45.820
what were the biggest
challenges that young girls were

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.170
finding with being vulnerable?

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.370
Just that they were
being attacked,

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:50.020
or they weren't receiving
that back to them, or--

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:50.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.415
A little bit of everything.

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:53.470
I think part of it was
too, like, they couldn't

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.830
find an authentic voice,
because everything

00:35:56.830 --> 00:36:01.500
was done for a like on
Instagram or for a retweet,

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.759
or whatever it was.

00:36:02.759 --> 00:36:05.050
And they would give each
other compliments on Instagram

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.720
just to get it back so
that they could look at it

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.729
and say, I have 500 comments
of how great I look, you know?

00:36:10.729 --> 00:36:12.520
ANDREW HORN: So I'm so
happy you said that,

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.645
because it really did just
trigger something in me.

00:36:14.645 --> 00:36:17.724
And you know, my reality is
that I wasn't a great student

00:36:17.724 --> 00:36:19.390
throughout high school
and even college.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:21.640
It's kind of like, I went
through and I got grades,

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.360
but I was never fully
present there or valued it.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.150
And no kind of
guidance, no speakers,

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.400
no counselors ever
connected with me

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.940
and gave me insight or advice
about how to evaluate the world

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.650
or how I wanted to live my
life that really connected.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.140
And so when we
talk about starting

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.720
with the art of meaningful
conversation and questions,

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.300
I think that, again, is
the best place to start.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.430
Because if you
empower young people

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.640
at a young age with a
foundational sense of self--

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.395
who they are, what's
important to them--

00:36:50.395 --> 00:36:52.270
I think that that's the
most important thing.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:55.270
And again, you can give
that to a younger person

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.310
and say, here are
some of the questions

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:58.992
that you can explore
for yourself.

00:36:58.992 --> 00:37:00.700
And when you can relay
that directly back

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.520
to social anxiety and shyness
and some of those things

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.490
that are much more prevalent
in high school and college,

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.740
then what happens is that
you give people a foundation

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.550
to say, before you can feel
confident in these situations,

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:15.310
like, the most important
thing is truly understanding,

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.274
trusting, and loving yourself.

00:37:17.274 --> 00:37:18.940
And so we can give
that to young people.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.770
I think that that's always
where I would start,

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:22.186
is not telling one
to do anything,

00:37:22.186 --> 00:37:24.790
but providing them with the
construct to actually perform

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.070
that kind of
introspection that leads

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.840
to virtuous
interactions, connection,

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.020
connecting with the type
of people that we need to.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:31.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.350
It's like almost
trying to get it

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.840
proactive rather than reactive,
because that was like--

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.550
we were trying to put out
fires almost, you know?

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.209
And it was hard to
do at that point.

00:37:39.209 --> 00:37:40.750
ANDREW HORN: Yeah,
my mom always says

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:46.390
that the wisest teachers are
the greatest question askers.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:48.010
And so that's what
I would emphasize.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:48.550
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:49.000
Thank you.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.250
ANDREW HORN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:56.232 --> 00:37:58.190
AUDIENCE: This is a really
welcome interruption

00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.690
in the day.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:37:59.280
[LAUGH]

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.160
I imagine the
people in this room

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.470
are a fairly self-selecting
group, as far

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:06.980
as being concerned about
these kinds of issues.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.490
Can you talk about times where,
especially somebody who's

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:12.740
used to being called intense
in the first meetings

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.954
now for a lot of the reasons
you've discussed, how do you

00:38:15.954 --> 00:38:17.870
navigate this when you're
meeting somebody who

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.169
is unwilling to meet
you at that level,

00:38:20.169 --> 00:38:22.460
and who is uncomfortable with
these kinds of questions,

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:26.090
or thinks that this is
extremely unnatural?

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:26.840
ANDREW HORN: Yeah.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.059
Absolutely.

00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:30.350
Do you want to-- are you
speaking in a business context

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.209
or social?

00:38:31.209 --> 00:38:32.750
AUDIENCE: I think
it applies to both.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.960
So I'd be curious--

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.210
ANDREW HORN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:36.602
So let's start with social.

00:38:36.602 --> 00:38:38.060
And this is something
that I've had

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.700
to come to grips with
as well, is again,

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.824
dealing with my own
anxieties and shyness

00:38:42.824 --> 00:38:44.240
with social
interaction, and how I

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.230
wanted to show up in the world.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.770
One thing that I've become
very clear on later in life

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:51.830
is that it is not
our responsibility

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.290
to make people feel comfortable.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:57.749
It is our responsibility
to be honest to ourselves.

00:38:57.749 --> 00:38:59.540
And this is within the
construct of, again,

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.180
leading with kindness, is
that we cannot harm people,

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.560
so we need to lead
with kindness.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.056
But that ultimately, it
is not our responsibility

00:39:06.056 --> 00:39:07.180
to make people comfortable.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.560
It is our responsibility to
be honest with ourselves.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.980
And if we're accepting of
some of these principles

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.220
about asking questions
and knowing who we are

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:20.450
and being fully present,
I think that sometimes you

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:22.460
are going to
interact with people

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.040
who don't connect with you,
who are not on your frequency.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.790
And I think that knowing that
you've showed up in integrity

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:32.510
in those moments as yourself
allows you to not get

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:35.110
hung up on them, allows
you to move forward.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.610
And the reality is that
you only have limited time

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:39.920
on this Earth, and
so those people who

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.749
aren't able to meet
you where you're at

00:39:42.749 --> 00:39:44.540
are oftentimes not
those people that you're

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.456
going to connect with.

00:39:45.456 --> 00:39:49.310
You know, I'd say that, again,
in the professional context,

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:53.300
seeking to understand people
is this virtuous path where

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.940
if people aren't going to
meet you all the way at what's

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.550
your dream, and you're
meeting them at--

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.650
whether it's like Penn
Station or whatever it is--

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.570
I think that there's
a way that you can

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.980
start earlier on to get there.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.760
And so again, I think that just
because someone can't meet you

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.719
there, like, if you were
to break down again--

00:40:09.719 --> 00:40:12.260
and you talked about, when we
were chatting right here, like,

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.610
your perception of
people right off the bat.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:18.470
And I love the idea that
your first question is not

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:19.970
your real question.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.130
It's that for a lot
of people, like, they

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.266
won't be able to go
there right off the bat.

00:40:24.266 --> 00:40:25.640
So what is another
question right

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.890
after that that you can go into?

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:30.380
And again, just allowing
yourself to lead with curiosity

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.213
and what you want to
know about that person.

00:40:32.213 --> 00:40:34.910
So if they're not willing
to talk about their dreams

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:39.020
or what they care about, what
do you want to know about them,

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.150
and why they're not
willing to go there?

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:43.280
It's, again, just giving
yourself to that process

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.904
and seeing where that
takes you I think

00:40:44.904 --> 00:40:47.555
is always going to
be a virtuous path.

00:40:47.555 --> 00:40:48.430
Does that make sense?

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.545
AUDIENCE: Yeah Thank you.

00:40:49.545 --> 00:40:50.295
ANDREW HORN: Cool.

00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:59.748
Yeah?

00:40:59.748 --> 00:41:04.400
AUDIENCE: So just touching again
on the subject of, you know,

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.520
younger people,
children, you know,

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.674
as a relatively new father--

00:41:08.674 --> 00:41:09.590
ANDREW HORN: Congrats.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:12.220
AUDIENCE: --and, you know,
speaking from my own experience

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.850
on Facebook, it's
been my feeling

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:19.750
pretty early on that
a lot of people I know

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:24.220
have exchanged a few
meaningful relationships

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.580
with a lot of meaningless
ones, and a lot of really

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.300
shallow ones.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.790
They've really kind of
replaced depth with breadth,

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.700
and we're not talking
to each other anymore.

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.110
We're broadcasting.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:35.610
Right?

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:38.350
And we're advertising,
so to speak.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.154
At least some of us do.

00:41:40.154 --> 00:41:42.070
And it's certainly the
experience on Facebook,

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:45.450
you know, browsing
Facebook, it's

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:49.430
an inescapable
experience of comparison.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.370
And since you
quoted Brene Brown,

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:52.630
I'm sure you know her works.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:57.520
And you know, comparison is
the pathway to feeling less,

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.500
to feeling ashamed.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.630
And I feel that I myself, you
know, I'm fairly immune to it.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:06.430
Not completely.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:10.390
At least, I'm smart enough
to avoid exposing myself

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:11.500
to too much of that.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.550
Are there tangible
things that we

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:23.260
can do to help children
develop that immunity

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.470
to the inescapable
world around us

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:29.530
where there'll be a lot of
people that are shallow,

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:31.450
there'll be a lot
of people that will

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:35.710
judge them using meaningless
tools like likes, et cetera?

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:40.030
And you know, obviously,
developing self-worth,

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.760
developing integrity,
these are principles

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.840
I can easily agree with.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:48.200
But are there good tricks to
do that I guess is my question.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.200
ANDREW HORN: Absolutely.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.107
Well, I'll expand on
the comparison theme,

00:42:52.107 --> 00:42:54.190
and then get right back
into how we can apply this

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:56.890
to young people and their
browsing and social media

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.300
habits.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.780
One of my favorite
concepts with comparison

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:05.680
is the idea that comparison
is the thief of joy.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.050
And I just notice this
in any given moment where

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:12.190
I find myself comparing
to a competitor,

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.530
to someone else who's
finding success.

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.050
And in those moments
where you feel

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:22.464
jealousy or angst, whatever it
might be when you're comparing,

00:43:22.464 --> 00:43:24.880
my first thought there, and
what I've trained myself to do

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.870
is to realize that that
comparison and that malice,

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:31.580
or whatever it might
be, is nothing--

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.340
it has nothing to
do with that person.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.280
It's purely internal, and it
says something about myself.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.170
And so I think about
the transformation

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:42.940
of comparing to celebrating,
which is what we want to do.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:47.380
Is that if we cannot celebrate
the successes of other people,

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:52.720
it only says something about
us and our own insecurities.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.590
So it's that shift from
comparing to celebrating.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:58.060
And if we cannot celebrate,
we can acknowledge that

00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.710
it's because of our
own insecurities,

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:03.310
and something to be worked
on, because no one is perfect.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:05.560
And as it relates
to young people,

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.630
I think, again,
rather than telling

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:10.990
them what to do, the
best thing that we

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:13.330
can do with young
people is to ask them

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.220
why they are doing
things, and to help them

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.500
come to their own realizations.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.582
And again, how we do that
is with good questions.

00:44:19.582 --> 00:44:21.040
And I'll revert
back to one that we

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.930
talked about earlier,
which is, if you

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:25.270
have a young person who's
posting on Instagram

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:28.420
or is typing these types of
comments, to simply ask them,

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.479
like, why are you doing that?

00:44:30.479 --> 00:44:32.770
And to see what kind of answer
that they actually have,

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:34.930
to actually help them
identify those motivations

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:38.200
for themselves, to see if
it's something that they like.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.780
And again, we all remember
our younger years,

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.190
and it's like, we are
hardwired to rebel.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.040
And so when someone
is telling us

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.961
that this is the
way to do something,

00:44:46.961 --> 00:44:49.210
we're going to be very
resistant for anyone to tell us

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.310
what to do when we're still
formulating our own identity.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.340
But when we can give
people a construct

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.560
to do that meaningful
introspection for themself,

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.780
I think that is probably
the most effective path

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.670
to help them evaluate
those things.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.290
So again, it's
just understanding

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:04.810
why they're doing these
things, and hopefully

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.300
encouraging designers
and people at Google

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.670
to be thoughtful about how
we are designing products

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:11.890
and what we're
defining as success.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:12.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.090
ANDREW HORN: Yeah.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:13.955
Absolutely.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.810
Anyone else?

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:23.730
One more.

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:24.794
Or a few more.

00:45:24.794 --> 00:45:26.544
AUDIENCE: This is
actually not a question.

00:45:26.544 --> 00:45:27.578
He may have a question.

00:45:27.578 --> 00:45:28.042
These are great.

00:45:28.042 --> 00:45:29.440
Is there any way
you can share these?

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.460
ANDREW HORN: Yeah, man.

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.410
If you email
john@tribute.co, he'll

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:34.620
be sure to send these out.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.680
Thanks, man.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.180
Hi.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.760
AUDIENCE: I'm a huge
fan of Dr. Brene Brown,

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.140
so you had me at Brene Brown.

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.430
[LAUGH]

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:45.470
So I wanted to just ask if
you had any statistics on--

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:47.520
because she talks a
little bit about this

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.820
in several of her books, but on
how the expression of gratitude

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.150
is what actually gives you joy.

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.560
So do you have any--

00:45:55.560 --> 00:46:00.030
is your company doing any type
of, like, studies on people

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.150
that actually participate in
this and their levels of joy

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:06.327
going up as a result of the
expression of gratitude?

00:46:06.327 --> 00:46:08.160
I would just be interested
to see that data.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:08.910
ANDREW HORN: Yeah.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:12.660
You know, so we partnered with
a nonprofit called the Grateful

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.322
Network.

00:46:13.322 --> 00:46:15.780
And so again, they're doing a
lot of leading-edge research,

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.020
along with the Greater Good
Science Center, which is

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.675
a unit outside of UC Berkeley.

00:46:20.675 --> 00:46:22.800
And they're doing some of
the leading-edge research

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.660
about the practice of
gratitude, and what

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.950
it's doing on the mind.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.930
And so we have our
internal metrics

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:30.900
that we talked about in
terms of actually quantifying

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.790
expressions of love
within these videos,

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.600
of actually quantifying this
act of sharing gratitude,

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.100
how that improves
your connectivity

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.332
with your community.

00:46:39.332 --> 00:46:41.290
And so right now, again,
of these 50,000 people

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:43.110
who've done it, right
now you're looking

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:45.969
at 99% of people who say
that the act of sharing

00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:47.760
this gratitude for
someone they cared about

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.801
made them feel more
connected to their community,

00:46:49.801 --> 00:46:52.835
and tears of joy are
now called wonder joy.

00:46:52.835 --> 00:46:53.970
So I can provide that.

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:56.942
But I'd say that those are
probably two of the networks

00:46:56.942 --> 00:46:58.650
that I'd check out
with more of that kind

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:00.070
of leading-edge research.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.070
So something that we're
kind of piggybacking off

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:04.084
of them to apply that
into our kind of like--

00:47:04.084 --> 00:47:05.500
in our design and
our development.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.250
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:06.810
Thank you.

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:09.070
ANDREW HORN: Thanks so much.

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:11.070
So if you have anything
nice to say, say it all.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:12.060
One of my favorite
things as well

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.360
is when I'm giving a talk and
someone's just, like, nodding.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.030
Because, like, yeah.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.510
She gets it.

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.490
You were nodding the whole time,
and it's such a great thing

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:18.080
to see that.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.240
So thank you for that.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:19.740
Yeah.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.050
That was awesome.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:25.228
So who are you guys going
to give your tribute to?

00:47:25.228 --> 00:47:26.534
Yes?

00:47:26.534 --> 00:47:27.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:28.533
ANDREW HORN: There you go.

00:47:28.533 --> 00:47:29.506
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:30.149 --> 00:47:31.690
So that's my fiance
Miki, by the way,

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:33.940
in the back of the room, who
gave me the first tribute

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.334
and inspired it all.

00:47:35.334 --> 00:47:36.750
And now she's six
months pregnant.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:38.506
We just got back from
the doctor today.

00:47:38.506 --> 00:47:40.936
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:40.936 --> 00:47:42.394
[LAUGH]

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:44.673
She's got a few now too.

00:47:44.673 --> 00:47:46.032
[LAUGH]

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.940
And obviously, I made
her my wife, so it works.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:51.752 --> 00:47:54.020
AUDIENCE: Has anyone ever
proposed in their tribute?

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.600
ANDREW HORN: We actually
just had a beautiful one.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.152
We had a woman who
proposed to her girlfriend.

00:47:59.152 --> 00:48:00.360
How long was the video, John?

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.734
JOHN: About an hour long.

00:48:01.734 --> 00:48:02.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:03.080
ANDREW HORN: Yeah.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.400
An hour long.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.530
And you know, just like
some of the stories, again,

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:07.690
it's like, I get goosebumps
thinking about it.

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:09.639
So like this past
week alone, we had

00:48:09.639 --> 00:48:11.180
this woman who had
an hour-long video

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.560
to propose to her girlfriend.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.810
We had another woman who
just submitted a testimonial,

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.360
and she was crying in
her testimonial video.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.130
And she said, you
know, I gave this

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:21.300
to my best friend of 55 years.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.680
She was diagnosed with
lung cancer five years ago,

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.610
and she didn't make it.

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:30.170
And I did this video so
that her granddaughters

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:31.580
would know who she was.

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.400
And the tribute ended up
being an hour and a half.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:39.080
And it's, again, it's
giving this gift of legacy

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.870
and gratitude, and reminding
people who someone was.

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:43.670
So if there's
anyone in your lives

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:46.040
who's really had an
impact, we'd love

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.400
to see you guys on the site.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.050
ANDREW HORN: Yeah.

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:54.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:55.883
ANDREW HORN: Thanks, guys.

00:48:55.883 --> 00:48:59.350
