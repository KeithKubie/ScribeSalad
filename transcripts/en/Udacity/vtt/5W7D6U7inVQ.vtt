00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Excellent work! You've just completed your first tough question

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
on filling out the charts for parsing.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Because parsing is everywhere in the computing world--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
from HTML to E-mail,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to languages like JavaScript or Python

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or C and C++--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
this notion of memoizing--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
writing down intermediate results so that we can refer to them--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is critical to performance; and because parsing happens all the time,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
this performance really matters.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now these are some of the first questions

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to really stretch our ability to do abstract reasoning,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so don't worry if it's taken you a few more trials on these exercises

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
than it may have in the past.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
On the other hand, we should definitely be excited

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
about the goal that we're working towards.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Very soon, we're going to have a complete parser

00:00:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
for HTML and JavaScript.
