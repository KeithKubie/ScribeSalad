[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.640
SPEAKER: Right,
well, good afternoon.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.920
And welcome to a very
special Talks at Google.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.400
I am delighted to have the three
principals from "Wicked" here.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.364
We've got Sophie Evans,
who plays Glinda.

00:00:20.364 --> 00:00:21.280
Give it up for Sophie.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.600
Sophie's mom is also here today.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.708
So we're very glad that
everyone can see her.

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:29.458
SOPHIE EVANS: Yay!

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:31.880
Thank you, Mummy.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.992
SPEAKER: Alice Fearn,
who plays Elphaba.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:37.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.210
It was Alice's
birthday yesterday,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.350
so we can maybe sing
"Happy Birthday" later.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.370
And we've got Bradley
Jaden, who plays Fiyero.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.590
I don't have a fun
fact about you Bradley.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.914
So maybe you can fill one in.

00:00:49.914 --> 00:00:51.080
BRADLEY JADEN: Oh, fun fact?

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.254
SPEAKER: Fun fact, exactly.

00:00:52.254 --> 00:00:53.170
Right from the get go.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.670
AUDIENCE: I've got
really long hair.

00:00:57.052 --> 00:00:57.760
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.870
So the way that today's
event is going to work

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.697
is we've got 45
minutes with the cast.

00:01:02.697 --> 00:01:04.280
We'll open it up to
questions halfway.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.350
As Rob said, there's a
microphone in the middle.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.790
So please get ready to
go with your questions.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.600
I'll let you know when it's
time to start moving there.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.460
And then afterwards, there's
the opportunity for some photos.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.070
We've got props at the back,
which I think most of you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.460
have already seen.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.007
I'm really excited about today.

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:22.340
So I'm going to start with a
quick overview of, I guess,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.690
"The Wizard of Oz" universe.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.410
In 1900, Frank
Baum writes a book.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.570
In 1939, we've got
the famous film

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.510
with Dorothy and Toto and
her ruby red slippers.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.380
And then we flip to the
witch's perspective in 1995,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.010
with the novel "Wicked, The Life
and Times of the Wicked Witch

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.280
of the West," which turns into
the musical that you all know

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.560
and love, "Wicked, The Untold
Stories of the Witches of Oz "

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.680
So first of all, these are
some iconic characters.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.530
And they have been
originated by legends--

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.810
Idina Menzel, Kristin Chenoweth,
who was in London recently.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.920
And I'd love to hear
about what that was like.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.899
But how do you work within the
existing "Wicked" universe?

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:02.690
How do you do this?

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.670
How do you take these characters
and really make them your own?

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.340
ALICE FEARN: I think it's--

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.370
I think for me, anyway, it's
quite simply just whenever

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.970
I have ever played something
that is iconic or has been

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.070
played before by
other people, I think

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.310
you just go back to the
book, the story, what

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.600
was originally written.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.240
And I think you,
from there, find

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.880
your version of
that person and why

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.330
she reacts or he reacts
in whatever ways you--

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.870
from what you read and what
you learn from that person.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.660
So, I think then,
you're not controlled

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.780
by people that have
done it before,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.070
or the way that
they've played it.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.990
And in fact, what
you do is create

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.640
your own version of of them.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.050
And I think then,
they become very true.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.160
I think they're very real.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.510
People can relate to
that person quite well.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.905
So, I think as long
as you go back--

00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:56.030
just go back to the script
and go back to the words

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.113
and what was written
originally, and I don't think

00:02:58.113 --> 00:02:59.229
you can go that far wrong.

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:00.020
SPEAKER: I love it.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.050
With Kristin in the
audience last week--

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.035
SOPHIE EVANS: Yes.

00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:04.380
That was crazy.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.990
Because, as a teenager,
she was the lady

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.480
that I listened to
singing popular.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.622
And I wanted to be
exactly like her.

00:03:13.622 --> 00:03:15.080
And with her being
in the audience,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.481
I probably did put a few Kristin
Chenoweth accents on everything

00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:20.730
because I just think the way
she did it was fantastic.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.590
But yeah, like Alice said,
it's keeping everything

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.090
that was there originally, but
bringing yourself to the role

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.590
as well.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.654
Because you don't want to see
a carbon copy every single time

00:03:29.654 --> 00:03:30.570
you go and see a show.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.230
It's nice to see someone's
personality injected

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.275
into the character.

00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:35.900
SPEAKER: So what do
you think you bring

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.669
that's unique to the role?

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:38.960
SOPHIE EVANS: I think I bring--

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.800
I try to be really truthful.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.120
I'm very clumsy in
life in general.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.955
So I bring that kind
of ditziness to it

00:03:45.955 --> 00:03:47.530
quite naturally.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.950
SPEAKER: Is that true, Mum?

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:49.505
Yes, OK.

00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:50.456
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:50.456 --> 00:03:51.830
SOPHIE EVANS: I'm
a baby giraffe.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.300
I fall over all the time.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.700
So that's great.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.816
But yeah, keeping the truth
of Glinda, and everything is--

00:03:58.816 --> 00:04:01.190
it comes from a good place
even though something she says

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.357
might come across as a
little bit catty or not quite

00:04:04.357 --> 00:04:04.940
what it seems.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.437
But it does always come
from a truthful, good place.

00:04:07.437 --> 00:04:08.145
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:10.959
And Bradley, you've worked
not only here in London,

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.500
but you've actually
been part of some

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.680
of the international casts.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.662
So how do you, I guess,
bring your truth to the role?

00:04:17.662 --> 00:04:19.370
BRADLEY JADEN: I think,
like Alice said--

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.190
she answered it really well.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.380
I don't think
trying to replicate

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.440
anyone else is going to do
yourself justice or the piece.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.020
And we're very thankful
that we are working

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.691
with such an incredible piece,
both with lyrics and dialogue,

00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:37.190
every night.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.130
So as long as we are telling
the story in our own way,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.710
and telling it as truthfully
as we possibly can,

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.960
then the job's pretty
much halfway there.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.620
Of course, we have our
own little touches.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.230
Me having long hair, I don't
think that's happened before.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.034
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:54.034 --> 00:04:55.700
ALICE FEARN: "Toss
Toss" gets an extra--

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.200
BRADLEY JADEN: Yeah,
the "Toss Toss"

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.420
is slightly different now.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.764
But yeah, it's about
having fun and making

00:05:00.764 --> 00:05:02.930
sure you're telling the
story and telling the truth.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.271
And I think as long as you
do do that, the audience are

00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:07.520
going to follow you hopefully.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.029
So--

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:10.570
SPEAKER: I love that
all three of you

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.361
have touched on this
idea of truthfulness,

00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:14.360
right, and being true to
yourself, but also true

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.010
to these characters.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.250
I think they're tremendously
nuanced characters, all of whom

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.760
transform in a number of ways,
probably none more notable

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.830
than your
transformation, Bradley.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.364
You go from perhaps a bit vain
and perhaps a bit unconcerned

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:31.030
about anything--

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.980
I think even Glinda, she may
be a bit vain, but scatty.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.340
But she already has this
heart, whereas you start

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.750
in a very different place.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.030
How do you manage
that transition?

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.560
BRADLEY JADEN:
Well, this is funny

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.224
because I don't see
Fiyero as arrogant.

00:05:46.224 --> 00:05:48.140
I think that he has his
own brand of cavalier,

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.930
and he has his kind of--

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.110
he has his own ways.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.690
But he's so different
from all the rest

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.360
of the other people in Shiz.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.550
But how do we know that
he's not the same as where

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.220
he is as other people
from where he comes from?

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.030
In Winky Land?

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.030
And they're all kind of
that place in their life.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.580
And he's just coming, and
he's just like, hey, this

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.150
is how I am.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.080
And I'm just quite
relaxed and chilled.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.930
And all these other
people kind of

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.570
go, wow, this is so different.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.360
And like you said, he
goes on a massive journey.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.860
And he turns up, and he's
never met women as powerful

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.520
as these two.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.100
And I think he learns
so much about himself

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.710
throughout the show.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.400
And I think that's
so exciting that he's

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.440
challenged by these
powerful women,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.030
and he's taken on
a journey that he

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.150
can find the truth in himself.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.620
I think he's, in a way,
learned and grown up

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.750
to be a certain way through--

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.770
I don't know-- peer pressure
or the way the society is,

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.330
that to meet these women
that can change his life

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.050
and allow him to be that honest
and that truthful to himself,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.160
that's exciting.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.580
And I think that's the way
I kind of want it to play,

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.210
that the audience
can kind of say that,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:09.380
oh, yeah, you're not afraid
to be open with your emotions,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.389
and to go as far as you can, and
wear your heart on your sleeve.

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:14.180
SPEAKER: I love it.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.319
And I think perhaps I've made
some unfair assumptions here.

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:18.735
BRADLEY JADEN: No,
no, not at all.

00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:21.230
Of course, I think
everyone does always

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.360
say he's arrogant
because he does turn up,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.010
and he has that song and he
gets everyone to dance his way.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.630
But I think he's just carefree.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.060
I think he's just
out having a laugh.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.306
And he doesn't want--

00:07:33.306 --> 00:07:35.180
he's not telling people,
you have to do this.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.250
There's no time he ever
says you have to do it.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.530
He's just saying,
let's just give it--

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.310
just give it a go.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.018
SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:07:41.018 --> 00:07:43.760
And I think there's a real-- so
I just made this mistake now.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.260
I've made some assumptions
about the character.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.110
And I think one of
the perhaps most

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.120
interesting things
about "Wicked"

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.300
is the fact that we go to
this world, we go to Oz,

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.130
and we're making all
kinds of assumptions.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.290
And the opening number,
we're making assumptions

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.032
about Glinda and the good
witch, and Elphie, who's

00:08:00.032 --> 00:08:01.240
the Wicked Witch of the West.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.262
And what does this
mean, without actually

00:08:03.262 --> 00:08:04.220
knowing the background.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.386
ALICE FEARN: Well that's it.

00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:07.750
That's the whole show is
that from that instant,

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.630
if you've made an assumption
that Elphaba is a wicked witch.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.910
And that's the whole point
of the story is to say,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:19.280
your assumptions were
completely wrong and fueled

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.570
by gossip and propaganda.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.460
So yeah, that's
the entire thing is

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.972
that you do assume that
Fiyero is maybe vain,

00:08:27.972 --> 00:08:29.430
or you do assume
that she's wicked.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.939
And you assume all those things.

00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:32.480
And actually, that's
the whole point.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.515
By the end of it, you go, wow,
I think I was completely wrong.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:36.890
BRADLEY JADEN:
And that's why I--

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.348
sorry, I'll go back because I
get excited by this question.

00:08:39.348 --> 00:08:42.289
When you are presumed something,
it's the same as the poster.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.330
When you look at the
poster, in this day and age,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:44.930
you see "Wicked."

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:45.860
And you see the green witch.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.026
And you see the white witch.

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.276
But not one part
of it does it say,

00:08:49.276 --> 00:08:50.400
the good and the bad witch.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.660
Do you know?

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.201
I mean, you could
actually say, well,

00:08:52.201 --> 00:08:53.930
why is the white
witch whispering?

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:54.830
That's a bad trait.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.830
Do you know what I mean?

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.220
The green witch--
why is the green bad,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.060
when in certain countries,
green is a lucky color?

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.500
Why is wicked bad?

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.910
When in this day and age,
people wake up and you go,

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.660
ah, that's wicked.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.540
That's cool.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.860
So there's so many different--
do you know what I mean?

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.490
Like, there's so
many different things

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.590
that you look at
that poster and go,

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.600
why, in this part
of our life, do we

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.410
see that as a negative, as that
green person is the negative?

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.600
And that's what is so
exciting about "Wicked,"

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.360
that by the end of it,
you have completely

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.467
changed all your expectations.

00:09:25.467 --> 00:09:26.300
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.771
And in some of the
posters, you can also--

00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:31.020
the white witch is not
entirely visible either, right?

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.600
So you've got this
really interesting moment

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.510
where you think, well,
what is going on?

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:34.790
BRADLEY JADEN: Yeah.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.360
SPEAKER: We don't know.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.984
SOPHIE EVANS: No idea
what is going on.

00:09:36.984 --> 00:09:37.930
SPEAKER: And so--

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.830
ALICE FEARN: I think,
why are you whispering?

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:40.670
A good question for me.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.210
BRADLEY JADEN: How do
you feel about that?

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.410
ALICE FEARN: What
are you whispering?

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.951
SPEAKER: So I would love to know
the answer to that question.

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:47.480
So I feel like if there are
any two people in the world who

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.720
can answer that question,
they're right here on stage.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.939
SOPHIE EVANS: I'm hungry.

00:09:52.939 --> 00:09:54.980
ALICE FEARN: Which is what
we are at this moment.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.200
I'm absolutely starving
after that three hours.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.076
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:59.076 --> 00:10:01.700
SPEAKER: I think that brings us
to a slightly lighter question,

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.380
which is, how do you prepare?

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.920
And how do you keep the energy
for such a demanding run

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.280
of shows?

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.655
SOPHIE EVANS: I like to not
have any rituals or anything.

00:10:10.655 --> 00:10:12.530
Because I know there
are some performers that

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:13.865
have a certain thing they do.

00:10:13.865 --> 00:10:17.570
But I'm not the one
that wants to create

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.450
those things because then when
you're not able to do those--

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.820
like make sure you have
10 minutes with your eyes

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.930
closed or anything like--

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.480
I don't believe in it.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.040
So I just have a
normal day, wake up,

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.100
have breakfast and then,
go in and do the show.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.917
Keep it cazh.

00:10:32.917 --> 00:10:34.000
ALICE FEARN: Keep it cazh.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.990
I don't-- I don't tend to do a
marathon or anything before it.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.960
I do tend to rest to some
degree during the day.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.560
I think my--

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.560
I've always loved sleep.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.950
But I do definitely--

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.080
if I've had a bad
night's sleep, it's

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.755
a somewhat bad show, or
a difficult show for me.

00:10:56.755 --> 00:10:58.880
I think if I don't get a
really good night's sleep,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.450
I do find that my voice can
tend to have a hard time.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.850
And I find that my
energy level is low.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.796
I don't worry about what
I eat at the minute,

00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:07.920
not that I ever really did.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.770
But you know what I mean?

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.160
I'm like, yeah, if it's a
huge pasta, it's a huge pasta.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.190
And that's what it is.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.210
With extra garlic bread?

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.890
That's fine because I'm
going to work it off

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.790
in three hours of running
around in those black outfits.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.530
So, yeah I don't overthink it.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.170
I think people who've gone
before me, if they have,

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.530
I think they actually probably
find it harder if you overthink

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.200
and of worry too much about it.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.180
At the end of the day,
it's not heart surgery,

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.030
as we always say.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.030
You're not saving lives.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.340
You're just trying to make
someone's life that day

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.072
a bit happier.

00:11:40.072 --> 00:11:41.780
So you just got to
remember that, really.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.980
But yeah, I'm the same.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.521
I don't have an
awful lot of rituals.

00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:45.531
I just like eight hours.

00:11:45.531 --> 00:11:46.322
SOPHIE EVANS: Yeah.

00:11:46.322 --> 00:11:47.645
ALICE FEARN: Yeah, that's it.

00:11:47.645 --> 00:11:50.024
SPEAKER: Well, given the number
of shows you do per week,

00:11:50.024 --> 00:11:51.440
I can see why you
need your sleep.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.325
And I can see why extra energy
from pasta or extra garlic--

00:11:54.325 --> 00:11:55.450
ALICE FEARN: Yeah, oh, god.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.200
Get the carbs in.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.601
Yup.

00:11:57.601 --> 00:11:58.990
SPEAKER: Bradley,
what about you?

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.460
BRADLEY JADEN: Well,
I do have to watch

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.140
what I eat just because
otherwise, I'm not going

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.389
to get in those little tights.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:04.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.760
That's going to be a
sight for sore eyes.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.080
So yeah, I do go to
the gym every day.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.700
And I like to eat
quite healthily.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.630
Other than that, I don't
really sleep that much anyway.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.560
So I don't need that.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.480
And then, I just like
to play some loud music

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.460
before I go on, really,
just to get in the mood

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.325
and have a bit of a dance about.

00:12:23.325 --> 00:12:24.700
I'm not sure the
creatives always

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.130
like it when they knock
on the dressing room door,

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.190
and they're like, trying to give
me a note, and I'm like, yeah!

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.870
SPEAKER: Now, the
follow-on question clearly

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.990
is what music are you
listening to that causes people

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.240
to say, oh, what's going on?

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.315
ALICE FEARN: You got
quite an eclectic--

00:12:37.315 --> 00:12:39.400
BRADLEY JADEN: Yeah, I
mean, I have quite a range.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.560
I will listen to everything.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.300
before a show, I do
quite like listening

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.138
to a bit of hip-hop and grime.

00:12:48.138 --> 00:12:48.887
SOPHIE EVANS: Yup.

00:12:48.887 --> 00:12:49.595
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:12:49.595 --> 00:12:50.170
Amazing.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.545
ALICE FEARN:
Hip-hop and grime, I

00:12:51.545 --> 00:12:53.545
don't even know what grime is.

00:12:53.545 --> 00:12:55.142
Hip-hop and grime.

00:12:55.142 --> 00:12:56.350
BRADLEY JADEN: So yeah, yeah.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.580
SPEAKER: I could talk
about grime for hours.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.380
ALICE FEARN: Could you?

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:58.780
SPEAKER: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.590
ALICE FEARN: I don't even--

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.756
SOPHIE EVANS: Sing us a bit.

00:13:00.756 --> 00:13:02.110
I haven't got a clue either.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.950
BRADLEY JADEN:
I'll play you some.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:03.658
SOPHIE EVANS: OK.

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:04.650
SPEAKER: OK, OK.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.070
So perhaps, after
the show, we'll

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.750
all listen to some
hip-hop and grime.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.920
SOPHIE EVANS: I'll
type that into iTunes.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.762
BRADLEY JADEN: Yeah.

00:13:09.762 --> 00:13:10.887
ALICE FEARN: Grime.

00:13:10.887 --> 00:13:12.303
SOPHIE EVANS: Type
it into Google.

00:13:12.303 --> 00:13:12.990
ALICE FEARN: Eh!

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.737
SPEAKER: Exactly, exactly.

00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:17.320
So we've talked a
little bit about how

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.340
it's a female-centered show.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.714
And you brought
that up, Bradley.

00:13:19.714 --> 00:13:22.390
But what's it like actually
playing these tremendously

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.102
interesting, complex women?

00:13:25.102 --> 00:13:26.350
SOPHIE EVANS: Amazing.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.522
I actually feel like you
teach an audience things

00:13:29.522 --> 00:13:30.730
that you learned in the show.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.063
I learned stuff about being
a woman throughout the show,

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:33.941
and how--

00:13:33.941 --> 00:13:35.440
if you've not seen
the show, Glinda,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.070
she's from a
background where she

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.340
gets everything her own way.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.990
And she thinks that's how
life's always going to be.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.960
And she goes to school.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.152
And you find out
that school isn't

00:13:46.152 --> 00:13:48.610
as easy as being at home with
your lovely mother and father

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.610
who give you everything.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.430
So you learn that you don't
always get your own way.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:56.447
And I think that's a great
lesson to teach people, young--

00:13:56.447 --> 00:13:58.030
I love it when
children come because I

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.370
think children look at it
a different way to adults

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.930
as well.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.780
So to impose those
lessons is quite special.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.990
And I learn all the
time in the show.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.400
So, yeah, it's special.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.710
SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:17.320
ALICE FEARN: Well, Elphaba,
the part is a fight.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.230
You're constantly fighting from
the moment you get on stage.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:26.489
So it's, in many ways, the
draining sort of quality

00:14:26.489 --> 00:14:28.030
that you have at
the end of the show,

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.650
especially in "For Good" is
very real because of the fight

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.305
that you're constantly-- you're
playing for 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:14:34.305 --> 00:14:42.600
The fight to well, be normal is
from the second she walks on.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.680
So I find it draining in
a really positive way,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.750
if that's a thing.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:52.710
Because that fight
brings out, actually,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.410
wonderful things for her, a
friendship that she'll never

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.220
forget, the love of her life.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.100
So she gets a lot
out of those fights

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.100
as well as losing an awful
lot at the same time.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:08.040
But the story-- we always get
quite emotional by "For Good."

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.960
And I think it's because we
have been through an awful lot,

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:19.110
and we've played our
stories full out.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.540
We've really gone
through the motions

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:26.585
and really had to emote.

00:15:26.585 --> 00:15:30.820
Yeah, and I think fight is
the classic word for me.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.219
We go through so much that
that is an amazing sort

00:15:34.219 --> 00:15:35.010
of feeling to play.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.968
And although we might be
tired, and although we

00:15:36.968 --> 00:15:40.440
might need to eat a giant
pasta at the end of the show,

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.220
it feels like you've really--

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.120
it's really worth it for
the story that you've told.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.160
And to try and change
people's perspectives on it,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.025
that it's really nice
that, to sort of go,

00:15:52.025 --> 00:15:54.150
you didn't think that was
going to happen, did you?

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.108
Or you didn't think she
was like that, did you?

00:15:56.108 --> 00:15:56.710
Really good.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.550
I'm really pleased that you
have come out going, oh, my god.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.710
There was one show recently
that I popped up at the--

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.710
we were at the very end.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.650
And everyone's
just, like, oh yay!

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.160
And like, everyone
just went, ah!

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.800
And it in that moment, you
just go, yeah, thanks, guys.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.700
You were with us.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.540
You know?

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.460
And when you have moments
like that, it's just great.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.680
And yeah, it's really--

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.760
it's such a ride.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.380
It's such an exhausting ride.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.367
But it's so worth
it for every moment

00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:25.450
you get from the audience.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.760
SOPHIE EVANS: I think one of
the other biggest lessons,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.343
especially at the
end of the show when

00:16:28.343 --> 00:16:30.465
you listen to "For Good,"
is about forgiveness

00:16:30.465 --> 00:16:32.070
and forgiving
friends because we've

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.740
got such a strong
friendship in the show.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.180
We come over all the hurdles
of not liking each other.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.930
And then we actually
realize we are

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.380
two complete different people
who just love each other

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.520
because we're so different.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.650
And then we have
all these things.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.715
She runs off with the
love of my life as well,

00:16:49.715 --> 00:16:53.400
not to give the story away, but
that is giving the story away.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.010
But then at the end, you
realize that friendship

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.630
is more important
than forgiveness

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.587
and that we do have
a strong bond that's

00:16:59.587 --> 00:17:02.170
more important than the things
that have tried to separate us.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:02.878
ALICE FEARN: Yup.

00:17:02.878 --> 00:17:03.630
SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.460
And that real life
is messy, right?

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.180
Nobody is perfectly good,
and nobody is perfectly evil.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.714
ALICE FEARN: Yeah,
no life is perfect.

00:17:10.714 --> 00:17:11.630
SOPHIE EVANS: So true.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.260
ALICE FEARN: And it's how you--

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.254
and it's how you deal
with that and come out

00:17:16.254 --> 00:17:18.420
the other end that's the
most important thing, which

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.890
is exactly what this story is.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:20.720
SOPHIE EVANS: Yeah.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.569
SPEAKER: Super.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.864
What do you like most and
least about your characters?

00:17:24.864 --> 00:17:26.030
ALICE FEARN: Most and least?

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.359
Go on, Brad.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.575
BRADLEY JADEN: Oh, OK.

00:17:28.575 --> 00:17:29.760
Yeah, OK.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.340
SPEAKER: So clearly,
you're gorgeous.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:31.840
Right?

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.000
Like, let's be [STUTTERS].

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.630
BRADLEY JADEN: Oh.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:34.130
Oh.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.320
ALICE FEARN: You are?

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.195
BRADLEY JADEN: Hello.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.010
Oh, goodness.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.800
I don't know.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.210
I do love the way that he just--

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.390
I think the carefree
way of life.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.954
I think I've learned a lot.

00:17:46.954 --> 00:17:48.870
And that sounds a bit
weird to say that you've

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.161
learned a lot from a character.

00:17:50.161 --> 00:17:51.810
But I've learned
a lot about myself

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.710
through playing Fiyero
and just allowing yourself

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.210
to be a bit more relaxed, and
taking each day as it comes,

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.880
and being a bit more carefree.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.630
And if people say, do
you want to do this,

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.240
you go, yeah rather
than just being uptight.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.050
And I think, in our business
as well, like Alice said,

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.755
you can get so like,
I need to do this.

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.130
I need to be
perfect every night.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.540
And I need to-- your
standard's still there.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.120
But you got to give
yourself a bit of a break

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.070
in all kind of walks of life.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.570
You know?

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.037
Like, as actors,
obviously, we care so much.

00:18:21.037 --> 00:18:22.620
But you want to be
perfect every time.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.190
And sometimes you can't.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.190
Do you know what I mean?

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.350
And I think I've
learned a lot from that.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.645
And then his negative.

00:18:29.645 --> 00:18:33.480
So I don't know.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.828
Maybe his choice
of clothing maybe.

00:18:35.828 --> 00:18:38.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.744
You know, that's
something to be--

00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:42.492
yeah, I'll say maybe that.

00:18:42.492 --> 00:18:42.983
SOPHIE EVANS: I like
his tight pants.

00:18:42.983 --> 00:18:44.060
I think they look great.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.900
BRADLEY JADEN: But I mean, I
mean, I'm in lady's jeans now

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.433
so I can't really complain.

00:18:47.433 --> 00:18:50.629
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:52.420
SPEAKER: I don't know
how you top that one.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.270
I'm just saying.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.224
ALICE FEARN: I like--

00:18:58.224 --> 00:18:59.640
because I don't
think it's a trait

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.500
that I actually
have as a person.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:07.620
So I like that she will stand
up no matter what and say

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.880
when something is wrong.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.694
I'm someone that tends
to go, I don't like that,

00:19:11.694 --> 00:19:13.360
but I'm going to think
what would happen

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.430
if I say that I don't like it.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.274
And I think of the options
that would happen afterwards.

00:19:18.274 --> 00:19:18.940
Elphaba doesn't.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.170
It's like, I don't like that.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.430
I'm saying something about it.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.810
She doesn't think of the
consequences of those.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:28.390
And although that might
mean a lot of bad stuff

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.520
happens to her during
the show for that reason,

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.292
I think that's an amazing
thing to just go, no,

00:19:33.292 --> 00:19:35.250
I don't believe in that,
or I don't trust that,

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.370
and that's wrong.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.130
And so I'm going to instantly
say something about that.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.088
I think that's amazing.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:48.620
Her negatives-- she just
runs around too much,

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.400
and it's tiring.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.320
She's just like, it's constant.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.560
It's just never-ending.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.310
That's the only negative.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.520
I think she's a
brilliant character.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.978
And I think there's
a lot of things

00:19:57.978 --> 00:20:01.880
that I'd love to take
from her in life.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.409
There's not many--

00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:05.200
I don't even see being
green as a negative.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.646
BRADLEY JADEN: I don't think
there are negatives to the both

00:20:05.646 --> 00:20:06.080
of the girls.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.070
ALICE FEARN: I don't
think that even

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.610
being green I see as a negative.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.540
I think it's fabulous.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.260
I mean, in fact, I think
I look better green.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.940
SOPHIE EVANS: You
look fantastic green.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:13.690
ALICE FEARN: I do.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:14.524
I look better green.

00:20:14.524 --> 00:20:16.440
SPEAKER: We'll come back
to green in a second.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.279
But I would love
to know what Sophie

00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:19.570
has to say about her character.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:23.120
SOPHIE EVANS: My character,
I love how happy she is.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.680
I'm a very smiley, happy person.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.531
So I love that I get
to be that on stage.

00:20:26.531 --> 00:20:28.280
Sometimes when you're
feeling a bit tired,

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.260
it is hard to be smiley.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.930
And my face, at the start of
the run, I had to get a massage.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.980
My face was killing because
I'm constantly like this.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.720
So I couldn't get it down.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.700
I was like, I'm stuck.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.041
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:42.665
So I love that.

00:20:42.665 --> 00:20:44.970
I love that I get to
be happy and positive.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.840
The only negative for me,
it's related to the costumes.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:53.914
They are so heavy that my
body is a bit sore, sore.

00:20:53.914 --> 00:20:54.830
That's the only thing.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.927
If I could just make them
a little bit lighter.

00:20:56.927 --> 00:20:58.510
SPEAKER: They are
tremendous costumes.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.160
SOPHIE EVANS: They're amazing.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.250
SPEAKER: And for those of you
who haven't seen the show,

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.245
like, I don't know how
you move in those skirts.

00:21:03.245 --> 00:21:03.500
Right?

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:03.955
ALICE FEARN: Oh, my god.

00:21:03.955 --> 00:21:04.720
They're enormous.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.280
SOPHIE EVANS: Yeah, I know.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.120
The skirt is.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:06.880
And it's so tight.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.190
And it's right on your hips,
and it pulls right down.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.680
And the stage is like this.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.460
And I'm in heels.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.960
So my body's just a bit,
like, what are you doing?

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.320
But I look great.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:15.820
It's fine.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.778
SPEAKER: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:16.778 --> 00:21:18.650
They're gorgeous,
absolutely gorgeous.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:20.822
So you're green, Alice,
when you're Elphaba.

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:22.280
But you're not
green at the moment.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.440
You look very nice.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.357
But you do seem to have
green nail varnish on.

00:21:25.357 --> 00:21:27.689
ALICE FEARN: Yeah, because
I've got to have green nails.

00:21:27.689 --> 00:21:28.790
SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.375
What's the makeup routine like?

00:21:30.375 --> 00:21:32.980
And then how do
you get it all off?

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.821
ALICE FEARN: Yes.

00:21:33.821 --> 00:21:35.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:36.680
With a challenge.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.460
If you look closely,
I'm sure you'll

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.131
go-- oh, actually, you've not
doing very well getting it off

00:21:41.131 --> 00:21:41.630
last night.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.360
But so I have to get in a
bit earlier than everyone.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.880
So I have to get in about half
an hour earlier than everyone

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.820
to start the makeup routine.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:55.890
And Act One is a little bit
slightly different to Act Two

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:56.400
makeup.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.337
So they don't have to do
an awful lot of eye makeup

00:22:00.337 --> 00:22:01.170
on me, for instance.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.557
It's quite literally just green,
really, and a bit of mascara.

00:22:04.557 --> 00:22:06.140
And then Act Two,
it gets much darker.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.680
And so they've sort
of-- it's not too bad.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.340
I thought it was going to
be much worse than the time

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:11.930
that it takes.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.850
They've got it down to
a fine art, I think.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.260
How do I get it off?

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.910
Weirdly, baby shampoo
works really, really well.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.680
Don't know what's
in baby shampoo.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.060
But you just get basically
a scrubbing brush and baby

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.470
shampoo, and you go for
it for about 10 minutes.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.270
And it all eventually comes off.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.955
It is water-based makeup so
it is willing to come off.

00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:38.580
But yeah, I mean,
after a two-show day,

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.746
that's really bedded into
that skin and those pores.

00:22:40.746 --> 00:22:44.940
So I think it wasn't
that long ago, actually,

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.182
and after a two-show day,
I had a really full shower,

00:22:47.182 --> 00:22:49.640
like a good 20 minutes, scrubbed
everything off, went home,

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.380
and Guv went--

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.546
he's my partner, by the way.

00:22:51.546 --> 00:22:54.210
He went, oh, not done very
well getting it off tonight.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.260
Did you rush?

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.630
And, like, a single tear
trickles down my face

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:04.320
as I went, no, I just spent
20 minutes in the shower.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.945
So sometimes, it
depends on, I think,

00:23:06.945 --> 00:23:08.570
how long you've had
it on for that day.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.930
But yeah, it does come off
if you're stable enough

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.140
to go through the scrubbing.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.390
But the skin suffers slightly.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.484
But that's just-- it's worth it.

00:23:17.484 --> 00:23:18.400
SPEAKER: For the arts.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.859
We're going to turn to audience
questions in a few minutes.

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:22.858
I've got one more that
I'd like to ask the cast.

00:23:22.858 --> 00:23:25.110
If you have a question,
please go to the microphone

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.740
in the center of the room now.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.270
So I've got kind of, I
guess, a general acting

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:35.800
question about your most
memorable moments on stage,

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.130
whether it's in this
show or perhaps another.

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.582
What are they?

00:23:40.582 --> 00:23:41.790
ALICE FEARN: During the show?

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.030
SPEAKER: Any show.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:43.860
Is it this show?

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.690
Is it one of your
first shows, maybe when

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.100
you were starting out?

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.420
SOPHIE EVANS: I've got--

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.340
it's related to
"Wicked," because it's

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.990
"The Wizard of Oz."

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.175
It's children that I was in.

00:23:54.175 --> 00:23:55.050
I was doing the show.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.730
And obviously, we
had a real life dog.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.104
I was Dorothy in "The Wizard
of Oz," which was brilliant.

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:02.490
We had a real life dog, Toto,
who was very well-behaved most

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:03.780
of the time.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.260
But one show, he must've had,
like, spicy dinner or something

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.750
because he decided to go
to the toilet on stage.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.370
And a little munchkin had to
run off, get a little pooper

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:17.290
scooper, run back on.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.330
And he stole the show.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.080
Yeah, so--

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.510
ALICE FEARN: Bet he got
a round of applause.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.110
SOPHIE EVANS: He always
got the biggest applause

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.068
at the end of the show.

00:24:23.068 --> 00:24:24.620
He'd run on.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.390
He did nothing.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.880
I just fed him ham
the whole show.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.990
And he got the applause.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.474
That was fun.

00:24:32.474 --> 00:24:33.890
ALICE FEARN: I
can't think of one.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.104
Can you?

00:24:35.104 --> 00:24:36.340
BRADLEY JADEN: Not most.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.250
ALICE FEARN: I can
only think of things

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.416
that have gone wrong in my
past, in different shows,

00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:40.489
like people--

00:24:40.489 --> 00:24:42.030
like things not
working or something.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.280
That's all I can think of.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.210
SPEAKER: But even
then, I think there's

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.711
a question around
resilience, right?

00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:47.085
How do you bounce
back from that?

00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:48.880
How do you take that
to something positive?

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.270
ALICE FEARN: I don't let it
get to me too much if something

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.965
goes wrong.

00:24:50.965 --> 00:24:52.340
You have to sort
of brush it off.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.490
Because if you get
annoyed about it,

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.850
then it's going to get sort
of like-- pointless energy.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:57.030
BRADLEY JADEN: That's what
exciting about live theater.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:57.590
Do you know what I mean?

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.089
That's--

00:24:58.089 --> 00:24:58.810
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.890
BRADLEY JADEN: It keeps it
fresh for you and the audience,

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:01.389
you know.

00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:03.650
And it's your job
to hopefully make

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:08.180
sure the audience are not aware
of a mistake that does happen.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.950
But things happen.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.284
But like you said, it's not
our job to try [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:12.284 --> 00:25:14.825
ALICE FEARN: Once there wasn't
a wig-- when I was in "Shrek."

00:25:14.825 --> 00:25:16.050
This is in "Shrek."

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.549
I pointed to Bradley because
we did "Shrek" together, "Shrek

00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:19.340
the Musical."

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.912
And yeah, there wasn't a wig.

00:25:21.912 --> 00:25:23.620
And I was doing this
really quick change.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:27.960
And this fear that suddenly
crossed the wig lady, Paula.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.420
And she just went,
I've not got your wig!

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.570
And I just went,
let's improvise.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:35.472
And so I got this, like,
shawl that was on the set.

00:25:35.472 --> 00:25:36.680
And I just went, don't worry.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.080
I'll just use this
because we had no time

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:39.956
to go and get a wig.

00:25:39.956 --> 00:25:41.330
And so we just
threw this around.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.430
I just went and did this
scene and then came back off.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.100
And she just was, like, in
tears, going, I'm so sorry.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.090
And I was just like, that
was quite fun for me.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.750
I made it work.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.890
It's things like that I quite
like as long as they're not

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.070
dangerous.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.440
And no one will have noticed.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.360
I don't think anyone noticed.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.450
I think I even had
people in that night.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.290
And I went, oh, did
you see me with no wig?

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.665
And they were like, don't know
what you're talking about.

00:26:00.665 --> 00:26:02.331
We always notice it
way more, because we

00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:04.190
know it's not the norm.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:08.360
But actually, an audience
very, very rarely,

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.870
unless they are there every sort
of day, which there are some

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:17.140
that are and would notice it.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.890
I generally quite
like it if things

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.580
go wrong because it
makes me go, how do I

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.580
deal with the situation?

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.180
What do I have to do?

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:23.700
And improvise.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.540
SOPHIE EVANS: You have
to use your brain.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.160
ALICE FEARN: Yeah, you have
to use your brain suddenly.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:27.460
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.751
Bradley, any memorable moments?

00:26:28.751 --> 00:26:31.380
And then we've got some
questions from the audience.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.230
BRADLEY JADEN: Yeah, I mean,
obviously, you get those ones.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.604
But then there's
also those times

00:26:34.604 --> 00:26:37.070
where as actors, when
you've been working hard

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.200
to get to your dreams--

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.140
and we've all been
understudies as well.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.522
And when we get that
chance to go on--

00:26:44.522 --> 00:26:46.730
I remember the first time
I ever played Jean Valjean.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.700
And I cried for,
like, two hours.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.700
Do you know what I mean?

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.070
I was just-- I've
played Jean Valjean.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.430
And my mom was there and stuff.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:57.180
But then I remember when you get
the phone call to play Fiyero.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.605
I was just-- you get so
overwhelmed because your dream

00:27:00.605 --> 00:27:01.700
is coming true.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.490
So you have those memorable
moments where things go wrong,

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:05.698
and you have to deal with it.

00:27:05.698 --> 00:27:08.060
But then you get those
moments of pure elation

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.630
where you're just kind of
like, wow, it's happened.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.940
And that's what's exciting
about being a performer

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.710
and an actor at the moment.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:16.460
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.180
Let's turn it over to the
audience questions now.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.520
AUDIENCE: My question is around
backstage and how confusing

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.000
it is and how organized it
is because there's monkeys

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.500
everywhere.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.990
There's scores of changes.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.580
BRADLEY JADEN: Like a zoo.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.038
Like, they're just
running around--

00:27:29.038 --> 00:27:30.379
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:30.379 --> 00:27:32.420
AUDIENCE: I'm just wondering
what goes backstage?

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.340
SOPHIE EVANS: Oh
it's like a circus.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.679
But in a good way.

00:27:35.679 --> 00:27:36.220
I very much--

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.250
BRADLEY JADEN: It's
controlled chaos.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.291
SOPHIE EVANS: I've got
some really quick changes.

00:27:39.291 --> 00:27:43.200
And the work that goes on
backstage-- so when I come off,

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.130
the first time I leave the
stage in the big bubble dress,

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.380
I then have to get changed
into this little suit

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.290
to be a student at Shiz.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:53.375
And there's about six people
just taking my wig off, taking

00:27:53.375 --> 00:27:55.250
my shoes off, taking my
dress off, putting me

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.208
in a different costume.

00:27:56.208 --> 00:27:57.282
And it happens in about--

00:27:57.282 --> 00:27:59.240
it must be about five,
six seconds because I've

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.656
got time to spare
where I can have

00:28:00.656 --> 00:28:01.970
a drink and things like that.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.110
And it's just amazing.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.660
The people backstage
are so on it.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.364
It's so rehearsed and
so well thought through.

00:28:08.364 --> 00:28:10.530
BRADLEY JADEN: I think if
you saw it as an outsider,

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.280
you would literally think
it was absolutely crazy.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.360
And it is chaos.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.120
But it's like a
well-oiled machine.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.860
And like Sophie said, we've got
an incredible backstage crew

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.472
and wigs and costume.

00:28:23.472 --> 00:28:24.680
And everyone knows their job.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.260
And everyone's doing their
track to their best ability.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.862
And everything just
moves so fluid.

00:28:28.862 --> 00:28:30.320
ALICE FEARN: You
can't really have,

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.028
like, someone come
and stand in the wings

00:28:32.028 --> 00:28:34.820
and watch because
that will instantly

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.652
disrupt the flow of the things
coming off, people coming off.

00:28:37.652 --> 00:28:39.110
They've got certain
directions they

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.714
need to go to get a
really quick change done.

00:28:41.714 --> 00:28:43.130
As soon as they
pass, then someone

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:44.420
brings something over here.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.240
Then that something's flying
up, something's coming in.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.130
If you're in that way,
then you can't be.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.230
So you just can't--

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:55.490
it's perfectly-- I mean, now,
it's a well-oiled machine.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.720
But it's all perfectly planned.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.537
This is why techs are there.

00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:01.620
We have a technical rehearsal
always before shows.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.040
And that's why they're
there is to work out

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.990
how this can work
perfectly and what

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.810
needs to happen at what point.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:12.650
So yes, it does look like
a madhouse, absolutely.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.124
But from our eyes, we
know exactly what--

00:29:15.124 --> 00:29:16.290
you can see what's going on.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:16.831
It's amazing.

00:29:16.831 --> 00:29:17.840
It's very well done.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.102
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:19.102 --> 00:29:21.560
SPEAKER: I can't-- I imagine--
the Apollo's an old theater,

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:21.740
right?

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.140
So I imagine there's not a lot
of space back there either,

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.223
which makes it even more--

00:29:25.223 --> 00:29:27.980
ALICE FEARN: Oh, I've worked
in much less space actually.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.300
I actually think it's quite--

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.100
I mean, there is
a lot of scenery.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.580
And there is a lot of
set that has to go up

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.690
in order to really space down.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.211
So yeah, they use height as
opposed to width and depth

00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:40.710
maybe.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.410
But again, it's just
perfectly timed so well.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.675
You wouldn't notice.

00:29:48.675 --> 00:29:50.300
I never even notice
what they're doing.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.210
It's amazing.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.390
SPEAKER: Amazing, amazing.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:52.974
Next question?

00:29:52.974 --> 00:29:53.806
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:29:53.806 --> 00:29:54.640
ALICE FEARN: Hi.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.590
SPEAKER: I'm interested
to know what happens

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:57.900
once the show is all finished.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.470
So do you start
auditioning for a new show?

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.520
Or do you have some downtime?

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.470
Or do you travel with the show?

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.276
Or yeah--

00:30:06.276 --> 00:30:08.150
SOPHIE EVANS: It can be
any of those options.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:08.410
ALICE FEARN: Yeah.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.860
Actually, all of
them or none of them.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.068
SOPHIE EVANS: You don't know.

00:30:11.068 --> 00:30:12.337
We would all, I assume--

00:30:12.337 --> 00:30:13.795
unless you want a
bit of time off--

00:30:13.795 --> 00:30:17.660
audition for a new show, or TV,
or whatever you wanted to do.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.502
But there's no guarantee
you'll ever work again really.

00:30:20.502 --> 00:30:21.264
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:21.264 --> 00:30:22.305
ALICE FEARN: There isn't.

00:30:22.305 --> 00:30:23.380
There really isn't.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.680
SOPHIE EVANS: There's not.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.060
it's really fickle.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.430
But--

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.390
ALICE FEARN: Yeah.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:32.140
You've always got a contract so
you always know your end date,

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.960
as it were, whether that extends
further than that, you just

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.390
don't know.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:37.930
So yeah, as you
get closer to that,

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.750
if something is available
after that end date,

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.416
then yeah, you start
auditioning for it,

00:30:41.416 --> 00:30:44.860
with the just sincere
hope that you get it.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.320
I do always like--

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.950
I've been working for
about 13 years now.

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:57.520
And I always go through
a phase that once I'm

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.976
getting towards the end of a
job, I want my evenings back.

00:31:00.976 --> 00:31:02.350
And I start going,
I really can't

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.865
wait to watch "Coronation
Street" at 7:30.

00:31:04.865 --> 00:31:05.740
You know what I mean?

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.200
So you sort of get that feeling.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.460
And you go, oh, I'm going
to do that for a while.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.580
And maybe you fill your day
with whatever work you do,

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.050
sessions or whatever items.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:16.630
I teach a lot.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.359
And then I do that
for a couple of weeks.

00:31:18.359 --> 00:31:20.650
And I go, now, I'm ready to
give my life back to a show

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.220
again now.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.620
Do you know what I mean?

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.009
So I go through that cycle
every single time pretty much.

00:31:26.009 --> 00:31:27.550
And I've done that
every single time.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.660
If someone said to me, Alice,
you finish on Saturday night,

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.065
and Monday, you start
that, I'd be like, oh, OK.

00:31:33.065 --> 00:31:33.940
[FAKE CRIES]

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.290
Because actually,
that's not ideal for me.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:38.140
I do like to have
a bit of a break,

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.240
not because I don't
love theater in any way.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.066
Just because I think
it's good for the brain

00:31:43.066 --> 00:31:44.440
to have that change
up because it

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.650
makes you appreciate each time
when you go back into a show.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:50.050
That's just my thing.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:51.820
BRADLEY JADEN: Well,
to touch on that,

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.000
I mean, I've been
very, very, very lucky

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.590
since I did "Shrek" with Alice.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.326
I did "Shrek."

00:31:59.326 --> 00:32:00.950
And then I finished
that on a Saturday.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.520
And on the Monday,
I started "Ghost."

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.375
I finished that on the Saturday.

00:32:04.375 --> 00:32:07.660
And I started "Les
Mis" on the Monday.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.120
And then, I did that, and
then did the "Wicked" on tour

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.286
and then finished that, and
went straight into this.

00:32:12.286 --> 00:32:15.760
So I actually, since
we did "Shrek" in 2012,

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.780
I've not had a--

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.585
ALICE FEARN: (SINGING)
Someone's talented.

00:32:18.585 --> 00:32:20.960
BRADLEY JADEN: But it's just
been a lucky thing because--

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.580
ALICE FEARN: (SINGING) Very
talented, just really more

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:25.566
talented than you are.

00:32:25.566 --> 00:32:26.066
OK?

00:32:26.066 --> 00:32:28.002
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:28.002 --> 00:32:29.377
SOPHIE EVANS: Well
done, Bradley.

00:32:29.377 --> 00:32:29.850
BRADLEY JADEN: It's not that!

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:30.796
I'm just saying--

00:32:30.796 --> 00:32:32.261
ALICE FEARN: What can I say?

00:32:32.261 --> 00:32:33.760
BRADLEY JADEN: But
I would sometimes

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.340
really like a bit of down time
and watch "Coronation Street."

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.840
ALICE FEARN: Stop
being so talented!

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.566
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:40.566 --> 00:32:43.430
Getting all the jobs
from everyone else.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:45.670
BRADLEY JADEN: No, but yeah.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:46.885
I don't know.

00:32:46.885 --> 00:32:48.760
There could be a job
that starts on a Monday.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.634
That's what I'll say.

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:53.499
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:53.499 --> 00:32:55.540
SPEAKER: What's the ramp
up into a new show like?

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.100
So because you're talented,
you stop on Saturday,

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.350
and you start again on Monday.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.670
Into shows that have been
running for a long time,

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:05.465
how do you ramp up?

00:33:05.465 --> 00:33:06.340
How do you get going?

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.580
How does that work?

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.270
BRADLEY JADEN: Well, usually,
you either double up,

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.090
or you start up.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:16.450
So you would do maybe four weeks
of a different show in the day,

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.807
and then you would do
your show in the evening,

00:33:18.807 --> 00:33:19.640
of a different show.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.390
ALICE FEARN: Yeah.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:21.000
And the brain.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.650
SOPHIE EVANS: That never
happened to me though.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:22.120
BRADLEY JADEN: Or
if you're doing

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.595
that, even if you're doing a
cast change, when people have

00:33:24.595 --> 00:33:26.970
stayed on for "Wicked" and
stuff and doing an extra year,

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:27.980
you'll be doing--

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.860
you rehearse with the
new cast in the daytime

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.595
until 5 o'clock or 4:30.

00:33:31.595 --> 00:33:34.220
Then you have a couple of hours
off, and then you do your show.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.867
And that would happen
for four to five weeks.

00:33:36.867 --> 00:33:38.950
If you are lucky, and maybe
it is a different show

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.200
that actually the rehearsals
start on the Monday,

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.150
then you're quite lucky that
you have the evenings free.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:50.410
But it is a bit of
a jigsaw, I think,

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:52.440
between the shows
and your rehearsals

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.979
and how it's kind
of placed, really.

00:33:54.979 --> 00:33:57.520
ALICE FEARN: I think sometimes,
when you're doing a new show,

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.760
or you're rehearsing something,
your brain instantly goes--

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.746
because we're creative minds.

00:34:02.746 --> 00:34:04.120
We've got creative--
so actually,

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.154
it's really nice because
you go, oh, my god.

00:34:06.154 --> 00:34:07.570
I'm thinking about
something else.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.570
I'm thinking about a new
story, a new character,

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.230
new intentions, new drives.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:15.334
So actually, sometimes it can
be really quite beneficial

00:34:15.334 --> 00:34:17.000
if you've done something
for a long time

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.785
because it does wake you back up
again to being a bit creative.

00:34:20.785 --> 00:34:22.060
SPEAKER: Oh, super.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.320
And one last question.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.030
AUDIENCE: What would be your
dream role on stage that you've

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.154
not had the chance to play?

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:31.440
SOPHIE EVANS: "The Little
Mermaid" would be mine.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.200
SPEAKER: Oh.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.949
SOPHIE EVANS: But she
has to roller skate.

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:35.080
And as I've said,
I'm really clumsy.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.663
So I don't know if
that's a good idea.

00:34:36.663 --> 00:34:37.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:39.570
I'd love to try.

00:34:42.395 --> 00:34:44.254
ALICE FEARN: Elphaba
was a big one for me.

00:34:44.254 --> 00:34:47.610
It had been for
many, many years.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:49.449
To be honest, a part
that I'd love to play

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:53.269
is one that I can never play
because it's a man's role.

00:34:53.269 --> 00:34:56.699
But I would love to play
Jean Valjean in "Les Mis."

00:34:56.699 --> 00:35:02.210
If we could just ignore the
fact that I was a woman,

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.380
that would be the part
that I'd choose to play.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.760
BRADLEY JADEN: Yeah.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.190
Well, I was very lucky
enough to play that role.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:09.750
And that was always a dream.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.650
ALICE FEARN: Yeah,
it's all right for you.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:13.150
BRADLEY JADEN: But
if anything else,

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.775
I'd love to play the Phantom in
"Phantom of the Opera" one day.

00:35:15.775 --> 00:35:17.316
ALICE FEARN: Next
job, let's face it.

00:35:17.316 --> 00:35:18.398
You've just said it now.

00:35:18.398 --> 00:35:20.617
And you're so talented,
you'll start on the Monday!

00:35:20.617 --> 00:35:22.700
BRADLEY JADEN: I'll start
on the Monday, everyone!

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.550
SPEAKER: But I do hope to see
you continue in your roles

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:35.530
in "Wicked" for perhaps
a little longer yet.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.100
"Wicked" is at the Apollo
Theater near Victoria.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.632
Many, many thanks
to Sophie Evans--

00:35:40.632 --> 00:35:42.942
SOPHIE EVANS: Thank you.

00:35:42.942 --> 00:35:46.530
ALICE FEARN: Alice
Fearn, and Bradley Jaden.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:47.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.997
SOPHIE EVANS: The
really talented one.

00:35:49.997 --> 00:35:51.830
SPEAKER: Thank you very
much for joining us.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:55.030
I think the cast will pose
for some pictures now.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.642
Thank you.

00:35:55.642 --> 00:35:56.600
ALICE FEARN: Thank you.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.470
BRADLEY JADEN: Thank you.
