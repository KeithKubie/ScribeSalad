00:00:00.604 --> 00:00:02.071
Background voice: Let's say this past year

00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:04.151
I started a restaurant

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:05.604
and I want to think about

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:06.870
what type of a profit

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.670
I've been making at that restaurant.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.735
We're going to think about it

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:10.603
in 2 different ways.

00:00:10.603 --> 00:00:11.471
We're going to think about it

00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:12.900
in terms of an accounting profit,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.066
which is really the type of profit

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.536
that most of us associate

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:17.734
with a business or a firm.

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:18.733
We're also going to think about it

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.400
in terms of economic profit,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.870
which we'll see is a little bit different.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.066
Instead of telling us whether a business

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.005
is producing income,

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:28.733
it tells us whether it makes sense

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.004
to even run the business

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:30.817
in the way that we're

00:00:30.817 --> 00:00:31.900
actually running it.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.270
First, let's focus on

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.400
the traditional way

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.005
of calculating profit.

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.337
Let's say my firm,

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:39.336
my restaurant,

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:40.736
(my firm in a restaurant)

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:45.623
in year 1 it brings in, in revenue,

00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:47.565
it brings in $500,000.

00:00:47.565 --> 00:00:49.804
Revenue literally is the amount of money

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:52.732
the customers pay me to
eat at the restaurant.

00:00:52.732 --> 00:00:54.233
They are paying for their dinners.

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.604
This is literally the money
that's coming in the door.

00:00:56.604 --> 00:00:58.335
Sometimes people call it the top line,

00:00:58.335 --> 00:00:59.733
because it's literally the top line

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.805
of our income statement.

00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:01.605
I just wrote it.

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:02.815
It's the top line.

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:05.203
Now we have to think about our expenses.

00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:08.222
Expenses.

00:01:08.222 --> 00:01:10.316
Now, when you're running a restaurant

00:01:10.316 --> 00:01:11.734
one of the obvious expenses

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:14.138
is going to be the cost of food.

00:01:14.138 --> 00:01:16.338
Food, we're going to say

00:01:16.338 --> 00:01:19.900
cost us $100,000.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.232
$100,000.

00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:23.066
Then, you have the cost of labor.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.150
I have the wait staff.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.670
I have the chefs and the bus boy.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.337
On all of those people,

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:28.203
in this past year,

00:01:28.203 --> 00:01:30.733
I spent $100,000.

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:31.650
Then, I have,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.337
and I am going to assume

00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:33.270
that I don't own the building,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.400
that I rent the building.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.335
So, building rent.

00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:38.066
I'm assuming this is on the building,

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:41.066
let's say that that was $200,000.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:44.400
Then finally, I really
just rented everything.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.815
I also rented the equipment,

00:01:45.815 --> 00:01:48.149
all of the stoves, the fridges,

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.483
all of that stuff.

00:01:49.483 --> 00:01:51.066
None of this is stuff that I own,

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:52.603
so the equipment rent.

00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:55.316
Equipment rent,

00:01:55.316 --> 00:01:58.232
I spent another $50,000.

00:01:58.232 --> 00:02:00.338
How much profit do I have here?

00:02:00.338 --> 00:02:01.400
Those are all of my expenses.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.400
I didn't borrow any money,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.804
so I didn't have any interest expense

00:02:03.804 --> 00:02:05.071
or anything like that.

00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:06.470
How much profit do I have

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.938
before paying tax,

00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:09.482
or essentially my pretax profit?

00:02:09.482 --> 00:02:10.670
The reason why we think
of it in those terms

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.983
is because the amount you pay in tax

00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:15.983
is usually derived from
your pretax profit.

00:02:15.983 --> 00:02:18.067
That depends on where this business is,

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:18.733
what country,

00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:19.732
what state,

00:02:19.732 --> 00:02:21.400
what type of business it is.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.150
The easy way to calculate pretax profit,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.233
pretax profit.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:27.733
This is pretax and we're thinking

00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:29.816
in terms of accounting
profit right over here.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.816
We take how much money
comes through the door

00:02:31.816 --> 00:02:33.605
and then we just have to subtract out

00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:36.816
all of the payments we
essentially have to make

00:02:36.816 --> 00:02:38.150
to other people.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.815
What we have left is out pretax profit.

00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:43.938
500,000 minus 450,000

00:02:43.938 --> 00:02:46.204
gives us a pretax profit

00:02:46.204 --> 00:02:48.338
(I'll do it in that same bright yellow)

00:02:48.338 --> 00:02:50.582
of $50,000.

00:02:50.582 --> 00:02:52.888
I'm assuming that I'm the only owner

00:02:52.888 --> 00:02:53.670
of this business,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.483
so I can essentially take it all out

00:02:55.483 --> 00:02:56.815
for myself.

00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:57.670
Maybe help pay

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.483
my own personal rent or whatever else,

00:02:58.483 --> 00:03:00.537
or I could take some of this

00:03:00.537 --> 00:03:01.336
or all of this

00:03:01.336 --> 00:03:02.738
and reinvest it back into the business.

00:03:02.738 --> 00:03:04.496
Maybe I start buying my equipment

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:05.899
or I expand in some way.

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:08.082
Who knows what I might do with that money.

00:03:08.082 --> 00:03:11.233
This is just traditional
accounting profit.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:12.900
This is how profit is calculated.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.605
Although, this is a super simple example.

00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:15.733
In the future I would like to do

00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:16.937
more nuanced examples

00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:18.204
in the accounting world.

00:03:18.204 --> 00:03:19.336
This, you would refer to

00:03:19.336 --> 00:03:21.400
as just accounting profit.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400
Accounting profit.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.983
When people in the everyday world

00:03:24.983 --> 00:03:25.870
talk about profit,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.670
this is normally what
they're talking about.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.472
Now, when economist talk about profit,

00:03:29.472 --> 00:03:31.316
they're talking about
something slightly different.

00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:32.733
The best way to realize that

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:35.670
is to just calculate economic profit

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.536
for this exact same business,

00:03:37.536 --> 00:03:40.669
or this firm, as a
economist would call it.

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.482
A firm really is a general idea

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:43.566
for an organization

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:46.233
that is trying to maximize profit.

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:48.004
Once again, it's year 1.

00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:50.066
Actually let me just copy and paste it.

00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:52.604
It's year 1, that's our revenue.

00:03:52.604 --> 00:03:53.816
I'm going to copy

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:56.150
and I'm going to paste it.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.471
This right over here.

00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:58.400
So far, so good.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.234
Looks pretty similar.

00:04:00.234 --> 00:04:01.814
Now, we're going to think about things

00:04:01.814 --> 00:04:03.147
in a slightly different way.

00:04:03.147 --> 00:04:06.519
Economist view cost in
terms of opportunity cost.

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:07.253
As we'll see,

00:04:07.253 --> 00:04:08.319
some of the opportunity cost

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.564
you can measure in terms of dollars.

00:04:10.564 --> 00:04:12.397
Some are less explicit.

00:04:12.397 --> 00:04:13.652
I'm going to write here,

00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:16.453
just so we can get in the
economist frame of mind,

00:04:16.453 --> 00:04:19.647
opportunity cost.

00:04:19.647 --> 00:04:20.719
Within opportunity cost

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:21.649
there are going to be

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.398
explicit opportunity cost

00:04:23.398 --> 00:04:25.985
and implicit opportunity cost.

00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:28.519
First, let's do the explicit.

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:31.063
Explicit opportunity cost.

00:04:31.063 --> 00:04:32.319
Actually, all of these

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.147
are explicit opportunity cost.

00:04:34.147 --> 00:04:37.261
Let me just copy and paste that.

00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:40.985
I will copy and paste.

00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:43.985
All of these are explicit
opportunity cost.

00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:45.480
The reason why they are explicit

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.730
is I'm actually making up ...

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.731
I'm paying money for all of these things.

00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:51.119
Even the equipment and
the rent of the apartment,

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:52.231
I don't own it.

00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:54.986
I'm actually paying whoever does own it.

00:04:54.986 --> 00:04:57.919
These are direct outlays
out of the business.

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.230
I'm explicitly making these payments.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.231
The reason why we can think
of them as opportunity cost,

00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:04.319
even though they're given in dollar terms,

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.518
is that if I was spending
$100,000 on food,

00:05:07.518 --> 00:05:10.585
that's $100,000 that I couldn't
spend on something else.

00:05:10.585 --> 00:05:11.652
If I'm spending $100,000 on labor,

00:05:11.652 --> 00:05:14.564
that's $100,000 that I couldn't
spend on something else.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.397
I'm just measuring the opportunity
cost in terms of dollars,

00:05:17.397 --> 00:05:19.984
but dollars that I could
have spent on other things.

00:05:19.984 --> 00:05:22.397
So far, it looks pretty much identical.

00:05:22.397 --> 00:05:24.232
I'm just viewing it with
a slightly different lens.

00:05:24.232 --> 00:05:26.480
You're like, "Well,
what's the big deal here?"

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.986
We're going to see a
little bit of divergence

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:30.119
when we start thinking
about the implicit cost

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:32.231
that really weren't
taken into account here,

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.986
the implicit opportunity cost especially.

00:05:34.986 --> 00:05:38.118
Implicit cost.

00:05:38.118 --> 00:05:39.852
If I am running this business

00:05:39.852 --> 00:05:41.897
and let's say, in order to run it

00:05:41.897 --> 00:05:44.585
I actually had to focus on it full time.

00:05:44.585 --> 00:05:48.253
I couldn't have actually quit my job.

00:05:48.253 --> 00:05:51.311
Then, there's an implicit cost of …

00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:52.862
An implicit opportunity cost

00:05:52.862 --> 00:05:54.147
of the job that I gave up,

00:05:54.147 --> 00:05:56.204
or my wages foregone.

00:05:56.204 --> 00:05:56.992
Let me write this down,

00:05:56.992 --> 00:06:01.193
wages foregone.

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:03.527
Let's say, and this will depend
on who we're talking about.

00:06:03.527 --> 00:06:05.445
Let's say I was a doctor

00:06:05.445 --> 00:06:11.027
and I was making a nice steady,
risk free $150,000 a year.

00:06:11.027 --> 00:06:15.195
I was giving up $150,000 a year.

00:06:15.195 --> 00:06:18.458
Now, we've listed all of the explicit

00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:20.612
and the implicit opportunity cost.

00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:24.524
Now we're ready to calculate
our economic profit.

00:06:24.524 --> 00:06:26.724
Let me draw a line over here.

00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:31.859
Our economic profit is going to be

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:33.337
our revenue that we're taking in,

00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:34.587
minus all of these expenses.

00:06:34.587 --> 00:06:36.254
That gives us a positive $50,000.

00:06:36.254 --> 00:06:40.504
Now, we have to subtract
the wages foregone.

00:06:40.504 --> 00:06:44.671
Then, I get to negative $150,000.

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:46.190
This is interesting.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.088
This is kind of a big discrepancy here.

00:06:49.088 --> 00:06:50.858
In accounting terms, I'm profitable.

00:06:50.858 --> 00:06:53.124
In economic terms, I'm not profitable.

00:06:53.124 --> 00:06:54.459
The important thing to realize

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:56.815
is economic profit, when it's negative,

00:06:56.815 --> 00:06:57.542
isn't saying,

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:01.094
or you say that you have
$100,000 economic loss,

00:07:01.094 --> 00:07:03.390
or an economic profit
of negative $100,000.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.208
This isn't saying that
the business or the firm

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:06.722
isn't spinning out money.

00:07:06.722 --> 00:07:07.720
What it is saying,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.291
is it probably doesn't make
sense to run this business

00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:13.208
or at least to run this
business in this way.

00:07:13.208 --> 00:07:15.056
If this was 0, that means,

00:07:15.056 --> 00:07:16.458
hey, it's probably making money,

00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:19.624
but you're kind of neutral
whether it makes sense

00:07:19.624 --> 00:07:21.208
to run it this way or not.

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.390
If it's positive, that means

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.959
it definitely does make sense
to run the firm in this way

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:27.458
and that it is definitely doing better

00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:30.589
than all of the alternatives.

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:32.323
This right over here is saying,

00:07:32.323 --> 00:07:34.456
look, you're making $50,000 a year,

00:07:34.456 --> 00:07:36.374
that's the 50,000 that you have to spend,

00:07:36.374 --> 00:07:37.257
if you're the owner,

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:38.590
or reinvest in the firm.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.991
This is saying, essentially,

00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:42.589
look, you could have
been making more money

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:44.390
than that $150,000.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.722
Instead of making $50,000 doing this,

00:07:45.722 --> 00:07:48.724
you could have been making $100,000 more

00:07:48.724 --> 00:07:50.124
doing something else.

00:07:50.124 --> 00:07:52.056
You are essentially giving up,

00:07:52.056 --> 00:07:56.542
you are giving up $100,000
to do this restaurant.

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.208
If you are a rational decision maker

00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:00.874
and you're really are about
maximizing your profit,

00:08:00.874 --> 00:08:04.874
this actually might not
make so much sense for you.
