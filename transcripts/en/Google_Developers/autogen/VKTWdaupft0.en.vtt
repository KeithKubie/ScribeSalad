good morning I'm Brian McQuaid I'm a

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:05.950
good morning I'm Brian McQuaid I'm a
 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.409
good morning I'm Brian McQuaid I'm a
software engineer at Google I work on

00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:07.419
software engineer at Google I work on
 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:09.150
software engineer at Google I work on
making the mobile web faster and better

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160
making the mobile web faster and better
 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.290
making the mobile web faster and better
and today I'm going to talk about

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.300
and today I'm going to talk about
 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.230
and today I'm going to talk about
building instant mobile web apps so

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240
building instant mobile web apps so
 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.850
building instant mobile web apps so
we'll take the next 30 minutes to cover

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860
we'll take the next 30 minutes to cover
 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.099
we'll take the next 30 minutes to cover
two topics the first will be I'll give

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.109
two topics the first will be I'll give
 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:18.749
two topics the first will be I'll give
an overview of the process my team

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:18.759
an overview of the process my team
 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.640
an overview of the process my team
actually took to optimize one of the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650
actually took to optimize one of the
 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.950
actually took to optimize one of the
apps I work on and then the second half

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960
apps I work on and then the second half
 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.659
apps I work on and then the second half
will sort of take from that some some

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669
will sort of take from that some some
 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.220
will sort of take from that some some
learnings or some generalizations and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230
learnings or some generalizations and
 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.540
learnings or some generalizations and
best practices that hopefully you can

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550
best practices that hopefully you can
 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.059
best practices that hopefully you can
take with you to make your mobile apps

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:30.069
take with you to make your mobile apps
 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:35.599
take with you to make your mobile apps
faster okay so our goal specifically

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:35.609
faster okay so our goal specifically
 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:38.310
faster okay so our goal specifically
more precisely is to render app content

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320
more precisely is to render app content
 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.470
more precisely is to render app content
on the phone in a second so from the

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480
on the phone in a second so from the
 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.660
on the phone in a second so from the
time a user sort of clicks a link to the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670
time a user sort of clicks a link to the
 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.340
time a user sort of clicks a link to the
time they actually sort of start to see

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350
time they actually sort of start to see
 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.529
time they actually sort of start to see
content on your phone and to interact

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539
content on your phone and to interact
 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:47.880
content on your phone and to interact
with it should be about a second and

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890
with it should be about a second and
 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.740
with it should be about a second and
this one second target actually comes

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750
this one second target actually comes
 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.540
this one second target actually comes
from some work linked here at the bottom

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550
from some work linked here at the bottom
 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.860
from some work linked here at the bottom
by Jakob Nielsen hopefully you can see

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870
by Jakob Nielsen hopefully you can see
 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.380
by Jakob Nielsen hopefully you can see
that that talks about some different

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390
that that talks about some different
 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.630
that that talks about some different
thresholds of human perception you know

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640
thresholds of human perception you know
 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.700
thresholds of human perception you know
we're sort of behavior changes and that

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710
we're sort of behavior changes and that
 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.049
we're sort of behavior changes and that
one-second boundary is interesting

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059
one-second boundary is interesting
 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.340
one-second boundary is interesting
because that's the point at which a user

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350
because that's the point at which a user
 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.770
because that's the point at which a user
will start to sort of disengage with

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780
will start to sort of disengage with
 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.359
will start to sort of disengage with
with you know the activity they've

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369
with you know the activity they've
 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.590
with you know the activity they've
initiated they'll start to think about

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600
initiated they'll start to think about
 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.319
initiated they'll start to think about
doing something else and so to keep the

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329
doing something else and so to keep the
 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.859
doing something else and so to keep the
user engaged to keep them you know

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
user engaged to keep them you know
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.969
user engaged to keep them you know
wanting to use your app we want to try

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979
wanting to use your app we want to try
 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.319
wanting to use your app we want to try
to deliver that content as quickly as

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329
to deliver that content as quickly as
 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:16.859
to deliver that content as quickly as
possible

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869
possible
 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.749
possible
ideally within that roughly one second

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759
ideally within that roughly one second
 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.770
ideally within that roughly one second
boundary so a lot of this a lot of what

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780
boundary so a lot of this a lot of what
 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.969
boundary so a lot of this a lot of what
I'm going to talk about is sort of

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979
I'm going to talk about is sort of
 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.440
I'm going to talk about is sort of
focuses on this concept of the critical

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450
focuses on this concept of the critical
 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.969
focuses on this concept of the critical
rendering path which you may have heard

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979
rendering path which you may have heard
 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.590
rendering path which you may have heard
Ilya talk about or others talked about

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600
Ilya talk about or others talked about
 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.690
Ilya talk about or others talked about
at a really high level the critical

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700
at a really high level the critical
 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.280
at a really high level the critical
rendering path is sort of the sequence

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290
rendering path is sort of the sequence
 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.740
rendering path is sort of the sequence
of resources that need to be loaded and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750
of resources that need to be loaded and
 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.770
of resources that need to be loaded and
parsed usually JavaScript and stylesheet

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780
parsed usually JavaScript and stylesheet
 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.480
parsed usually JavaScript and stylesheet
resources that prevent content on the

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490
resources that prevent content on the
 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.679
resources that prevent content on the
page from actually rendering from the

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689
page from actually rendering from the
 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.289
page from actually rendering from the
screen right so so actually it's easiest

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299
screen right so so actually it's easiest
 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.819
screen right so so actually it's easiest
to sort of explain I think with an

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829
to sort of explain I think with an
 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.130
to sort of explain I think with an
example okay so here along the top we've

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140
example okay so here along the top we've
 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.100
example okay so here along the top we've
got kind of a timeline that shows how an

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110
got kind of a timeline that shows how an
 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.420
got kind of a timeline that shows how an
example page that I'm using for this

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430
example page that I'm using for this
 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.330
example page that I'm using for this
example renders over time out to 20

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340
example renders over time out to 20
 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.219
example renders over time out to 20
seconds on a mobile device so we have a

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229
seconds on a mobile device so we have a
 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.660
seconds on a mobile device so we have a
performance problem here and the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670
performance problem here and the
 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.980
performance problem here and the
question becomes well why is it so slow

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990
question becomes well why is it so slow
 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.420
question becomes well why is it so slow
right you know why is it taking nine

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430
right you know why is it taking nine
 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.010
right you know why is it taking nine
seconds to render anything to the screen

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020
seconds to render anything to the screen
 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.139
seconds to render anything to the screen
and why does it take 20 seconds to sort

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149
and why does it take 20 seconds to sort
 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.180
and why does it take 20 seconds to sort
of finish rendering and that's what the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190
of finish rendering and that's what the
 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.860
of finish rendering and that's what the
critical rendering path sort of tries to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870
critical rendering path sort of tries to
 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.520
critical rendering path sort of tries to
answer

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530
answer
 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.740
answer
so if we have an example network

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750
so if we have an example network
 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.880
so if we have an example network
waterfall here we can kind of walk

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890
waterfall here we can kind of walk
 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.230
waterfall here we can kind of walk
through and try to start to make sense

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240
through and try to start to make sense
 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.570
through and try to start to make sense
of what this critical rendering path is

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
of what this critical rendering path is
 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.340
of what this critical rendering path is
all about so we obviously we start by

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350
all about so we obviously we start by
 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.850
all about so we obviously we start by
loading HTML resource that comes back

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860
loading HTML resource that comes back
 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.260
loading HTML resource that comes back
with some content I might have a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270
with some content I might have a
 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.870
with some content I might have a
stylesheet with a script resource and so

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880
stylesheet with a script resource and so
 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.430
stylesheet with a script resource and so
at this point we have sort of like I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440
at this point we have sort of like I
 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.660
at this point we have sort of like I
said you know the critical path includes

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670
said you know the critical path includes
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.020
said you know the critical path includes
usually scripting styles these resources

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030
usually scripting styles these resources
 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.730
usually scripting styles these resources
block the browser from actually painting

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740
block the browser from actually painting
 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.470
block the browser from actually painting
content to the screen so well a style

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480
content to the screen so well a style

wait for that stylesheet to load before

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810
wait for that stylesheet to load before
 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.300
wait for that stylesheet to load before
it actually paints any content to the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310
it actually paints any content to the
 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.670
it actually paints any content to the
screen so we can't paint anything until

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680
screen so we can't paint anything until
 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.320
screen so we can't paint anything until
these resources finish loading

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330
 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.280
imagine that you know we send out the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290
imagine that you know we send out the
 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.020
imagine that you know we send out the
request for both of those the response

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030
request for both of those the response
 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.250
request for both of those the response
comes back to the JavaScript at nine

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260
comes back to the JavaScript at nine
 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.850
comes back to the JavaScript at nine
seconds and at that point you know we

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860
seconds and at that point you know we
 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.960
seconds and at that point you know we
can begin to paint something to the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970
can begin to paint something to the
 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.130
can begin to paint something to the
screen right it may not be the content

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140
screen right it may not be the content

screen right it may not be the content
the user actually wants unfortunately

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730
the user actually wants unfortunately

the user actually wants unfortunately
that's sort of at the end but we've sort

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530
that's sort of at the end but we've sort
 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.410
that's sort of at the end but we've sort
of started to paint and then from there

imagine that javascript resource adds

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940
imagine that javascript resource adds

just a toy example but so the question

just a toy example but so the question
 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.950
just a toy example but so the question

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250
doing great but the first thing we did
 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.830
doing great but the first thing we did
was we wanted to see exactly how how

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840
was we wanted to see exactly how how
 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.080
was we wanted to see exactly how how
poorly we were doing right and so what

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090
poorly we were doing right and so what
 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.610
poorly we were doing right and so what
we saw really surprised us it was it was

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620
we saw really surprised us it was it was
 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.070
we saw really surprised us it was it was
worse than we expected you know now you

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080
worse than we expected you know now you
 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.750
worse than we expected you know now you
can see where the example comes from I

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760

long to load so we started to look at
 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.000
long to load so we started to look at
the markup you know we saw we had some

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010

but this isn't all that uncommon right

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580
but this isn't all that uncommon right
 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.980
but this isn't all that uncommon right
you see this in lots of apps so there's

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990
you see this in lots of apps so there's
 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.510
you see this in lots of apps so there's
nothing that really stood out here as

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520
nothing that really stood out here as
 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.060
nothing that really stood out here as
being particularly costly so we went

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070
being particularly costly so we went
 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.270
being particularly costly so we went
back to our time line then we looked at

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280
back to our time line then we looked at
 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.160
back to our time line then we looked at
a network waterfall right you can see we

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170
a network waterfall right you can see we
 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.190
a network waterfall right you can see we

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.390

question came up you know okay well

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400
question came up you know okay well
 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.520
question came up you know okay well
we're loading all these resources but

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530
we're loading all these resources but
 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.080
we're loading all these resources but
which of these resources are actually

you know which of these are on sort of

you know which of these are on sort of
 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.990
you know which of these are on sort of

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.130
one of the things that PageSpeed
insights actually does today is it can

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140
insights actually does today is it can
 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.480
insights actually does today is it can
tell you what what resource which

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490
tell you what what resource which
 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.920
tell you what what resource which
resources are on the critical rendering

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930
resources are on the critical rendering
 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.890
resources are on the critical rendering
path and so we can go here we can click

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900
path and so we can go here we can click
 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.280
path and so we can go here we can click
through and we can see you know we've

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290
through and we can see you know we've
 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.990
through and we can see you know we've
got these JavaScript resources these CSS

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000
got these JavaScript resources these CSS
 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.070
got these JavaScript resources these CSS
resources that are on that critical

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080
resources that are on that critical
 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.750
resources that are on that critical
rendering path that block rendering of

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760
rendering path that block rendering of
 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.150
rendering path that block rendering of
content on the screen and then use that

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160
content on the screen and then use that
 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160
content on the screen and then use that
to go back to our waterfall and start to

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170
to go back to our waterfall and start to
 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.790
to go back to our waterfall and start to
focus on you know which resources

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800
focus on you know which resources
 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.110
focus on you know which resources
actually block rendering right so now we

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120
actually block rendering right so now we
 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.010
actually block rendering right so now we
have

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020
have
 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.470
have
about a dozen resources to focus on and

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480
about a dozen resources to focus on and
 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.300
about a dozen resources to focus on and
we know we're able to focus more

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310
we know we're able to focus more
 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.800
we know we're able to focus more
precisely on you know what are the

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810
precisely on you know what are the
 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.060
precisely on you know what are the
render blocking effects of these

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070
render blocking effects of these
 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.440
render blocking effects of these
resources and then how do we address

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450
resources and then how do we address
 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.660
resources and then how do we address
those and so we can begin to sort of

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670
those and so we can begin to sort of
 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.440
those and so we can begin to sort of
match up here right we've got some

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450
match up here right we've got some
 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.240
match up here right we've got some
content that loads before this sort of 9

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250
content that loads before this sort of 9
 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.950
content that loads before this sort of 9
second first pane we can start to notice

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960
second first pane we can start to notice
 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.240
second first pane we can start to notice
you know okay well you know which of

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.250
you know okay well you know which of
 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.740
you know okay well you know which of
those resources are blocking that point

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750
those resources are blocking that point
 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.350
those resources are blocking that point
I'll get into that in just a minute but

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360
I'll get into that in just a minute but
 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.430
I'll get into that in just a minute but
this was sort of the starting point for

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440
this was sort of the starting point for
 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.420
this was sort of the starting point for
us was sort of looking at this and

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430
us was sort of looking at this and
 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.760
us was sort of looking at this and
figuring out okay well you know how do

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770
figuring out okay well you know how do
 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.440
figuring out okay well you know how do
we optimize the critical rendering path

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:10.450
we optimize the critical rendering path
 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:17.910
we optimize the critical rendering path
for this page and so you know we at a

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:17.920
for this page and so you know we at a
 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.170
for this page and so you know we at a
high level we felt like we had sort of

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180
high level we felt like we had sort of
 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.650
high level we felt like we had sort of
two two problems here one was that we

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660
two two problems here one was that we
 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.730
two two problems here one was that we
had a bunch of render blocking

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740
had a bunch of render blocking
 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.830
had a bunch of render blocking
JavaScript and CSS loaded in a way that

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840
JavaScript and CSS loaded in a way that
 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.860
JavaScript and CSS loaded in a way that
blocked any content at all from

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:28.870
blocked any content at all from
 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.720
blocked any content at all from
rendering the page rendering on the page

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:30.730
rendering the page rendering on the page
 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.030
rendering the page rendering on the page
right so this block of this block of

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.040
right so this block of this block of
 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.590
right so this block of this block of
JavaScript and CSS here which was you

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:34.600
JavaScript and CSS here which was you
 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.690
JavaScript and CSS here which was you
know declared in the head of the HTML

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:36.700
know declared in the head of the HTML
 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.150
know declared in the head of the HTML
all had to be downloaded parsed and

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.160
all had to be downloaded parsed and
 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.860
all had to be downloaded parsed and
executed in order for anything at all to

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:40.870
executed in order for anything at all to
 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.660
executed in order for anything at all to
render on the screen right and as we

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:42.670
render on the screen right and as we
 

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.610
render on the screen right and as we
know mobile networks have really high

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:44.620
know mobile networks have really high
 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.990
know mobile networks have really high
latency so you know downloading

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000
latency so you know downloading
 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.190
latency so you know downloading
additional resources has a pretty

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.200
additional resources has a pretty
 

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.570
additional resources has a pretty
significant you know pretty high cost

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:51.580
significant you know pretty high cost
 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.640
significant you know pretty high cost
all the while your users are you know

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:53.650
all the while your users are you know
 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.080
all the while your users are you know
looking at a blank screen waiting and

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.090
looking at a blank screen waiting and
 

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.920
looking at a blank screen waiting and
wondering if your app is working

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:55.930
wondering if your app is working
 

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.320
wondering if your app is working
thinking about transitioning way to do

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.330
thinking about transitioning way to do
 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.050
thinking about transitioning way to do
something else right so for us and I'll

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.060
something else right so for us and I'll
 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.220
something else right so for us and I'll
show in a little more detail in a minute

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.230
show in a little more detail in a minute
 

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.200
show in a little more detail in a minute
what we concluded we needed to do is

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.210
what we concluded we needed to do is
 

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.600
what we concluded we needed to do is
basically eliminate all of these

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:06.610
basically eliminate all of these
 

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.070
basically eliminate all of these
resources from render being render

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080
resources from render being render
 

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.020
resources from render being render
blocking and that amounted to doing two

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.030
blocking and that amounted to doing two
 

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.690
blocking and that amounted to doing two
things which will dive into loading our

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:12.700
things which will dive into loading our
 

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.590
things which will dive into loading our
render blocking JavaScript

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:13.600
render blocking JavaScript
 

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.660
render blocking JavaScript
asynchronously and then really thinking

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:15.670
asynchronously and then really thinking
 

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.280
asynchronously and then really thinking
about what is the minimal amount of CSS

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:17.290
about what is the minimal amount of CSS
 

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.020
about what is the minimal amount of CSS
we actually need to render this out and

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.030
we actually need to render this out and
 

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.360
we actually need to render this out and
loading that in a blocking way but

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.370
loading that in a blocking way but
 

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.650
loading that in a blocking way but
making sure we weren't loading any more

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:22.660
making sure we weren't loading any more
 

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.210
making sure we weren't loading any more
than we needed in a render blocking way

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:24.220
than we needed in a render blocking way
 

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.560
than we needed in a render blocking way
and then right and so recall this as the

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:28.570
and then right and so recall this as the
 

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.910
and then right and so recall this as the
screen shot that sort of was associated

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:29.920
screen shot that sort of was associated
 

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.440
screen shot that sort of was associated
with that point in the in the in the

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:31.450
with that point in the in the in the
 

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.350
with that point in the in the in the
page load thing to note here is that you

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360
page load thing to note here is that you
 

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.270
page load thing to note here is that you
know we hadn't actually rendered the

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:36.280
know we hadn't actually rendered the
 

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.620
know we hadn't actually rendered the
content the user really cared about that

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:37.630
content the user really cared about that
 

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.620
content the user really cared about that
text box to interact with the app yet so

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:40.630
text box to interact with the app yet so
 

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.110
text box to interact with the app yet so
the second issue was we were actually

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120
the second issue was we were actually
 

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.060
the second issue was we were actually
rendering that sort of critical content

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.070
rendering that sort of critical content
 

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.630
rendering that sort of critical content
the text box you know the user could use

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640
the text box you know the user could use
 

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.370
the text box you know the user could use
to actually analyze a page using a

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:50.380
to actually analyze a page using a
 

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.050
to actually analyze a page using a
JavaScript resource right we had to

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:52.060
JavaScript resource right we had to
 

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.390
JavaScript resource right we had to
download a large chunk of JavaScript

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:54.400
download a large chunk of JavaScript
 

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.470
download a large chunk of JavaScript
download parse and execute that

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480
download parse and execute that
 

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.060
download parse and execute that
JavaScript before we actually render

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.070
JavaScript before we actually render
 

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.920
JavaScript before we actually render
that you know using javascript to

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:58.930
that you know using javascript to
 

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.260
that you know using javascript to
construct the dom so this added another

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:01.270
construct the dom so this added another
 

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.700
construct the dom so this added another
roughly you know ten seconds of latency

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:02.710
roughly you know ten seconds of latency
 

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.530
roughly you know ten seconds of latency
here before we could get to this point

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:04.540
here before we could get to this point
 

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.750
here before we could get to this point
so all in all you know we had sort of

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:06.760
so all in all you know we had sort of
 

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.840
so all in all you know we had sort of
two at a high level these two problems

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:09.850
two at a high level these two problems
 

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.870
two at a high level these two problems
and so we sat down and we tried to sort

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880
and so we sat down and we tried to sort
 

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.880
and so we sat down and we tried to sort
of address these things the thing we did

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:14.890
of address these things the thing we did
 

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.290
of address these things the thing we did
for this was we realized well you know

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:16.300
for this was we realized well you know
 

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.340
for this was we realized well you know
most of the content you know we're

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:17.350
most of the content you know we're
 

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.540
most of the content you know we're
rendering it with JavaScript and that's

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:18.550
rendering it with JavaScript and that's
 

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.560
rendering it with JavaScript and that's
fine and great but it just wasn't

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:19.570
fine and great but it just wasn't
 

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.920
fine and great but it just wasn't
performant and so what we did is we

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:21.930
performant and so what we did is we
 

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.750
performant and so what we did is we
inlined that initial view right so the

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760
inlined that initial view right so the
 

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.520
inlined that initial view right so the
or I should say we put the initial views

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:26.530
or I should say we put the initial views
 

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.700
or I should say we put the initial views
HTML markup directly in the HTML no

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:29.710
HTML markup directly in the HTML no
 

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.080
HTML markup directly in the HTML no
longer depending on JavaScript to

longer depending on JavaScript to
 

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.030
longer depending on JavaScript to
actually render that which allowed us to

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040
actually render that which allowed us to
 

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.650
actually render that which allowed us to
you know just present that to the user

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:34.660
you know just present that to the user
 

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.330
you know just present that to the user
that much faster without having to wait

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:36.340
that much faster without having to wait
 

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.460
that much faster without having to wait
for that render blocking JavaScript to

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:38.470
for that render blocking JavaScript to
 

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.340
for that render blocking JavaScript to
load so I just want to show a quick

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:41.350
load so I just want to show a quick
 

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.550

before-and-after you know here's that

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560
before-and-after you know here's that
 

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.840
before-and-after you know here's that
HTML markup for the original page that

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:45.850
HTML markup for the original page that
 

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.580
HTML markup for the original page that
took 19 seconds at least part of it

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:47.590
took 19 seconds at least part of it
 

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:48.930
took 19 seconds at least part of it
right we've got our render blocking

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:48.940
right we've got our render blocking
 

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.120
right we've got our render blocking
JavaScript in the head we've got some

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.130
JavaScript in the head we've got some
 

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:56.910
JavaScript in the head we've got some
markup for the content but we don't have

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920

you'll notice the input box right that

00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.020
you'll notice the input box right that
 

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.450
you'll notice the input box right that
was rendered with JavaScript so some of

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:00.460
was rendered with JavaScript so some of
 

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.830
was rendered with JavaScript so some of
that comes later the sort of after case

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:03.840
that comes later the sort of after case
 

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.600
that comes later the sort of after case
here we've got a slightly different

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:06.610
here we've got a slightly different
 

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.670
here we've got a slightly different
markup right first we've got an inline

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680
markup right first we've got an inline
 

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.620
markup right first we've got an inline
style block that contains the CSS we

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:10.630
style block that contains the CSS we
 

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.150
style block that contains the CSS we
need to style the content the initial

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160
need to style the content the initial
 

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
need to style the content the initial
view so we don't have to go to network

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:14.170
view so we don't have to go to network
 

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.930
view so we don't have to go to network
to download additional style sheets

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:15.940
to download additional style sheets
 

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:16.950
to download additional style sheets
which you know will incur additional

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:16.960
which you know will incur additional
 

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.900
which you know will incur additional
mobile network round trips which are

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:18.910
mobile network round trips which are
 

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.510
mobile network round trips which are
significantly slower or significantly

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:21.520
significantly slower or significantly
 

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.540
significantly slower or significantly
slow down the page load and then as I

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:24.550
slow down the page load and then as I
 

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.680
slow down the page load and then as I
mentioned you know now we've made sure

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:25.690
mentioned you know now we've made sure
 

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.260
mentioned you know now we've made sure
that all the markup we need to render

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:28.270
that all the markup we need to render
 

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.730
that all the markup we need to render
this sort of above the fold content is

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:29.740
this sort of above the fold content is
 

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.500
this sort of above the fold content is
directly in HTML we're not using

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:31.510
directly in HTML we're not using
 

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.360
directly in HTML we're not using
javascript to render any of this content

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.370
javascript to render any of this content
 

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.030
javascript to render any of this content
and then finally you know because we're

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.040
and then finally you know because we're
 

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.730
and then finally you know because we're
including all the markup we need to

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:38.740
including all the markup we need to
 

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.380
including all the markup we need to
render the initial view directly in HTML

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:40.390
render the initial view directly in HTML
 

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.210
render the initial view directly in HTML
we can load our JavaScript

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:42.220
we can load our JavaScript
 

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.430
we can load our JavaScript
asynchronously because we don't need it

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440
asynchronously because we don't need it
 

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.750
asynchronously because we don't need it
to render so we don't want it to block

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760
to render so we don't want it to block
 

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.340
to render so we don't want it to block
rendering of the initial presentation so

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:50.350
rendering of the initial presentation so
 

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.630
rendering of the initial presentation so
that at a high level is the process we

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:51.640
that at a high level is the process we
 

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.580
that at a high level is the process we
went through and so the question is you

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:53.590
went through and so the question is you
 

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.200
went through and so the question is you
know how do we do do we actually speed

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.210
know how do we do do we actually speed
 

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.550
know how do we do do we actually speed
the page up so here's the waterfall for

00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560
the page up so here's the waterfall for
 

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.140
the page up so here's the waterfall for
the original page we've got about 25

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:01.150
the original page we've got about 25
 

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:05.190
the original page we've got about 25
resources in total and then here's the

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200
resources in total and then here's the
 

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.410
resources in total and then here's the
waterfall for this sort of rewrite that

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:07.420
waterfall for this sort of rewrite that
 

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.310
waterfall for this sort of rewrite that
was focused on

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320
was focused on
 

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.810
was focused on
delivering a really fast experience on

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:09.820
delivering a really fast experience on
 

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.430
delivering a really fast experience on
mobile and you can see we've got about

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440
mobile and you can see we've got about
 

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.620
mobile and you can see we've got about
20 resources now right so we had 25

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:13.630
20 resources now right so we had 25
 

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.640
20 resources now right so we had 25
before 20 now it's not really

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:17.650
before 20 now it's not really
 

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:18.870
before 20 now it's not really
significantly different if you look at

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880
significantly different if you look at
 

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.400
significantly different if you look at
the total waterfall size total number

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:20.410
the total waterfall size total number
 

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:21.810
the total waterfall size total number
requests right but but I think what's

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:21.820
requests right but but I think what's
 

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.550
requests right but but I think what's
really important here is looking not at

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:23.560
really important here is looking not at
 

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.560
really important here is looking not at
the total number of quests but the

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:25.570
the total number of quests but the
 

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.940
the total number of quests but the
relative size of the two critical paths

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:26.950
relative size of the two critical paths
 

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.380
relative size of the two critical paths
between the critical rendering path

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:28.390
between the critical rendering path
 

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.140
between the critical rendering path
between the two pages right so in the

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.150
between the two pages right so in the
 

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.670
between the two pages right so in the
old example we had a bunch of resources

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680
old example we had a bunch of resources
 

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.260
old example we had a bunch of resources
here we've got everything we need to

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:34.270
here we've got everything we need to
 

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.210
here we've got everything we need to
render the initial view in the HTML

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:36.220
render the initial view in the HTML
 

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.370
render the initial view in the HTML
payload so the critical path the

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:38.380
payload so the critical path the
 

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.590
payload so the critical path the
critical rendering path is this one HTML

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600
critical rendering path is this one HTML
 

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.240
critical rendering path is this one HTML
resource and we can render you know much

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.250
resource and we can render you know much
 

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.490
resource and we can render you know much
more quickly than in the original case

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:44.500
more quickly than in the original case
 

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.700
more quickly than in the original case
where we had a dozen resources so we

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:47.710
where we had a dozen resources so we
 

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:48.900
where we had a dozen resources so we
often talk about you know well okay

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:48.910
often talk about you know well okay
 

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.670
often talk about you know well okay
reducing requests is sort of a goal and

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680
reducing requests is sort of a goal and
 

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.380
reducing requests is sort of a goal and
with performance and with optimisation

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:52.390
with performance and with optimisation
 

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.850
with performance and with optimisation
but I think what's more important is to

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:53.860
but I think what's more important is to
 

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.990
but I think what's more important is to
think about reducing the number of

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.000
think about reducing the number of
 

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.760
think about reducing the number of
requests on the critical rendering path

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:56.770
requests on the critical rendering path
 

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.850
requests on the critical rendering path
that's really where you you know will

00:11:59.850 --> 00:11:59.860
that's really where you you know will
 

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.130
that's really where you you know will
see your big returns so let's look let's

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:02.140
see your big returns so let's look let's
 

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.810
see your big returns so let's look let's
do a sort of a side-by-side you know

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:03.820
do a sort of a side-by-side you know
 

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.900
do a sort of a side-by-side you know
before and after so the optimized case

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:05.910
before and after so the optimized case
 

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.550
before and after so the optimized case
we start to render in about a second and

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560
we start to render in about a second and
 

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.960
we start to render in about a second and
a half and we're completely done at

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:09.970
a half and we're completely done at
 

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.370
a half and we're completely done at
three seconds all the images everything

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:11.380
three seconds all the images everything
 

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.170
three seconds all the images everything
have come back and recall the original

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:13.180
have come back and recall the original
 

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.900
have come back and recall the original
case you know we're still waiting right

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:15.910
case you know we're still waiting right
 

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.340
case you know we're still waiting right
we can't actually really interact with

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:17.350
we can't actually really interact with
 

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.660
we can't actually really interact with
the app even at this point because we

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:18.670
the app even at this point because we
 

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.750
the app even at this point because we
don't have the text box right so we were

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760
don't have the text box right so we were
 

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.500
don't have the text box right so we were
able to reduce the you know render time

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:28.510
able to reduce the you know render time
 

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.090
able to reduce the you know render time
down from about you know 20 seconds down

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:30.100
down from about you know 20 seconds down
 

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.560
down from about you know 20 seconds down
to one or one and a half seconds right

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:31.570
to one or one and a half seconds right
 

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.380
to one or one and a half seconds right
so we more or less accomplished our goal

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:33.390
so we more or less accomplished our goal
 

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.550
so we more or less accomplished our goal
so that's you know the process we went

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560
so that's you know the process we went
 

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.200
so that's you know the process we went
through and now I'm going to spend a

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:37.210
through and now I'm going to spend a
 

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.560
through and now I'm going to spend a
little time talking about the process of

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:40.570
little time talking about the process of
 

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.570
little time talking about the process of
optimizing your apps content so you know

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:42.580
optimizing your apps content so you know
 

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.710

the first thing we sort of identified as

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000
the first thing we sort of identified as
 

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.240
the first thing we sort of identified as
an important best practice is to load

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.250
an important best practice is to load
 

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.860
an important best practice is to load
scripts asynchronously right so don't

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:55.870
scripts asynchronously right so don't
 

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.230
scripts asynchronously right so don't
load scripts in a way that blocks

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240
load scripts in a way that blocks
 

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.380

00:13:56.609 --> 00:13:56.619
downloading and then go ahead and just
 

00:13:56.619 --> 00:13:58.979
downloading and then go ahead and just
proceed parsing the rest of the document

00:13:58.979 --> 00:13:58.989
proceed parsing the rest of the document
 

00:13:58.989 --> 00:14:00.840
proceed parsing the rest of the document
and render that content to the user as

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:00.850
and render that content to the user as
 

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.309
and render that content to the user as
quickly as you can right so this this

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:02.319

rendering path which is a really
important thing to do so I'll say there

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:10.209
important thing to do so I'll say there
 

00:14:10.209 --> 00:14:13.049
important thing to do so I'll say there
are some subtleties here it's not it's

this is a really dangerous thing to do
 

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.900
this is a really dangerous thing to do

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:21.910
and there are other you know sort of
 

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.789
and there are other you know sort of
subtleties that I'd be happy to talk

subtleties that I'd be happy to talk
 

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:26.460
subtleties that I'd be happy to talk
about at the sort of session and I guess

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:26.470
about at the sort of session and I guess
 

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.199
about at the sort of session and I guess

know you'll recall we had about six

00:14:35.369 --> 00:14:35.379
know you'll recall we had about six
 

00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:36.840
know you'll recall we had about six
seconds of render blocking javascript

seconds of render blocking javascript
 

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.169
seconds of render blocking javascript
and CSS but then we had ten seconds to

00:14:40.169 --> 00:14:40.179
and CSS but then we had ten seconds to
 

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:42.119
and CSS but then we had ten seconds to

resource download parse and executed
before the app finished rendering right

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:45.850
before the app finished rendering right
 

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.879
before the app finished rendering right
and the problem was we were loading this

00:14:47.879 --> 00:14:47.889
and the problem was we were loading this
 

00:14:47.889 --> 00:14:50.189
and the problem was we were loading this

big javascript bundle whose job it was
to actually construct the dom right so

00:14:51.419 --> 00:14:51.429
to actually construct the dom right so
 

00:14:51.429 --> 00:14:53.189
to actually construct the dom right so
we have to go to network in order to

00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199
we have to go to network in order to
 

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:54.710
we have to go to network in order to
create the dom that the user would see

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720
create the dom that the user would see
 

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.819
create the dom that the user would see
and this is just unfortunately an

00:14:56.819 --> 00:14:56.829
and this is just unfortunately an
 

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:58.409
and this is just unfortunately an
inherently slow process on mobile

00:14:58.409 --> 00:14:58.419
inherently slow process on mobile
 

00:14:58.419 --> 00:15:01.409
inherently slow process on mobile
rendering client-side so I'll let's talk

00:15:01.409 --> 00:15:01.419
rendering client-side so I'll let's talk
 

00:15:01.419 --> 00:15:03.210
rendering client-side so I'll let's talk
about so what do we mean by server-side

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:03.220
about so what do we mean by server-side
 

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.379
about so what do we mean by server-side
rendering versus client-side rendering

00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:04.389
rendering versus client-side rendering
 

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:06.329
rendering versus client-side rendering
so client-side rendering you're using

00:15:06.329 --> 00:15:06.339
so client-side rendering you're using
 

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:09.929
so client-side rendering you're using
JavaScript right to actually render the

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:09.939
JavaScript right to actually render the
 

00:15:09.939 --> 00:15:11.699
JavaScript right to actually render the
content in the document right so here we

00:15:11.699 --> 00:15:11.709
content in the document right so here we
 

00:15:11.709 --> 00:15:15.599
content in the document right so here we
load app j/s the dom itself doesn't

00:15:15.599 --> 00:15:15.609
load app j/s the dom itself doesn't
 

00:15:15.609 --> 00:15:17.369
load app j/s the dom itself doesn't
really contain any markup it doesn't

00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:17.379
really contain any markup it doesn't
 

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:18.869
really contain any markup it doesn't
contain market that you can see on the

00:15:18.869 --> 00:15:18.879

screen it's just got a placeholder div
and then when app dot j s finishes

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:24.009
and then when app dot j s finishes
 

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:26.609
and then when app dot j s finishes
loading we might get something like this

00:15:26.609 --> 00:15:26.619
loading we might get something like this
 

00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:28.259
loading we might get something like this
that actually constructs the dom you

00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:28.269
that actually constructs the dom you
 

00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:29.609
that actually constructs the dom you
know once that resource finishes loading

00:15:29.609 --> 00:15:29.619
know once that resource finishes loading
 

00:15:29.619 --> 00:15:32.430
know once that resource finishes loading
right by contrast

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440
right by contrast
 

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.560
right by contrast
server-side rendering you know

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:34.570
server-side rendering you know
 

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.400
server-side rendering you know
everything that we need to display in

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:36.410
everything that we need to display in
 

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.350
everything that we need to display in
the initial view is present right in the

the initial view is present right in the
 

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.840
the initial view is present right in the
HTML markup and so no additional

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:40.850
HTML markup and so no additional
 

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.130
HTML markup and so no additional
resources are needed right as soon as

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:42.140
resources are needed right as soon as
 

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.079
resources are needed right as soon as
that HTML comes back we can render that

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:44.089
that HTML comes back we can render that
 

00:15:44.089 --> 00:15:45.430
that HTML comes back we can render that
to the screen and the user sees it as

00:18:56.389 --> 00:18:56.399
development team or you know pitch in
 

00:18:56.399 --> 00:18:58.610
development team or you know pitch in
and help out to make it easy to do that

00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620
and help out to make it easy to do that
 

00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.990
and help out to make it easy to do that
as part of you know using that framework

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000
as part of you know using that framework
 

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.080
as part of you know using that framework
so you can take advantage of this

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.090
so you can take advantage of this
 

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:07.940
so you can take advantage of this
automatically so the third area I want

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:07.950
automatically so the third area I want
 

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.100
automatically so the third area I want
to talk about is minimizing render

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:10.110
to talk about is minimizing render
 

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.960
to talk about is minimizing render
blocking CSS and this is I think this is

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:11.970
blocking CSS and this is I think this is
 

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.690
blocking CSS and this is I think this is
the topic we get the most questions on

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700
the topic we get the most questions on
 

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.100
the topic we get the most questions on
so I'm going to go through a couple

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:16.110
so I'm going to go through a couple
 

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.680
so I'm going to go through a couple
common questions here the first of which

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:18.690
common questions here the first of which
 

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.700
common questions here the first of which
you know people say well what do you

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:19.710
you know people say well what do you
 

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.289
you know people say well what do you
mean CSS is blocking you know why is

00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299
mean CSS is blocking you know why is
 

00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:22.700
mean CSS is blocking you know why is
this part of this blocking critical

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:22.710
this part of this blocking critical
 

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.649
this part of this blocking critical
rendering path JavaScript locks yes but

00:19:24.649 --> 00:19:24.659
rendering path JavaScript locks yes but
 

00:19:24.659 --> 00:19:27.950
rendering path JavaScript locks yes but
what do you mean CSS blocks and it's

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960
what do you mean CSS blocks and it's
 

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.330
what do you mean CSS blocks and it's
correct that you know JavaScript blocks

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340
correct that you know JavaScript blocks
 

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.950
correct that you know JavaScript blocks
down create dom tree construction right

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960
down create dom tree construction right
 

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.409
down create dom tree construction right
javascript blocks the parser but

00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419
javascript blocks the parser but
 

00:19:33.419 --> 00:19:35.869
javascript blocks the parser but
stylesheets block render tree

00:19:35.869 --> 00:19:35.879
stylesheets block render tree
 

00:19:35.879 --> 00:19:37.999
stylesheets block render tree
construction right so ultimately in

00:19:37.999 --> 00:19:38.009
construction right so ultimately in
 

00:19:38.009 --> 00:19:39.799
construction right so ultimately in
order to layout in paint we need the

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:39.809
order to layout in paint we need the
 

00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:41.480
order to layout in paint we need the
stylesheet to have finished loading and

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:41.490
stylesheet to have finished loading and
 

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.820
stylesheet to have finished loading and
what your users care about is content

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:43.830
what your users care about is content
 

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.669
what your users care about is content
painted to the screen right so for them

00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679
painted to the screen right so for them
 

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:48.019
painted to the screen right so for them
javascript is read I'm sorry style

00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:48.029
javascript is read I'm sorry style
 

00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:50.659
javascript is read I'm sorry style
sheets are render blocking right so it's

00:19:50.659 --> 00:19:50.669
sheets are render blocking right so it's
 

00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:51.950
sheets are render blocking right so it's
important to sort of keep this in mind

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960
important to sort of keep this in mind
 

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.330
important to sort of keep this in mind
right if you load a large stylesheet in

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:53.340
right if you load a large stylesheet in
 

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.070
right if you load a large stylesheet in
the head that's going to delay the time

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080
the head that's going to delay the time
 

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.909
the head that's going to delay the time
it takes to paint content to the screen

00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919
it takes to paint content to the screen
 

00:19:57.919 --> 00:19:59.560
it takes to paint content to the screen
so

00:19:59.560 --> 00:19:59.570
so
 

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:04.820
so
ja CSS is render blocking so what's

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:04.830
ja CSS is render blocking so what's
 

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.039
ja CSS is render blocking so what's
critical CSS what is this we talked

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:07.049
critical CSS what is this we talked
 

00:20:07.049 --> 00:20:08.539
critical CSS what is this we talked
about this concept of critical CSS you

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:08.549
about this concept of critical CSS you
 

00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:09.499
about this concept of critical CSS you
may have heard it sort of goes along

00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:09.509
may have heard it sort of goes along
 

00:20:09.509 --> 00:20:12.349
may have heard it sort of goes along
with the critical rendering path and how

00:20:12.349 --> 00:20:12.359
with the critical rendering path and how
 

00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:15.680
with the critical rendering path and how
to identify my critical CSS so critical

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:15.690
to identify my critical CSS so critical
 

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.950
to identify my critical CSS so critical
CSS you can think of as the minimal CSS

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960
CSS you can think of as the minimal CSS
 

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.509
CSS you can think of as the minimal CSS
you need to actually sort of position

00:20:20.509 --> 00:20:20.519
you need to actually sort of position
 

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.459
you need to actually sort of position
and style content in the initial view of

00:20:22.459 --> 00:20:22.469
and style content in the initial view of
 

00:20:22.469 --> 00:20:25.009
and style content in the initial view of
your app right so everything you need to

00:20:25.009 --> 00:20:25.019
your app right so everything you need to
 

00:20:25.019 --> 00:20:27.609
your app right so everything you need to
present that flash of unstyled content

00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:27.619
present that flash of unstyled content
 

00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:29.539
present that flash of unstyled content
for the content that you display

00:20:29.539 --> 00:20:29.549
for the content that you display
 

00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:31.789
for the content that you display
initially to the user the idea here is

00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799
initially to the user the idea here is
 

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:34.549
initially to the user the idea here is
that because we know CSS is render

00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559
that because we know CSS is render
 

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:36.379
that because we know CSS is render
blocking we want to minimize the amount

00:20:36.379 --> 00:20:36.389
blocking we want to minimize the amount
 

00:20:36.389 --> 00:20:38.899
blocking we want to minimize the amount
of CSS that we serve up to the user in

00:20:38.899 --> 00:20:38.909
of CSS that we serve up to the user in
 

00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:40.249
of CSS that we serve up to the user in
order to minimize the sort of size of

00:20:40.249 --> 00:20:40.259
order to minimize the sort of size of
 

00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:42.169
order to minimize the sort of size of
the critical path and get the content to

00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179
the critical path and get the content to
 

00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:43.810
the critical path and get the content to
display as quickly as possible so

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:43.820
display as quickly as possible so
 

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.799
display as quickly as possible so
identifying critical CSS I'll talk about

00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:45.809
identifying critical CSS I'll talk about
 

00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:49.999
identifying critical CSS I'll talk about
this people you know people often ask

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:50.009
this people you know people often ask
 

00:20:50.009 --> 00:20:51.440
this people you know people often ask
the question why have all the CSS I need

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:51.450
the question why have all the CSS I need
 

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.450
the question why have all the CSS I need
all of it what do you mean critical you

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:53.460
all of it what do you mean critical you
 

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.609
all of it what do you mean critical you
know how do I know what's critical and

00:20:55.609 --> 00:20:55.619
know how do I know what's critical and
 

00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:58.249
know how do I know what's critical and
what's not so again critical CSS is that

00:20:58.249 --> 00:20:58.259
what's not so again critical CSS is that
 

00:20:58.259 --> 00:21:00.289
what's not so again critical CSS is that
needed to position in style content the

00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299
needed to position in style content the
 

00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:02.450
needed to position in style content the
initial view you know so imagine we have

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460
initial view you know so imagine we have
 

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.419
initial view you know so imagine we have
this alert CSS rule and then we've got

00:21:05.419 --> 00:21:05.429
this alert CSS rule and then we've got
 

00:21:05.429 --> 00:21:06.979
this alert CSS rule and then we've got
this markup served up in the initial

00:21:06.979 --> 00:21:06.989
this markup served up in the initial
 

00:21:06.989 --> 00:21:09.019
this markup served up in the initial
HTML so it's going to be visible in the

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:09.029
HTML so it's going to be visible in the
 

00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:12.129
HTML so it's going to be visible in the
initial view that references that rule

00:21:12.129 --> 00:21:12.139
initial view that references that rule
 

00:21:12.139 --> 00:21:15.829
initial view that references that rule
we expect it to look like this on the

00:21:15.829 --> 00:21:15.839
we expect it to look like this on the
 

00:21:15.839 --> 00:21:17.659
we expect it to look like this on the
page initially right we expected to have

00:21:17.659 --> 00:21:17.669
page initially right we expected to have
 

00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:19.999
page initially right we expected to have
their proper stylings a good way to ask

00:21:19.999 --> 00:21:20.009
their proper stylings a good way to ask
 

00:21:20.009 --> 00:21:21.289
their proper stylings a good way to ask
yourself you know is this critical CSS

00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:21.299
yourself you know is this critical CSS
 

00:21:21.299 --> 00:21:23.119
yourself you know is this critical CSS
or not it's ask well if I took this rule

00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:23.129
or not it's ask well if I took this rule
 

00:21:23.129 --> 00:21:24.769
or not it's ask well if I took this rule
out of the payload right would my

00:21:24.769 --> 00:21:24.779
out of the payload right would my
 

00:21:24.779 --> 00:21:26.690
out of the payload right would my
initial view with the content I serve to

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700
initial view with the content I serve to
 

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.719
initial view with the content I serve to
the user initially look correctly and in

00:21:29.719 --> 00:21:29.729
the user initially look correctly and in
 

00:21:29.729 --> 00:21:31.909
the user initially look correctly and in
this case obviously if we took that rule

00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919
this case obviously if we took that rule
 

00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:33.979
this case obviously if we took that rule
out it would sort of get the default

00:21:33.979 --> 00:21:33.989
out it would sort of get the default
 

00:21:33.989 --> 00:21:37.359
out it would sort of get the default
stylings and look totally wrong right so

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:37.369
stylings and look totally wrong right so
 

00:21:37.369 --> 00:21:40.879
stylings and look totally wrong right so
clearly we need the CSS to style content

00:21:40.879 --> 00:21:40.889
clearly we need the CSS to style content
 

00:21:40.889 --> 00:21:43.940
clearly we need the CSS to style content
in the initial view thus it is critical

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:43.950
in the initial view thus it is critical
 

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.649
in the initial view thus it is critical
CSS and we want to serve it up early in

00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:45.659
CSS and we want to serve it up early in
 

00:21:45.659 --> 00:21:51.259
CSS and we want to serve it up early in
a render blocking way so imagine we

00:21:51.259 --> 00:21:51.269
a render blocking way so imagine we
 

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:53.239
a render blocking way so imagine we
changed our HTML markup there so you can

00:21:53.239 --> 00:21:53.249
changed our HTML markup there so you can
 

00:21:53.249 --> 00:21:55.669
changed our HTML markup there so you can
see before it was span classes was alert

00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679
see before it was span classes was alert
 

00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:58.039
see before it was span classes was alert
now we decide okay we don't really want

00:21:58.039 --> 00:21:58.049
now we decide okay we don't really want
 

00:21:58.049 --> 00:21:59.719
now we decide okay we don't really want
a mark hello world as an alert it's just

00:21:59.719 --> 00:21:59.729
a mark hello world as an alert it's just
 

00:21:59.729 --> 00:22:00.469
a mark hello world as an alert it's just
a normal

00:22:00.469 --> 00:22:00.479
a normal
 

00:22:00.479 --> 00:22:02.719
a normal
sniffing of text we want it to be styled

00:22:02.719 --> 00:22:02.729
sniffing of text we want it to be styled
 

00:22:02.729 --> 00:22:06.049
sniffing of text we want it to be styled
as such at this point so imagine though

00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059
as such at this point so imagine though
 

00:22:06.059 --> 00:22:07.609
as such at this point so imagine though
that we do use the alert class later in

00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:07.619
that we do use the alert class later in
 

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:08.930
that we do use the alert class later in
the app right like imagine your users

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940
the app right like imagine your users
 

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.200
the app right like imagine your users
interacting with the app you know they

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.210
interacting with the app you know they
 

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.220
interacting with the app you know they
try to upload a video

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:13.230
try to upload a video
 

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.960
try to upload a video
oh it fails you want to show an alert at

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:14.970
oh it fails you want to show an alert at
 

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.510
oh it fails you want to show an alert at
that time so we do need it but we don't

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520
that time so we do need it but we don't
 

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.680
that time so we do need it but we don't
need this rule as part of the initial

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:18.690
need this rule as part of the initial
 

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:22.130
need this rule as part of the initial
view at that point right it's not part

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140
view at that point right it's not part
 

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.210
view at that point right it's not part
of the initial view and so it's no

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220
of the initial view and so it's no
 

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.220
of the initial view and so it's no
longer sort of critical and you may want

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:25.230
longer sort of critical and you may want
 

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.140
longer sort of critical and you may want
to think about loading that later

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:27.150
to think about loading that later
 

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.000
to think about loading that later
in the app lifecycle in a way that

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.010
in the app lifecycle in a way that
 

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.470
in the app lifecycle in a way that
doesn't block the initial the initial

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480
doesn't block the initial the initial
 

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.860
doesn't block the initial the initial
view so one more bit I think this is

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:33.870
view so one more bit I think this is
 

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.180
view so one more bit I think this is
actually probably this is somewhat

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:35.190
actually probably this is somewhat
 

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.440
actually probably this is somewhat
subtle but probably the most important

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:36.450
subtle but probably the most important
 

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.110
subtle but probably the most important
thing when we talk about critical CSS

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120
thing when we talk about critical CSS
 

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.880
thing when we talk about critical CSS
it's critical you know the critical CSS

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:40.890
it's critical you know the critical CSS
 

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.560
it's critical you know the critical CSS
is the CSS needed to position and style

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:42.570
is the CSS needed to position and style
 

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.960
is the CSS needed to position and style
the content in the initial view right so

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:44.970
the content in the initial view right so
 

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:48.560
the content in the initial view right so
oftentimes we inline data URIs into our

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:48.570
oftentimes we inline data URIs into our
 

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.240
oftentimes we inline data URIs into our
CSS you know the goal being okay let's

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:50.250
CSS you know the goal being okay let's
 

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.070
CSS you know the goal being okay let's
reduce the number of requests that my

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080
reduce the number of requests that my
 

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.539
reduce the number of requests that my
page makes I can serve the image

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:53.549
page makes I can serve the image
 

00:22:53.549 --> 00:22:55.909
page makes I can serve the image
separately or I can inline it right into

00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919
separately or I can inline it right into
 

00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:58.900
separately or I can inline it right into
my CSS and interestingly what what uh

00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:58.910
my CSS and interestingly what what uh
 

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.030
my CSS and interestingly what what uh
what we are doing when we inline these

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:02.040
what we are doing when we inline these
 

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.100
what we are doing when we inline these
data urs for images is we're basically

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:04.110
data urs for images is we're basically
 

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.539
data urs for images is we're basically
promoting the image from being non

00:23:05.539 --> 00:23:05.549
promoting the image from being non
 

00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:07.730
promoting the image from being non
render blocking right not part of the

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740
render blocking right not part of the
 

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.980
render blocking right not part of the
critical render path because images by

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:09.990
critical render path because images by
 

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.140
critical render path because images by
default they obviously need to download

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:12.150
default they obviously need to download
 

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.600
default they obviously need to download
the image to render the image itself but

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:14.610
the image to render the image itself but
 

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:15.860
the image to render the image itself but
images don't block rendering of other

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:15.870
images don't block rendering of other
 

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.740
images don't block rendering of other
content on the screen when we inline it

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:18.750
content on the screen when we inline it
 

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.810
content on the screen when we inline it
as a data URI here we basically promoted

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:20.820
as a data URI here we basically promoted
 

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.490
as a data URI here we basically promoted
it to being render blocking to being a

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500
it to being render blocking to being a
 

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.200
it to being render blocking to being a
part of the critical rendering path and

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:24.210
part of the critical rendering path and
 

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.460
part of the critical rendering path and
we're making that critical rendering

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:25.470
we're making that critical rendering
 

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.010
we're making that critical rendering
path that much longer right and so you

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.020
path that much longer right and so you
 

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.049
path that much longer right and so you
know data URIs - they tend to be quite

00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059
know data URIs - they tend to be quite
 

00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:34.880
know data URIs - they tend to be quite
big right right so here's our markup so

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:34.890
big right right so here's our markup so
 

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.710
big right right so here's our markup so
you know if you look at your CSS and

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720
you know if you look at your CSS and
 

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.000
you know if you look at your CSS and
you're using this technique lots of

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.010
you're using this technique lots of
 

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:39.350
you're using this technique lots of
sites do you'll notice probably the

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360
sites do you'll notice probably the
 

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.360
sites do you'll notice probably the
majority of bytes in your CSS files may

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:41.370
majority of bytes in your CSS files may
 

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.070
majority of bytes in your CSS files may
actually be from these inline data URIs

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080
actually be from these inline data URIs
 

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.510
actually be from these inline data URIs
and what you're doing is you're

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520
and what you're doing is you're
 

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.860
and what you're doing is you're
increasing that critical path link

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:45.870
increasing that critical path link
 

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:48.230
increasing that critical path link
pretty significantly and actually

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240
pretty significantly and actually
 

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.700
pretty significantly and actually
causing users to have to wait to see any

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:49.710
causing users to have to wait to see any
 

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.820
causing users to have to wait to see any
content at all on the screen as a result

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:51.830
content at all on the screen as a result
 

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:56.210
content at all on the screen as a result
so you'll actually render the other

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:56.220
so you'll actually render the other
 

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.799
so you'll actually render the other
content on the screen more quickly if

00:23:57.799 --> 00:23:57.809
content on the screen more quickly if
 

00:23:57.809 --> 00:23:59.150
content on the screen more quickly if
you just switch back to that you know

00:23:59.150 --> 00:23:59.160
you just switch back to that you know
 

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.310
you just switch back to that you know
either CSS sprite with the external file

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320
either CSS sprite with the external file
 

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.140
either CSS sprite with the external file
reference or you know if you're using

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:03.150
reference or you know if you're using
 

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.490
reference or you know if you're using
something like speedy where spriting

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:04.500
something like speedy where spriting
 

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.440
something like speedy where spriting
doesn't really bring you any benefit

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:06.450
doesn't really bring you any benefit
 

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.190
doesn't really bring you any benefit
just keeping each image assets separate

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200
just keeping each image assets separate
 

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.870
just keeping each image assets separate
reducing the size of the CSS reducing

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880
reducing the size of the CSS reducing
 

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.919
reducing the size of the CSS reducing
the size of your critical rendering path

00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:12.929
the size of your critical rendering path
 

00:24:12.929 --> 00:24:15.289
the size of your critical rendering path
and making the page load that much more

00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:15.299
and making the page load that much more
 

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:18.980
and making the page load that much more
quickly this is pretty easy to test out

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:18.990
quickly this is pretty easy to test out
 

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.409
quickly this is pretty easy to test out
you know create a simple page and let a

00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:21.419
you know create a simple page and let a
 

00:24:21.419 --> 00:24:22.669
you know create a simple page and let a
bunch of data uris in a style sheet

00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679
bunch of data uris in a style sheet
 

00:24:22.679 --> 00:24:26.210
bunch of data uris in a style sheet
create a second version of that page you

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.220
create a second version of that page you
 

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.080
create a second version of that page you
know use the technique

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:27.090
know use the technique
 

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:28.520
know use the technique
where you've got a separate image a set

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:28.530
where you've got a separate image a set
 

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.260
where you've got a separate image a set
make sure there's some non image content

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:30.270
make sure there's some non image content
 

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.520
make sure there's some non image content
on the page all right so put some text

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:31.530
on the page all right so put some text
 

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.040
on the page all right so put some text
in there whatever it may be and then

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.050
in there whatever it may be and then
 

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.330
in there whatever it may be and then
compare the two in webpage tasks do a

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340
compare the two in webpage tasks do a
 

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.070
compare the two in webpage tasks do a
video comparison on a 3G network and

video comparison on a 3G network and
 

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.660
video comparison on a 3G network and
you'll see that when you in line data

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:38.670
you'll see that when you in line data
 

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.250
you'll see that when you in line data
URIs into your stylesheet you're

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260
URIs into your stylesheet you're
 

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.690
URIs into your stylesheet you're
blocking rendering of all the content on

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:41.700
blocking rendering of all the content on
 

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.150

rendering path is expensive I encourage

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580
rendering path is expensive I encourage
 

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.520
rendering path is expensive I encourage
you know people to not take that

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:55.530
you know people to not take that
 

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:56.960
you know people to not take that
approach except for maybe very small

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:56.970
approach except for maybe very small
 

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.270
approach except for maybe very small
data URIs right so I would I would say

00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280
data URIs right so I would I would say
 

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.240
data URIs right so I would I would say
that you know large data URIs inlined in

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:02.250
that you know large data URIs inlined in
 

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:03.680
that you know large data URIs inlined in
render blocking CSS are actually harmful

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:03.690
render blocking CSS are actually harmful
 

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.240
render blocking CSS are actually harmful
for rendering performance and I would I

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:05.250
for rendering performance and I would I
 

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:11.840
for rendering performance and I would I
would avoid using that approach so then

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:11.850
would avoid using that approach so then
 

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:13.340
would avoid using that approach so then
a couple more questions how okay so I've

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:13.350
a couple more questions how okay so I've
 

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.810
a couple more questions how okay so I've
