00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.850
So one vital question to ask at this
point is which circle of feedback

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.250
we should be targeting?

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.200
Since the current
prototype is pretty sparse,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.860
it makes a lot of sense to
target the first circle,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.490
just to be sure that we're going
in the right direction with this.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.410
You need to make sure that
you're going to the right city

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.730
before you get directions to
a specific address there.
