1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,750
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:08,550
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast farm by day, October,

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,310
October 2nd oh my God. Get
Out. You fucking Barracuda,

4
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:19,140
dude. It's a fucking fall.
It's officially the fall,

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,010
isn't it? Lovely. Honda's
leaves turning different colors,

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,190
falling off the trees and
crunching under your feet.

7
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:31,191
Halloween comes and then Thanksgiving
and it'll be a good 75 80 degrees with a

8
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:37,260
whatever, but the oceans rising, but
whatever's going be very interesting.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,960
It's going to be very interesting.
False. I feel coming up.
Oh, do you feel it, bill?

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,580
Was this your own idea?

11
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,850
Did you stick your head out the window
and assess it or did you listen to a

12
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:51,990
bunch of Shit on TV? All
right, you got me. You got me.

13
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:56,040
But it is the fall, the falls,
one of my favorite seasons,

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,210
what I loved about the fall was the
beginning of the school year and I

15
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:04,380
absolutely love school. I just, when I
was a child, I just, I crave knowledge.

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,390
I don't know what it was like.

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,010
Of course the other kids wanted
to go outside and play and gaging

18
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,150
contests of sport, but not me now. I just
wanted to curl up in the corner disk,

19
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,480
couldn't just, my mother just
couldn't get me enough books.

20
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,990
I know. I was obviously, um, it
was obviously in a non truth.

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,010
None of that was true.
Uh,

22
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,630
what I liked about the fall was I
got new clothes for school, you know,

23
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,810
which back then was you got your hand
me downs from your brother and you got a

24
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:36,870
new pair of sneakers. All right. And uh,

25
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:40,230
they were new until that first time it
fucking rained or something happened and

26
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:45,000
then they would just, you know, that was
it. And those, we use sneakers for a year.

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,770
You wore sneakers for a year.

28
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,770
Your mother bought him like a half
size or a full size too big dependent.

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,310
We know she was trying to gauge,
you know,

30
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:56,190
when your balls we're going to drop to
considering how big your feet we're going

31
00:01:56,191 --> 00:02:00,600
to be. Right. Um, it was
one of those, you know,

32
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,440
one of those things back then there
was like nine grades all in one class,

33
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,790
not fucking with you.
Um,

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,010
I liked the new sneakers in
the new clothes and whatever
hand be down shit that

35
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,230
I got from my older brother. And then, uh,

36
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,530
and then it was football and then also
was starting to get cold so I didn't have

37
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,260
to deal with any more.
Do I look at why you fucking legs are,

38
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:25,080
I didn't have to deal with that with
the summer and empty. We'll sunburns.

39
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,740
I liked it. It was more of
a fucking winter guy. Um,

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,530
but other than that,
everything else sucked.

41
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,000
I fucking arc 180 days of school to go.
Can you believe that?

42
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,030
Used to think that that was hard and
he actually used to fuck up in school.

43
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,050
If you're like me, I always
look back. It's just like,
why don't I just come home?

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,840
Why not just pay attention,
come home and just do my homework.

45
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,680
I could've gone to like a
really good college. Like,

46
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,110
and to me a good college is, it has, it
has a sports program that I can follow.

47
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,930
It's division one and you know,

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,130
they battled for fucking at
least to win their conference.

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,150
You know what I mean?
I don't fucking,

50
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,803
okay.

51
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,050
I Dunno. I, I don't fucking like

52
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,470
these college you should go to where
everybody is. I don't know what it is.

53
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:26,100
Like take Vanderbilt
in the SEC by the way.

54
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,190
Who played a hell of a fucking
game this weekend? Right?

55
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,520
Scared the shit out of Florida.
Um,

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,260
I always thought that, you know, I always,

57
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:41,910
I always assumed that that school sucked
because their football team was no good

58
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:43,890
for so long.
Now they're actually halfway decent.

59
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:48,180
But I judge schools by how
good their sports program is.

60
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,620
And you know, there's a lot of people on
real sports are one of those shows that,

61
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:52,921
you know,

62
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:55,740
everybody wears suits and for some
reason they have a pen but they're never

63
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:58,930
really writing, you know, those shows that
take it really seriously. And then they,

64
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,390
what does that silly little Lucille,

65
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:05,391
the educational system that people
judge a school by their sports programs?

66
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,800
Well, no, this you fucking
pencil pushing nerd.

67
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,050
There would be no campus without sports.
Okay.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,100
On a thousand fucking fractal
drops like me fill a stadium.

69
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,800
That money goes right back
into the school, doesn't it?

70
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:26,220
God knows it's not paying the players.
All right.

71
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,770
And that's why when you go to
the University of Michigan,

72
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:32,700
it's its own fucking city. It's not
because of the science department.

73
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,960
Well, the engineers that know
how to build the buildings,

74
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,140
it's cause the big blue down the fucking
street [inaudible] pulling 100 400,

75
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:48,830
510,000 people a Goddamn game.
That's what pays for it.

76
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,560
You know? Even if it's not all
that money, the level of attention.

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,180
And that makes people all
around the world, you know? No.

78
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:59,670
That song hail to the victors.

79
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:03,960
Valliant hail to the victors.
Fucking get on a raft.

80
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,280
Get over here and go to that school.
Right. Isn't that how it goes?

81
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,280
I don't know. MMM. I don't know.

82
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:16,220
What the fuck was I talking about? Why I
like the fall? Yeah. I would've fucked in.

83
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:20,500
I study
so fucking stupid.

84
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:25,010
I can't believe. I can't imagine if I
actually understood calculus, what my,

85
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,070
what my world would be like right now

86
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,410
by just took the time to fuck.

87
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:33,170
I mean it's not like they just
dumped it all on you the first day.

88
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,830
Yeah.

89
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,950
I forget when I stopped paying attention
somewhere around seventh grade I just

90
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:40,920
was like, Eh, I'm just not into this.

91
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,170
MMM.
Oh my God.

92
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:50,900
I could have studied and then I could
do one of those extra curricular things

93
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:53,680
and got like a scholarship,
you know,

94
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,490
participated in a bunch of other shit than
I would have had that all flushed out.

95
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,110
I see you're on the debating team.

96
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,980
You're on the swimming team and I'll
let shit remember those fucking kids.

97
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,700
The kid next to you. His
locker was like neat, you know?

98
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,260
And it wasn't all dented and shit.

99
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,240
Fucking always had his homework
wear like sweaters, you know,

100
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,700
you just be looking at him
like kind of fun as fuck does.

101
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:20,930
This person is like my age and
they have their shit that together

102
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,820
always at a thousand papers falling
out of my fucking, it just was a mess.

103
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,550
And every year I'd be like, okay,
this year I'm going to study,

104
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,540
I'm going to fucking am I
drawn all over my books.

105
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,280
I'm going to pay attention. I'm going to
try and get all A's and B's. That's all.

106
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:39,740
That's all I wanted to do and I just,
I couldn't do it.

107
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,710
I put up a good fight through about,
I get to about September 10th

108
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,770
then I get like that
first fucking c, c, c,

109
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,570
c. What's that? What's that
a reference to? Speaking of
moving, let movie lines. Si.

110
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,363
Si,
Si.

111
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,570
Was it summer rentals for summer school
that it was the guy who's been on TV for

112
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:07,500
40 years but never does interviews,

113
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:12,200
so people kind of Mark Harmon is that
his name? Was that guy like chainsaws,

114
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:13,034
some shit.

115
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,500
Then of course they made the Latino girl
pregnant cause you could still do that

116
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:19,620
back then.
Can't do that now you get called out on,

117
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,810
they would never do that now.
Now they would make the white guy pregnant

118
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,220
to show that that progressive,
that's how it would work.

119
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,683
You know what I mean?

120
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,590
There's nothing wrong with having
a Latino woman to be pregnant,

121
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,500
but when she's the only
Latino in the fucking movie,

122
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,470
that's when it becomes a problem.
Oh.

123
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,070
So she's going to summer school and
she's knocked up and she's dressed like

124
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:50,580
fucking zebra man and
heavy metal parking lot.

125
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,820
Do you know?
I'd never seen that.

126
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,820
I thought that was an entire fucking
movie and ice for years. I was like,

127
00:07:56,821 --> 00:08:00,180
I got to get around to watch and heavy
metal parking lot. I never fucking saw it.

128
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:04,260
And finally somebody referenced
it again. Um, oh, I know why.

129
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,660
Dean del Ray from the let there be talk
all things, comedy network podcast.

130
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,280
He sent me a link and one
of Judas Priest's guitarist,

131
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,640
uh, who the, those KK downing and Glen
[inaudible], Glen Tipton, he bought,

132
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,350
I hope I'm saying his name right.

133
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,710
He bought a fucking Porsche in 1985 or
86 he went to the factory when he was on

134
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:31,290
tour and that's back when they made
them. Hey, there was hand built,

135
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,430
none of this robot shit.

136
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,260
None of this outsourcing it to fucking
whatever the fuck they do it now. Um,

137
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,010
they were hand built.
Okay.

138
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,610
By the same people that
brought you audio tape

139
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,500
and World War One and World War
Two. All right. It was fucking,

140
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:52,230
they were hand fucking built.

141
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,930
It's right at the same people brought
you October fest and the Holocaust,

142
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,170
you know what I mean? They're there.
They're all over the map over there.

143
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,780
That's why Germany is
still such a scary country.

144
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,340
It's like what's going
to happen over here?

145
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,540
Are we all going to get drink beers and
get shit faced or are you guys going to

146
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,600
try and take over the world again?
You know,

147
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,270
that's what's on their weather channel
as a monitor.

148
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,640
All the psychos over there.
What are the, what is,

149
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,270
what does the general population planning
right now or possibly a small group of

150
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:27,240
really motivated people
within Deutschland.

151
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,500
So anyways,
I had never seen heavy metal parking lot.

152
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:38,790
I thought it was a full movie. So I sit
down to watch it right out of the gate.

153
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,130
I love it.
Cause the concerts at the cap center.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,210
And that's where I used to
watch the, uh, you know,

155
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,490
whenever the Bruins used to play,
when they'd go down and play the capitols.

156
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:52,491
And they had rod lang way look like my
math teacher back in the day that my math

157
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,840
teacher was a dead fucking ringer.

158
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,400
Flunked his class two fucking
years in a row was two summers.

159
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:00,091
I'll never get back.

160
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:02,550
Actually my senior year I didn't fucking
go to summer school was like, well,

161
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:06,210
what's the point? I can't get into a
school that has a good foot, you know,

162
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:10,410
football program or basketball program.
I don't know, sports here, so fuck it.

163
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,320
Um, anyways, what the fuck am I talking
about? Yeah. So I'm watching this thing.

164
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:17,460
So they had the cap center,

165
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,520
which I never really saw what it looked
like because they never really showed

166
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,650
the outside that I can remember.
They just be abroads that I,

167
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,603
they would camp center

168
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,340
Berry Peterson leading the league with
40 some goals a great year. He had,

169
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,380
um, and we traded in my belief. Um,

170
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,860
so I go to watch this fucking thing
and uh, I've gotta be honest with you.

171
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,550
Like the memories that came flying back,
first of all,

172
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:45,810
my first concert ever was Judas
priest with dock and opening up.

173
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,420
Of course it was dark and they
fucking open for everybody.

174
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,360
Day Open for everybody in Tesla opened
for fucking and Cinderella opened for

175
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,310
fucking everybody.

176
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,813
MMM.

177
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,830
That was my first on the Turbo Lover Tour.
Right.

178
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,500
And I guess I found out all these years
later that that Judas priest Guy Glen

179
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,333
Tipton or whatever,

180
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,510
but a fucking Porsche that was a turbo
and he loved it so much that he's fucking,

181
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:19,340
you know, was inspired to write a song
and then a rob Halford took it in whatever

182
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:23,720
direction he wanted to take it in. You
know that we remember that song. Huh?

183
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,100
Your turbo lava make no sense.
Right?

184
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,790
You won't see me

185
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,653
then.
Yeah.

186
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,360
Uh,
Geo feel me.

187
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,960
Oh, like crazy music. Right. Um,

188
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,400
I saw them on that tour. So anyway,
so I watched that heavy metal, uh,

189
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,490
parking lot and um,
I was fucking great.

190
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,870
That's exactly, I mean, to have a
fucking fill now. I know way, way,

191
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:59,370
way past the whole, everybody knows
that by now we have a film that thank,

192
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,920
thank you so much for filming that.
I do.

193
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:07,330
The first time I ever saw anybody do blow,
I went to an ACDC concert.

194
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:11,140
I remember I pull up my big
stupid red fucking hair. Right.

195
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,180
You know, and I can't grow at long. My
hair just grew out so I, I was like,

196
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:19,390
I missed it man. I should have come
up in the 70s I would have been fine.

197
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,990
We'd have been rocking that Bernie
from room to 22 but you know,

198
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,780
everybody kind of had their shit.
You know,

199
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,790
I don't know what the fuck it was in the
80s wasn't short, but it wasn't long.

200
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,570
It was bright before the mullets
feathered, everything was feathered.

201
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,810
Fairfox it was so hot. Even the guys
tried to have their hair let curse. Right.

202
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:40,460
That's what was going on. And
me, I was just like, you know,

203
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,190
I was a man without a spot, without a
fucking country. So I would pull up,

204
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,040
you know,
not a whisker on my face.

205
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,230
I fucking pull up my
stupid fucking looking.

206
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,200
Like I swear to God looking
like a giant opie Taylor and a,

207
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,280
and I was totally into the music,
but I just look like a fucking freak,

208
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,700
you know, I should've grown
my, I go actually I couldn't
grow my house assessed,

209
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,110
should at least go on the Malakai route
and just been drunk enough and just got

210
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:11,410
out of the car and screamed Outlander
and then everybody will left me own loan.

211
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:16,411
I remember I pulled up to the ACDC thing
and this fucking guy was doing blow and

212
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,040
he had a Toyota pickup truck rusted out.

213
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,860
Of course back then
everything fucking rusted,

214
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,870
especially the Toyota Hunks and hunks of
shit. But the engines would never die.

215
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,030
Right?
You'd be driving down the street.

216
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:29,950
You could literally see the
fucking engine still working.

217
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,610
So this guy gets out of the car

218
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,850
and I'm like looking at him like I
know we liked the same kind of music,

219
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:43,660
but we are not the same person.
I remember he was fucking, yeah,

220
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:46,150
this blond hair look,
cut his own hair.

221
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:48,700
It was like some like a
fucked up page boy haircut

222
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,330
and like a perm all at the same time.

223
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,700
And like he turned around and through the
line and then fucking came right up to

224
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:02,440
my window as I pulled up looking
like a fucking, like, I don't know,

225
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,230
I felt like I was on one of those zoos
where the animals aren't in a cage,

226
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,500
you know, he just came up and he was
like, yeah. And I was kinda like, hey man.

227
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,790
Fortunately I was with somebody else. I
think that we were listening to who made,

228
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,930
who would a very respectable volume.
Um, yeah, that was the, who made,

229
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:22,980
who want in loudness,
opened up a Japanese heavy metal band.

230
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,210
Um, I dunno what the fuck I'm
talking about here. Let's, let's,

231
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:31,050
let's get into the podcast. I'm
just sort of meandering here. Um,

232
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,470
why don't we talk a little bit
of NFL football. We'd like,

233
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:39,360
we've got to talk college first. All
right. So when I watched, I watched, uh,

234
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,370
I watched Texas tech
against, um, Oklahoma state.

235
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:48,990
What a fucking great game that was. And
what an atmosphere out there in Lubbock,

236
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:53,690
Texas. I got to go a Texas tech gay
man. So I was actually out there.

237
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,180
I was looking up theaters to see
if they had a little stutter.

238
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:00,800
I could play maybe next year, whatever,
during football season, you know,

239
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:02,840
anybody can go to Dallas.
Right.

240
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,550
I've already been to Texas A and M
and I've been to the Texas longhorns.

241
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:09,830
The next big program is Texas Tech.
Right.

242
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,440
Of course they'll give
you shit at Baylor or Smu.

243
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:14,630
They never recovered from
the fucking death penalty.

244
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:19,790
But what else they got out
there? I think that's it. So, um,

245
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,030
I was rooting for Texas
tech cause I know I just,

246
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,430
just cause they were the underdog,
but it's such a fucking great game.

247
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,440
And I was flipping back and forth,
you know, my adopted college team,

248
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,330
Lsu fucking tigers, you know,
we lost again, but you know,

249
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:39,410
we lost to the Trojan. So that's okay.
You know, that's how I say it to people.

250
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:41,570
You know, we, we lost
this week to the Trojans.

251
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,320
I thought USC last two.
All they did.

252
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:50,321
I was talking about the Troy Trojans
from the very formidable sun belt

253
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:51,524
conference.

254
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,750
I was embarrassed as a new Lsu fan.

255
00:15:56,751 --> 00:16:01,610
I became an Lsu fan about
nine years ago and as a, uh,

256
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,500
adopted team to see all those fucking
people leave the fucking stadium emptied

257
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:11,300
out with eight minutes to go. All right.
Granted they needed three scores, but uh,

258
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,810
I, I didn't like that at
all. I hate seeing that.

259
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,110
And then I was at that point just rooting
that they came back and one just so

260
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,160
all those fucking cunts would have to
lie on Monday and see that they were part

261
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:25,790
of the 40 people that still stuck around.
But um,

262
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,510
I'm trying to think what
was worse watching Lsu lose
to Troy or the Troy Trojans

263
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:36,560
helmets, you know, you know,
everything has to look like fucking,

264
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,141
I don't know.
You know,

265
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:43,490
that you don't let that Awful Candy at
movie theaters that they only sell it at

266
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:45,440
movie theaters,
whatever those fucking things are.

267
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,060
I don't mean gummy bears don't have a good
friend of mine that loves gummy bears,

268
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,920
Guy Friend. It just, I dunno, it just, it
almost fucks up our friendship, you know,

269
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,780
like when, when he's kind
of bugging me, whatever,

270
00:16:56,781 --> 00:17:00,110
I just kind of think every once in once
it gets fucking guy likes gummy bears.

271
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,440
I'll do what? I love going to movies,
you know, I fucking love going to movies.

272
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:09,560
I take my kids, you know,
get a box of gummy bears,

273
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,050
gummy bears. Um, yeah,

274
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:22,250
the fucking Oregon ducks. All
right. Those green and yellow cons,

275
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,660
they fucked it up for everybody.

276
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,200
They were the first ones to put the disco
ball in their head and now everybody's

277
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:31,400
doing it. I'm calling it right now.
Those fucking things are going to look,

278
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,610
they're going to look fucking ridiculous
in years to come. People will be like,

279
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:38,120
what in the Fi's that electric is that
thing like plugged in or some shit?

280
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,500
Some of them are cool. I guess. I don't
know what, but I, I love how the MLB,

281
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,120
this year they went back to the,
uh,

282
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,380
like they went to like this non gloss
matte color on the batting helmets say

283
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:52,620
look fucking mean as hell,
man. I'm meeting as hell, man.

284
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,370
Um, so anyways, that's what
the fuck I watched. And um,

285
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,580
then I watch pro football today or

286
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,330
[inaudible]

287
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,280
Jay, Jay ash, the New England patriots
with their second loss of the year.

288
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,860
Um, pardon me, joys that they lost twice
because it keeps all the fucking price.

289
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:16,750
It'd be nice to have a nice
fucking anticipation free a season,

290
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,670
you know?
And when you're two and two,

291
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:23,500
God knows nobody's fucking looking at
you now. Uh, how about that defense? Huh?

292
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,250
The fuck I'll tell you.
I'll tell you right now,

293
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:30,090
if you want to score 30 points,
you got to go to new wig. Like,

294
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,813
okay,

295
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,690
I'm trying to,
I should look this up like we gave up,

296
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,730
I think we gave up 75 points in the first
two games and then we added another 30

297
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:44,150
today. Is that what happened?
Let's look at the Patriots here.

298
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,680
Let's look at this sad,

299
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,330
sad tale and I can't figure
out what the fuck is going on.

300
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:52,741
I mean,

301
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:57,360
how many yards have we given up this
year on just like blown coverages that

302
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:58,950
fucking fake screen pass.

303
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:02,580
Like the entire defense
on that side bites on it.

304
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,720
You know, if we look at our
corners and our safety's,

305
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,220
it's still butler Chung McCourty.

306
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,170
Those guys have been
playing together for years.

307
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,690
I don't know how long we've had the
Gilmore Guy, but I like that guy.

308
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:15,570
That guy hits hardy knock somebody out
of the game. He had another good hit,

309
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:20,700
you know, bullshit hands to the
face and then a brutal one. But a,

310
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,900
we shouldn't have been in that
situation to begin with. But, um,

311
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,110
our offense is fine me course.

312
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:31,380
I would love if our offensive line could
give them a little Brady a little more

313
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:36,300
time. Um, he's definitely taken too many
hits, but we're still scoring points.

314
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,430
But our defense, Jesus Christ,
not really stopping the run,

315
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:46,140
not really getting pressure on the
quarterback blown fucking coverages.

316
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,410
But, uh, I just feel like the blown
coverage, is that something that you know,

317
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,450
met Patricia can work on,
right.

318
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,170
He can get those guys like three of
the four of them. It's just like,

319
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:57,360
you guys want to fucking
Superbowl last year. I'm not,

320
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:58,320
I don't know all the patriots,

321
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:01,750
so I don't know when Gail Morgan
on the fucking team. Um, all right,

322
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,060
let's look at Patriot's here.

323
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,670
patriots.com I should have gone schedule,
right? Is that what I should've done?

324
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,750
This is going to take for fucking ever
patriots schedule. All right, here we go.

325
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,160
Patriots schedule.

326
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,110
They're going to go download
the schedule when, okay,

327
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:23,700
so we let up 42 points the first week.
Then we were on the road,

328
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,050
only let up 20.

329
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,830
Then we let up 33 and we let up 33 again.

330
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,550
Those are all at fucking up.
No, two of those were home.

331
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:40,510
Three of those weren't home.
Jesus fucking Christ. All right.

332
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,450
33 36 42 I think.
I Dunno,

333
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,290
I just glance at those numbers.
Wait,

334
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,740
(333) 034-0220 thank God for the 20.

335
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:56,320
All right.
42 and 20 is 62 so that's 31.

336
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,460
So we're averaging like
fucking, I dunno, 30 I guess.

337
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:02,730
32 points a fucking game.
Yeah. Yeah. Tie, right? No,

338
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,340
you're not going to go far in the
fucking playoffs. Um, by the way,

339
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,800
my fucking football pick came in.

340
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,020
I called it the fucking giants
get in three against Tampa Bay.

341
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,600
Dude, I fucking called it. I told you.

342
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,290
Yeah,

343
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,440
granted, the giants didn't fucking
win, but they only lost by two. Um,

344
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,630
and as a Patriot Fan,

345
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:29,030
I hate that the giants are owned four
more so than I hate the fact that we're

346
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:31,560
two and two because I wanted
to play the giants again.

347
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,820
The Superbowl to fucking beat those
bastards one time. Where you what?

348
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,490
Why don't we, we got nothing to lose.
The giants got everything to lose.

349
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,520
They've got shit talking rights
right now. You just got to say, hey,

350
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:43,930
you guys fucking owners. Right? By the
way, somebody tweeted like to do it.

351
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,270
When was the last time you guys even
fucking beat us? I went to a home game.

352
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,820
Own away game. I'm sorry, giants.
We fucking beat you up. Uh, I dunno.

353
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,740
The last time we played you in the
regular season in your fucking house,

354
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,820
you can't, it's fucking guys bragging
about preseason games. It's like,

355
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:03,080
dude, you want to super bowls?
That's all you give a fuck about. Um,

356
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,270
so anyways, uh, so that's my one pick.

357
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:10,370
So now I'm going to make another
pick on Thursday. All right, Abby.

358
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,250
Every Thursday I'm going to do my NFL
pick of the week. Now what is what?

359
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,260
You have to thank for your
fucking degenerate Gambler,

360
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,540
you know good and God damn well,

361
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:22,320
I have just as much chance with the
information that I'm using of picking a

362
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:27,060
winner as a housewife who doesn't
watch a game. Okay? So this first week,

363
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,280
I'm not going to say it was dumb luck.

364
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,210
I was going on fucking how many points
the giants scored against the eagles.

365
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:39,570
I know they scored him late and then Eli
Manny, who's ripped my heart out twice,

366
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,960
showed it to me and then very politely
aided and didn't get any blood on his

367
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,820
doctors, right? I was like, there's
no fucking way that these guys,

368
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,350
and I thought that they want to come away
with a win. I did Buccaneers. Look, Greg,

369
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,600
God bless him by the way. Who the fuck is
this? Ron Funches guy on the, on the, uh,

370
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,860
on, uh, Carolina fucking panthers.

371
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,120
Guy was killing us all day long.
I was, I don't pray for injuries,

372
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:09,360
but when his leg cramped up, I was like,
thank God. Then he came back out again,

373
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:13,860
caught another first down second.
We get that fucking Guy Outta here.

374
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,230
Um, so anyways, uh, that's
what I was basing it on.

375
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,140
So I'm going to pick another
one on Thursday and then
you the degenerate gambler.

376
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:25,580
You gotta be wondering,
we'll all freckles.

377
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,590
Will he get lucky two weeks in a row?

378
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,260
Because now I'm in your
head cause I won last week.

379
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,790
This is like playing roulette, like
going right. The last time was black.

380
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,650
Is it going to be another black
or is it going to be a red?

381
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,280
Do I sit out this week?
See if it goes to blacks in a row,

382
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:44,540
then I know it's going to be red.
All right. No, it was red this week.

383
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,400
I'm a goddamn ginger. All right.
Remember that Guy Fucking,

384
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:52,520
he didn't pay his taxes. Always
been on black. Always been on red.

385
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,030
Um,

386
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,370
I'm going to go out on a limb and say
that might be the Photoshop of this week.

387
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,610
That's too fucking easy, right?
That's a movie poster right there.

388
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,350
Always bet on red.
I don't know who's playing next week.

389
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:12,200
So how about those fucking La Ramps,

390
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,360
not your same old rams.

391
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,090
Fucking winning win and win and beat the
Dallas fucking cowboys. Jesus Christ.

392
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,320
They're gonna have their fucking heads
in a noose out there. Um, all right,

393
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,840
well let's get down to it. Oh, Billy.

394
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:31,760
Fucking booze back his back.
I fell off the wagon.

395
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,890
I couldn't do it. I'm fucking with
you. I'm still on the fucking wagon.

396
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,080
I went to Vegas and I passed that test.
I was at the, uh, the Monte Carlo,

397
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,370
not the race.

398
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,880
The fucking casino stayed over at the
MGM Grand Cause they're doing some,

399
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,840
uh, construction, I
guess on the Monte Carlo.

400
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,310
So they had me across the street and uh,

401
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,440
oh my God, what a fucking,
that way there's, there's
no better people watching.

402
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,570
Then when you go to Vegas, Holy
Shit. I went down to the pool. Yes.

403
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:05,720
I went down to the pool. I was working
with partner. He's an Italian guy.

404
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,480
He actually has pigments. So he wanted
to go down in the polls. I had fucking,

405
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:09,800
I'm not going to stay in
the room the whole time.

406
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,900
So I go down to the Goddamn pool dude.

407
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:14,660
And it was like right as the sun
had already started to go down,

408
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,350
was on the other side of the casino.
So it really wasn't any sun on the water.

409
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:23,000
So there was maybe five or six young
people there and everybody else was my

410
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:27,860
generation or older and Holy Shit,
I know this is a hacky topic.

411
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,090
I know this is,
but thank God I never got a tattoo.

412
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,670
Thank fucking Christ.
If you saw these fucking people,

413
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,690
and they're my age man,
49 years old, no shirt on.

414
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,640
All these fucking chicks with
their ankles, sorority tattoos,

415
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,540
telling kids what to do with tattoos,
you know what I mean?

416
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,920
And then that good.

417
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,920
That's what kills me about the tattoo
becoming mainstream was the incredible

418
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:03,800
like lack of research
that most people did.

419
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,000
Their total lack of
respect for the art form

420
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,290
and the complete lack of
respect for themselves

421
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,480
to go out and try to actually
find somebody good at it.

422
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,763
I gotta tell you,

423
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,100
I must've seen 500 fucking tattoos on
about a hundred different people down

424
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:31,310
there at the pool.
Everybody just tatted up,

425
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:37,710
shit show man boobs are
just peck sag and down.

426
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,110
You know, women, you always gotta
give a pass because they, they have,

427
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,170
they have to bear children.
All right,

428
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,910
but guys, man, there's no fucking
reason. You just keep doing the pushups.

429
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:52,300
Yeah,

430
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,690
keep the chest high and tight with the
fuck are you doing lay off the pizza and

431
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:56,590
the boots.

432
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,960
She fucking guys just walking around
this saggy chess and the fucking tribal

433
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:04,450
band,
the tramp stamps,

434
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,270
those sorority ankle tattoos.
Just fucking horrific.

435
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,360
I went down there and
was just sitting there,

436
00:27:13,361 --> 00:27:16,270
just reminded of my own mortality
going like, Jesus Christ.

437
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,920
I really want to fucking act like I'm
above these people, but like, you know,

438
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:26,560
smartest fucking thing I that I,
I didn't do was I never got a tattoo.

439
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,570
Jesus fucking Christ. Thank
Christ. I never did it. You know,

440
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:35,530
I like it used to be back
in the, you know, cause look
at me. I'm not a tattoo guy.

441
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,333
All right,

442
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,890
Tattoo. They, they, they
got to go back to bad asses.

443
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:44,943
You know what I mean?

444
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:50,850
Guys in biker gangs or in prison or like
chicks who not a shoot pool where the

445
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,450
leather pants,

446
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,493
right.

447
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,750
Hey,
I'm out of my fucking mind.

448
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:59,420
So we went down there and we
just looked at that fucking

449
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,930
see a humanity and then this guy just
comes out just screaming about how he lost

450
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:10,010
20 grand and he had a big grin on his
face. He goes, throw me in the pool.

451
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,740
I can't swim. Maybe I'll
drown. I just lost 20 grand.

452
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,350
I just lost 20 grand in there.
And I looked down and was like,

453
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:19,550
that fucking guy doesn't have 20 grand.
There's no fucking way. He's got 20 grand.

454
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,100
And who fucker walks ease?
He's just acting like he's a big shot,

455
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:26,120
right there may be dead. I
have no fucking idea. So, um,

456
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,831
and we went over,

457
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:32,750
we did the show and after the show we
sat out by this giant air conditioning

458
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,710
duck behind a wall on a picnic table
and smoke cigars. And it was great.

459
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,920
And I didn't participate at
all in the Vegas Shenanigans.

460
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:44,060
I knew enough when I walked through
the lobby and I saw the people,

461
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:46,100
all the young people, I was
like, this is their time.

462
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,330
Don't be the creepy guy hanging around,
ruining it, get the fuck outta here.

463
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:54,260
So I went back over to the MGM,
walked back and a,

464
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:57,860
I got back probably about 1230 at night
and I was at first wave of women that

465
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:01,940
had had enough, you know, two out of
three of them are walking barefoot,

466
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,010
carrying their horse horseshoes,
right?

467
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:07,220
What happens in Vegas stays in
Vegas and they just said dirty feet,

468
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:11,530
just walk into the f
with a giant fucking drink.

469
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,210
And I was glad that I stayed.
I did stay out of that and I didn't booze,

470
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:21,310
although I did smoke a fucking cigar
and a Kinda did it on an empty stomach.

471
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,540
And I got admit I was a little fucking
nauseous cause it was this giant Cuban.

472
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:29,410
And the next day we took the helicopter
out and back and on the way back,

473
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:31,180
those like a 17 to 30 knot wind,

474
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,870
depending on what altitude we were until
we really got down low flying over the

475
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:35,410
15,

476
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,320
it got down to like nine knots and we
kind of getting pushed around a little bit

477
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:41,830
up there. And that was a couple
times I was like, oh my God,

478
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,070
feeling a little nauseous up here.
You know,

479
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,020
that's not what you want to see from
your pilot asking for a puke bag. I mean,

480
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,720
the most comforting thing he could say
at that point, you know, it's all right.

481
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:54,400
It's all right. I, I drank last night,

482
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,780
so, um, anyways, but I gotta
tell you, man, flying out there,

483
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,230
taking the helicopter and going
over the mode. Javvi desert.

484
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,483
MMM.

485
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:12,790
Was it was, it was fucking incredible.
The desert is so, it's like beautiful,

486
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,650
terrifying, boiling, hot and
freezing all at the same time.

487
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,200
It's just fucking, I swear to
God, I don't know why. You know,

488
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,110
what's something that people
thought we faked the moon landing.

489
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,240
That's probably where they went, right?
They probably just went out to the desert.

490
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,790
You know it's a lot of mountains though.
I don't think they faked it, man.

491
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:34,030
I think they going, I think they got
up there. I have it gives a fuck.

492
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:36,730
Maybe they didn't. There's so much
shit for me to fucking babble about.

493
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Do you guys watch the Formula One at all?
Huh?

494
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,780
Anybody see it than
anybody? She ate it all. Uh,

495
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,740
what do I have it here?
It gets to the fucking standings.

496
00:30:49,741 --> 00:30:51,780
I know. What's his
face? One from red bull.

497
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,000
Red Bull had to fucking
cars and I can now,

498
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,630
I always want to say I always fuck up
that guy's name. The fuck is his name.

499
00:30:57,631 --> 00:31:01,560
Who wanted this? Who won the
race today? The fuck's his name.

500
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,460
What is his name?

501
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,660
Max For stappen once I think Sebastian
Vettel I can't think Verstappen cause

502
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:17,510
that v like my brain can only handle one
v word a minute or the same letter I'm

503
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:22,520
telling you I have, I don't know
what the fuck my deal is. Um,

504
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:28,260
but this is the first race that
I saw with Lewis Hamilton or,

505
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,920
or, uh, Valtteri Botox
in the Mercedes teams.

506
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,130
One of what? Either one of them, if they,

507
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,270
if they're in first fucking
place going into the turn,

508
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,720
the Mercedes cars are just too goddamn
good. Maybe a Ferrari can run him down.

509
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:43,620
I've never fucking seen it, but
red bull, this was their day.

510
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,590
This was their track.
They were amazing.

511
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,840
Lewis Hamilton got into fucking the first,

512
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,150
it was the first person
that came out in the lead.

513
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,750
I can't even talk this fucking
pockets. I apologize. Um,

514
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,400
came onto the first turn in the lead
and as far as my year and a half of

515
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:05,530
watching this shit,
that means you're going to win the race,

516
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,870
especially if your number
Sadie's and, um, for staff.

517
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,190
And actually came right up on him and went
right around them like it was nothing.

518
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:18,600
And then opened up like an eight,
nine second lead on them. I have,

519
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:23,590
I've never seen that. I'm a Mercedes
humbled like that by red bull.

520
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:28,210
So congratulations. Then Daniel
Ricardo came in third place and, uh,

521
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:33,490
Lewis Hamilton fucking steady, steady
Eddie there, still got second place.

522
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:38,140
He's got 281 fucking point.
Sebastian Vettel for whatever
fucking reason. Ferrari.

523
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:41,840
I don't know what they're doing.
My daughter had her first cold man,

524
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:44,090
so I was kind of watching her.
So I missed the beginning.

525
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:47,720
All of the sudden Kimmy raking it at some
going on with his turbo and he didn't

526
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:51,470
even fucking drive.
And Sebastian Vettel was way in the back,

527
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,350
so I'm going to guess,
uh,

528
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,590
you the fucked up during the time trials
and got some sort of penalty or they

529
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:59,000
had to switch out a gearbox.

530
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,950
There's some shit that puts
you at the back of the race.

531
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:03,380
You're only allowed to use so many parts,

532
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,770
somebody engines or something
like that throughout the season.

533
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:08,000
So he was all the way in the back.

534
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:12,060
He was able to work himself all
the way up to fourth place, um,

535
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,570
which was really impressive.
Uh, but now he is, be as,

536
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,630
what does he got? He's 34
fucking points. I mean,

537
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:24,990
I don't think that they'd make it
up after that debacle in Singapore,

538
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,620
that absolute fucking three
stooges fucking debacle.

539
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:29,670
I don't think that they make it up,

540
00:33:29,671 --> 00:33:33,930
but it was very exciting as a new fan
of Formula One to actually see somebody

541
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,950
enforced first place and get past actually
see a Mercedes Benz in first place

542
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:42,720
and get past it gave me hope that
Formula One can be more like that.

543
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:47,920
Um, the way moto GP is.
All right. Um, anyways,

544
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,180
let's get to some of the reads
here for the week. Uh, some of the,

545
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:56,030
actually some of the advertising and
shall we, uh, have a popup, where is it?

546
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,550

Flowers. Oh No, wait, wait, wait,

547
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:05,000

548
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,140
This podcast? It just fucking blows. What

but they got a got fucking silk
down by my tanked and my balls.

from the yard? She's still that stuff.

That's just disgusting.

Undies makes the most comfortable
underwear in the world.

624
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,570

A cornucopia.

629
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,220
It's a cornucopia basket. Look at that.
I nailed it. Thanksgiving horn thing.

630
00:38:57,221 --> 00:39:00,820
Basket squash got me there.
All right.

631
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:04,190
Dawlish Dollar Shave Club, do you? Uh,

632
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,200
what you might not know is that dollar
shave club also has products for pretty

633
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:12,550
much everything else you need in
the bathroom. Body Wash, shampoo,

634
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:16,030
Hair Gel, lip balm, herpes medicine,

635
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:21,070
everything at the store,
the crab comb at the store.

636
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:22,270
There are too many options.

637
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:25,960
And you can't tell the difference between
any of them if this a brush or is this

638
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,050
for my taint? Why is it always
go to the tank? I don't know. Uh,

639
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,540
then if you have any questions,

640
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:36,541
the clerk usually doesn't know the
difference either or can't really help you

641
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,310
since they are not an expert
on the products or maybe
they just have one person

642
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:45,850
working there, like my experience
and fucking cvs and Dwayne Reed,

643
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,510
they run a skeleton shift in the
middle of the fucking day. Uh,

644
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,190
now you don't have to step foot in a
store to get high quality to get a high

645
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:55,840
quality shave and grooming products.

646
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,860
A dollar shave club delivers them
right to your door. Pube tremors.

647
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,031
There's something else.

648
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,750
This is like the family feud named
something you'd find in a bathroom.

649
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,300
Johnson family.
Uh,

650
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:12,330
pube tremors show me [inaudible]
now we'd like the fourth answer

651
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,650
and everybody claps, you
know, and as they go,

652
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:22,240
like the authority and the intelligence
slowly starts to drop. You know,

653
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:25,600
maybe if they have an artist in the family
that lasts family members. All right,

654
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:29,260
but when they get down to that last
person, who else do we fucking bring?

655
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:34,300
You know? Um, anyways, where
am I as a, for a limited time,

656
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:36,850
dollar shave club is basically
giving away their shit.

versions of their most popular products

they've been cut with laxative. Um,

667
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,900

00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:39,680
Can I give you guys advice on a safety
razor? When you have a weighted handle?

673
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:41,480
Do not pull it across your face.

674
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,440
Hold it lightly and let gravity
with the weight of the handle.

675
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,230
Bring it down across your face. If
you don't, you're gonna cut yourself.

that I handle everything I think I did.

711
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:04,340
By the way,
I'm going to be in a Saint Petersburg,

712
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:09,050
Florida at the Mahaffey theater.
They added a late show this Friday night.

713
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,380
It's going to be me.
Uh,

714
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,940
Rosebowl Tailgate Legend,
Aka the,

715
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,350
uh, the crown royal kid, Joe Barton.
Nick. That's his new nickname,

716
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:26,030
the crown royal kid. He just got
signed to a three year deal. Um,

717
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,620
Paul Versey, Paul Dude, I called it
Versie. Whatever you do, do not bring up.

718
00:44:31,621 --> 00:44:34,830
That is giants or Owen for.
Okay. He's very sensitive.

719
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,930
We're going to be down there.
Uh,

720
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,500
and Thursday night I'm going to
the Patriots for as Tampa game.

721
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:41,730
I'm going to be respectful.

722
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:44,610
I'm not wearing my patriots gear because
I don't listen to everybody giving me

723
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:47,610
shit. I don't need all that shit.
Even if we wanted to feed it,

724
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:50,490
I still wouldn't wear it. I, I've
learned, I just, I just go there.

725
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,510
I silently rude from my fucking team
of Tampa winds. I say congratulations.

726
00:44:54,511 --> 00:44:55,344
Who gives a fuck?

727
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:00,390
This is the last NFL team that
I need to see a home game of.

728
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,120
And then I'll have gone to
all the baseball and all the,

729
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,330
all the football at a professional level.
And uh,

730
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:10,320
in my world of doing horrible in
school and going to colleges, uh,

731
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:13,530
numerous colleges during my
college career, none of which, oh,

732
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,120
I went to NC state for my
first, my freshman year, um,

733
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:20,820
sort of was in the off campus program.

734
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:25,110
I literally fucking drove into the
library and watch the classes on cassette

735
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:27,870
tape. Like I had some sort
of fucking terminal disease.

736
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,260
That was my first semester and
second semester I had two classes,

737
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,580
both of which I flunked because by then
I decided I didn't want to be in North

738
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,190
Carolina, so I sorta went there. Um,

739
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,500
this is back when NC state wolf pack
had like a Chucky Brown and Charles,

740
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:44,940
I think it was Charles Shackleford,

741
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,030
I believe they still had
grass seats in the end zone.

742
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,050
I went to a Carolina a state game there.

743
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:56,550
Then I went to a couple other
schools, uh, ended up at Emerson. Um,

744
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,110
Emerson, I don't even know
what I fucking mascot is.

745
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,260
I have no idea what it is. Uh, anyways,

746
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:09,950
it's like a final draft
software or some shit. Um,

747
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,070
the fuck am I talking about?
Yes.

748
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,320
I'm going to be in a Saint
Petersburg and then I'm going to on,

749
00:46:15,321 --> 00:46:19,800
on Saturday we'll go into
the Florida gators first.

750
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:24,790
Lsu Mighty Lsu.
So I will be silent.

751
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,600
He rooting for, I like Florida too,
but I'll be rooting fella shoe man.

752
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:32,601
I can't fucking just cause they lost
to the sunbelt Trojans the fuck.

753
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,050
Um, but I get to go to
the legendary swamp and a,

754
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,940
I actually love both those teams,
but a,

755
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:43,920
I decided to hitch my wagon to Lsu so
I can't just like fucking jump. I, I,

756
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:45,900
you know, I'm not going to be
a con on either one of those.

757
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:49,630
I'm just going to be happy to
be at that legendary field, um,

758
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:52,980
the at the swamp and then
also to be at the, uh,

759
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:57,420
pirates of the Caribbean stadium stadium
that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers planned.

760
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,470
Um, all right. Lewis Hamilton
on HBO. Hey Bill. Big Fan.

761
00:47:01,471 --> 00:47:05,840
Just wanted to let you know that Lewis
Hamilton is going to be featured on Hbo

762
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,510
Real Sports Tonight. I gotta watch that.
Uh, if you miss it, I'm sure you can. Uh,

763
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,970
I'm sure you can watch it later
on. Demand. Keep doing your thing.

764
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:18,000
Love F is for family and the
podcast is a weekly ritual for me.

765
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,420
Best wishes to you and your growing
family. Oh, thank you very much.

766
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,860
I'm going to allow to
try to check that out.

767
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,240
I saw I follow is Hamilton on
Twitter. And I saw that he, uh,

768
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,830
had some announcement to make and it
looked like was wearing some moto GP suit

769
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,510
and he was walking to a,
towards a motorcycle.

770
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,560
Now there's no fucking way the Mercedes
team is going to let them do that, right?

771
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,830
I don't think so.
So I don't know what the announcement was.

772
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:46,720
Maybe he'd said he got another diamond
stud for his other side. His knows,

773
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:50,740
I have no idea. I don't pretend to
live in that man's stratosphere.

774
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:55,420
I live in the troposphere. He lives
in the stratosphere. All right.

775
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:00,000
The Buccaneers logo,
everybody. A bullet built.

776
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:04,000
Uh, the original Buccaneers
logo was taking from the school.

777
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:07,150
I went to Beloit college.

778
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:12,180
They settled in court and Beloit one
because the school has been around before

779
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:14,120
the NFL.
Uh,

780
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:19,480
the school is big in the liberal arts
culture and the conversation of changing

781
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:23,920
the mascot due to the barbaric
history of the Buccaneers, uh,

782
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,880
the school actually has two
mascots in official and unofficial.

783
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:33,270
The unofficial is a turtle and they're
trying to see if they can make it the

784
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:38,170
official mascot over the
buccaneer. Good Lord. I could,

785
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,850
I could give a fuck about it.

786
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,800
But how would you feel if the Patriots
were to change to a pussy animal?

787
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,240
First of all, I fucking love turtles.
If you don't like turtles, man, this,

788
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,630
there's something wrong with you.
They're awesome. They don't bug anybody.

789
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:56,500
And if you think they're pussies,
go out and go get bit by one. Um,

790
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,900
I fucking love turtles.

791
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,650
I add one as a pet and I went to
church and I came home and it drowned.

792
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:07,570
Stain was Ralph and it buried it in the
fucking woods. I never got another one.

793
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,600
Uh, thanks for bringing
it up. Uh, anyways,

794
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,580
some pussy animal because
they're associated with white
nationalists or whatever.

795
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:20,320
Grotesques historical events
that is beyond our control. Um,

796
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:23,740
the funny thing about that is all the
liberal white people that go along with

797
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:27,910
doing that shit do not want to give up
their land or their flat screen TVs.

798
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,600
I get, you know, so as
a, as a a half assed,

799
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,920
you know, gesture, they're
going to get rid of the mascot.

800
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:39,280
Like obviously I feel the Redskins.
I mean it's literally like a racial slur.

801
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:44,110
So I get that one. But, uh, this
other shit, I mean, I dunno,

802
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,550
liberal people want to get rid of it,
but I feel that's kind of a way of, uh,

803
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,560
getting away with being conc is you're
kind of getting rid of the evidence.

804
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,220
You know, if they had the buccaneer
err on the side, they'll be like, well,

805
00:49:57,221 --> 00:49:58,840
who's that? And be like, Oh yeah,

806
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,140
that was a group of white people that
came over here and just massacred a bunch

807
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:05,710
of fucking people. Just took a bunch
of shit. They were evil. They are evil.

808
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,500
And for all I know, uh, you
are one of their descendants,

809
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,550
but if you just make it all go away and
there's just a turtle, I don't know.

810
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,670
I think they give human
beings too much credit.

811
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,750
Like you have to understand that we're
kind of out of our fucking minds. Um,

812
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:24,520
some something, some of it has to do
with power. I don't know what it is, but,

813
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,790
uh, I dunno. We get too much power. You,

814
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:31,940
we behave like those fucking chimpanzees
when they go out and hunt the other

815
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:36,530
monkeys. You know what I mean? I'll never
fucking get over watching that. I just,

816
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:37,370
it's the human,

817
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:40,460
the way they get excited and the way
they torture the other fucking monkey

818
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,700
rather then just kill
the fucking thing is a,

819
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,680
is a level of like sit there.
That's why I don't like cats.

820
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,530
I don't like that.
They just won't kill the mouse.

821
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,280
How the fucking things freaking,
I just put it out of its fucking misery.

822
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:55,660
They want,
still want to have fun with it.

823
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:57,933
MMM.

824
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,140
Like if somebody said, we're
descendants of cats, I'd be like, yeah,

825
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,080
I fucking believe that.
Where are we sneaking up on each other?

826
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:08,730
Trying to stab one another,
you know? Um, anyways,

827
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,800
I respect cats though, you know, I respect
them all. I'm just saying, you know,

828
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,280
just that behaviors is fucking
weird. Anyways, he says,

829
00:51:18,281 --> 00:51:19,880
love the fuck out of the podcast.

830
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:24,320
Been listening since 2011 and followed
your comedy sense. Why do I do this? Uh,

831
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,830
thank you for all the labs. Hope your
family's doing well and go fuck yourself.

832
00:51:26,831 --> 00:51:30,280
Yeah, my baby girl had a little
bit of the sniffles do what?

833
00:51:30,281 --> 00:51:33,280
A baby as a cold and it's sneezes.
That's the funniest shit ever.

834
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,520
They don't cover their mouth and just,
it's fucking unreal.

835
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:40,960
It's like poltergeist and uh, what's
that? What's that? Nickelodeon.

836
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,670
Slime. Um, so if you've got a baby, uh,

837
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:48,520
somebody told me this is good
advice was just to get like a,

838
00:51:48,521 --> 00:51:53,020
a face cloth and have it wet and Dab at
it so you don't make their nose all raw

839
00:51:53,021 --> 00:51:56,950
and all that stuff. Obviously
frequently rinse it out, change it.

840
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:00,910
I know this is disgusting, but it
was kind of what I was doing. Um,

841
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:04,510
I feel like I gave her the cold cause I
came back from Toronto and I felt like I

842
00:52:04,511 --> 00:52:08,950
had s was fighting off something and
I'm not going to not hug and kiss.

843
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:13,030
My daughter does that. My daughter. Right.

844
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,730
So I was hanging out with her and, uh, Nia
was out with some friends this weekend,

845
00:52:18,731 --> 00:52:22,240
so it was kind of a, I got to be the
single dad and I gotta tell you, man,

846
00:52:22,241 --> 00:52:25,030
I fucking loved it.
You know,

847
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,610
I don't know what these single
parents are complaining about.

848
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,850
I did it for about eight hours and
I didn't have a problem at all.

849
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,050
No, it was awesome. We, she watched them,

850
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,020
the Formula One race with three
and she watched the Patriots game.

851
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:40,990
I got a patriots onesy um,

852
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,360
and they get said little but
awesome or something like that,

853
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:46,300
has the Patriot logo on it and
whenever it's football Sunday.

854
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,420
And what's cool is Nia is
not into sports and shit.

855
00:52:49,421 --> 00:52:51,220
So she didn't want it to
have a bunch of sports shit,

856
00:52:51,221 --> 00:52:54,460
but I just bought it anyways.
And uh,

857
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:59,140
she fought for like two
seconds. He's like, all right,
if you're into that, fine,

858
00:52:59,141 --> 00:53:03,760
she gets it, she gets it. So that's what
it is. Football Sunday, I come home,

859
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,850
she's got two different patriots onesies.

860
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:09,850
I got to get her a Bruins one for the
season coming up and all it's playoff

861
00:53:09,851 --> 00:53:14,380
baseball. Joe Bucket, his finest, um,

862
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,680
efforts for families.
Joe Buck at his finest.

863
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,070
I'm looking forward to that.

864
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,440
Crossing my fingers for a Yankees.

865
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:28,440
Red Sox match up another classic series.
Who knows who wins this, you know,

866
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,880
I don't know how many times we played this
year, but we were dead even, you know,

867
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:35,530
if we played 18 times, we
went nine and nine. Um,

868
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,950
and I got it to be interesting,

869
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:42,270
serious cause I haven't seen price be
able to beat the fucking Yankees at least

870
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,930
in the second half when I was
paying attention. So we'll see. Uh,

871
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,270
how many home runs did judge end up with
a love of the people that have given

872
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,960
him shit. I was so happy that he got
fucking 50. These fucking cops. Dude,

873
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:57,830
I'm telling you that they say that the
home run Derby fucks up your swing. Oh,

874
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:01,110
is that what they say? So what they
say? You're not a football scout.

875
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:05,820
Are you all right Aaron? Judge, all
fucking rise court is in session.

876
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:10,260
Have you reached a verdict? We get
it. His last name's judge Aaron.

877
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:14,940
Judge stats. Here we
go. I know we've got 50.

878
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,560
What did he finish with?
Hold on.

879
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,060
It's 50 fucking toe.
Holy Shit.

880
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:27,600
That is fucking amazing.
52 home runs.

881
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:31,170
I let everybody give him shit
about his strikeouts. Gives a fuck.

882
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:32,993
Yeah.

883
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:37,630
114 Rbis, hundred 27 base
on balls. 208 strikeouts.

884
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,400
52 home runs.
You had 542 at bats

885
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:48,850
and he had to, he still hit two 84 with
two oh 208 strikeouts. He still had to 84.

886
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:54,450
It's fucking amazing. What a season
graduations to him. I hope he beat you.

887
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:57,900
I hope you be. If we fucking,
you know what I'm, I, you know,

888
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,060
I'm not one of those carts
that can't recognize greatness.

889
00:55:00,061 --> 00:55:04,850
That's fucking amazing. All
right, dear Billy button nose. Uh,

890
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:06,010
thought this was interesting.

891
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:11,030
A new French law says that photo's must
come with a disclaimer that they're

892
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:16,780
photo shopped. I love the French.
I fucking love the French.

893
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:18,160
You know what I mean?
You know why?

894
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:22,000
Cause they fucking going around having
threesomes and they're sick of being

895
00:55:22,001 --> 00:55:25,720
excited about bringing somebody else into
their relationship and they don't look

896
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:29,260
like the fucking picture. You know
what I mean? I get it. Anyways.

897
00:55:29,261 --> 00:55:34,261
It's being done to discourage unhealthy
extreme thinness among people trying to

898
00:55:34,361 --> 00:55:39,361
emulate unrealistic body shapes that
were faked with the computer program.

899
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,080
All right, so I was a little
off the mark on that. Um,

900
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,020
this could really change the
landscape from models, right? There's,

901
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:51,250
is sports equivalent in there somewhere.
Uh,

902
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,760
love you love Nia, keep up
the good work. Um, yeah,

903
00:55:55,761 --> 00:56:00,710
I mean I think that's probably, that's
not for adults. That's for more. Uh,

904
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:05,910
I think that's for kids. Um,
cause I noticed, you know,

905
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:08,320
when I went to Toronto I couldn't believe
how good looking the people went on.

906
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,730
And I've just been going around in general
just noticing how good looking people

907
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:15,780
are. And I was just like, what the fuck is
going on? And what I, I think it is, it's,

908
00:56:15,781 --> 00:56:19,200
I think it's an a result of everybody
being on social media and you post a

909
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:21,570
picture yourself and you know,

910
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:25,060
all this stuff that you
didn't about yourself and
then shit that you didn't even

911
00:56:25,061 --> 00:56:30,010
recognize that, that evidently people,
other people notice in comments,

912
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,050
you know, a dude, you fucking nice
new profile picture. But I got it.

913
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,550
Got to ask, okay, what's
up with your right ear?

914
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:43,210
What's up with that shirt? What's up
with the blah, blah, blah, you know,

915
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:47,800
and then it's unreal. And then you
start getting like a fucking complex.

916
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:52,220
Um,
social media is other than promoting.

917
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,740
Um, but anyways, I just feel
like for me, social media,

918
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:01,580
I promote gigs and I go on and I
try to make people laugh. That's it.

919
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:05,090
But to actually go on there and look at
comments, it's just not a healthy thing.

920
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,290
I don't think it's healthy for anybody.

921
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,730
Even if you're the most beautiful fucking
person in the world. Because you know,

922
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:14,690
at some point you're gonna start to go
down the other side and then the comments,

923
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:19,490
hey, you still hot, but you started to
look starting to show your age there.

924
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:23,450
Lol. Just kidding. You know, I love you.
That's all. Somebody who's gotten nothing,

925
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,560
nothing but fucking
compliments needs to hear,

926
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:29,630
and then it's just a downward spiral
into fucking botox and all of that shit.

927
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:35,280
Um, if I could promote anything, uh,

928
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,190
just fucking,
just acted goddamn age,

929
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:42,750
that's the best way to do it. Just
as you, as you're in your forties,

930
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:46,830
dress like you're in your forties,
keep yourself in good fucking shape.

931
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,980
There's a certain number you hit and
the best she can be at that point is you

932
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:53,850
look good for your age.
And if somebody says that to you,

933
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,140
it's a fucking compliment. You got to be
young. You weren't cheated. All right,

934
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,910
stop trying to fucking hang
on by your fingernails.

935
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:07,320
It's fucking over.
Let young people be young.

936
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,440
Let them have their,

937
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:11,940
whatever the fuck it is they're doing
with those Goddamn Djs. I don't get it,

938
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,400
but it's their shit.
Let them have it.

939
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,520
Stop showing up with your botox face
asking if anybody has any Molly.

940
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,620
Okay. You're creeping
people out. All right.

941
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:30,060
It's over. Mike. My public
service announcement is over.
All right. Apocalypse prep.

942
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,201
Hey Bill.

943
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:34,830
Recently my girlfriend got mad that I
don't have anything prepared in case of a

944
00:58:34,831 --> 00:58:39,270
hurricane or a massive flood. I'm not
naive, but we live in Kansas City.

945
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:43,860
I told her that while I have a flashlight,
extra cases of water and a generator,

946
00:58:43,861 --> 00:58:46,710
not bad for a 25 year old homeowner,
that's pretty fucking great.

947
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,770
Annual on a home, a 25.
Congratulations. Um,

948
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:53,610
I don't have a box titled Apocalypse Shit.

949
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:58,800
She said, I never think
about the future. Oh boy.

950
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,760
I told you know. Well, you know, at least
she's not asking for a kid. We made,

951
00:59:02,761 --> 00:59:07,310
I don't think about the future. I
bought a house. You dizzy broad.

952
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:12,740
Uh, I told her that a gas
powered generator is literally
a symbol for the future.

953
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,710
Uh,
you talk about this stuff all the time,

954
00:59:15,711 --> 00:59:17,990
but have you actually got anything ready?
Thanks.

955
00:59:17,991 --> 00:59:22,070
Ps loved the music and the
throwbacks. Uh, well Andrew thumbless,

956
00:59:22,071 --> 00:59:26,840
he's the one that picks out the
music. Um, I, I bought some shit.

957
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:31,400
I bought some bucket of fucking food
that, you know, would last forever.

958
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,940
And like the lid on the bucket,
um,

959
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:38,060
also doubled as a toilet seat
and you could shit in the bucket,

960
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:42,440
but then I don't know where
your food went. I went down
the rabbit hole, you know,

961
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:46,310
about 10 years ago, thinking
about, you know, uh,

962
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:51,090
going off the grid and fucking buying gold
and silver coins and all of this shit.

963
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:54,320
And then I was just, then I just went the
other way and I was just like, you know,

964
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:56,330
I don't think I want to
survive the apocalypse.

965
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,020
I'm fine if I'm laying in the street,
you know what I mean?

966
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:05,030
Cause then I would just live
this unbelievable quality life.

967
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:08,660
And then once the apocalypse
hit and everything sucked,

968
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,420
I wouldn't have to fucking live
through it. You know, you're like,

969
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:15,430
when I'll fucking player like a,

970
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:16,520
okay,

971
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,230
say like doc rivers. Like, you know,

972
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:22,450
he won a championship with the Celtics
and then they totally dismantled the team

973
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:25,450
and he's like, dude, I, I'm too fucking
old to go through a rebuilding year.

974
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:28,780
That's how I feel with like
society. Okay. It's just been great.

975
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,920
Every fucking day of my life.
Okay. Yeah. Just, you know.

976
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:34,690
Yeah.

977
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:37,570
My fucking dresser drawer is
full of championship rings.

978
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:41,260
I got to live in this country. Look
at how I looked. I fucking lucked out.

979
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:46,580
Not going to fucking lie to you. I lucked
out. So follow that shit goes away.

980
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,120
You know what I mean?
And everything just collapses.

981
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:53,090
And then fucking prisoners at car.
I'm not going to fucking survive that.

982
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,420
So that'll be it.
You know what I mean?

983
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:02,380
I'd fucking down a bottle of
booze and then just turn the,

984
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,350
I guess it's different now
that I got a family. I Dunno.

985
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:08,300
Maybe I'll buy a generator.
All right. Movie,

986
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:15,550
movie lines. I gave you one
this week. See She, she, uh,

987
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,010
did Billy Bass drum.
Uh,

988
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:22,490
this is the best line from a [inaudible]
could we talk bass drums here for a

989
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:23,324
second?

990
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:28,510
Everybody I know has a different fucking
way of tuning the Goddamn Bass Drum.

991
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:33,020
What is your, what is the way that you
do it? Do you get a good sound out of it?

992
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:38,770
I just had somebody blew my fucking mind
when I thought it was you just tuned

993
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,630
the batter head.
You know,

994
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:45,090
that was the one that I thought
you put a little tension too.

995
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:50,250
And then I thought the other side,
you just fucking, you know, just

996
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:51,310
yeah.

997
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:55,460
You know, tightened it. Pass the
wrinkle. Alright. Cause Hey, you want to,

998
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,750
you want to move that air, right?
You also want to have the, I dunno,

999
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,720
fuck the fucking beat or have
something to rebound off of. And uh,

1000
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:05,880
then I met somebody and he fucking
tells me the exact opposite thing.

1001
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,220
And then I met somebody this weekend
and he goes back the other way.

1002
01:02:08,221 --> 01:02:12,390
I don't know what the fuck to do.
All I know is my bass drum tuning sucks.

1003
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:17,650
So, um, whatever, I'm going to give
it another shot. I'm just gonna.

1004
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:20,580
You just have to have the balls to just,

1005
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,940
just keep on doing it and doing it
back again and then just dealing with

1006
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,160
whatever shit sound you'd
come up with an each time.

1007
01:02:26,161 --> 01:02:29,520
Hopefully getting it a
little bit better. But, uh,

1008
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:33,210
I'm always open to listen to people.
Uh,

1009
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,290
any ideas you have, please let me
know. All right, dear Billy Bass drum,

1010
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:42,000
this is the best line from a supporting
character in a movie is from Wayne's

1011
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:45,270
world too. There's nothing
vulgar so you can play it on air.

1012
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:50,370
Wayne and Garth had brought a roadie back
from the UK to help put a concert put

1013
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:55,140
on a concert while hanging out.
He tells them this crazy story,

1014
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:59,610
rock and roll story about Ozzy, Jeff Beck
and Keith Richards. Give it a listen.

1015
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:00,660
All right,

1016
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:04,350
let's hope there's no fucking racial
slurs in this like there was last week.

1017
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,400
Um,
or some reason the link isn't working.

1018
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:17,160
Oh, well, I want the link work. Where
is it? Oh, you know what I need.

1019
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,920
I have to go over here.
Hang on, I'll hit pause.

1020
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:23,190
You don't have to torture your way through
this. All right, we're back. Here we go.

1021
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,680
Here it is air. It is. Come on.

1022
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:34,910
Go on
stage.

1023
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,790
No one's going to be able to
hear this dude. I don't know why.

1024
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:41,100
It's super fucking quiet.
What's going on here?

1025
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:47,470
I got all the volumes up. Oh, I
know this thing. And that's when he,

1026
01:03:47,471 --> 01:03:50,380
in the end he said, uh, you know, he
goes into the store to go buy him.

1027
01:03:50,381 --> 01:03:54,970
You need to buy chocolate m and m's
to fill up into Ozzie's brandy glass.

1028
01:03:54,971 --> 01:03:59,971
And he goes there and the place was closed
and they had some dog fights off the

1029
01:04:00,701 --> 01:04:04,660
dog and then he had the murder, the
owners with their own shoes. Right.

1030
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:08,140
I think that's what it is. I'm sorry dude.
I don't know if anybody can hear this.

1031
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,400
Can you hear it?

1032
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:27,480
Well, instead of this bloody

1033
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:31,803
well

1034
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,830
in the shop phone on his son,
different story all together.

1035
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,970
All right.
To beat them to death.

1036
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:50,950
There you go. Nasty businesses in
it. I never watched it. I know.

1037
01:04:50,951 --> 01:04:53,800
I never saw Wayne's world. That was
right when I started doing standup.

1038
01:04:53,801 --> 01:04:57,700
So I fucking missed out on it. I was
too busy trying to get on stage. Oh,

1039
01:04:57,701 --> 01:04:58,121
by the way,

1040
01:04:58,121 --> 01:05:03,121
the ticket link for the all things
comedy podcast festival is in Phoenix is

1041
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,650
up@billboard.com for the first time ever.

1042
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:10,651
I am going to do a live
Monday morning podcast.

1043
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:14,320
Now the first thing is you asking yourself
as like, you're going to have a guest?

1044
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:18,280
No.
Are you going to address the no,

1045
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,050
I'm going to go out there.

1046
01:05:20,051 --> 01:05:22,360
I'm going to get a bed and I'm
just going to lay down in it.

1047
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:25,450
You guys are fucking sit there and watch
it. I don't know if it's gonna work,

1048
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:28,840
but we'll see. We'll see. It's
going to be more like a play.

1049
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:36,550
It's going to have headphones on. I'm
going to block out people laughing. Um,

1050
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,140
I'm probably,
I have to react to the crowd,

1051
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:41,320
but I'm not going to be fucking going
out there doing stand up or any of that.

1052
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:44,170
I'm going to sit down and I'm just going
to fucking do my boy. You're again.

1053
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:45,520
You know, if you're just
going to be able to watch it.

1054
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:49,660
I've got to have some sort
of commemorative tee shirt
or a poster or some shit,

1055
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,710
but that is going down
in Phoenix, Arizona. He,

1056
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:56,290
I've never done the video thing I did
at one time and it at the all things

1057
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:58,990
comedy podcast,
I guess I did at one time,

1058
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:03,520
but if you ever wanted to see what the
fuck this shit looks like, um, who knows?

1059
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:06,340
Maybe it won't work.
Like rap, like rap live.

1060
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:07,930
Remember when they
didn't know I'm I sorry.

1061
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,850
Wrapped with a live band member that
when they tried to do that unplugged you

1062
01:06:12,851 --> 01:06:17,410
only guy who ever pulled it off was ll
cool j. He pulled it off. Everybody else.

1063
01:06:17,411 --> 01:06:19,810
It just never,
it just didn't fucking work.

1064
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,080
You got to add the guy on the turntables.
Um,

1065
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,950
I'm probably wrong about that, but I just
said it and I'm going to stick by it.

1066
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:31,000
All right. Fat phobic.
Dear Billy Backbreaker,

1067
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:35,530
I'm a 28 year old Hawaii
male living in Ohio.

1068
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:39,190
I had been single for nearly
four years now. Congratulations.

1069
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:44,050
I consider myself to be an active
guy. Rock climbing, going to the gym.

1070
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:48,160
Is this like your Tinder fucking
bullshit you're sending me.

1071
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:53,260
I like to rock climb, go to the
gym, cycling, et Cetera. Anyways,

1072
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:58,270
I used to be overweight at 250 pounds
and over the course of a year I was able

1073
01:06:58,271 --> 01:07:02,380
to get down to 172 pounds and maintain
that to to the activeness and eating a

1074
01:07:02,381 --> 01:07:07,170
plant based diet. Good for
fucking you sir. Making me fall.

1075
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:10,720
You're inspiring me. Good for you
man. What a great thing you did.

1076
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,430
My situation is this.

1077
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:16,480
I have some ladies that have expressed
their interest in me. However,

1078
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:20,170
the majority of them are overweight and
have no self control when it comes to

1079
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:23,440
their diet and exercise.
I'm not attracted to bigger women,

1080
01:07:23,441 --> 01:07:28,441
which puts me in a difficult situation
when they very openly flirt and invite me

1081
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:31,780
out. Why? You're not attracted to them.

1082
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:36,810
That's totally fine and it's totally
fine to not be into overweight people.

1083
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:38,860
I don't know why.

1084
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:42,520
You have to pretend that you're in
the people that you're not into,

1085
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,080
so the person you know eating the
fucking Drake's cake can feel good about

1086
01:07:47,081 --> 01:07:51,490
themselves. What about you? There's
still a victim in there. Okay.

1087
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:56,230
And considering being on a shape
is curable for most people.

1088
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:59,320
I'm not saying it's not a disease,
but for most people they do what you do,

1089
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:02,980
plant based Diet to get
active and fucking falls off.

1090
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:05,810
Plus considering you are a fatty,

1091
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,640
this is like an alcoholic,
you know who got sober,

1092
01:08:09,641 --> 01:08:11,050
you're going to go hang
out with an alcoholic.

1093
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:14,470
I guarantee you will become a fat
fuck hanging out with them. Right?

1094
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,190
And then where are you going to be?

1095
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,550
You're going to be laying down
and she tries to ride you on top.

1096
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:23,380
I hope you got enough to fucking still
get it in there to belly slapping

1097
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,940
together. You don't have to
be part of that to you. Uh,

1098
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:30,680
the ladies can turn down men no problem.
But when a man turns down a lady,

1099
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:34,090
some of the ladies I work with in their
close friends, I've known for you.

1100
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,940
Some of the ladies I work with in our
close friends I've known for years. Well,

1101
01:08:36,941 --> 01:08:38,330
why the fuck would you date them anyways?

1102
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,860
They know that I've been single for
four years. Honestly, I am picking,

1103
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:46,520
I've also learned to be happy after
multiple bad relationships. Dude,

1104
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:48,830
you are fucking crushing life right now.

1105
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:54,160
Don't fuck it up by dating some fatty
that you work with because society is

1106
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:57,950
telling you that you're not
progressive if you don't. Anyways,

1107
01:08:57,951 --> 01:09:01,190
so when I deny a date requests
or don't flirt back with them,

1108
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,950
they say that I'm fat phobic.

1109
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:11,570
Is this, what if this has come to, um,

1110
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:17,390
what gives some fat fucking
mantated Douche came walking
up to them pressing his

1111
01:09:17,981 --> 01:09:20,560
dick up against, I mean that's
what the fuck they're doing to you

1112
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:28,260
sticking their fucking clam and your
face smelling like a Jim Dandy Sunday at

1113
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:33,670
friendlies. Right? What the fuck?
Fuck off. I'm not fat phobic.

1114
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:39,640
I just weighed 172 pounds and I know
that I can get a better fucking cut of

1115
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:42,460
meat. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to go.

1116
01:09:42,461 --> 01:09:45,820
That means I'm just saying cause that
fat phobic pissed me off. All right,

1117
01:09:45,821 --> 01:09:49,540
you should respect
everybody. Just say, listen.

1118
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,220
Um, I used to be fat like you
and I started rock climbing.

1119
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:56,890
Why don't you rock climb?
Okay.

1120
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:59,950
Or at least maybe just stare at a bunch
of rocks instead of eating rocky road

1121
01:09:59,951 --> 01:10:03,100
ice cream every fucking weekend
may be girl, throw your bang.

1122
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:07,210
Every once in a while is dice clay
says, I'll trow you a bang. Yeah, dude,

1123
01:10:07,211 --> 01:10:08,410
can I tell you something right now,

1124
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:14,700
this fucking woman's movement
thing is completely out of control.

1125
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:18,820
It's completely out of control.
They are not all of them,

1126
01:10:18,821 --> 01:10:22,570
but so many of them are everything that
they're fucking preaching that they

1127
01:10:22,571 --> 01:10:27,530
don't want guys to do
to them. Okay? There,

1128
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:32,560
you know you have the
absolute 100% right to date.

1129
01:10:33,231 --> 01:10:34,910
Whoever the fuck you want to date,

1130
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:38,330
you have the right to be as
shallow as you fucking want to be.

1131
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:43,850
You could date for looks for 10 fucking
years if you want to before you want to

1132
01:10:43,851 --> 01:10:47,210
settle down and get serious. You
know, and if you wait too long,

1133
01:10:47,211 --> 01:10:50,570
you're going to pay the price, but
it's your life. The linen. This is,

1134
01:10:50,571 --> 01:10:51,950
this is your fucking life,
dude.

1135
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,000
You're going to date some fucking fatty
and you don't want to just so what the

1136
01:10:58,001 --> 01:11:02,560
those constant work, we'll
look at you in a better way. I,

1137
01:11:02,561 --> 01:11:06,130
I wouldn't do that. Just be like,
yeah, my dance card is full.

1138
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:11,320
All right, this, these are
the measurements I like and
I'm not ashamed of it. Okay?

1139
01:11:11,321 --> 01:11:15,370
That's what I find attractive
as do you,

1140
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:18,460
can I tell you something?
All of those women at work,

1141
01:11:18,461 --> 01:11:23,050
if they could be the size that
you find attractive would be,

1142
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:27,010
you know what I mean?
And they ate their way into that position.

1143
01:11:27,011 --> 01:11:30,100
It's their job to eat the way out,
the same way you did.

1144
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,920
So you had to get on a bike,
you had to climb a bunch of rocks,

1145
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:37,540
you had to do all this shit. Now
your urine game shape, right?

1146
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:42,130
You're fucking and Coby Bryan shape and
there's showing up like shack and they

1147
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:45,890
want to try to play their way into shape.
Remember Colby still,

1148
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:50,350
he's give chefs shit for doing that.
Yeah. Fuck that. Anyways, he says,

1149
01:11:50,351 --> 01:11:52,120
I've never pointed out their weight,

1150
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:56,350
but when I have openly expressed interest
in other women while talking to the

1151
01:11:56,351 --> 01:12:00,520
other guys at work, the women start to
shame me. All right dude. You know what?

1152
01:12:00,521 --> 01:12:05,400
I was on your side until you said
shame. What do, what the fuck happened?

1153
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:09,300
What happened to people?
They shame you.

1154
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:12,420
You just fucking laugh at him saying that.

1155
01:12:12,421 --> 01:12:16,350
Only like bones and twigs.
Um,

1156
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:19,500
I get along with everybody
so I never strike back.

1157
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:24,180
What's your problem with anything in
fear that I might be taken to HR for God

1158
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:25,410
knows what in days.

1159
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:31,010
Also having denied some of the women
they've gone as far as to not speak to me

1160
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:37,640
as much until other female co coworkers.
How horrible of a man I am.

1161
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:42,970
Leaving them to have bad attitudes against
me just because I won't date them. Uh,

1162
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,370
do what he looked like Burt Reynolds. What
the fuck's going on here? I would, uh,

1163
01:12:46,371 --> 01:12:49,280
yeah. Listen, this is the deal.

1164
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:54,250
Women go to HR guys, just laugh
at it. So just laugh at it, dude.

1165
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:58,100
You know what I would do? I would be
overly friendly to the ones that hate me.

1166
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:05,240
You know, morning. So
you look lovely today.

1167
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:08,480
Kill them with kindness,

1168
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:13,990
and then I would bring the most smoking
hot fucking chick you can find to the

1169
01:13:14,211 --> 01:13:18,380
fucking Christmas party. That's what you
got to do anyways. He says it's true.

1170
01:13:18,381 --> 01:13:22,490
I'm not attracted to big a women. That's
fine. There's nothing wrong with that.

1171
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:27,020
But women sit around all day talking
about guys having to be this tall,

1172
01:13:27,021 --> 01:13:29,540
have this fair, she'll
hair, wear these clothes.

1173
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:33,050
But when a man has any sort of criteria,
we get shamed.

1174
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:36,430
Do Stop saying that.
Okay?

1175
01:13:36,431 --> 01:13:40,420
Being shamed is totally within your own
power at the age that you're at. Okay?

1176
01:13:40,421 --> 01:13:43,330
If you're a fucking teenager or
younger, I get it. All right?

1177
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:46,540
But at some point you gotta be
comfortable with how you look. Okay?

1178
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:49,420
You've got to get comfortable with
yourself and then someone can't shame you

1179
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:53,410
unless you actually did
something shameful. Yeah.

1180
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,080
If he kicked the puppy across the room,
you know what I mean?

1181
01:13:56,081 --> 01:13:58,390
You don't want to be comfortable enough
with yourself that you can handle the

1182
01:13:58,391 --> 01:14:02,410
criticism and have it not affect. You
should feel shame. All right. Anyways,

1183
01:14:02,411 --> 01:14:02,591
he goes,

1184
01:14:02,591 --> 01:14:05,680
I'm writing to hopefully get your take
on the matter and hear what you would do

1185
01:14:05,681 --> 01:14:06,580
in this situation.

1186
01:14:06,581 --> 01:14:11,581
I will never see desiring of fit healthy
person who about their body as a bad

1187
01:14:13,331 --> 01:14:14,380
thing. No, you shouldn't.

1188
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:19,750
And that's something that all people
should aspire to be fit and in shape,

1189
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:22,750
healthier than they were yesterday.
As much as you can. I, you know,

1190
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:24,070
obviously the aging process,

1191
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:29,020
you're getting older every second
one step closer to the grave. Right.

1192
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,740
But you know, in the meantime, yeah.
Uh, thanks for all the good laughs.

1193
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:37,180
You and Nia are the friends. I wish
I had real life. That's so nice.

1194
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:41,620
Have a good day. Go Fuck Yourself. Yeah,
Dude. By the way, that goes for women too.

1195
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:45,220
Postal women too. All right. Um,

1196
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:46,650
yeah,

1197
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:50,430
yeah. Dave, what the fuck you want to
date? And if you want to be shallow.

1198
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:51,870
Yeah.

1199
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:56,790
You know, in dish date hot people than
just do that. See what that's like.

1200
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:03,080
It's up to you. I don't understand.
You know what I mean? Like the,

1201
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:06,980
you know what you have at work. Do you
have a bunch of busy bodies, you know,

1202
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:09,410
and as these people out there
that want to be the person to say,

1203
01:15:09,411 --> 01:15:13,510
I introduced this person or that person,
um,

1204
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:18,080
oh dude, I swear to God,
man, I swear to God,

1205
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,900
you find the hottest fucking
chick you can fucking find.

1206
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,610
You can fucking find. Take her to the
Goddamn Christmas party. And by the way,

1207
01:15:25,611 --> 01:15:29,120
let her know what's up.
Let her know what's up.

1208
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,740
I would say I would find,
I would tell some fucking,

1209
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:36,220
I would tell some hot chick that
whole fucking story and you know,

1210
01:15:36,221 --> 01:15:37,480
hot chicks loved being hot.

1211
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:40,510
Nothing that they would make them feel
hotter than to go down there and have a

1212
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:43,810
bunch of women look at or just hate
her because how fucking hace is.

1213
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:47,650
There you go. Find that chick.
Maybe she's into sports too.

1214
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,850
Next thing you know, you guys are
running the country, not the country.

1215
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:55,810
That company.
That's perfect.

1216
01:15:57,050 --> 01:16:01,710
Ah, it's a fantasy. But maybe you can
make it happen, sir. I'm good luck to you.

1217
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:05,630
Good luck to you. And uh,
that's it. And by the way,

1218
01:16:05,631 --> 01:16:09,950
there's plenty of guys out there that
like big women, you know what I mean?

1219
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,073
It's plenty.

1220
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:13,420
Yeah.

1221
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:18,310
Did you get, it's up to you to be happy
with your own fucking body. All right.

1222
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:22,840
I'm telling you,
telling you just fucking have a salad.

1223
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:26,260
Have One fucking salad a day.
Start fucking working out.

1224
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:30,130
Read up as much as you can on nutrition.
Try the best you can.

1225
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:33,820
Eat the best food you can,
which is really difficult,

1226
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:38,680
you know, so he could do
then. Other than that,

1227
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:43,380
leave people alone and let them date.
Who the fuck they want to date? Um,

1228

ugly under roof fucking jerseys.
