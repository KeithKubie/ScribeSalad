00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.450
Good afternoon.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.780
Thanks for braving the
deluge and being with us.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.210
My name is Robin Kelsey.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.020
And along with Ian Miller--
my colleague in the history

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.230
department--

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.110
I want to welcome you
to the environment

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.370
forum at the Mahindra
Humanities Center.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.080
The center director,
Homi Bhabha--

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.430
without whom Ian and I would
be holding these events

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.729
in the subbasement of Weidner--

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.840
could not be here
this afternoon.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.160
But he sends his
encouragement and benevolence.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.610
His support for our
venture is essential.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.840
But that said, without the
Mahindra Humanity Center's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.670
Steve Biel and Sarah
Razor, Homi, Ian, and I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.170
would be hosting these events
in the subbasement of Weidner.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.080
So to them go our heartfelt
thanks for all that they do.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.560
Some of you may know that
Harvard has a program called

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.530
Harvard Heroes that
recognizes staff members whose

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.780
contributions to campus life go
above and beyond any reasonable

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.950
expectation.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.460
And last week it was
announced that Sarah

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.850
is a hero, which
we already knew,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.160
but it is wonderful to have
it recognized officially.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.210
So I'd like to give
Sarah a round of applause

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.100
The environment forum
has a particular purpose.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.240
When Ian and I approached
Professor Bhabha with the idea

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.290
for the forum, we were not
content with the notion

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.230
of sprinkling some humanist
ideas into conversations

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.090
around the environment.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.490
We wanted to bring
the environment

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.040
to the center of conversations
about what the humanities might

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.240
be.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.050
The aim was not to include the
environment in the humanities

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.979
as one more topic
or theme, but rather

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.010
to ask what happens
to the humanities

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.280
when one takes the
immensely challenging

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.350
environmental conditions
under which we

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.750
live as a pressing and
critical fact of human life.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.030
I've been speaking
of the environment,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.110
but of course there are many
overlapping environments

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.570
that touch human
lives differently,

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.880
depending on social relations
and material circumstances.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.800
Wealth and privilege offer
buffers from the consequences

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.470
of environmental
disruption, which

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.730
is incurred largely in the
production of that wealth

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.020
and privilege.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.570
While poverty,
discrimination, and abjection

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.880
bring many forms of
exposure and vulnerability.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.010
In launching the
environment forum,

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.070
questions of environmental
justice, as well as

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.440
questions about where theory
hits lived experience,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.720
were very much on our minds.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.510
From the start, Ian
and I have wanted

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.570
this to be an
inclusive venture built

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.800
on an ever widening circle
of students and faculty

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.660
interested in the intersection
between humanistic questions,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.580
broadly defined, and
environmental issues.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.690
One colleague with whom we
knew we wanted to collaborate

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.990
was Ajanta
Subermanian, professor

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.310
of anthropology and
South Asian studies.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.450
And this gathering,
this event on Scales

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.990
of Environmental Justice,
Building A Transformative

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.660
Politics, is in every
profound way her event.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.510
And we are so grateful
for the vision and energy

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.670
that she has brought
to putting it together.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.030
With that I will turn over the
task of further introductions

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.660
to her.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.908
So please join me in welcoming
Ajanta to the podium.

00:04:14.908 --> 00:04:17.836
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:23.692 --> 00:04:26.170
This is not conducive
to short people.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.180
Thank you Robin for that.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.480
So this event has been a
long time in the making.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.080
And I'm delighted to have all
of my fellow panelists here.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.900
So scales of
environmental justice.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.330
These are urgent times.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.000
We're witnessing the
rise of authoritarianism

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.480
and ethonationalist
politics the world over.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.090
In the United States, the
election of Donald Trump

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.870
has ushered in more
tolerance for overt racism,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.120
greater collusion between
government and corporate

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.750
interests, and the rollback
of hard won advances

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.920
in environmental
and social security.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.590
With Scott Pruitt reversing
environmental gains

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.410
at breakneck speed,
what is at stake

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.930
is nothing less than the
very idea of the greater

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.020
social good.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.090
These are times that are
particularly well suited

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.840
to environmental justice.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.672
A politics born out of
necessity and possibility.

00:05:33.672 --> 00:05:35.630
From the vantage point
of environmental justice

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.530
communities, however, the crisis
in ecological and social health

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.160
has been urgent for a
very, very long time.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.890
Capitalism-- even
the democratic kind--

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.530
has always had its
sacrifice zones

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.540
where ecologies and
populations have

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.120
been treated as expendable.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.060
Within the United States
most of the sacrifice zones

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.910
are poor and non-white,
and have been

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.840
subject to repeated
histories of marginalization.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.000
The list is long--

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.270
Warren County, North Carolina,
Yucca Mountain, Nevada,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.240
the Lower Ninth
Ward in New Orleans,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.530
Flint, Michigan Chicago's south
side, the Standing Rock Indian

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.760
reservation, Puerto Rico,
Roxbury, Massachusetts,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.682
and on, and on, and on.

00:06:26.682 --> 00:06:29.140
These are also places where
environmental justice movements

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.310
have arisen, that point to the
overlap between race, class,

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.370
dispossession, and toxicity.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.170
These movements
eliminate the limits

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.660
of mainstream
environmentalism, and the need

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.050
to bring within its purview
industrial regulation,

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.060
public health,
occupational safety, labor

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.820
rights, urban green space,
and sustainable cities.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.350
In this sense,
environmental justice

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.350
has always been a
universalistic politics

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.149
aimed at prioritizing public
goods over private gain.

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:04.440
Although environmental justice
was a powerful challenge

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.520
to mainstream environmentalism,
environmental justice activists

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.960
typically refer
to themselves not

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.560
as the new environmentalists,
but as the new civil rights

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.090
activists.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.620
And they do so to
place themselves

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.230
within a particular
genealogy of struggle,

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.320
where the rights of nonwhite
populations and the poor

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.270
have been at the center.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.180
Language-- or more
specifically storytelling--

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.490
has been an important tool
within environmental justice

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.950
activism for naming
and illuminating

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.970
injustices that have been
invisible to a wider public.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.310
Take the term
environmental racism,

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.820
coined by North Carolina pastor
and community leader Benjamin

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.830
Chaffetz in 1982, to describe
the siting of a toxic waste

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.030
dump in predominantly black
Warren County, North Carolina.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.240
The Warren County
mobilization racialized

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.640
the anti-toxics agenda,
and generated a whole host

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.780
of studies on the unequal burden
of enviromental toxicity borne

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.240
by US racial minorities.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.210
By naming this phenomenon
environmental racism,

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.400
activists expanded the
parameters of the term

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.580
environment, and made visible
a widespread experience shared

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.240
by poor and nonwhite communities
across the United States.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.640
Similarly environmental
apartheid--

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.390
another term coined by urban
planning scholar and activist

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.740
Robert Bullard--

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.430
pointed to the overlap of
race, place, and toxicity.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.700
And the parallel
hazards of black life

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.370
in apartheid South Africa and
the democratic United States.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.809
Through these
practices of naming,

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.200
environmental justice
disrupts normative narratives

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.270
about which places
and which people

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.360
have value, and shapes
alternative imaginations

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.080
of place and politics.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.000
It also offers ways to
channel experiences of harm

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.580
into public knowledge
and collective action

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.840
at different scales.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.830
As our panelists will show
eloquently through their work,

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.400
envirometal justice
is a multi-scaler

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.000
of politics that ranges
from the scale of the body,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.780
to that of the home, the
neighborhood, city, nation,

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.456
and beyond.

00:09:07.456 --> 00:09:09.830
So what does it mean to think
about environmental justice

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.910
at different scales?

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.360
My justice has always
emphasized that importance

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.420
of grounded experience to
transformative politics.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.130
As stated in the charter
of the 1991 National

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.400
People of Color Environmental
Leadership Summit, convened

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.340
in Washington DC,
enviromental justice

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.150
is about doing environmental
in the very places, quote,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.600
"Where we live, work,
study, and play" unquote.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.730
The embodied
experience of locality

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.730
has been key to the making
of knowledge of community

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.890
and of politics.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.870
The emphasis on
the local scale has

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.870
been a way to foreground the
meanings, through which people

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.640
who are typically
written out of, or simply

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.970
subsumed within
larger narratives,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.960
make sense of their own lives.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.730
It's an argument
for their agency

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.990
in interpreting the
past, the present,

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.460
and building a better future.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.740
But environmental justice
has never been just

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.780
about the local scale--

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.090
it's also been about the
broader contextualization

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.690
of local experiences, to make
clear shared predicaments,

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.240
and enable coalition building.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.240
The need to think and act
both within and across scales

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.250
has only grown
with the expansion

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.590
of the movement over
time from its beginnings

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.480
in the citing of dirty
industries and toxic waste,

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.330
to now taking on
issues as diverse

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:34.040
as transportation justice, urban
green space, housing quality,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.030
the beauty industry,
militarism, and climate change.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.190
Each of these issues has
required new strategies

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.890
and alliances, which
foreground both the promises

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.360
and tensions of working in
coalitions across scales.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.600
We have very powerful
examples of such solidarity.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.480
Some have involved
collaboration between activists

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.200
and scientists.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.510
Public health scientists
and women activists

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.150
have together shown that
non-white women's heightened

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.390
exposure to toxic chemicals
in beauty products

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.660
is an instance of a
global health disparity.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.870
In doing so, they've linked the
toxins in hair straighteners,

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.060
skin lighteners and
non-white women's

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.550
bodies to structural racism.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.900
While toxins are one
diagnostic of broader

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.369
structural conditions,
water is another.

00:11:21.369 --> 00:11:23.660
Water has been at the heart
of an environmental justice

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.930
politics that is both
local and trans-local.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:32.600
In Gaza, Flint, Durban,
Cochabama, Bhopal, and Standing

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.500
Rock, residents have demanded
the right to water as is safe,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.080
evenly distributed,
public resource.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.670
The claim to water as life
is a far-reaching critique

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.790
of commodification,
privatization, and settler

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.640
colonialism that has brought
residents into alliance

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.770
with lawyers, litigating
on their behalf

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.660
against both states and
corporate polluters.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.560
Once these similar efforts
to illuminate commonalities

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.780
through shared struggles
around the right

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.860
to housing, to transportation
equity, and to green space.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.500
So these are examples of how
environmental justice scales up

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.530
from the most intimate and
everyday forms of bodily

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:16.370
harm and need, to wider
systems of oppression.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.440
By contrast, the
climate justice movement

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.810
works in the other direction.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:25.760
By reframing global warming
as an environmental injustice,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.310
the movement scales
down to highlight

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.000
the localized differential
impact of climate change.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.940
As a result, we now recognize
enduring differences

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.970
within a shared crisis, that
most immediately affects

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.670
frontline communities, such
as the victims of Hurricane

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.150
Katrina, and the
Inuit of the Arctic.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.770
These and other
solidarity movements

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:49.460
have connected the dots between
an individual health problem,

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.830
or a localized
struggle for resources,

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.700
and wider processes of
redlining gentrification, state

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.340
violence, and corporate power.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.410
They've shown how links
between scales both

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:05.860
perpetuate injustice, but can
also become key to battling it.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.230
And environmental justice
as a multi-scaler politics

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.090
is not just about
the relationship

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.650
between spatial scales.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.250
It's also about scales of time--

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.300
by pointing to the birth defects
in children born 30 years

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.930
after the Bhopal gas disaster,
by characterizing the water

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.860
crisis in Gaza and Standing
Rock as settler colonialism,

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.870
or Shell Oil's extraction sites
as petrochemical plantations,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.780
or the anthropocene
as the capitalocene,

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.060
environmental justice
movements offer a different way

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.090
of thinking about
and inhabiting time.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.780
Not as linear, but as
overlapping, continuous,

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.390
cyclical, or repetitive.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.580
Within these conceptions
of past and present,

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.895
there are also ways of
re-imagining the future.

00:13:52.895 --> 00:13:54.770
The panelists who have
joined us this evening

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.410
represent a few of
the remarkable women--

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.290
women of color-- working
on the front lines,

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:04.520
and across different scales
of environmental justice.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.970
Kalila Barnett is currently
the interim director,

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.270
executive director of the Dudley

program which funds
cross-sector collaborative

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.990
work for economic justice
in communities of color.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.030
Her background includes
facilitating community

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:07.020
dialogues, and consulting on
issues of anti-oppression,

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.620
civic engagement, economic
justice, racial justice,

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.810
leadership development
collaboration, and community

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:13.850
building.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.110
Trina is also a gardener,

where she used popular
education strategies to engage

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.990
and empower local communities.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.975
Here, Indira has worked to
create women-led cooperatives

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:40.990
in East Boston, and to
envision a community land

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:42.999
trust for Chelsea.

00:15:42.999 --> 00:15:45.040
Indira is committed and
passionate about creating

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.650
systemic change to bring
about racial justice

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.220
and immigrants' rights.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.800
Tenbit Mitiku is a member of
Alternatives for Community

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.510
and Environment,
where she has served

00:15:55.510 --> 00:16:00.280
as a volunteer, development
intern, and now development

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.470
and communications assistant.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:06.130
Born and raised in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.040
her background includes
community oriented education,

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.920
that focused on empowering
low-income women to participate

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.360
in the labor force.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.760
She's also been involved
in several projects that

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.750
address issues of homelessness
in the greater Boston area.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.810
Tenbit earned a sociology
degree from Simmons College,

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.090
and is currently
studying global studies

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.060
and international relations
at Northeastern University.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.900
Her interests are in
economic development,

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.280
environmental research,
and global health equity.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.430
And last, but not least, Ami
Zota received her master's

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.320
and doctorate in
environmental health

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.150
at the Harvard School
of Public Health,

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.680
and is now an
assistant professor

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.240
in the Department
of Environmental

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.170
and Occupational Health at
George Washington University's

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.420
Milken School of Public Health.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.790
Ami's work seeks to secure
environmental justice

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.160
and improve health equity
through advancements

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.040
in science, policy,
and clinical practice.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.140
Her research identifies
novel pathways

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.560
linking social disparities,
environmental exposures,

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.927
and reproductive and
children's health.

00:17:04.927 --> 00:17:06.760
Ami received a career
development grant from

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.440
the National
Institutes of Health,

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.990
and was recently recognized
as a pioneer under 40--

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.420
she's a baby--

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.320
pioneer under 40 in
environmental public health.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.819
Her research has been featured
in national and international

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.150
media, and has helped shape
health and safety standards

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.030
for toxic chemicals.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.510
So before turning
to our panelists,

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.093
let me just say a
little about myself,

00:17:27.093 --> 00:17:29.662
and why I'm so excited
for this panel.

00:17:29.662 --> 00:17:34.030
So I'm an anthropologist, and
my work is on rights politics

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.360
in India.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.020
At Harvard, I teach an
undergraduate course

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.500
titled politics of nature, which
is devoted to understanding

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.840
the relationship between
environmental injustice

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.220
and social inequality.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.590
And each time I've
taught it, Ami and Trina

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.960
have done guest lectures,
and the students

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.260
have gone on a toxic
tour, organized by ACE--

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.974
the organization that Tenbit
and Kalila have been a part of.

00:17:57.974 --> 00:17:59.890
And most of the students
who take the course--

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.348
and some of them
are actually here,

00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:03.012
which I'm really
delighted about--

00:18:03.012 --> 00:18:04.720
most of them take the
course because they

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.410
have some investment in
environmentalism of politics,

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.300
and many would even
characterize themselves

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.130
as environmentalists.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.690
But a lot of them
typically don't

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.470
think about environmentalism
as social justice politics.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.310
And that's what the course
really pushes them to do.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.170
And this is why I
think this panel is

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.770
so important as an addition
to the Mahindra Environment

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:27.959
forum--

00:18:27.959 --> 00:18:29.500
and my hope is that
this conversation

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.890
about environmental
justice, and local activism,

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.260
will have a lasting
impact on how

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.830
we think about the environmental
humanities [INAUDIBLE]..

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.980
So let's turn now
to our panelists.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.860
I've asked each of them to
speak for about 10 minutes,

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.421
after which we'll open
up the floor to Q&amp;A.

00:18:47.421 --> 00:18:48.920
So we're going to
start with Kalila.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.950
Thank you so much for the
opportunity to be here

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.360
on this cold, wet afternoon.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.560
Especially, I'm happy to be here
amongst this wonderful group

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:12.180
of panelists and women who,
some of whom I've worked with,

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.100
some of whom I've
just met today.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.190
It's a real honor for me.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:22.200
So I was asked to speak
about the scale of the city,

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.000
in terms of
environmental justice.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.460
And so I will be
talking primarily

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.250
about my experience and my
work in the city of Boston,

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:33.300
because that is the place
that I know the best,

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.360
for better or for worse.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:42.160
And I wanted to start by
talking about this event that's

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.990
coming up, that
I hope all of you

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:49.070
will participate in, that's
very inspiring to me.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.120
So May 1st is World
Asthma Day, and it is also

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.550
International Workers Day.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:59.960
One of the organizations that
I am very closely connected to,

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.750
because of my work at
ACE, and my activism work,

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.910
is Community Labor United.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.390
And that organization has formed
a coalition called the Green

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.750
Justice Coalition.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.790
And it's a group
of organizations

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.040
across the state of
Massachusetts, community

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.310
organizations, environmental
organizations, and labor

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:23.620
unions, who are organizing
around the intersection

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.740
of environment and economics.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.520
And the event that we're
putting together that day

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.990
is called #letusbreathe.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.320
And the way that we
envision this event

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.300
is just by this
brief statement--

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.180
"Around the world, there are
people struggling to breathe.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.180
For some, it is the
effect of pollution.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:52.040
For others, crippling heat,
intensified by climate change.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.710
And then there are folks
like Eric Garner, whose

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.370
airways were restricted
by a combination of asthma

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.640
and brutal force."

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.370
And for me, this
is a real summation

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.880
of where the environmental
justice movement is at,

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.320
at this moment.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:18.090
So in many ways the shape of the
environmental justice movement,

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:22.830
the kind of battles that
we're facing in 2018,

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.190
are different than they
were when I started at ACE,

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:30.510
and when large
environmental justice

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.917
organizations across the
country were formed in the '90s.

00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:36.000
The sort of structures
that we're fighting against

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.460
are still remaining,
but the battles

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.380
look a little bit different.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.050
And the struggle really,
at this moment, I think,

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.780
is trying to figure out how
do we build the kind of power

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:52.370
that we need to achieve the kind
of change that we want to see.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.070
And for us, that's really
about the power and control

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.530
to make decisions
about our lives,

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:02.240
and the ways in which we want
to transform our community.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.220
And in Boston, in
particular, I think

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:09.020
there's kind of three ways
that the landscape of how

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.440
we're working has really
had to change and to adapt.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.080
I think one of the biggest
drivers is the cost of land

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.280
and the cost of housing.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:27.720
So I grew up in Roxbury, and
during my middle school period

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.850
I was bussed to a
school in the suburbs.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.880
I was a part of
the METCO program.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.250
And so at that
time period, when I

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.620
would go to Wayland,
where I went to school,

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:42.610
and tell people that I lived
in Roxbury, it was like, whoa,

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:43.770
it's so dangerous there.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.086
I can't believe you've
even made it out here.

00:22:46.086 --> 00:22:47.910
[LAUGHS]

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.100
Somehow I survived
all of those years,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.240
and was able to be
a part of a thriving

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.440
and beautiful community.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.695
But that was the image.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.920
But now, many of
those people who

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.310
were contemporaries
of my younger siblings

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.140
are moving towards the city--

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:13.030
are buying condos, are
starting businesses,

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.800
and there's a lot of
speculation that's

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.220
going on around the vacant
properties around where

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.860
I grew up.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.710
Members of our
organization of ACE,

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.160
other organizations that
we're closely connected to,

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.020
are facing rent
increases, and are

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.300
having to move
further and further

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.740
outside the city of Boston,
outside of their community.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.350
Sometimes even to southeastern
parts of the state,

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.482
so outside of even the
greater Boston region.

00:23:41.482 --> 00:23:43.440
And that's pretty different
from the conditions

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.910
that we were facing
in the early '90s.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.840
So if you think about
organizations coming together

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.570
during that time,
particularly in major cities

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.800
across the country, dealing
with the impacts of--

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:00.180
or the consequences of
redlining, of disinvestment.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.400
The organization that I'm
connected to right now,

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.920
the Dudley Street
Neighborhood Initiative,

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.620
was when residents came
together to get eminent domain

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.020
powers to take back
control of the land.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:16.240
The other thing that has also
very much changed, I would say,

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.410
is the wealth gap
that we're facing.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.780
So there's always been a huge
disparity, always been troubles

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.520
and challenges with that.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.820
But a recent study that
was done in 2016, called

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.880
the Color of Wealth, mentions
that white households

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.060
in the Boston area had the
median net worth of a quarter

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.720
of a million dollars,
while black households have

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.480
a net worth of $8--

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.200
$8.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.760
So not only are residents
facing pressures

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.730
from a speculative land
and housing market,

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.330
they are not able
to find the wealth,

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.640
they're not able
to find the income

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.760
to bring themselves into place.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.280
And then the third piece I
think is really important

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.600
is the actual infrastructure of
grassroots community organizing

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.900
entities across our region.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:15.090
So while I was at ACE,
my job was fundraising,

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:19.800
was asking for resources to
help us build out the organizing

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.280
work that we needed to
do to build leadership

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.840
within our communities.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.850
And even during the
course of my eight years

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:30.270
there, we saw a number
of national foundations

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.780
who moved away from funding
grassroots organizing.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.010
A lot of money shifted towards
a national climate bill--

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.980
a lot of money given to large
environmental organizations,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.260
and not given to us.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.630
And so the infrastructure
upon which we really

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:49.200
need to build our movements
has gotten more fragile,

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.770
I would say, over time.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.130
And that's really something
important to consider

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:53.880
and to talk about.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:03.780
But I want to end on
a more positive note.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.810
And to offer a couple of
thoughts about, even given

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:09.150
those conditions, how do we
build the kind of movement

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:09.780
that we need?

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.710
How do we build more
events, more collaborations,

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.050
like #letusbreathe?

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.570
So one thing I think
is, we need to have

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.030
a bold and audacious
vision that goes

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:25.150
across a bunch of
different boundaries.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.360
We need to not be
afraid to ask for

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.850
and to demand the
kind of resources

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.800
that our communities
really need,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.350
rather than just what we
think is politically feasible.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.710
One of the ways in which
we're beginning to do that

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:45.100
is by building what we're
calling a 10-year agenda.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.420
So it is an opportunity
for organizations

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.970
across different
sectors to come together

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.610
and to say, what do we want
the state of Massachusetts

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:57.490
to look like over the
course of the next 10 years?

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.470
And we're thinking
not just about,

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.120
what does it look
like in education?

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.380
What does it look
like in housing?

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.820
But what does it
actually look like when

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.089
we think about those things
in an intersectional way,

00:27:06.089 --> 00:27:07.255
and really do them together?

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:14.140
I think we're also talking about
this idea of a just transition.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.200
So we know, because the
climate is changing,

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.240
that things are
going to keep moving.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.390
The change is inevitable,
but justice is not inevitable

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:26.690
unless we speak out, unless
we make a difference.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:28.750
And so using this idea
of just transition,

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:32.620
we're fueling experiments and
projects that would actually

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.350
have community members
make decisions,

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.420
and govern, and lead.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.110
One of them is a micro-grid
project that folks in Chelsea

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.510
are working on,
and also Chinatown

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:48.130
within the city of Boston, where
there is a micro-grid that's

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.110
owned by the community.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:54.490
So if there is ever a
major weather event,

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.250
we know what the impacts can be
when people don't have access

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.040
to the resources they need,
electricity, water, et cetera.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.730
So how do we prepare
ourselves for those things

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:06.220
that we know that
are coming, but do so

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.200
in a way that shifts
the ownership?

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.820
Shifts who gets
to make decisions

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.470
about those
resources, and really

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:16.220
begin to make those
decisions together?

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.350
I think, in closing,
the other things that

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.320
give me hope and signal
to the kind of movement

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.980
that we need to be building is
the rise of the climate justice

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.710
movement.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.750
And so we know that that has
roots internationally, but also

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.690
here within the
US, organizations

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.300
like the Climate Justice
Alliance, Grassroots Global

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.410
Justice, are bringing folks
together at multiple scales,

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:43.910
and cities scales, local
scales, regional scales,

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.220
to talk about what does
it take to really build

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.600
a just transition?

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.290
How do we actually have a hard
line against the fossil fuel

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.050
economy?

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:56.514
How do we not allow
ourselves to--

00:28:56.514 --> 00:29:01.880
that's my timer-- how do we not
allow ourselves to just rest

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.080
in what is politically feasible,
but offer solutions and visions

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.370
that are bold, and what
really needs to happen?

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:12.820
I think the other place
for a real opportunity

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.840
and intersection is the rise
of the Black Lives Matter

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.680
movement, and the
ways in which I

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.660
see people trying to build
and grow the civil rights

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.950
legacy in this country.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.830
I think there's a lot of
opportunity for intersection,

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.920
a lot of opportunity for
leadership development,

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.690
and for sharing of struggles.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:38.050
And so for those reasons,
and probably more

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:42.790
that we'll get to talk about
in the Q&amp;A, I remain excited.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.560
So thank you very much for
the opportunity to talk.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.090
How is it, Jennifer--

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.040
oh, I forgot to
introduce Jennifer.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.680
I'm so sorry.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.560
We're having simultaneous
translation from English

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.080
to Spanish, thanks to Jennifer.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.260
How's the speed?

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.596
Should we speak more slowly?

00:30:08.596 --> 00:30:10.040
Maybe just a tad.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:10.540
Just a tad?

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.040
OK.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:15.410
Trina?

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.190
I'm going to get up
and go to the podium.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.240
Beautiful, OK, good
evening, everyone.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.180
My name is Trina,
and as Ajantha said,

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.640
I had just the honor
and the joy of being

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.430
with her and her students.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.370
It's like an annual ritual--

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:48.890
it's really an important part
of my own growth, and I love it.

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:51.860
And so I'm really happy to
be invited to speak with you

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.550
today, really about something
that I don't talk about a lot.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:59.120
And so I'm not used to talking
about this area of interest

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.510
that I have, so if
you bear with me,

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:06.680
I'm just getting familiar
with my own interest

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.830
and wanting to share with you.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.620
So as Ajantha said,
I love to garden.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.260
I'm not a very good gardener.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.470
I've grown up in a family
of black women who garden.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:23.210
And so what I wanted
to do was to learn more

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:27.710
about African-American
women's gardening practices,

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:31.790
and in particular how
African-American women have not

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.330
only contributed to
environmental justice movement

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:38.650
through our gardening
practices, but also to US

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:41.090
environmental history.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:45.890
And so part of this
project came as part

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.470
of my undergraduate
degree work, which I only

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.155
completed recently, like
within the last two years.

00:31:51.155 --> 00:31:53.865
I went to Goddard
College in Vermont,

00:31:53.865 --> 00:31:56.478
which hasa very different
kind of program--

00:31:56.478 --> 00:32:01.330
one that really suited me, and
I wanted to back and finish

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:03.370
my college education.

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:07.010
And so have this interest
in African-American women

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.340
and our gardening practices.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.570
And I thought for a long
time, what language am I

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.720
going to give this interest?

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.910
What is the story that
I'm really trying to tell?

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:23.520
And so I came up with
this, Grown by Herself.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.670
Let me say a little bit
about what that means to me.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:32.340
The first thing is that,
gardens are stories,

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.900
and they are a way that we
author and we tell our stories.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:41.090
And so I thought, well, how
can I make that connection?

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.940
And so, Grown by Herself--

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:50.962
so in the tradition of the
slave narratives, and that

00:32:50.962 --> 00:32:53.442
they were written
by him or herselv.

00:32:53.442 --> 00:32:56.914
These were stories
that formerly enslaved

00:32:56.914 --> 00:33:00.386
people would tell
others about what

00:33:00.386 --> 00:33:02.500
it was like to be
enslaved, because we know

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.084
a lot of enslaved people did
not learn to read and write,

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.000
because that was forbidden.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.440
So in order to
capture those stories,

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.048
they would tell their stories
to other writers, and other

00:33:14.048 --> 00:33:15.900
[INAUDIBLE].

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:20.460
So I took the term,
thinking that gardens

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:24.980
are a way of authoring our
stories, Grown by Herself

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.090
is very much in that
same tradition--

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:33.100
that black women have authored
an account of their lives

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.080
through gardening.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.290
And that's what the term,
Grown by Herself means.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:42.210
It also means about black
women have ushered and fostered

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.320
environmental movements.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.200
So the environmental movement,
environmental justice,

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.310
has been grown by
African-American women's garden

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.807
practices.

00:33:51.807 --> 00:33:53.803
I'm just going to grab my water.

00:33:59.292 --> 00:34:02.210
So, Grown by Herself,
as I say here,

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:05.750
is about the role
of community gardens

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.680
in the lives of
African-American women

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.130
in their environmental activism.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:11.750
And African-American
women have been

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.429
at the forefront
of the leadership

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.410
for environmental
justice in the US.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:21.020
Their activism has been
about mobilizing communities

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:25.100
to shut down power plants
in their neighborhoods,

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:30.630
or work to beautify streets,
or to convert vacant lots Into

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:31.380
community gardens.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.860
And those are just
a few examples

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.940
of how African-American
women have

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:41.010
led an environmental movement
in our garden practices.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:44.079
So let me say a
little bit about--

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:46.400
oh, here we go--

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.110
so part of my research,
for Grown by Herself,

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:55.520
was thinking about the roots
of African-American women's

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.490
gardens, and what we
grow in our gardens,

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:02.510
and how we developed our
gardening practices over time.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.180
And so I did a little
bit of research,

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.850
and I learned a lot about
the provision gardens

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:10.690
that enslaved
people had, as part

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.810
of how they would grow food.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.760
So they would work
in the fields,

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.620
or they'd work in the house,
but also enslaved people

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.870
had their own gardens.

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:24.340
And of course, that
varied by situation,

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.740
but in this illustration here,
that was part of my research,

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:32.190
you see what that looked like,
and what the structure of that

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.690
is.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:36.400
So you see the dwelling, you
see the small plots of gardens,

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.750
and then you see the women
there tending their gardens.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:42.670
And usually, it
was the women who

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.130
were doing a lot of the
tending of the gardens,

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.050
and so forth and so on.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:51.190
And so there was a lot of
like community connection.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.990
Often different
families would come

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:56.870
and they would plant together,
they'd grow together.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.530
And so there was a lot
of relationship-building

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.180
and connection between
enslaved families.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.730
So that's just kind
of an illustration

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:07.466
that I found as
part of my research.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.770
So I also wanted to
talk about the foods

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.234
that African-American women
grew in their gardens.

00:36:19.234 --> 00:36:24.195
And I did a little bit of
research on some of the--

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.320
there were lots of
different stories

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:33.360
about how these
seeds are the foods

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.530
that enslaved
African-American women grew,

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:39.960
and how they actually made
it and survived the Middle

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.530
Passage.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:45.850
So there's all of these stories,
which I have not really--

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.390
I haven't learned
a whole lot about

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:49.056
and found a lot of
evidence, but there's

00:36:49.056 --> 00:36:52.200
a lot of anecdotal
evidence about women hiding

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:57.210
seeds in their hair, or lots
of different ways that some

00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.150
of the seeds of
these vegetables--

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:03.990
yams, and collard greens,
and so forth and so on,

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.840
food staples that are part
of the African-American diet

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.750
were actually grown
in these gardens.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.120
That was also just part
of my own learning.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.690
And what these practices
really meant to me

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:24.130
was that women were--

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.970
they had a resilience, that
even in those conditions

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:30.880
of enslavement,
African-American women

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:36.670
were committed to a community
story and identity that

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:40.520
was more about
self-determination,

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.670
which has been a constant theme
of environmental justice work.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:49.210
So that theme continues to
be the way that we think

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:50.580
about environmental justice--

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.760
as people directly impacted,
telling their own stories,

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.647
being very self-determinant.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:08.280
So I was also interested
in, at the end of slavery,

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.340
how did African-American
women continue the gardening

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:18.930
practices, especially for
people that stayed in the South.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:22.430
And so this picture here
is just a reflection

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:26.790
of how a lot of the
foods that people grew,

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:29.500
they continue to grow, if
they were able to hold on

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.900
to land in the South.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:38.450
And this is just a
reflection of even the way

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:42.630
that people grow food in
rows, and so forth and so on.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.600
And how it just
continues to be a way

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:50.060
that African-American women
continue to take leadership

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.720
just around connection to land,
family connection to land,

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.726
family connection to tradition.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:10.780
So also, I was thinking, then,
how this evolved over time,

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.440
into the vacant
lot gardening that

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.580
became kind of the hallmark
of the civil rights movement.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.420
And the growth of the
environmental justice movement

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.210
with the toxic waste
study in the late '80s,

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:30.730
in the early '70s, when
black families were really

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:37.330
starting to want to be very
self-determinant about what

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.310
was happening in
their neighborhoods,

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:43.570
and the disinvestment
in black neighborhoods,

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:50.530
and the open lots that city
governments didn't really

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:51.080
take care of.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:55.120
So families would,
and communities

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.450
would start to do
a lot of activism

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.640
around the vacant lots.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.580
And so it just became--

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.830
it's how how this form
of activism evolved,

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.860
and African-American were
at the forefront of that.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.270
So again, this is
just one reflection

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:23.390
of how this has been--

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:26.450
young people have
been involved, and how

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:28.754
they've learned through
these kind of practices

00:40:28.754 --> 00:40:30.170
and traditions
about what it means

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:33.118
to be environmental leaders
in their own neighborhoods.

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:42.100
So this last slide here,
again, represents how

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.680
black women have continued to--

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.830
you see this woman here,
she's holding up a kale

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:51.760
as she's marching
through the streets,

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.840
again symbolizing the way that
black women have continued

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.320
to be at the forefront
of this kind of activism

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:05.000
for environmental justice,
food justice, clean water,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:12.080
safe communities, and just being
on the forefront of this EJ

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:12.830
movement.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.770
And so I just wanted
to show that image,

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.530
because I feel like it really
reflects how black women have

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:20.412
continued in that tradition.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:35.260
To this question of
what gives me hope--

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:38.740
I think what's
important for us to do

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:42.400
is to be able to
tell our stories,

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.010
and to listen to the voices
of people that really tend

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:49.030
to be marginalized within this
whole discussion about what

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.490
it means to have an
environmental movement

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:52.930
in the US.

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:58.270
And environmentalism, as
folks have been saying before,

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:03.310
was sort of couched in this
saving our national parks,

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:07.060
and the polar bears,
but not really rooted

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.080
in analysis of where
people are living,

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.060
where they're going to church,
where they're going to school,

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.940
and making a lot of these
deeper intersections,

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.880
and the impact of
environmental racism.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.130
And so I really believe
that it's important

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:23.890
that we lift up the leadership
of people that are directly

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:26.350
impacted by
environmental racism,

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.380
environmental degradation.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.490
And that we start to put the
solutions and the resources

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:38.285
in the hands of
those communities.

00:42:38.285 --> 00:42:39.776
So, thank you.

00:42:39.776 --> 00:42:41.267
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:20.150
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:43:29.657 --> 00:43:31.698
My name is Indira Garmendia,
I am from Nicaragua.

00:43:31.698 --> 00:43:37.410
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:42.164
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:43:42.164 --> 00:43:43.580
I'm very happy to
be here, and I'm

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:49.880
very happy to be able to have
a voice in this type of space.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:57.450
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:43:57.450 --> 00:43:59.130
I want to talk
today about the work

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:01.710
that we do at
GreenRoots in Chelsea,

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:05.340
and how we work with
environmental justice.

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:14.580
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:17.660
And I would like to ask you a
few questions to begin with.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:22.710
And so, if you would answer
yes, please raise your hand.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:26.640
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.140
Who uses salt to melt
their snow in the winter?

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:38.380
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.570
Who's gone to Boston Logan
Airport to take a trip?

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.500
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.090
Who likes to consume fresh
fruits and vegetables?

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:59.400
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.500
And who uses their
heat in the winter?

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.145
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:45:12.974 --> 00:45:17.320
So, I actually have
some bad news for you.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:23.490
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:26.130
So, without meaning
to, all of you guys

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:29.160
have contributed to
environmental inequality

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.812
in Chelsea.

00:45:30.812 --> 00:45:32.680
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.900
And I'll explain why.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:49.340
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.610
So in Chelsea, in
the river in Chelsea,

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:57.350
we store 100% of the jet fuel
that is used by Logan Airport.

00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:00.890
So in Chelsea and East
Boston, along the river.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:10.220
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:14.990
70% to 80% of the oil that is
used for heat in New England

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:18.800
is also stored along
the river in Chelsea.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:29.690
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:33.570
In Chelsea, we also have
more than 400,000 tons

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:38.590
of road salt that is used for
more than 350 cities in New

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:39.670
England.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:56.170
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:46:56.170 --> 00:47:01.120
Also in Chelsea, we have the
second largest produce center

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.200
in the United States,
which not only serves

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.430
cities in New England,
but also in other parts

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:07.660
of the United States.

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.710
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:18.980
So now I would like to talk
about who lives in Chelsea.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:24.740
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.170
And then we will understand
why all of these industries

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:28.730
are found in Chelsea.

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:37.310
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:39.410
Out of all of the people
that live in Chelsea,

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:42.750
73% are ethnic minorities--

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:45.480
people that we consider
people of color.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.580
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.970
24% live below the poverty line.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:48:02.930
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:07.640
Out of those 73% of people
of color, 65% of those

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.810
are immigrants, are Latinos.

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:16.430
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:19.850
In Chelsea, we have the highest
rates of hospitalization

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:22.080
because of asthma.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.050
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.880
We also work in East Boston.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:41.760
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.260
East Boston, although
it's five squared miles,

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:49.980
the people of East Boston
only live on two square miles,

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:52.350
and that's because the
other three are used up

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.550
by the airport.

00:48:54.550 --> 00:49:01.350
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:05.220
53% of the residents
are Latino, and 17%

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.144
live below the poverty line.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:20.204
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:49:20.204 --> 00:49:21.870
So as you can see,
we have a lot of work

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.530
to do in Chelsea
and East Boston.

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:40.340
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.300
You know, in GreenRoots,
we work a lot

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:46.170
for environmental justice, and
we have a lot of work to do,

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:49.410
a lot of illnesses to
confront, and things

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:53.270
that we have to solve because
they're impacting our bodies.

00:49:53.270 --> 00:50:06.930
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:11.400
So we're trying to achieve
this environmental justice,

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:15.030
and improve the quality of
life through collective action,

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:18.150
unity, education,
and youth leadership

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:20.350
in our neighborhoods
and communities.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:35.790
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:38.820
These are some of the
topics that we deal with.

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:43.290
As you can see, land and
food justice, youth power,

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:46.740
waterfront access, energy
democracy, transit justice,

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:50.160
clean air and public
health, and climate justice.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:59.210
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:07.170
And for us, it's not
that we're trying

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:09.990
to work for the community,
but rather with the community.

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:12.720
Because we cannot achieve
anything that we want

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.520
to achieve without working
with the community.

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:18.750
And that's why we talk about
implementing, empowering,

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:20.638
and engaging the community.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:42.120
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.330
We have been working in
Chelsea for 23 years,

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:47.670
and we have had
lots of victories.

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:49.172
And we've also had
lots of losses.

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:50.880
But I would like to
talk to you about one

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.241
victory in particular.

00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:59.400
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:03.670
How many of you have heard of
the power company, Cape Wind?

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:30.050
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:34.520
This power company,
Cape Wind, in 2006,

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.970
at the same time that it
was proposing a wind power

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:44.120
plant in Cape Cod, it was also
proposing an electrical plant

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.520
to be situated right
across the street

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:51.450
from the only elementary
school in Chelsea.

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:52.830
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:53.820
So why?

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:55.650
What was the difference?

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:57.420
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.860
So just remember who
lives in Chelsea.

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:01.050
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:04.430
And who live in Cape Cod.

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:16.950
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:21.150
And in 2006, we were able
to beat the company--

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:23.370
we were able to
beat this proposal,

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.420
so that it wasn't built
right across the street.

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:31.680
This is just an idea of what
the electrical plant would

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.750
have looked like if it
had been constructed

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:36.750
right across the street
from the elementary school.

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:50.130
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.290
We were able to
stop this project

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:56.310
with public action, oral
and written testimonies,

00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:59.190
collecting signatures from
the residents of the city,

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:01.140
and legal advocacy.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.070
And we were fighting
for a year and a half,

00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:06.168
but we were finally able to win.

00:54:06.168 --> 00:54:07.596
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:21.280
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.450
We're doing a lot of
different projects,

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:25.640
we have a lot of
work, as you can see--

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:28.430
there's a lot of work to
be done in these areas.

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.992
But I want to share
two particular projects

00:54:30.992 --> 00:54:31.700
that we're doing.

00:54:34.424 --> 00:54:47.390
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:50.300
We're working on a
micro-grid, in collaboration

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.660
with the organization
Green Justice Coalition.

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:57.050
We won $75,000 to
conduct a study

00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:00.780
on micro-grids in Chelsea.

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:10.050
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:12.510
This micro-grid
would be connected

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:17.940
to the much larger energy grid
of the electrical company.

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.075
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:31.530
It's a little bit complicated
to explain it, but--

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:32.700
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:34.490
But I'm going to try.

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:42.410
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:48.700
So the buildings that would
be connected to the grid

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:52.510
would produce their own
renewable energy, whether solar

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:54.500
or wind.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:58.170
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:01.350
And then they could sell this
energy to the larger company.

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:04.440
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.660
And in that way,
reduce energy costs.

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:27.210
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:28.680
These buildings,
the buildings that

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.750
would be connected
to the micro-grid,

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:35.610
would be public schools,
municipal buildings, hospitals,

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:39.480
public housing, and the
large produce market

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.000
that I was mentioning earlier
that serves many communities,

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.930
in addition to New England.

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:46.080
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:55.680
So we are looking beyond
our local borders.

00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:02.000
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.780
Also, if there's a
natural disaster,

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.820
the residents of
the town could go

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:11.830
to these buildings as shelter.

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:16.380
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:20.152
And this would also prevent
what our brothers in Puerto Rico

00:57:20.152 --> 00:57:20.735
have suffered.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:37.720
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.800
Also at GreenRoots, we're
working on community land

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.230
trusts, to create
these land trust

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:47.400
with a group of immigrant
women, some Latinas who

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.840
will live in Chelsea.

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.110
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:03.730
The idea actually
came from the crisis

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:05.260
that Chelsea is
going through, and I

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:09.460
would go as far as to say that
this is a national crisis.

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:11.710
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.110
And it's especially
an important housing

00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:22.100
crisis for people of color,
and people of low income.

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:23.800
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:32.230
More than 70% of the residents
in Chelsea are tenants.

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:42.160
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.950
So there's this great
crisis in Chelsea,

00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:47.650
because now that it's
being gentrified,

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:50.770
people are seeing
their rents go up

00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.660
and they have to be displaced
to other communities.

00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:55.810
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:13.140
The people in that community
understand what's going on,

00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:14.190
and the crisis--

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:16.300
the housing crisis that
they're going through.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:17.850
But they also
understand that they're

00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:20.605
fighting for land
and for housing,

00:59:20.605 --> 00:59:21.980
because it's one
of their rights.

00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:25.740
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:37.110
So in addition to
these land trusts,

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:41.730
we also want land, in order
to build housing, community

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:44.970
gardens, and green spaces.

00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:45.950
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:47.420
Thank you.

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.890
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:06.590
So, I am from an environmental
justice organization

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:09.800
that many of my
sisters mentioned--

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.500
Alternatives for
Community and Environment,

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:17.830
ACE, located in the
Roxbury neighborhood.

01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:21.400
For 25 years, ACE
has brought together

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:25.030
families and communities
to build their power,

01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:28.130
to eradicate
environmental racism,

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:32.620
classism, and create healthy
sustainable communities,

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:35.810
and achieve
environmental justice.

01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:39.350
This mission is implemented
through a community organizing

01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:44.900
membership model that engages
and empowers people of color,

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.500
and low-income communities,
to identify solutions

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:53.660
to their shared problems, and
to run successful campaigns

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.800
in implementing the solutions.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:01.340
That process is facilitated
through our programs.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.510
The Roxbury environmental
Empowerment Project,

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:13.060
REAP, the T Riders Union, TRU,
the Roxbury campaign committee,

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.570
our membership program,
environmental justice

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:21.190
legal services, and our
leadership in coalitions,

01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:27.010
advancing environmental justice
in Boston and in our state.

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:30.190
Our GreenRoots
leadership development

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:34.000
is grounded in a
strongly held belief

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.740
that those most
impacted by injustice

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:44.200
must lead us in resisting it,
and in creating solutions.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.600
To ensure we live this belief,
and are led by members,

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.360
ACE provides formal
and informal pathways

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:57.220
for skills building, learning,
and practice within all

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.810
our organizing and programs.

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:04.440
I'd also like to mention that
women in our organization

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.400
are at the core of the
environmental justice work.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.670
It is an anchor for the
movement to generate

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:16.630
smart ideas in this struggle.

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:18.330
Women of color at
ACE are involved

01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:21.450
in many aspects of
the administration,

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:25.850
fundraising, and
organizing projects.

01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:31.280
I think there is also a sense
of acknowledgment in the Roxbury

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.990
neighborhood, that women are at
the center of leading the youth

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:40.790
development, that also encourage
the community to participate

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:44.840
in urban gardening,
transportation, and health

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.610
equity.

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:51.930
We also believe in advancing
ourselves with education,

01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:55.290
so that we have all the
necessary tools to plan

01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:59.730
the next steps in our
sustainable work for better

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:01.025
transparent policies.

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:07.630
Our T Riders Union
program organizes

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:10.450
transit riders from
low-income communities,

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:14.290
and communities of color, to
advocate for better service

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:16.690
from the MBTA.

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:19.390
In our public
transit justice work,

01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:24.220
we also continue to collaborate
with GreenRoots Chelsea,

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:28.930
with whom we partnered to
gain former governor Patrick's

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:33.730
support for executive order
552, the MBTA's adoption

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:36.116
of the youth pass program.

01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:39.200
The transportation
for Massachusetts,

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:43.430
a diverse coalition of
over 70 partner and member

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:48.350
organizations, who advocate
for transportation funds

01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:53.780
to be spent fairly and wisely
for transportation decisions

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:56.900
that are transparent,
accountable,

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.300
and to ensure that
our transportation

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:03.100
system has sufficient resources
to meet the Commonwealth's

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:03.600
needs.

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:09.910
Roxbury Environmental
Empowerment Project--

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:14.710
REAP-- works with youth
of color on a variety

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:19.390
of environmental justice
issues, identified by youth

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:22.280
as relevant to their lives.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:25.730
They know that a healthy
and sustainable community

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:28.880
is one that must not
weather the storm

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:35.990
and be resilient, but also adapt
and prepare for climate change.

01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:38.870
Essential to this
work of adaptation

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:43.640
is creating community-based
alternative models,

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.430
which enables residents
to experiment,

01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:51.020
learn, and envision
a sustainable future.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:54.470
REAP's Grow or Die
campaign has successfully

01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:58.520
transformed four
city-owned vacant lots

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.750
into multi-use community
gardens, where residents

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:09.300
build community and develop
the skills in food cultivation.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.930
In the next year, we
will expand our vision,

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:16.620
and engage in efforts to
promote long-term community

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.660
land use and control.

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.550
We believe this move
to our community

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:24.700
control through
community land trusts

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:29.170
will protest against unwanted
private development that

01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:31.780
drives the
gentrification, instead

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:37.070
of supporting the stabilization
of our neighborhoods.

01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:42.720
As an anchor organization of
the Green Justice Coalition,

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:48.060
one of ACE's goals is to lead
public education strategies

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:52.500
to build legislator and public
support for clean energy

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:56.100
and environmental protection.

01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:59.200
ACE leads Green Justice
Coalition's work

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.240
on a landmark
environmental justice

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.950
bill, an act relative
to environmental justice

01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:08.740
and toxic reduction.

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.860
And the comment was,
which would incorporate

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:15.070
a definition of environmental
justice community

01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:20.220
into the Massachusetts general
laws, required the development

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:23.640
and implementation of
environmental justice policies

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:27.040
across state
secretariats, and limit

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.360
the setting of new
industrial facilities

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:34.560
that rely on toxic materials
in environmental justice

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.820
communities.

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.430
Through our coalition
work, ACE effectively

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:44.330
pushed Massachusetts to
enact its first statewide

01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:47.180
environmental
justice policy, which

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:52.660
created a legal structure
necessary to combat and prevent

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:56.360
the environmental overburdening
of low-income communities

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.230
and communities of color.

01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:01.860
With an advocated and
negotiated approval

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.140
of the state's three-year
energy efficiency

01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:10.420
plans, making visible the needs
of low income energy consumers

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.620
and renters.

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:17.180
In all of our environmental
justice organizing and advocacy

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:22.070
work, we bring an intersectional
analysis connecting

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:25.550
clean energy and
reduce greenhouse gas

01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:31.460
to greater equity and economic
livelihood, development plans,

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:35.075
housing, and health outcomes,
and legal and technical

01:07:35.075 --> 01:07:35.680
expertise.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.160
Neighborhoods that
have seen decades

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:45.300
of public and private
disinvestment,

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:49.530
environmental degradation,
and racist segregation,

01:07:49.530 --> 01:07:52.230
are now being flooded
with an influx

01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:56.070
of new capital,
new developments,

01:07:56.070 --> 01:07:58.700
and new residents.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:03.250
A large part of this
problem is an over-reliance

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:08.300
on the private sector,
and an overall agenda

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:11.720
to drive urban development.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.899
The public sector sees its role
as facilitating and supporting

01:08:16.899 --> 01:08:22.609
private development through
public policy and spending.

01:08:22.609 --> 01:08:27.109
There is currently no greater
threat to Roxbury's culture

01:08:27.109 --> 01:08:31.319
and economicals
than gentrification,

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:34.930
and the risk of
further displacement.

01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:39.779
The Roxbury campaign committee
is educating and organizing

01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:44.340
Roxbury residents around the
Boston Planning and Development

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.979
Agency.

01:08:45.979 --> 01:08:47.790
the planning process
and development

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:53.790
plans to ensure sustainable and
equitable community development

01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:56.250
in our neighborhoods.

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:59.020
And our membership
program provides a space

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:03.790
for our constituents to
identify problems and implement

01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:06.649
solutions.

01:09:06.649 --> 01:09:10.670
Our movement affirms
the rights of all people

01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:14.420
to public policy that
is free from any form

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:18.840
of discrimination, to
participate as equal partners

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.140
at every level of
decision making,

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:25.260
and for communities
to not be subject

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:28.840
to environmental extraction.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.080
This movement more
broadly affirms the rights

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:35.890
of communities not to
be subject to extraction

01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:40.880
that also includes culture
and the local economy.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.830
In transitioning from an
extractive to adjusted economy,

01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:50.240
municipalities,
developers, and communities

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:53.420
must work to
preserve and enhance

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:57.230
local cultural and
economy assets.

01:09:57.230 --> 01:09:59.410
Thank you.

01:09:59.410 --> 01:10:00.895
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.880
Hello, OK, so we're going
to shift gears a little bit.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.630
I am an environmental health
public health scientist.

01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:24.400
And so if we view many of
the environmental and social

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.780
justice problems that my
colleagues have talked about

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:32.350
today as nails, one
of my main hammers

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:34.420
is the scientific method.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:37.000
And I'm probably more
comfortable talking

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.670
in the language of data
and statistical models

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:42.460
than I am storytelling--
so I'm actively

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.812
resisting the urge of showing
you lots of graphs and data.

01:10:45.812 --> 01:10:47.830
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:53.530
And rather, sharing
with you how I

01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:58.030
try to implement this
dual goal of conducting

01:10:58.030 --> 01:11:03.100
rigorous, innovative science
that actively addresses

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.320
public health problems,
and that actively

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.580
is used to promote health
protective policies,

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.870
and support decision making--

01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:16.070
whether that's on the
local or national level.

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:22.780
As Ajantha mentioned, I
seek to make advancements

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:25.810
in science policy
and clinical practice

01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:27.850
to help secure
environmental justice

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:33.942
and improve, unfortunately, the
growing inequalities in health.

01:11:33.942 --> 01:11:35.150
Particularly in our country--

01:11:35.150 --> 01:11:38.620
we're really moving in
the wrong direction.

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:43.060
Instead of improving
things, even though we've

01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:45.190
been documenting a
lot of these health

01:11:45.190 --> 01:11:49.330
disparities for many
years, many decades.

01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:51.190
For the past 15
years, I've worked

01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:54.790
alongside various
community organizations

01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:57.550
using the scientific
method to both document

01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:00.610
and validate community concerns.

01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:04.000
I've addressed health
risks from various forms

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.650
of environmental degradation,
ranging from poor indoor air

01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:13.030
quality in public housing
to ambient air pollution

01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:16.480
from oil refineries and
other polluting industries,

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.480
metal-laden mine waste
at toxic Superfund

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.640
sites on Native
American reservations,

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.540
and most recently toxic
chemicals in beauty products

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:28.540
marketed to women of color.

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:31.570
I'm going to share a few
examples from my own research,

01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:38.030
and you'll probably see some
examples of scaling of issues,

01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:41.830
and the evolution of my own
work, which has been greatly

01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:44.530
influenced by listening
to community members,

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:46.150
listening to collaborators.

01:12:46.150 --> 01:12:48.760
Also listening to
the data, and being

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.310
willing to try new things.

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:54.940
So the first example
I want to share

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:58.240
with you comes from a
community-based participatory

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.080
study, called the California
Household Exposure Study.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.230
This study was done
in collaboration

01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:07.930
with several
universities, and two

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:12.100
community-based organizations,
including an EJ organization

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.430
called Communities for
a Better Environment

01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:18.370
in the San Francisco Bay Area.

01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:20.140
The goal of this study--

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:21.760
it was done in
northern California--

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.530
and our main point was to
compare indoor and outdoor air

01:13:26.530 --> 01:13:29.140
pollution exposures
between Richmond--

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:32.470
a neighborhood bordering an
oil refinery-- and Bolinas,

01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:36.910
a rural neighborhood that
served as a regional comparison.

01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:39.340
Something that was
unique about this project

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:42.760
was, we had in many
different types of goals.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.190
So our scientific goal--

01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:48.250
and this was a project that
was funded by the National

01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:51.130
Institutes of Health-- so
our scientific goal was

01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:56.470
to characterize cumulative
impacts of various pollution

01:13:56.470 --> 01:14:00.310
sources in an environmental
justice community.

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:02.980
Which we defined as
an area of low income,

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:06.220
or ethnic minority residents,
who are disproportionately

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:08.140
affected by pollution.

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.450
We did this by measuring
numerous pollutants

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:15.020
and assessing differences with
homes in non-EJ communities.

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:16.790
In addition to our
scientific goals,

01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:20.170
we also had educational
and policy goals.

01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:22.240
Our educational
goals were to inform

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.030
community members about
their air quality,

01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:29.380
and strategies for
exposure reduction.

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.220
And then, one of our
main policy goals

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:38.080
was actually to help our
advocacy partners inform

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.660
local decisions about
the oil refinery.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.470
So those policy goals were
derived in collaboration

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:46.910
with our advocacy partners.

01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:49.840
And so to help facilitate
those policy goals,

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.620
we did a couple of things.

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:55.090
One, we actively
reported the results back

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:58.120
to the community in
various different ways.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.700
Too often, scientists come
into these communities,

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:04.000
collect data, and then leave.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.130
There's never that return back.

01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:11.490
We held community events with
Spanish language interpreters,

01:15:11.490 --> 01:15:15.120
and child care, where
we gave the results back

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.200
to the community in ways that
were culturally appropriate,

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.840
at the appropriate
educational level.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.710
Which really also pushed us
to find new ways to visualize

01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:28.270
and communicate our data.

01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:33.090
We also reported individuals'
environmental exposure results

01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:36.600
back to them, if they had
requested that information.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:39.930
And at that time, that
was also very novel,

01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:42.480
because often
people think, well,

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:46.170
if there aren't clear health
and safety thresholds, perhaps

01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:49.860
reporting the data back
will only create anxiety,

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:52.770
or perhaps community
members won't know how

01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:55.230
to interpret that information.

01:15:55.230 --> 01:15:57.780
But we decided we would help
them in that interpretation

01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.970
process, and we
would we would let

01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:04.150
them make some of those
decisions for themselves.

01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:06.390
So these intentional
efforts helped

01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:08.610
to create a dialogue
and exchange

01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:10.260
with the local community.

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:14.460
And it also led to a shared
ownership of the data.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:17.970
As a result, our community-based
organization partner

01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:20.400
presented the data to
the Richmond city council

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.430
and planning commission,
and argued in court

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:26.370
for a cumulative
impacts assessment

01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:30.390
to be included in the oil
refinery permit applications.

01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:33.750
And that was an approach that
was central to our research.

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:36.510
This advocacy resulted
in a legal victory

01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:40.470
that actually blocked the
expansion of the oil refinery.

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:45.370
So we saw that as a big
win for public health.

01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:49.980
Another kind of big I
guess lessen or component

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.470
of this project
was the diversity

01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:54.570
of our scientific team.

01:16:54.570 --> 01:16:57.990
I think it also helped to
change how the community viewed

01:16:57.990 --> 01:17:00.600
scientists and science.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.990
Many communities of
color carry a distrust

01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:05.940
of science and medicine.

01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:10.320
In part because there's
been historical expectations

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.650
of these communities by
the scientific enterprise.

01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:16.200
But also because
science and medicine

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.620
are still commonly used to
discredit community knowledge

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:21.690
and experience.

01:17:21.690 --> 01:17:23.370
You know, I did a
lot of the reporting

01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:26.010
back of the results
to the community,

01:17:26.010 --> 01:17:27.600
and I, probably
for many of them,

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.600
I was the first woman of color
scientist that many of them

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.930
had ever met.

01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:35.050
And I think that brings up an
important issue for this panel,

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:38.700
which was very intentionally
created to lift up

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:42.210
voices of women of color, about
why diversity and inclusion are

01:17:42.210 --> 01:17:43.140
important.

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:46.290
Because it really does impact
what research questions are

01:17:46.290 --> 01:17:50.100
asked, the methods that
are used to answer them,

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:55.800
as well as whose perspectives
and voices are included.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:01.110
Another side, another dimension
of the work that came out

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:05.370
of that same community-based
participatory research project,

01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:11.160
involved more work on toxics
at the state and federal level.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.370
So another one of
our policy goals

01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:17.010
was to impact state
and federal policies

01:18:17.010 --> 01:18:21.440
regarding endocrine-disrupting
compounds in consumer products.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.170
So endocrine-disrupting
chemicals

01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:26.440
are substances
that are often are

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.170
man-made industrial chemicals.

01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:32.290
They can interfere with how
hormones behave in our body,

01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:35.000
even at low levels.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.730
Many of these
chemicals are widely

01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:39.640
used in consumer products,
and consequently are

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.860
ubiquitous in our
everyday environments,

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:44.360
as well as in our bodies.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.200
So in this California
Household Exposure Study,

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:53.340
we looked at a lot
of chemicals that

01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:58.910
may have come from vehicular
exhaust, or the oil refinery,

01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:02.430
but we also measured a
wide range of these EDCs.

01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:06.180
And we found very high levels
of PBDE flame retardants

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.330
in all of the California homes.

01:19:09.330 --> 01:19:13.090
And they were some of the
highest levels in the world.

01:19:13.090 --> 01:19:15.750
And so this was kind of
a surprising finding,

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:18.330
but we followed the data.

01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:22.530
And the back story on
these flame retardants

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:23.970
are quite interesting.

01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:27.360
So beginning in
the 1950s and '60s,

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.470
we started seeing a big
uptick in household fires,

01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:35.400
and fire-related
injuries and even deaths.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.210
And it was largely because
smoking rates were going up,

01:19:39.210 --> 01:19:41.730
lots of people were
smoking indoors, often

01:19:41.730 --> 01:19:44.070
falling asleep with
half-lit cigarettes.

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:47.550
At the same time, we were
having more consumer products

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:52.080
like furniture being made
from petrochemical byproducts,

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.820
like polyurethane foam.

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:59.250
So there was this perfect
storm of more smoking,

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:00.810
and highly flammable products.

01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:04.740
Well, the tobacco
industry was very clever,

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:08.335
because they very
cleverly shifted the focus

01:20:08.335 --> 01:20:10.710
from the cigarettes-- which
was really the main problem--

01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:12.030
to the couches.

01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:16.070
And they're like, those are
the things we have to fix.

01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:20.760
So it was a well-intentioned
intervention,

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:23.640
but furniture makers
started treating furniture

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.890
with these chemical
flame retardants, which

01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:27.715
they just mixed into the foam.

01:20:27.715 --> 01:20:29.090
And they thought
they were inert,

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:31.215
and they thought they were
staying in the products.

01:20:31.215 --> 01:20:33.760
Well, lo and behold,
they weren't inert,

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.937
they were actually
neurotoxicants.

01:20:35.937 --> 01:20:38.520
And they weren't staying in the
furniture-- they were actually

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:43.140
migrating out of our products
into our dust and into our air.

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.770
So we found-- jump
forward 30 or 40

01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:50.550
years, people had started
detecting them in breast,

01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:52.080
in house dust.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:56.340
And we found these very high
levels in California homes.

01:20:56.340 --> 01:21:01.230
And we hypothesized that it
was the unintended result

01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:06.870
of the very unique and stringent
fire safety standards that

01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:08.680
were unique to California.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.670
So they said that,
all furniture must

01:21:11.670 --> 01:21:14.710
be able to withstand an
open flame for 30 seconds.

01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:16.620
And so the way that
most furniture makers

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:20.310
did this was by adding
these flame retardants.

01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:24.180
And so we wanted to
see, well, would we

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:27.200
see the same thing
in people's bodies?

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.760
And so we did several
other studies,

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.060
and we actually found
that low-income,

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.640
racially diverse pregnant
women in California,

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.610
had some of the
world's highest levels

01:21:38.610 --> 01:21:41.520
of these PBDE flame
retardants in their bodies.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:47.250
And remember, these are
established neurotoxicants,

01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:51.960
based on studies in cells,
in animals, and even humans.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.900
So around this time this
research was published,

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:59.190
California policymakers
started considering a change

01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:01.440
to the state's fire
safety standards.

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:04.260
I happened to be doing
a post-doc in California

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:08.190
at that time, so I testified
in front of the California

01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:12.780
legislature, and also
started writing commentaries

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:15.060
to highlight the
disproportionate burden

01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:18.930
of chemical flame retardants
among low-income communities

01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:20.530
of color.

01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:23.800
And it was important
to highlight

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.350
these disproportionate
impacts, but it was also

01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:30.970
important for
building coalitions,

01:22:30.970 --> 01:22:33.850
because up until that point,
the chemical industry had really

01:22:33.850 --> 01:22:38.110
tried to say, oh, this is
green legislation that only

01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:40.060
the enviro groups wanted.

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:45.430
And they actually
tried to kind of pit

01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:50.890
the enviros against some of the
EJ and social justice groups,

01:22:50.890 --> 01:22:53.860
because still, low income
communities of color

01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:58.480
were dying more from
household fires.

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:01.660
So during this
time, too, new data

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:06.960
was coming, was being revealed
that these flame retardants

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.740
really weren't that effective
in addressing the problem.

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:16.350
So we started writing
about how you should really

01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:19.920
think about this fire
safety standard not just

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:23.250
as an environmental standard,
but really a social policy.

01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:25.080
Because we know a lot
of these communities

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:29.710
already face so many barriers to
healthy growth and development.

01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:33.480
So here is a chance
to prevent exposure

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.950
to a known neurotoxicant.

01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:39.540
And over time, this
body of work has

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:43.110
helped to change our approach
to fire safety at both the state

01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:46.560
and federal level, to
ensure adequate fire

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.240
safety without the use
of hazardous chemicals.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.850
So now I just want to share
one last example, where

01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:57.390
my work is getting increasingly,
I would say, molecular.

01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:59.760
I'm becoming more
interested, and really trying

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:04.020
to understand how
structural racism,

01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:08.970
and other systemic forces really
become biologically embedded

01:24:08.970 --> 01:24:12.690
at the molecular and cellular
level to affect health,

01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:17.820
and to also affect the
health of future generations.

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.800
And some of this
work really lies

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.990
at the intersection of
environmental justice,

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.610
but also reproductive justice.

01:24:23.610 --> 01:24:28.650
Because a lot of it is really
about the right of women

01:24:28.650 --> 01:24:31.830
to control their
own bodies, and also

01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:34.230
to have control
over their ability

01:24:34.230 --> 01:24:38.160
to have a healthy
pregnancy, and to be

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.620
able to raise their families in
healthy and safe environments.

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:47.490
And some of this
work has been getting

01:24:47.490 --> 01:24:51.360
a lot of attention in the media
recently, just thinking about

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.820
black women's health, and just
the really disturbing disparity

01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:01.500
around how many black women
are dying in childbirth today.

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:05.040
You look at my own city of DC,
one of the most wealthy cities

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.950
in this country, and our
maternal mortality rate

01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:10.530
is twice the national average.

01:25:10.530 --> 01:25:15.630
There's whole wards of DS
that lack a maternity ward.

01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:23.090
Which to me is completely
unacceptable in 2018 in USA.

01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:27.460
So I'm trying to connect
structural racism,

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:29.560
and how it may become
biologically embedded

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.820
to impact reproductive health.

01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:39.790
And so one way we're
doing that is we're

01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:42.040
starting to look at the
health repercussions

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.850
of toxic chemicals in beauty
products through an EJ lens.

01:25:45.850 --> 01:25:48.600
Something we refer to as
the environmental injustice

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:50.230
of beauty.

01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:52.780
Beauty products use is
an understudied source

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:55.750
of environmental
chemical exposures.

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:57.250
Some of these
products could include

01:25:57.250 --> 01:26:00.400
reproductive and developmental
toxicants, such as pthalates

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.410
and heavy metals.

01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:07.690
However, disclosure requirements
are limited and inconsistent.

01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:09.970
Compared with white
women, women of color

01:26:09.970 --> 01:26:11.950
have higher levels
of beauty product

01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:14.720
related environmental
chemicals in their bodies.

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.350
And this is independent
of socioeconomic status--

01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:22.510
so it can't be explained by
socioeconomic status alone.

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:25.060
So it can't be
explained by class.

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:28.420
Even small exposures to
these toxic chemicals

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:32.020
during critical periods of
development, such as pregnancy,

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:36.190
can trigger adverse health
consequences on fertility,

01:26:36.190 --> 01:26:40.870
on pregnancy, on brain
development, and even cancer.

01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:45.400
Mass distributions of images
that idealized whiteness can

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:49.330
influence sales of hair
straighteners, skin lighteners,

01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:51.700
and odor-masking products.

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:55.930
And racial discrimination
based on European beauty norms

01:26:55.930 --> 01:26:59.920
can lead to internalized racism,
body shame, and skin tone

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.420
dissatisfaction.

01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:03.040
Factors that can
influence product

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:08.560
use to achieve these
idealized beauty norms.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.600
So we are starting to look at
beauty products use as one way

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.240
that structural
discrimination may

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:17.920
become biologically embedded.

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.484
And in one future project,
or upcoming project,

01:27:21.484 --> 01:27:22.900
we're actually
going to be working

01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:25.540
with a multi-disciplinary
team of public health

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:29.170
scientists, social scientists,
as well as grassroots,

01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:34.360
EJ-RJ organizations to identify
links between beauty product

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:38.860
use and racial ethnic
differences in breast cancer,

01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:44.500
through community-based surveys
and chemical product testing.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:49.690
In general, we're trying
to use sophisticated,

01:27:49.690 --> 01:27:54.640
emerging, biological
molecular tools,

01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:00.220
with nuanced social
structural frameworks

01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:03.820
to move beyond just
looking at race

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:07.570
as this dichotomous
biological construct,

01:28:07.570 --> 01:28:11.080
to one that's really looking at
it more as a social construct,

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:15.880
and really focusing on racism,
in addition to just race.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:20.600
So and all of this
research, I should say,

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.060
has been a great opportunity
to train the next generation

01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:29.200
of women of color
scientists, and to get

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.730
them engaged into this work.

01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:36.910
So it's kind of new models
of not only new disease

01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:41.920
models, but new ways
of creating knowledge.

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.920
And I just want to end by
saying that, even though I often

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.930
speak in the language
of data and numbers,

01:28:46.930 --> 01:28:50.920
good science alone is not
enough to create social change.

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:54.130
I'm equally committed to
translating and disseminating

01:28:54.130 --> 01:28:58.910
the science for public
health policy and practice.

01:28:58.910 --> 01:29:02.272
So I'll just leave it at that.

01:29:05.236 --> 01:29:06.718
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:14.150 --> 01:29:15.040
That was wonderful.

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.590
Thank you so much for those
incredible presentations.

01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:21.075
I just want to
open the floor up.

01:29:21.075 --> 01:29:23.230
You guys have all
been here listening,

01:29:23.230 --> 01:29:26.280
so I'm sure you have
lots of questions.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.680
I have questions of my own, but
I think let's start with yours.

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:31.006
Yeah?

01:29:31.006 --> 01:29:32.455
[INAUDIBLE]

01:29:36.802 --> 01:29:39.683
Trina, I want to ask you a
question about the garden

01:29:39.683 --> 01:29:40.183
project.

01:29:40.183 --> 01:29:46.150
What are your hopes
for the project?

01:29:46.150 --> 01:29:48.730
How do you see this evolving?

01:29:48.730 --> 01:29:52.600
Well, that's a really
great question, thank you.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:57.490
I'm very interested in
the power of stories,

01:29:57.490 --> 01:30:03.100
and the power of culture,
and how we talk about change

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:06.490
that is led by people who
are directly impacted.

01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:09.760
I'm also very interested
in black women's stories,

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:15.160
black women as leaders,
black women as innovators,

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.040
and thinkers, and scientists.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:24.430
And I just feel that black
people's relationship to land,

01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:29.905
because of the legacy
of enslavement,

01:30:29.905 --> 01:30:36.660
that that connection is really--

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:41.550
and analyzing why
that connection

01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:45.225
is really important in terms
of our environmental activism.

01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:53.220
And I love gardening, and I have
lots of black women in my life

01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:55.710
who garden, and I love them
all, and I learn something

01:30:55.710 --> 01:30:57.100
from all of them.

01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:59.250
And I think that
just gardening are

01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:01.080
really interesting stories--

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:04.650
they're ways of telling
stories about who we are

01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:07.260
and where we come from.

01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:09.880
And that's powerful to me.

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:13.800
So I don't know if that's a
direct answer to your question,

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:19.170
but I think there's a lot
to learn from black women

01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:23.390
environmental leaders
that we don't know.

01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:26.080
And I'm interested in those
stories being uplifted.

01:31:30.789 --> 01:31:32.330
Can you introduce
yourself, actually,

01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:35.594
before you ask your question?

01:31:35.594 --> 01:31:39.130
--sit on the back of this couch.

01:31:39.130 --> 01:31:41.960
I'm Amelia, I'm a
junior at the college.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.880
And I want to say
thank you to all of you

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.630
guys-- this has been a
really fascinating panel.

01:31:47.630 --> 01:31:52.960
My question is about
the future, I guess.

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:56.440
We've heard a lot about
the need for adaptation

01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:01.030
to climate change on both
macro and micro levels.

01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:02.800
But I'm wondering
what your thoughts are

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:07.480
about how communities can
adapt, in terms of transforming

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:11.170
themselves, and whether
environmental justice is also

01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:14.320
a project of
transforming communities

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.340
to tackle the future?

01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:23.422
I think that's
addressed to any of you.

01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:30.257
I guess a couple of
things come up for me

01:32:30.257 --> 01:32:31.340
when I hear that question.

01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:38.270
I think climate
resiliency, the that term

01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:43.010
has been coming up a lot
in philanthropic spaces,

01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:45.770
and also in spaces
of organizing.

01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:50.000
And I think that one
of the lessons that

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.640
was learned from
Hurricane Sandy,

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:56.420
from Katrina, that I
think is important,

01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:59.840
is to understand that our
neighbors and our communities

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.690
are also first responders.

01:33:02.690 --> 01:33:05.900
And so part of how
communities are able to adapt

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:10.880
is by continuing to build
relationships with each other.

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:18.110
And that sounds
sort of slow, but it

01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:21.740
is the thing that saves
people in those moments,

01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:26.570
is their ability to be
rescued, to be recognized,

01:33:26.570 --> 01:33:30.000
and to be connected
to a social network.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.860
And so I think
adaptation and resiliency

01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:37.550
is about the physical
infrastructure that

01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:42.730
gives people a few more
hours to get to a safe place,

01:33:42.730 --> 01:33:48.200
but it is also about, what
are the ways in which we

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.930
need to have policies that
support and strengthen

01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:51.660
communities?

01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:54.950
Which is one of the reasons why
gentrification and displacement

01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:59.180
is such a huge threat to
communities that are already

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:01.880
going to be less likely to
be able to be resilient,

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:05.430
because people are moving away
from those social networks.

01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:11.540
I think it's also a reason
why jobs and economic policies

01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:16.340
are really important, because
the ways in which people

01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:18.750
have to have multiple jobs--

01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:21.350
so they're not at
home being able to be

01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:23.420
in those social
spaces because they

01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:26.120
have to work to pay their rent.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:27.740
And so I think all
of those things

01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:31.220
are really linked together,
and the environmental justice

01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:34.550
framework, I think,
provides analysis

01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:39.440
of how those different
problems are intersected

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:43.052
and how we can think
about solutions.

01:34:43.052 --> 01:34:44.950
If I can just add--

01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:47.860
and I also would just say
that, communities of color

01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:49.990
have always adapted.

01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:54.070
And you don't survive 400
plus years of oppression,

01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:58.360
and not have strategies
for adapting.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.520
And so I feel like one
of our opportunities

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:04.600
is to learn from what
people have always done,

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:08.050
and that we don't
always take ideas from,

01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:10.810
as Ami's pointing
out in her work.

01:35:10.810 --> 01:35:13.150
That you don't always
lead with the ideas

01:35:13.150 --> 01:35:16.210
that comes from
outside the community.

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:18.910
That you're actually
engaging the community

01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:21.580
on what they know already.

01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:25.450
And that becomes part of the
strategy that we all value.

01:35:25.450 --> 01:35:29.800
So we've always adapted,
everyone has always adapted.

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:34.090
And of course, we
always have to be

01:35:34.090 --> 01:35:36.820
attentive to what's emerging,
but we've always adapted.

01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:45.790
So this narrative about
what do people need to do?

01:35:45.790 --> 01:35:47.920
What have people
always done that we

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:50.530
can learn from, and
invest in those strategies

01:35:50.530 --> 01:35:52.006
and to actually support them.

01:35:58.950 --> 01:36:00.890
Thanks, thank you very much.

01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:02.270
This is great.

01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:04.792
I'm loving hearing
about all of your work.

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:05.500
I was wondering--

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:06.291
Introduce yourself.

01:36:06.291 --> 01:36:11.300
Oh, my name is Kaya, I'm
an anthropologist, as well.

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:13.940
I was wondering if you could say
a little bit more, all of you,

01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:14.440
about--

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.062
I feel like I heard you all
are doing really intersectional

01:36:17.062 --> 01:36:19.520
work, and I feel like I heard
a lot about the intersections

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:22.610
of environmental justice,
housing justice, transit

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:24.680
justice, and I'm wondering
if you could just

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:27.200
say more about where criminal
justice fits into that?

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:30.170
How you see your work
intersecting with mass

01:36:30.170 --> 01:36:33.470
incarceration, with effects
of that on the communities

01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:34.410
that you work in.

01:36:34.410 --> 01:36:36.920
And where you see
the opportunities

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.556
for working on that.

01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:47.603
Anyone?

01:36:47.603 --> 01:36:49.103
I have a lot to say
on that, but I--

01:36:49.103 --> 01:36:49.790
[INAUDIBLE]

01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:51.774
[LAUGHTER]

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:58.730
So in Roxbury, you
probably know that there

01:36:58.730 --> 01:37:00.680
are two police stations.

01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:10.370
It is one of environmental
concerns, too.

01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:16.730
If you look around, you see a
lot of elderly people, not too

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.770
many young people.

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:26.760
Also, on top of that,
some of the problems

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:31.470
we identified in mass
incarceration was,

01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:36.060
within mass
incarceration itself,

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:41.670
there is a form of environmental
justice problem there.

01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:47.780
In some of the
Massachusetts facilities

01:37:47.780 --> 01:38:01.380
that are hosting a lot of
incarcerated people of color,

01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:08.660
we identified that there is a
concern of contaminated water

01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:18.580
within the facility, and we
are working with some house

01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:23.120
expertise to identify,
and what it means.

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:30.480
So if you see environmental
justice, the scope goes on.

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:35.140
And for ACE, or any
environmental justice community

01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:40.030
that we have been
working, the shape

01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:43.415
and the form of the
struggle has been changing.

01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:56.460
We may have a few successes,
but definitely in the past 20

01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:59.460
years, they have changed.

01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:04.260
They have become more
complicated, structurally.

01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:12.950
So seeing environmental justice,
and the criminal justice,

01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:14.150
they are all connected.

01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:24.840
So for our organizing
work would be to see

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.450
the structural problems--

01:39:27.450 --> 01:39:32.330
just saying, oh, this
is people of color,

01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:34.600
so they are impacted by this.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:38.230
But it's much deeper than that.

01:39:38.230 --> 01:39:45.990
So the movement of Black
Lives Matter is just not

01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:47.700
an open-air--

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:56.510
some type of-- so it has been
around for many, many years,

01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:57.580
as you can imagine.

01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:02.280
But within a struggle,
there's another struggle.

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.420
That's why I'm trying to say.

01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:08.550
And there is a lot of work
to be done, definitely.

01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:13.260
But finding those solutions
is what we should focus on.

01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:16.950
Because it seems
sometimes, it's endless.

01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:22.990
But yeah, if anyone
wants to add on that.

01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:27.270
Well, and sometimes
we know the solutions,

01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:30.420
but it's about implementing
basic solutions.

01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:33.000
So take the example of lead--

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.540
we know the health
effects of lead.

01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:38.430
We know how to fix that problem.

01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:42.960
Whether it's lead in water,
or lead in lead paint.

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.830
And yet, in some
ways, lead, like

01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:50.430
the problem of getting
blood levels down

01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:52.110
is considered a
public health victory,

01:40:52.110 --> 01:40:56.910
but really it's been
concentrated globally

01:40:56.910 --> 01:41:01.320
among poor people, and in this
country, and in EJ communities

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:05.940
And we know that lead
exposures in children,

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:07.440
they're irreversible.

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.040
And they also affect
brain development,

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:16.560
but they may also be
increasing violent behavior

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:19.200
and things linked to--

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.050
so they're almost
predisposing people

01:41:22.050 --> 01:41:26.320
to get into the
criminal justice system.

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:30.180
So in that way, some of
these environmental concerns

01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:32.950
are perpetuating these cycles.

01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:35.700
And in the case
of lead, we don't

01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:38.040
have to go out and
hunt for a solution.

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:40.320
We actually know
them pretty well.

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:43.999
So it's about just
having the political will

01:41:43.999 --> 01:41:45.739
the implement what we know.

01:41:49.230 --> 01:41:50.626
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:41:50.626 --> 01:41:54.520
I would like to add something.

01:41:54.520 --> 01:42:32.430
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:37.460
I think that criminal justice
and environmental justice

01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:38.600
are linked.

01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:41.090
Because when you look
at all of the bodies

01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:43.460
that live in our communities,
who are these bodies?

01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:44.960
Who are these people?

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.400
And it's people of color--

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.070
immigrants, black communities.

01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:50.990
And these are the
very communities

01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:55.410
that are being criminalized
specifically because they're

01:42:55.410 --> 01:42:58.980
black, and there's this
prejudice behind being black,

01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:03.300
or a person of color, or a
person that's an immigrant.

01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:15.930
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:43:15.930 --> 01:43:19.990
In my community where I
live, 65% are Latinos,

01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:23.750
and I see that a lot of young
people are being incarcerated.

01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:30.090
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:43:30.090 --> 01:43:32.670
And these young
people are also black,

01:43:32.670 --> 01:43:34.680
because even though
we're Latinos,

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.460
Latinos are very diverse.

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:41.860
And so there are
also black Latinos.

01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:43.140
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:43:59.730 --> 01:44:03.420
With the current
administration that we have,

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:06.420
they're implementing
anti-immigrant laws

01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:09.270
that our communities
are suffering through.

01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:10.680
And it's not only
our communities

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:13.980
that are being incarcerated,
but they're also being deported.

01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:26.880
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:30.090
These policies are
separating our communities.

01:44:30.090 --> 01:44:33.180
And for a lot of our
communities, to be deported

01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:34.740
means to die.

01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:36.600
Because when they
arrived here, they

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:40.930
were able to escape
that violent situation.

01:44:40.930 --> 01:45:00.540
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:03.040
When we talk about
environmental justice,

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.580
we are also talking
about criminal justice.

01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:08.020
And all sorts of
types of justice--

01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:10.040
human rights, just
basic human rights.

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:12.270
It's not only about
having clean air

01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:15.000
but rather having the
right to live and to have

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:15.810
a life of quality.

01:45:18.490 --> 01:45:19.442
Thank you.

01:45:24.690 --> 01:45:26.750
From the same couch, up front.

01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:30.129
Hi, I'm Shalonda Baker,
and I'm a professor of Law

01:45:30.129 --> 01:45:31.545
and Public Policy
at Northeastern.

01:45:31.545 --> 01:45:35.260
So it's good to see
you, Tenbit, here.

01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:38.440
So one of the successes of the
environmental justice movement

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:42.550
has also been its downfall,
in terms of the gentrification

01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:45.130
that we see in communities
that have been,

01:45:45.130 --> 01:45:46.990
quote unquote, cleaned
up, and are now

01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:50.080
more inhabitable and safer.

01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:53.740
So I see environmental justice
as a really useful framework,

01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:57.430
and a theoretical tool, to
identify problems, and then

01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:58.900
remediate.

01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:01.060
But I think we're in
this really unique moment

01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:04.810
with the just transition, which
many of you have mentioned,

01:46:04.810 --> 01:46:06.820
to look at the
different intersections

01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:09.190
between gentrification,
and among climate

01:46:09.190 --> 01:46:11.260
justice and
environmental justice,

01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:13.930
as well, particularly in some
of the energy innovations

01:46:13.930 --> 01:46:16.230
that some of you mentioned.

01:46:16.230 --> 01:46:18.280
And I was just wondering,
more concretely,

01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:22.030
about the particular
policy opportunities

01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:27.490
to link the gentrification piece
and the threats to the home

01:46:27.490 --> 01:46:30.490
with innovations around
energy and energy democracy--

01:46:30.490 --> 01:46:33.550
I know that was mentioned by
Jennifer, and also Kalila.

01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:37.060
And so I don't know if there's
anything happening locally

01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:42.970
in Boston around home security,
and security of land, that

01:46:42.970 --> 01:46:45.250
could allow for this just
transition to happen,

01:46:45.250 --> 01:46:47.860
that doesn't further
jeopardize the communities

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:50.990
that are already at risk
of losing their homes.

01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:59.640
I would say that--

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:01.440
I wouldn't say that
people are necessarily

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.100
already making those links.

01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:04.710
But hopefully we'll
be there, soon.

01:47:04.710 --> 01:47:07.800
But a couple of folks
had mentioned the idea

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:09.840
of a community land trust.

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:13.950
And so Dudley Street
Neighborhood Initiative

01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:16.900
convenes the greater
Boston land trust network,

01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:19.350
which includes
GreenRoots, and ACE,

01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:22.950
and several other community
organizations across the Boston

01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:26.610
area, who've combined
forces to try

01:47:26.610 --> 01:47:29.730
to push more broadly
the land trust movement.

01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:34.020
So some of those folks are
just starting land trusts,

01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:35.520
so they're in the
process of trying

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:37.830
to actually acquire the land--

01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:41.160
which is particularly
challenging,

01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:44.850
in the case of Chinatown, for
example, one that there's not

01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:46.440
a lot of vacant land.

01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:49.980
But then OK, you
can afford to buy

01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:55.990
a triple decker for, I don't
know, $700,000 or something,

01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.490
let's say.

01:47:56.490 --> 01:47:59.670
But then you don't
have enough resources

01:47:59.670 --> 01:48:03.970
to keep it affordable for the
tenants that are in there.

01:48:03.970 --> 01:48:08.820
And so one of the things that
they are trying to push for

01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:12.090
is dollars from the
Community Preservation Act.

01:48:12.090 --> 01:48:17.490
So this was a policy that
Boston passed last year, that

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:21.290
allows access for resources
for affordable housing,

01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:23.340
green space, and
historic preservation.

01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:26.940
So I think that's
one opportunity.

01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:32.100
Also talking with the
city about prioritizing

01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:35.340
land for disbursement
to land trusts.

01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:39.470
So there are still some
smaller parcels of land

01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:41.580
in the city of
Boston, particularly

01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:44.550
in Roxbury, Dorchester,
and Mattapan.

01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:49.860
So how do we prioritize
that public resources

01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:52.770
going for the public good?

01:48:52.770 --> 01:48:55.290
And there have been
examples of that recently,

01:48:55.290 --> 01:48:57.960
with Dudley Street
Neighborhood Initiative.

01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:03.091
So we acquired a commercial
property in Upham's Corner--

01:49:03.091 --> 01:49:05.340
one of the largest commercial
properties that the land

01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:06.365
trust ever acquired.

01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:13.200
Its design and planning
is being discussed

01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:16.710
as a part of the larger Upham's
Corner planning process.

01:49:16.710 --> 01:49:19.290
What I haven't seen
people do just yet,

01:49:19.290 --> 01:49:23.550
is to think about what are
the opportunities for energy

01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:28.380
efficiency, or a connection
on the land that we do have.

01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:30.240
I think, in part,
because people are just

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.995
like, the land is so expensive,
how do we even just get it?

01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:44.430
But there is also kind
of simultaneously a push

01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:53.160
around codification
of climate resilient--

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.110
basically climate
resilience policies

01:49:55.110 --> 01:49:57.540
around the building codes
within the city of Boston.

01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:01.670
So a lot of the things that
developers are doing are--

01:50:01.670 --> 01:50:03.720
they're not required
to do those things.

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:07.590
And so perhaps there's an
opportunity to think about,

01:50:07.590 --> 01:50:10.740
not only should this land be
used for the public good--

01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:14.610
which we've defined broadly
as doing affordable housing--

01:50:14.610 --> 01:50:16.830
but what are the
opportunities to build

01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:20.615
in a more sustainable
and resilient kind of way

01:50:20.615 --> 01:50:21.990
by looking at the
building codes.

01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:24.330
So yeah, those are
a couple of things

01:50:24.330 --> 01:50:26.910
that folks are talking about.

01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:34.650
I've also heard about policies
for when subsidized housing is

01:50:34.650 --> 01:50:39.390
redeveloped, to push for
upgrading of air conditioning

01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:40.500
within those units.

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:43.170
Because we know that
especially for communities

01:50:43.170 --> 01:50:45.420
that are way from the
coast, where there's just

01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:48.720
a lot of concrete,
heat is one of the ways

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:52.740
that people are going to be
suffering, and probably dying,

01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:54.735
if they don't have access
to cooling centers.

01:50:57.350 --> 01:51:02.450
Can I just-- because
several of you

01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:07.335
talked about the land trusts,
and also about the micro-grid.

01:51:07.335 --> 01:51:10.710
So is there no link between
the land trust and micro-grid?

01:51:10.710 --> 01:51:12.320
Is that what you're saying?

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:14.210
I'm saying it's really
just getting started.

01:51:14.210 --> 01:51:18.440
So the micro-grid
project, I think

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:22.360
the award for that
came earlier this year.

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.340
And so the land trust that
DSNI has, for example,

01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:27.300
has been around for
a couple of decades.

01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:29.720
So some new things
are being introduced

01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:33.500
into the conversation because
there are environmental justice

01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:36.200
organizations at the table,
like ACE and GreenRoots.

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:39.200
But I would say
within the past six

01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:41.664
to eight months people are
beginning to explore those.

01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:52.700
Hi, my name is Pua
Brown, I'm a senior.

01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:55.010
Thank you all for coming,
and for your contributions,

01:51:55.010 --> 01:51:55.935
and all your work.

01:51:55.935 --> 01:51:57.900
It's really amazing.

01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:01.520
I am in environmental science
and public policy at Harvard,

01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:05.642
and I just finished my
thesis on food sovereignty--

01:52:05.642 --> 01:52:08.420
[APPLAUSE]

01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.654
--in traditional
Hawaiian agriculture,

01:52:10.654 --> 01:52:12.320
in the context of the
whole food system,

01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:15.470
but really focusing on water
rights and the public trust

01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:19.710
doctrine, and restorative
environmental justice.

01:52:19.710 --> 01:52:24.830
And so that brings in what you
are saying about communities

01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:28.560
uplifting themselves,
giving them the resources--

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:31.220
whether it's
environmental resources,

01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:40.040
or economic resources-- to
make the change that they seek.

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.190
And so I guess--

01:52:41.190 --> 01:52:44.220
and I took Professor
Subermanian's class

01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:46.630
last semester, and it
was a huge inspiration.

01:52:46.630 --> 01:52:48.880
In clarifying on these
thoughts, and one of the things

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:51.180
that just kept coming up,
so many of these themes

01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:54.960
were throughout my thesis,
but the intersectionality

01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:56.970
of environmental justice.

01:52:56.970 --> 01:53:04.440
And creating a world,
imagining alternative futures,

01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:06.690
in a world of shared values.

01:53:06.690 --> 01:53:09.810
And I really think that there's
a huge potential in terms

01:53:09.810 --> 01:53:13.670
of indigenous rights, and
environmental justice rhetoric,

01:53:13.670 --> 01:53:15.420
and also restorative
environmental justice

01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:18.520
for all marginalized
communities.

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:21.932
And so I was wearing if you
guys had more to say about that.

01:53:28.190 --> 01:53:31.130
One thing-- thank
you, very much,

01:53:31.130 --> 01:53:36.350
and for just even lifting
up this future of where

01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:39.810
we have shared values.

01:53:39.810 --> 01:53:46.830
You know, I think that part
of the power of storytelling,

01:53:46.830 --> 01:53:48.330
and in hearing each
other's stories,

01:53:48.330 --> 01:53:51.080
is that we start to build
empathy for each other.

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:55.890
And I feel like that's a
really undervalued facilitator

01:53:55.890 --> 01:54:03.720
of how we might start to
create equity and justice.

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:08.910
And so I think that
when we hear stories

01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:11.959
and we start to make connections
between our histories,

01:54:11.959 --> 01:54:14.250
and understanding that a lot
of what we're dealing with

01:54:14.250 --> 01:54:17.910
has been set up, there's
a historical precedent set

01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:21.240
in motion by certain
laws and policies

01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:23.680
that got us where we are today.

01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:29.560
And so I think that it's that
larger ecosystem of what you're

01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:34.480
saying, is how do
we lift up what

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:41.140
is indigenous rights, what is
the community knowledge that we

01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:43.480
hold?

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:46.360
I think that one point
that I'm taking away, just

01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:47.830
from your own
reflection, I think

01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:49.540
it's going to take an
intersection of all

01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:51.560
of those different strategies.

01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:55.360
And I think that the
strategy around policy,

01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:58.390
I think that is an area where
we're playing a little bit

01:54:58.390 --> 01:55:01.630
of catch-up, and we have to
really engage our folks on--

01:55:01.630 --> 01:55:03.370
what are the
policies on the books

01:55:03.370 --> 01:55:05.800
right now that
need to be changed?

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:09.190
That are causing
harm, that many of us

01:55:09.190 --> 01:55:12.010
really don't know
that much about?

01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:16.720
And we have to politicize
folks about policies, and how

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:19.100
we can change policies.

01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:21.430
And so I feel like
that's an area--

01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:24.380
whether it's around
land usage, or energy.

01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:27.310
And if I could just lift
up a couple of things

01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:30.880
that some of our
grantees are doing,

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:35.020
we had a grantee
network in Rhode Island

01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:38.650
of immigrant workers that just
passed legislation at the state

01:55:38.650 --> 01:55:40.630
level in Rhode Island,
that recognizes

01:55:40.630 --> 01:55:42.670
worker-owned cooperatives.

01:55:42.670 --> 01:55:46.600
That had not been
recognized in the state

01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:51.071
of Rhode Island, worker-owned
cooperatives, as businesses.

01:55:51.071 --> 01:55:53.320
Which means that maybe they
can get some state funding

01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:53.820
to start.

01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:56.920
But that's a game
changer for people.

01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:01.720
Or even thinking about
the incarceration--

01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:03.670
that there was a
group of young people

01:56:03.670 --> 01:56:07.750
that passed the CSA Act in
Providence around police

01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:11.200
brutality, and mandating that
the police department keep

01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:14.350
data on who they stop and why.

01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:17.410
Because they were learning
that young people had these--

01:56:17.410 --> 01:56:21.010
after having interactions
with the police--

01:56:21.010 --> 01:56:24.070
that their names are in
these gang databases.

01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:26.700
And they had no idea why.

01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:29.140
And so parents didn't know,
the youth didn't know.

01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:31.300
They'd go to apply
for jobs and programs,

01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:33.597
and then these
records would come up.

01:56:33.597 --> 01:56:35.680
And it's like, how the
hell did they get in there?

01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:37.660
And they'd have these
interactions with the police,

01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:39.910
and the police would put
their names in the database.

01:56:40.690 --> 01:56:44.800
So they just passed
a law that changes

01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:49.750
that, where the police have
to be transparent about what

01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:52.060
they're doing when they
interact with youth of color.

01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:53.540
So this is what I'm saying--

01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:58.960
this is the multi-strategy,
policy-level engagement

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:02.680
that we have to be on top of.

01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:05.440
So I think that that's one of
the opportunities that we have.

01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.480
Thank you so much.

01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:17.580
I really enjoyed
the conversation

01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:20.360
on different scales.

01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:23.430
My question emerges out
of some of the things

01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:24.900
around the
environmental justice,

01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:26.880
and moving more to
what Ami was talking

01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:29.970
around science and
production of knowledge

01:57:29.970 --> 01:57:32.160
on a scientific level.

01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:34.800
And I wanted to raise--

01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:37.470
that's my first question,
how do you really

01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:39.510
make those connections
more explicit?

01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:41.100
Because most of
the time, when we

01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:42.910
think from
environmental justice,

01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:46.260
immediately that knowledge
is degraded as being

01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:51.090
less, scientifically less
knowledgeable, or less

01:57:51.090 --> 01:57:54.220
insightful about innovation
and all that stuff.

01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:57.600
And so I think it may be
interesting to see, how do we

01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:59.610
have that conversation,
that it doesn't really

01:57:59.610 --> 01:58:01.860
become us versus them?

01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:04.020
Because for instance, I am--

01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:05.640
by the way, I didn't
introduce myself.

01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:08.880
I'm [INAUDIBLE],, I
teach in Toronto.

01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:11.160
I sent some of my
students to go into one

01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:14.190
of the communities,
which is like Chelsea,

01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:18.570
and they were shocked how the
corporations have come in,

01:58:18.570 --> 01:58:21.960
and making demands and
claims on the indigenous land

01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:25.650
in order to build their
own power plants there.

01:58:25.650 --> 01:58:27.900
While the indigenous
people have been struggling

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:31.170
for more than 40 years
in this particular area

01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:33.180
to really say, we don't
want power plants,

01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:35.490
because it's
contaminating our waters,

01:58:35.490 --> 01:58:38.190
it's destroying our lives--
cancer rate is higher

01:58:38.190 --> 01:58:39.930
than any other community.

01:58:39.930 --> 01:58:41.790
So I'm wondering
if there is a way

01:58:41.790 --> 01:58:46.470
of speaking to that kind
of gap, if you will.

01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:47.680
So that's my first question.

01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:51.090
My second question because I'm
also an international relations

01:58:51.090 --> 01:58:55.920
professor, one of the big
issues that you guys brought up

01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:59.670
about energy and migration,
we saw Donald Trump just

01:58:59.670 --> 01:59:01.710
attacked Syria.

01:59:01.710 --> 01:59:03.330
And one of the
major issues there

01:59:03.330 --> 01:59:05.820
is foreign policy
and militarization.

01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:08.760
So I just wanted
to throw that out,

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:10.800
because I think one
of the major issues

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:13.590
here is like a lot of
resources, public resources

01:59:13.590 --> 01:59:18.120
end up going to militarization,
and basically stealing

01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:23.080
other people's land
and energy resources.

01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:28.200
So how do we make that global
connection more explicit?

01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:31.980
And I think in a way we can
speak about America as being so

01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:35.190
isolated, and the big empire--

01:59:35.190 --> 01:59:37.980
can kill anybody everywhere--
but I think it may be important

01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:41.550
for us to start thinking,
especially around migration,

01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:42.990
what are those connections?

01:59:42.990 --> 01:59:45.300
Because when you are
displacing refugees,

01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:50.180
they're coning here,
perhaps, or Europe,

01:59:50.180 --> 01:59:53.700
but with what implications
on environmental issues

01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:58.055
and scientific approaches
to understanding?

01:59:58.055 --> 01:59:59.672
The environmental destruction?

01:59:59.672 --> 02:00:01.932
Thank you.

02:00:01.932 --> 02:00:03.380
Sure, I can start.

02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:08.420
I think your point is well
taken about the production

02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:13.200
of knowledge, and how
to engage communities

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.050
and to lift up their knowledge.

02:00:15.050 --> 02:00:18.620
Especially to protect
their environment,

02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:19.600
protect their rights.

02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:24.060
And I think conversations
like this are very important.

02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:27.230
And I think it starts
with developing

02:00:27.230 --> 02:00:29.690
trust among different people--

02:00:29.690 --> 02:00:33.740
investing in these
relationships.

02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:38.810
I think everything starts
with relationships.

02:00:38.810 --> 02:00:40.980
And that gets back to
what Trina was saying,

02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:44.570
and especially relationships
across difference.

02:00:44.570 --> 02:00:47.400
And then once you have
those relationships,

02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:52.050
to be creative about
what you produce,

02:00:52.050 --> 02:00:55.350
and also the different
languages you

02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:57.180
can use in your
production, and also

02:00:57.180 --> 02:00:59.250
the different types of output.

02:00:59.250 --> 02:01:02.430
So language is being
anything from English

02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:07.470
to indigenous languages,
to more scientific,

02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:09.810
quantitative
language, to something

02:01:09.810 --> 02:01:13.620
that's very much
constructed to move policy.

02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:16.440
Which is, in and of
itself, its own language.

02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:20.910
Or a language that's
very much constructed

02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:25.620
to increase everybody's
awareness of a problem, which

02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:28.110
often means policy.

02:01:28.110 --> 02:01:30.780
So really thinking about--

02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:33.390
in a sense, I think, to
create change, a lot of us

02:01:33.390 --> 02:01:38.250
have to almost think
bilingually, but not

02:01:38.250 --> 02:01:45.210
necessarily thinking about
language in a looser term.

02:01:45.210 --> 02:01:51.000
Because I think
community-based partnerships

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.070
can take many different forms.

02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:59.760
But I think that the best
ones recognize the fact

02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:01.920
that different stakeholders
have different needs,

02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:06.120
and ideally we'd be trying
to address some of these.

02:02:08.266 --> 02:02:10.140
Kind of going back to
your point about moving

02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:12.250
policy, two things--

02:02:12.250 --> 02:02:14.100
I've started to
get more into that.

02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:16.990
And it is a very
different way of thinking,

02:02:16.990 --> 02:02:19.470
and a different way of
translating information.

02:02:19.470 --> 02:02:24.120
And also asking very specific
questions that may be different

02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:26.490
sometimes the most
pressing questions

02:02:26.490 --> 02:02:27.910
for the scientific community.

02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:30.150
But then, I think the
other elephant in the room

02:02:30.150 --> 02:02:35.630
is, what is our
likelihood of changing

02:02:35.630 --> 02:02:38.070
policy for the better
on the federal landscape

02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:39.555
in the next few years?

02:02:39.555 --> 02:02:43.410
So even if that's what we
need to do, if you look at,

02:02:43.410 --> 02:02:48.830
in the space human rights
environment, public health,

02:02:48.830 --> 02:02:51.750
likely, the only thing, it
anything that's happening,

02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:56.080
is going strikingly in
the wrong direction.

02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:01.470
And so what are the
strategies in the face of that

02:03:01.470 --> 02:03:03.390
the big elephant in the room?

02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:06.720
But that also speaks to
different levels of government.

02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:10.380
So it's not that all the levels
of government line up neatly.

02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:12.000
So you've got
California, which is

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.180
at war with the federal
government right now.

02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:17.370
So it's not just
about figuring out

02:03:17.370 --> 02:03:19.500
the language of policy,
and how to navigate

02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:22.190
the world of policy, but
at what level of state--

02:03:26.020 --> 02:03:28.330
you pitch your claims.

02:03:28.330 --> 02:03:31.090
And you can even use tensions
between different levels

02:03:31.090 --> 02:03:33.370
of government to your advantage.

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:41.250
I heard a lot about
the municipal level.

02:03:41.250 --> 02:03:45.030
And that level of government
having a little more

02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:48.460
give, that it's a much more--

02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:51.230
there's possibilities
for participation.

02:03:51.230 --> 02:03:56.720
There's possibilities to lay
claim to policy as a right.

02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:59.000
I don't know whether
it's that easy

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.452
to do at the federal level.

02:04:09.590 --> 02:04:12.240
Were all like, so
many things to say.

02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:16.380
I think you're right--

02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:19.020
a lot of us are mostly
contesting for power

02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:21.240
at the municipal
level, because that

02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:28.220
is where it's a level
that our base understands,

02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:30.180
and can vision around.

02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:33.020
And at the same
time, I also believe

02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:35.630
that this is part of the
reason why I was talking

02:04:35.630 --> 02:04:38.130
about this 10-year agenda.

02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:41.900
So part of the reason--

02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:47.030
I should say, we're not in this
position as a country because

02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:49.130
of this one election.

02:04:49.130 --> 02:04:57.980
So there were a series of
decisions and power strategies

02:04:57.980 --> 02:04:59.900
that folks had been
planning decades

02:04:59.900 --> 02:05:04.520
before this moment that happened
to come to fruition, maybe by--

02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:09.470
who knows, just as a
cloud of circumstances

02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:10.640
brought us to that.

02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:17.900
And so I think for me, that
means that we, our side,

02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:20.210
needs to also be doing
that kind of level

02:05:20.210 --> 02:05:21.830
of planning and strategy.

02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:22.640
Not that it's easy.

02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:29.600
But the hard part
is, not only being

02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:34.040
able to say what we don't want,
but really doing the hardware

02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:36.290
to vision about what
does it look like when

02:05:36.290 --> 02:05:37.370
we're going to govern?

02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:41.640
And how do we actually want
these systems transformed?

02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:45.110
And I think that's
the part that we

02:05:45.110 --> 02:05:49.520
have to really begin thinking
and strategizing about.

02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:54.590
And unfortunately, understanding
and grappling with the fact

02:05:54.590 --> 02:05:56.330
that, during this
period, there's

02:05:56.330 --> 02:05:58.700
going to be a lot of harm.

02:05:58.700 --> 02:06:00.780
That is just inevitable.

02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:05.690
And so how can we also
strengthen our practices

02:06:05.690 --> 02:06:08.900
for healing with each
other, and dealing

02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:12.500
with the multitudes
of many faceted ways

02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:16.220
that trauma is going to be
continuing to attack our folks,

02:06:16.220 --> 02:06:18.260
and is already is already here.

02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:22.430
But yeah, I think we have to
do you longer term visioning

02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:25.360
and planning.

02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:27.645
Does anyone want to answer
the militarism question?

02:06:32.770 --> 02:06:43.104
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:06:43.104 --> 02:06:45.020
Something that was very
interesting about what

02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:49.562
you had mentioned was that
intersection between what

02:06:49.562 --> 02:06:51.020
is happening here,
and also what is

02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:52.660
happening in other countries.

02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:54.730
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:07.190
I think that when we talk
about environmental justice,

02:07:07.190 --> 02:07:09.770
we also have to talk
about capitalism

02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:14.060
and the economic system that we
have, that is, quite frankly,

02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:14.990
destroying our lives.

02:07:19.032 --> 02:07:20.380
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:07:41.237 --> 02:07:42.820
I'm going to talk
about Latin America,

02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:45.460
because that's what
has been my experience,

02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:47.710
and that's what I'm most
knowledgeable about.

02:07:47.710 --> 02:07:49.310
But we have suffered.

02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:52.220
We have suffered for
a very long time--

02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:58.460
ever since the colonialism
of extractivism.

02:07:58.460 --> 02:08:01.840
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:05.980
And now we're living
through capitalism.

02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:11.830
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:13.900
And so what connections
do we see there,

02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:16.960
between everything that is
economic and the environment?

02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:18.680
And it's completely connected.

02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:19.800
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:30.820
And it's these
large corporations

02:08:30.820 --> 02:08:36.610
that go to our
countries, that just

02:08:36.610 --> 02:08:39.660
exploit our natural resources.

02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:40.750
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:09:03.970 --> 02:09:06.700
These major corporations,
by exploiting

02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:09.940
our natural resources, are
displacing indigenous groups,

02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:11.740
are displacing
basically everything

02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:13.120
that gets in their way.

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:14.920
They're contaminating
rivers, they're

02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:17.500
taking our precious
goods, and it's exactly

02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:22.600
this system that is causing
this climate change.

02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:23.860
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:09:24.670 --> 02:09:27.440
And they do it there,
and they do it here.

02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:28.570
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:09:50.830 --> 02:09:53.590
So when you talk
about these systems

02:09:53.590 --> 02:09:55.330
and how they're
connected, we also

02:09:55.330 --> 02:09:57.430
have to talk about immigration.

02:09:57.430 --> 02:10:00.850
Immigration here, when we
talk about these poor people

02:10:00.850 --> 02:10:03.580
from Latin America,
from Central America,

02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:08.950
coming here, these ragamuffins
and riffraff that's immigrating

02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:10.772
into the United States--

02:10:10.772 --> 02:10:12.730
when we look at all of
that, we're not actually

02:10:12.730 --> 02:10:17.230
looking at what the problem
is, what the problem there is.

02:10:17.230 --> 02:10:18.550
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:22.430
So we're not looking at
the root of the problem.

02:10:22.430 --> 02:10:23.840
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:10:26.762 --> 02:10:28.720
A lot of people think
that immigrants come here

02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:30.000
to take our jobs.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.480
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:33.620
That we're criminals.

02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:45.740
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:50.150
In 1998, Central America
suffered a hurricane

02:10:50.150 --> 02:10:53.000
that completely devastated
the region, which

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.530
was called hurricane Mitch.

02:10:55.530 --> 02:11:00.590
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:02.630
And that caused many
Central Americans

02:11:02.630 --> 02:11:05.850
to cross the border
into the United States.

02:11:05.850 --> 02:11:07.110
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:32.600
And so as a result, we had
what is now called TPS--

02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:35.990
or temporary protective status.

02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:59.630
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:11:59.630 --> 02:12:03.170
So for years, these people
have lived here in the United

02:12:03.170 --> 02:12:07.400
States-- both Central American
and people from Africa--

02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:09.950
under this temporary
protective status.

02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:12.140
But now that temporary
protective status

02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:14.660
is being threatened,
and now they

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.430
are being threatened
that they're

02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:20.370
going to now be stripped of the
TPS and live here illegally.

02:12:20.370 --> 02:12:26.360
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:30.550
So for many Central Americans,
next year will be their last.

02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:31.640
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:52.090
So when you look
at it, immigration

02:12:52.090 --> 02:12:56.170
is completely linked with
environmental justice.

02:12:56.170 --> 02:12:58.240
How is it connected
to capitalism?

02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:00.400
How is it connected
to climate change?

02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:02.840
Everything is absolutely
interconnected.

02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:10.870
Great, well this was wonderful.

02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:29.840
I just wanted to
make one announcement

02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:35.600
of another environmental
justice talk, which is tomorrow.

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:37.630
Just to keep the ball rolling.

02:13:37.630 --> 02:13:40.250
Go to as many EJ
talks as you can.

02:13:40.250 --> 02:13:43.400
It's by Elizabeth
Hoover, and the title

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:45.350
is, The River Is in Us--

02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:47.750

Reproductive Justice

02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:49.910
in a Mohawk Community.

02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:53.260
From 4:00 to 6:00 PM,
Harvard Hall, 102.

02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:55.280
If you try to make it.
