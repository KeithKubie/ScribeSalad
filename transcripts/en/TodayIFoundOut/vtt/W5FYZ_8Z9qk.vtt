00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:17.570
For kids who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s,
it was sugary cereal commercials that dotted

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.730
the television landscape, featuring lucky
leprechauns, wise-cracking droids and adorable

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.730
Gremlins.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.910
A common theme among all of them was advocating
these products were a “magical part of a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.530
complete breakfast“, helping to ingrain
that idea into our collective mindset.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.030
Of course, anyone who has even a modicum of
knowledge about proper nutrition knows that

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.561
regularly partaking in a massive dose of extremely
calorie dense, sugary cereal is not at all

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:48.149
needed nor advisable in a “complete breakfast”.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.440
So how did we get here?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.750
What did people historical eat for breakfast
and who was the first to claim eating cereals

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.649
like mini-ETs was a nutritious way to start
the day?

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.600
To begin with, both large groups of people
eating breakfast and large groups choosing

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.150
to skip it is nothing new.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.630
While The Iliad and The Odyssey make mention
of soldiers and manual laborers eating a meal

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.369
very close to the start of the day, with items
on the menu being things like barley bread,

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.110
olives, fig, and wine, many in the ancient
world did not eat breakfast at all.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.470
In fact, as far as a set meal goes, it wasn’t
uncommon to choose to only eat one large meal

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.650
towards the end of the day.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.710
For instance, according to food historian
Caroline Yeldham, outside of the aforementioned

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.710
individuals like campaigning soldiers and
those who spent their days doing intensive

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.870
manual labor, many Ancient Romans did not
typically eat a morning meal, preferring the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.700
aforementioned one, very large meal a day
eaten at about three or four in the afternoon.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.790
That said, those Romans who did eat a morning
meal, with said meal called jetaculum, seem

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.619
to have eaten things like bread, olives, raisins,
cheese, and nuts, washing it down with some

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.310
wine-based beverage, somewhat similar to the
Ancient Greeks.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.380
As for the legionary on the go, they ate things
such as a porridge made from wheat and barley

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.750
soaked in water.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.240
In all cases, this was essentially pre-prepared
or quick to make and eat food that provided

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.240
what the body needed to sustain high energy
output throughout the morning.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.300
The trend toward abstaining from breakfast
at all saw a huge upsurge during the Middle

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.030
Ages, with many opting for a two meal system-
one around noon and one in the evening.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.920
Eating a meal shortly after waking during
this period in the Western world seems to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.110
have been largely considered a form of gluttony,
as noted by 13th century priest Thomas Aquinas

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.580
in his Summa Theologica.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.060
That’s not to say nobody ate breakfast,
however, even in this anti-breakfast era in

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.390
the Western world.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.110
Those requiring a lot of calories to get through
the day generally ate things like rye bread

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.720
and beer in the morning, though it appears
the more devout of these individuals tended

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.630
to take their desire for a morning meal as
a sign of moral weakness, and their giving

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.750
into it as something of a sinful act.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.400
Unsurprisingly given manual laborers tended
to be poor, beyond being considered somewhat

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.690
gluttonous, eating breakfast in this era also
tended to be looked down upon by the affluent

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.980
as something only poor people did.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.920
It was also during this time that the midday
meal, which, as mentioned, for many in the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.200
Western world was the first meal of the day,
was actually called “dinner,” from the

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.070
Old French word “disnar” which meant breakfast.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.000
So, in other words, lunch was breakfast and
it was called dinner…

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.310
It was during the 14th and 15th centuries
that adding a meal between last night’s

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.730
feast and the midday one started coming into
fashion for all classes.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.610
In fact, the English word “breakfast”
dates back to the mid-15th century when it,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.200
unsurprisingly, literally meant to break the
fast between two meals.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.720
Within a few centuries, breakfast became normalized
and there are records of it being pushed as

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.620
the “most important meal of the day” going
all the way back to the early 18th century,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.550
with those who could afford such items eating
things like eggs, tea, and coffee, along with

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.850
more classic breakfast items like breads,
nuts, and fruits.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.370
In fact, by the mid-18th century, certain
of the English elite even started building

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.710
designated breakfast rooms.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.790
This finally brings us to the 19th century
and the more direct genesis of the sugary

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.230
breakfast cereal we have today.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.130
It was in this era that many Americans were
suffering from dyspepsia, or indigestion,

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.190
seemingly caused by a high protein / high
fat diet largely composed of fatty meats and

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.810
not nearly enough fiber.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.350
Symptoms included upper abdominal pain and
bloating.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.060
To combat this, and other real and perceived
ailments, alternate breakfast items began

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.630
popping up, generally attempting to avoid
meats and animal fats altogether.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.850
On top of this, with the industrial revolution,
breakfast became less about socializing and

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.150
more about quick consumption- the factory
workers needed their caloric intake but didn’t

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.580
have enough time to prepare or eat a full
sit-down meal.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.940
Enter breakfast cereals.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.630
The first modern, designated breakfast cereal
(forms of porridge aside) was invented in

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.880
1863 by a vegetarian Christian abolitionist
doctor named James Caleb Jackson.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.530
Created for his sanatorium patients as a healthy
start to the day, it was comprised of crumbled,

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.540
twice baked graham flour (which is essentially
a type of non-bleached, “all-natural”

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.990
finely ground whole wheat flour) and bran
(hard outer layer of the grain), he called

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.020
“granula”.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.250
The end product resembled a much harder version
of modern Grape-Nuts, but with significantly

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.250
larger nuggets.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.870
Jackson’s granula was reportedly so hard
that it needed to be soaked in liquid for

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.640
at least 20-30 minutes before it could be
comfortably bitten into it.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.330
In the 1870s, Dr. John Kellogg ran his own
sanatorium in Battle Creek, Michigan and was

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.000
known for his very strange, sometimes sadistically
abusive methods, including electrically shocking

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.140
children’s genitals, applying forms of acid
to them, removal of the clitoris in females,

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.690
and circumcising males- all to attempt to
prevent masturbation and sexual urges.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.490
(Interestingly, the latter male circumcision
treatment as something commonly performed

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.270
in America actually hails from this era; the
modern non-Jewish / non-Islamic practice of

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.920
foreskin removal was not really a thing in
the Western world until it began to be seen

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:29.200
as a way to prevent masturbation, see: Why
Do Men Get Circumcised?).

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.670
In any event, Dr. Kellogg visited Jackson’s
retreat and was most impressed with his granula.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.580
So impressed, in fact, that he ripped off
the idea, creating his own version of it made

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.940
of wheat, corn, and ground oats.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.010
He uninventively called it “granula”…

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.730
As a result, Jackson sued and Kellogg was
forced to rename his cereal “granola.”

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.760
A few years later, a failed Battle Creek suspender
salesman named Charles W. Post partially knocked

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.730
off Kellogg’s product and started selling
an exceptionally similar “granola” product

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.389
he called Grape-Nuts, claiming it could make
one’s “red blood redder.”

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:06.120
As with Jackson, Kellogg and Post both pushed
this food item as an ideal, healthy food to

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.010
start the day with, setting the trend that
has continued through today for this line

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.110
of product.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.760
Between Kellogg and Post, at the turn of the
20th century, Battle Creek became a battle

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.140
ground for two companies that would come to
define the world of breakfast cereal.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.889
For instance, legend has it that due to a
mishap making a batch of the original version

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:30.680
of Graham crackers (originally created by
Presbyterian minister Sylvester Graham as

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.580
a way to curb sexual urges, and particularly
the urge to masturbate), John Kellogg and

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.960
his brother Will invented a product they unimaginatively
dubbed “Corn Flakes”.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.290
Post was a little more flamboyant, naming
his version of the same thing “Elijah’s

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.780
Manna”- meant as a striking allusion to
the biblical story about the food that saved

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.190
the wandering, starving Israelites.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.940
With the famed prophet sitting on a rock and
hand feeding a raven on the front of the box,

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.419
Elijah became the first cereal mascot.

00:07:55.419 --> 00:08:00.480
However, fairly quickly, religious groups
protested and Post changed the name to “Post

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.480
Toasties.”

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.710
Ultimately the Kellogg brothers split over
Will Kellogg’s decision to recommend adding

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.760
sugar to Corn Flakes to help it sell better,
something Dr. John Kellogg found borderline

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.640
blasphemous as such a thing, in his opinion,
encouraged sexual excitement.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.830
The two parted ways with Will founding the
Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, which

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:24.139
went on to become the now billion dollar Kellogg
corporation (which besides their tasty flakes

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:27.960
was soon to also introduce another breakfast
staple- Rice Krispies).

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.669
His brother John Kellogg stuck to his original
principles and continued to dedicate his life

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:36.039
to ridding the world of such evils as masturbation…

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:40.960
Now, given the ladies of the house at this
time tended to be the ones who decided what

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.320
the family would eat, during the first few
decades of the 20th century, cereal advertising

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.279
was primarily aimed at housewives.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:53.950
Kellogg’s told women to wink at their grocer
and see what they got (answer: a box of Corn

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.950
Flakes).

00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:00.040
Quaker Oats likewise sponsored radio dramas
and mid-day radio shows aimed at housewives.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.490
Post told moms that bringing up kids on their
cereals would help them later in life.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:10.380
In the late 1930s, as breakfast cereal became
more established and commonly purchased anyway,

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:16.100
cereal companies started thinking it might
be best to skip the middlewoman, instead marketing

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.550
directly to children, who presumably would
pester their mothers for which cereal they

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.550
wanted.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:27.490
For instance, in 1936, a “Dennis the Menace”-like
character named Skippy was used to specifically

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.930
market Wheaties to children.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:29.930
(Originally a comic strip, Skippy and his
creator, Percy Crosby, have a particularly

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:30.930
sad story).

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.430
The problem here is that children tend to
not like straight bran or wheat… but they

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.870
do love sugar.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:42.900
In 1939, the first pre-sugared cereal was
produced, called Ranger Joe Wheat Honnies.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.420
Ironically, the product was actually an effort
by the creator to minimize how much additional

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:53.050
sugar kids commonly put on their cereal by
including a relatively small, regulated amount

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.050
already.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.860
But instead of curbing the practice of over-sugaring
cereal, it eventually resulted in the opposite,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.810
starting with Post copying Ranger Joe Wheat
Honnies with their own version called Sugar

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.990
Crisp in 1949; thanks to a major breakfast
cereal producer now making such a pre-sugared

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.730
product, the rest of the industry followed
suit.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.560
By the 1960s, cereal companies were devoting
approximately 90% of their advertising budgets

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.870
to directly appealing to individuals of the
youthful persuasion.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.430
This is why it is so common today to have
“prizes” in the cereal box, tie-ins with

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:29.810
movies, video games, and TV shows, and products
called Sprinkles Spangle and Ice Cream Cone

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.810
Cereal.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.010
On that note, this is also why adding more
and more sugar to breakfast cereal became

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.010
a thing.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.470
As for widespread claims by the manufacturers
that these cereals are “part of a complete

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:44.010
breakfast,” technically the cereal companies
are not lying here.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.440
Unsurprisingly given that the three primary
nutrient groups, known as macronutrients,

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.870
that humans need to survive are carbohydrates,
proteins, and fats, according to the American

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:59.530
Chemical Society, a healthy breakfast should
consist of mostly carbohydrates and proteins.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.220
Shocker, I know.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:07.250
And, indeed, cereal, even if it’s simply
a bowl of pure sugar, constitutes carbs.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.750
So these products can indeed technically be
considered an essential part of a complete

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:17.899
breakfast, just perhaps not an advisable one
given the vast majority are essentially candy

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:24.839
cleverly marketed to appear nutritious, often
complete with a giant label on the side showing

00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:30.620
all the vitamins added to the product… along
with tiny recommended serving sizes that nobody

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.760
even comes close to following to mask the
absolute massive number of calories and sugar

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.190
most real-world servings of the products contain.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.470
But to be fair, combined with certain other
breakfast items, in extreme moderation this

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:46.580
staple of the breakfast world could potentially
be useful if one leads a very physically active

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.490
life, instead of just rolling out of bed only
to very soon after sit at a desk all day and

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.910
then come home and sit on the couch until
bed time.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.260
On that note, perhaps those sedentary, wealthy
aristocrats of old were on to something in

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.600
choosing to skip the morning meal.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.180
And for those who led a heavily manual labored
life, it is perhaps no surprise that some

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.589
form of grain-based morning meal seems to
have been the choice people made throughout

00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:14.370
most of recorded history- easy to quickly
eat and comprised of a mix of simple and complex

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.300
carbs to provide both quick and relatively
longer lasting stores of energy, all while

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.770
avoiding too much protein and fat which, while
otherwise essential for life and important

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.470
for things like maintaining muscle mass, might
not sit well when eating mostly that in the

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.800
morning and then jumping right into hard labor.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:37.279
Funny enough, while you might think products
like Grape-Nuts or Corn Flakes would offer

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:42.830
a better alternative to more sugary breakfast
cereals, at least in terms of avoiding a blood

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:48.350
sugar spike, it should be noted that Grape-Nuts
has a glycemic index of 71.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:54.320
(For the uninitiated, the GI is a scale showing
the effect of a given food item on one’s

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.750
blood sugar levels, with 100 being pure glucose.)

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:02.660
This is surprisingly higher than such sugary
cereals as Fruit Loops (about 69) and Frosted

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.500
Flakes (about 55).

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.899
For further shocking reference, Corn Flakes
has a mean GI of about 81, and Rice Krispies

00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:14.680
are at 82, while table sugar only has a GI
of 60.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.940
That said, good nutrition is a lot more complicated
than just looking at a single number and there

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.520
is definitely a place for food items high
on the GI, particularly ones that offer other

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.180
benefits like lots of fiber and micronutrients.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:34.149
It’s just surprising how high the vast majority
of breakfast cereals, even seemingly non-sugary

00:13:34.149 --> 00:13:38.980
ones like Grape-Nuts, are on that index.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.100
In 1941, CheeriOats were introduced as a “ready-to-eat”
oat cereal.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.660
The name emphasized the main ingredient to
differentiate itself from the numerous other

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.420
brands out there whose products were generally
made of things like wheat.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.890
Unfortunately for CheeriOats, Quaker Oats
took offense to the name, claiming the “Oats”

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.300
part infringed on their trademark.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:03.030
While it is highly unlikely Quaker Oats would
have won in court, to avoid the issue altogether,

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:33.509
the name was changed to Cheerios in 1945.
