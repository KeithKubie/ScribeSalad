00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:08.140
Accusing someone of narcissism has become
one of the great and tempting insults of our

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.210
age. It is what we are inclined to label anyone
who appears overweening, boastful, entitled

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.480
or excessively pleased with their own existence.
But it’s possible to wonder whether the

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.029
word really fits the conceited and bombastic
types we’ve grown used to applying it to

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.350
– and, a larger point, whether we’re really
understanding, and therefore correctly addressing,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.620
the origins of the regrettable behaviour to
which it refers. Behind our enthusiastic use

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.420
of the term lies an implicit theory of human
nature: that people seek undue attention for

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.010
themselves, grow pretentious and inclined
to bombast when – at heart – they feel

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.149
an extraordinary love for who they are. It
is their hugely high estimation of themselves,

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.590
combined with their robust pride in everything
they are and do, that is at the root of their

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.739
tendencies to talk up their own achievements
and to try to secure the admiration of strangers.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.340
But, on closer examination, it seems that
the agitation and peacock displays cannot

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.991
really stem from a feeling of being perfectly
and requitedly enamoured of oneself. Those

00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:23.710
whom we loosely call narcissists can’t actually
think so well of themselves; they boast and

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.090
show off because they can’t find a way of
being sufficiently content with who they really

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.469
are – and are driven on by a manic, haunting
terror of their own invisibility and mediocrity.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:42.219
The behaviours we associate with narcissism
– the vanity, the greed, the lies – aren’t

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:49.310
symptoms of self-love, they are proof of its
dangerous, tragic absence. Let’s recall

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.600
the original Greek myth from where the word
descends. Narcissus was a hunter from central

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.890
Greece, the son of the river god Cephissus
and the nymph Liriope. He had long flowing

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.240
locks, deep blue eyes, unblemished skin and
full enchanting lips. One day, as he walked

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.380
past a quiet pool of water, he caught sight
of his own reflection, failed to recognise

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.650
himself and was entranced with the image.
He had never seen anyone quite so enchanting

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.519
– and could not stop falling profoundly
in love with himself, the most admirable and

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:31.340
bewitching being he had ever spotted. Framed
like this, narcissism sounds laughable and absurd. But derogatory

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.269
remarks make us lose sight of the genuine
benefits of having been able, when young,

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.709
under the tutelage of kindly caregivers, properly
to admire oneself without reserve, to have

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.930
been allowed to strut and sing and feel utterly
home in one’s own skin and, for a time,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.159
delight amply in the sheer wondrousness of
one’s existence. There might be such a thing

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:02.530
as good narcissism: a phase of coming to love
oneself that is the precondition for knowing

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:10.890
how to love anyone else. Most of the problems of
the world are created by people who do not love themselves.  Who cannot

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.299
inwardly believe in their own worth; those
who grew up with a searing hatred and shame

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.500
about who they were – and who now cannot
stop insistently claiming an attention of

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.019
which they were once deprived. One has to
despise oneself really rather a lot before

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.000
it ever seems like a good idea to devote one’s
life to trying to prove valuable in the eyes

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.431
of complete strangers. By contrast, the really
self-contented ones among us are those who

00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:45.519
have no burning need for adulation and know
how to draw quiet satisfaction from nothing

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:52.260
more than their own unadorned, ordinary being.
We should want to build a world not where

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.650
there are fewer people who have loved themselves
but where there are many more, a world richer

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.700
in what we can term healthy narcissism. We
will be modest and self-effacing, ready to

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.500
be quietly interested in and attentive to
others, happy to forego baubles and manic

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.900
acclaim, when we’ve had a chance to gaze
at our reflection awhile and think it really

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.470
pretty nice – nice enough for us to go out
and start generously to spread kindness and

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.640
selflessness to those around us.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.360
Did you know that The School Of Life is actually a place?  Ten places in fact.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.320
