00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.830
So the information about
the Hufting bound gives us a way of

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.160
thinking about how many samples we need
to accurately learn the value of an arm.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.850
So we're going to have to
actually pick a number for that.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.460
How many samples we're going to take of
each arm to guide us in that decision.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.830
It's going to be helpful to think about
how we're going to combine information

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.680
across the arms.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.340
So this is going to be a strategy
that will ultimately work,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.970
though we don't have all the details
filled in yet, and it goes like this.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.730
What we're going to do is, we're
going to take c samples of each arm for

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.970
some value c.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.880
&gt;&gt; That's what I was going to do.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.540
&gt;&gt; The c is going to be some function of
epsilon delta k, that sort of thing, but

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.060
it's going to be some number, and

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.950
it's going to be a number that,
well, we're going to see.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.030
It's going to be some number that
guarantees that we're some amount

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.270
close with some certainty.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.530
And then after that point,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.780
we're going to choose the arm that has
the highest estimate, the best estimate.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.520
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.254
&gt;&gt; Ultimately, we want our final
decision here to be epsilon

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:55.120
close to the optimal decision
with probability 1 minus delta.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.510
So I claim that to do that,
for this to work,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.485
we need to learn each arm individually
to an accuracy of epsilon over

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:07.680
2 with a certainly of
1 minus delta over k.
