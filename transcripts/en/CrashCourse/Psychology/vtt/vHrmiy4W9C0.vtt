00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
In the early 1800's, German physician, Franz
Joseph Gall spent a lot of time running his

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.980
fingers over the scalps of strangers. He wasn't
a hairdresser, he wasn't a masseuse, he wasn't

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.920
just like a big fan of heads. He was a phrenologist,
he was the first phrenologist. Gall believed

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.850
that a persons personality was linked to their
skull morphology, that its bumps and ridges

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.970
indicated aspects of their character. Amazingly
this "science" actually caught on, was widely

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.350
practiced for decades, and Gall became something
of a celebrity.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.020
Well, with a head like his, one can see how
he might have been a little bit fixated with

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.940
skull shape.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.570
Eventually, phrenology was dismissed as a
cult pseudoscience because it turns out your

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.760
cranial contours tell us exactly nothing about
what's happening inside the brain.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.579
And yet! Gall was actually on to something
big, something that we knew nothing about.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.110
Remember, at this point we were just starting
to get consensus that the brain was the source

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.280
of self and not like the soul or the heart
or whatever. His lasting and correct proposition

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.309
was that different parts of the brain control
specific aspects of our behavior.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.309
Like we talked about last time, there is a
strong link between biological activity and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.320
psychological events. But in addition to the
interplay of chemicals like neurotransmitters

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.420
and hormones, a lot of this has to do with
that localized parts of the brain have specific

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.610
functions, like vision, movement, memory,
speech, and even facial recognition. Function,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.820
in other words, is localized.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.350
If you could stimulate different parts of
my brain in any way you wanted to– and if

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.479
you ask me nicely, I just might let you–
you could control my movements, my memories,

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.030
and even my personality. Poke my brain over
here and my arm would twitch, poke here and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.369
I'd remember my first kiss, do it up her and
suddenly I'd be filled with a tremendous Hulk-like

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:36.880
rage!

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.479
This is the link between the brain, that physical
hunk of gunk between the ears, and the mind,

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.900
the thing that is us, our consciousness, our
behavior, our decisions, our memories, our

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.520
selves. Some neuroscientists like to say that
the mind is what the brain does, so one of

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.790
the driving questions of psychology and, like,
the human experiment is "How do our brains'

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.700
functions tie to the behavior of the mind?"
And you can't even ask the right questions,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.799
let alone get at some of the answers, until
you get to know the brain.

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.230
[Intro]

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.029
You might have a passing familiarity with
your nervous system, like, "The brain bone

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:23.549
is connected to the spinal cord bone, and
the spinal cord bone is connected to the motoneuron

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.590
bone." That's your central nervous system,
and there aren't actually any bones. Your

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.040
central nervous system, or just CNS, is what
makes your bodies big decisions. This system

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.739
is the command center, and if you mess with
it, things are gonna get weird. There's also

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.930
the peripheral nervous system, which is composed
of scout-like sensory neurons that gather

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.909
information and report it back to the central
nervous system.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.519
To get a handle on just how physical the roots
of your mind and personality are, how concretely

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.659
your nervous system makes you you, let me
tell you a story. The curious case of Phineas

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:58.139
Gage. In 1848, a genial chap named Phineas
Gage was working on the railroad, tamping

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.769
gunpowder into a blasting hole with an iron
rod, but the gunpowder ignited.The resulting

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.529
explosion caused the rod to shoot like a bullet
up through his left cheek and out of the top

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:12.669
of his head. There's brain in between those
two places, by the way. Amazingly, he stood

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:17.379
up after the accident, and walked over to
a cart, described what had happened, and then

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.359
they drove him back to his house, all while
he was conscious.

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.260
So the doctor came to examine him, and refused
to believe that a rod had in fact passed through

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.379
his head, understandably. Until Phineas started
coughing and an amount of brain that the doctor

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:37.389
described as a teacup-ful fell out of his
head, and the doctor had to accept indeed

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.839
what had happened. After a few months of convalescing,
he was pretty much healed up and moving around

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:47.229
like he used to. But his friends were saying
that Phineas was no longer like himself. Yes

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:52.019
he had his memories and his mental abilities,
and he walked and talked and looked the same,

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.709
minus an eyeball, whereas the old Phineas
was mild-mannered and soft-spoken, the post-spike-to-the-brain

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.229
Phineas was surly and mean-spirited and vulgar.
People started to describe him as "no longer

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:04.019
Gage."

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.389
Phineas moved away from America, the scientific
establishment lost contact with him and 12

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.419
years later, after a series of seizures he
died at the age of 36. Phineas is a great,

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.370
if extreme, example of how function is localized
in the brain and how physical and biological

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.680
factors can be reflected in psychological
ways. Of course he is also an excellent example

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.020
of how individual studies are not particularly
useful, especially since we have very little

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.639
data on what Phineas was actually like before
or even after his accident. Most accounts

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.379
are from the months directly after the accident,
and many of them conflict. It's completely

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.340
possible that he continued to heal and lived
his remaining years as a happy and productive

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.789
citizen.

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.680
Intro-psychology texts often paint the simple
picture of Phineas just so we can have a clear

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.599
example of the moment when physicians realized
that messing with the brain was messing with

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.240
the mind, but it is of course all much more
complicated and Phineas was an actual, real

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.009
life person, I feel that we should give him
the nuance and mystery that he deserves.

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.870
Now you might have heard that we only used
about 10 percent of our brains, and oh if

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.099
that were true, Phineas would lose a quarter
of his and he'd be just fine. And if we could

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.490
just harness the rest of that gray mush, we'd
be able to mind read and levitate and get

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.430
all Professor X. It's an exciting thought,
as exciting as the idea that I can tell what

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.319
kind of tea you like by feeling the bumps
on your head. It is also exactly as wrong.

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.379
After watching an hour or so of reality TV,
you'd be forgiven for thinking that some people

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.860
are only working at 10 percent brain capacity.
But in actual reality, brain scans show that

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.900
nearly every region of the brain lights up
during even simple tasks like walking and

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.340
talking. Not only that, but the brain itself
requires 20 percent of all the body's energy,

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.210
and it would make little evolutionary sense
to throw much energy away at something that

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.159
is only minimally active.

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.780
As animals, our capabilities have developed
in part from our brain structures. We're actually

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.960
able to trace our evolutionary history as
we come to understand these structures. Less

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.729
complex animals have simpler brains designed
for basic functioning and survival: rest,

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.310
breathe, eat. Whereas more complex animals
like many mammals possess brains that feel,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.819
remember, reason, and predict. These animals
don't have all new systems. They have new

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.749
brain systems built upon old brain systems.
The brain is kind of like a set of Russian

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:08.639
nesting dolls. The outermost wooden doll is
the newest, most detailed and most complex,

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.490
but as you go deeper, the dolls become older
and smaller, and simpler, and more generic.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.030
The innermost wooden doll is the oldest, most
basic. It's like a fossil in your head.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.360
This inner core of the brain, sometimes called
the "old brain" still performs for us much

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.389
as it did for our early evolutionary ancestors.
It's anchored by the brainstem, the most ancient

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:32.469
and central core of the brain where the spinal
brain enters the skull. Above it, at the base

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:36.840
of the skull, is the medulla. Here, old brain
functions happen automatically without any

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.289
conscious effort: the beating of hearts, the
breathing of lungs, that sort of thing. The

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:45.270
pons is perched on the medulla, and it helps
coordinate movement. Above the pons, at the

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.139
top of the brainstem, is the thalamus, a pair
of egg-shaped structures that take in sensory

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.099
information related to seeing, hearing, touching,
and tasting. The reticular formation is a

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.819
finger-shaped nerve network inside the brain
stem that's essential for arousal, which isn't

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:03.060
necessarily what you feel upon seeing a particularly
nice-looking human, but instead refers to

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.729
things like sleeping and walking and pain
perception; other important functions. The

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:10.300
baseball-sized cerebellum, or "little brain",
swells from the bottom of the brain stem and

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.689
is responsible for non-verbal learning and
memory, the perception of time, and modulating

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:19.990
motions, it controls voluntary movement like
your sweet dance moves, but it also gets impaired

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.960
easily under the influence of alcohol, hence
the term "tipsy".

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.159
So the old brain systems keep our body's basic
functions running smoothly; the sort of stuff

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:31.759
any animal might need. This is pretty much
where the brain stops for reptiles.

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.389
For higher functions, we look to the limbic
system. This includes the amygdala, hypothalamus,

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.400
and hippocampus. Sort of a border region of
the brain separating the old brain and the

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.139
newer, higher cerebral areas. The amygdala
consists of two lima bean-sized clusters of

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:50.360
neurons and is responsible for memory consolidation
as well as both our greatest fear and hottest

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.409
aggression. Stimulate one area of the amygdala,
and a docile family dog suddenly morphs into

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:57.809
a blood thirsty Cujo. Shift that electrode
over just a tiny bit and that dog will be

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:02.789
cowering at butterfly shadow puppets. The
hypothalamus keeps your whole body steady,

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:07.249
regulating body temperatures, circadian rhythms,
and hunger, also helps govern the endocrine

00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:10.430
system, especially the pituitary gland. You
should also thank your hypothalamus for allowing

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.840
you to feel pleasure and reward. Rats implanted
with electrodes in the reward center of their

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.689
hypothalamuses and given ways to self stimulate
those areas will essentially reward themselves

00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:25.430
until they collapse or die. So, use with caution.
The final part of the limbic system is the

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.039
hippocampus, central to learning and memory,
and if it's damaged, a person may lose their

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:32.039
ability to retain new facts and memories.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.740
Now above all of this is the most advanced
stuff - the stuff that you think of when you

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.199
think of the brain - the grey matter. The
two hemispheres of your cerebrum make up about

00:08:40.199 --> 00:08:44.500
eighty-five percent of your brain weight,
and oversee your ability to think, speak,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.300
and perceive. The left and right hemispheres
govern and regulate different functions, giving

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.310
us a split brain, connected by a structure
called the corpus callosum. So, for instance,

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.930
language production is controlled largely
by the left hemisphere, while certain creative

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:01.040
functions are controlled by the right. Though
this has nothing to do with handedness or

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.699
people having dominant sides of their brain
being more analytical or creative or whatever

00:09:05.699 --> 00:09:10.389
- that's part of what we call pop psychology:
a behavioral disorder in which journalists

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:14.750
and arm chair psychologists use research showing
beautiful, detailed, intimately connected

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:19.639
complexities of your brain to sell newspapers
or reinforce previously held beliefs.

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:24.370
Yes, some tasks are distributed to one side,
but the sides are deeply and constantly connected;

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.910
a statement as general as "artistic people
use their right brains" is as useless as saying

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.699
"artistic people have particularly bumpy heads".

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:35.620
Finally, covering the left and right hemispheres,
we have the cerebral cortex, a thin layer

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.779
of over twenty billion interconnected neurons.
But let's not forget the unsung heroes of

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:45.430
your nervous system: the billions of non-neuron
glial cells, which provide a spider web of

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.240
support that surround, insulate, and nourish
the cerebral neurons.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.699
You've probably seen enough brain diagrams
to know that the cerebral cortex's left and

00:09:52.699 --> 00:09:58.199
right sides are subdivided into four lobes:
the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal,

00:09:58.199 --> 00:10:03.180
all separated by especially prominent folds,
or fissures. Each lobe does indeed have its

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.259
own set of duties, and would have made Franz
Gall proud.

00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:09.910
The frontal lobes, just behind your forehead,
are involved in speaking, planning, judging,

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:14.259
abstract thinking, and as the tale of Phineas
Gage reminds us, aspects of personality. The

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:18.720
parietal lobes receive and process your sense
of touch and body position. At the back of

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.740
your head, the occipital lobes receive information
related to sight. And the temporal lobes just

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.139
above your ears process sound, including speech
comprehension.

00:10:26.139 --> 00:10:30.079
Remember that each hemisphere controls the
opposite side of the body, so my left temporal

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:33.690
lobe processes sounds heard through my right
ear. And within these lobes there are still

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.709
more regions that have specialized functions.
Your motor cortex at the rear of your frontal

00:10:37.709 --> 00:10:41.990
lobes, for example, controls voluntary movements
and sends messages from the brain out to the

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.750
body like "pet that dog!" or "pick up that
mug", while your somatosensory cortex right

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.149
behind it processes incoming sensations like
"Oooooh, that doggie is soft!" or "Gah, the

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:50.860
mug is hot!"

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.670
The rest of your grey matter is made up of
association areas that are related to higher

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.970
mental functions like remembering, thinking,
learning, and speaking. But the thing about

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.860
association areas is that unlike your sensory
or motor cortex, you couldn't just poke one

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.779
and create a neat response. Association areas
are more subtle; they deal with things like

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:12.209
interpreting and integrating sensory input
and linking up with memories. And they prevail

00:11:12.209 --> 00:11:17.029
throughout all four lobes, so brain damage
to different areas will cause very different

00:11:17.029 --> 00:11:17.410
results.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:22.449
A lesion on a specific part of the temporal
lobe may destroy a person's ability to recognize

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:27.800
faces; traumatic memories or overactive hormones
can profoundly affect our behavior and emotions

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.600
- all of which remind us how fundamentally
biology and psychology are intertwined. And

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.889
there are few more fascinating examples of
this than how we sense and perceive the world

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:39.380
around us, so that's where we're gonna pick
up next week.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.970
For now, if you were paying attention, you
learned the basics of the central nervous

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:48.649
system, specifically the brain, which can
be understood in terms of old or of more evolutionary

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:53.589
ancestral structures, along with the limbic
system, and new structures, which include

00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:55.800
lobes, cortices, and association areas.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.490
