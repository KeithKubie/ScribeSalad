00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540
know exactly how you count the hours but
 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.110
know exactly how you count the hours but
many of our hours are screened as

opposed to physical I mean the screen is
 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.120
opposed to physical I mean the screen is
physical but it's some virtual thing and

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.130
physical but it's some virtual thing and

in some sense we live in a cocoon almost
 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.090
in some sense we live in a cocoon almost
a projection at this point you know

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.100
a projection at this point you know
 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.020
a projection at this point you know
we're still here but we in terms of what

that's good or bad I'll leave to one
 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.520
that's good or bad I'll leave to one
