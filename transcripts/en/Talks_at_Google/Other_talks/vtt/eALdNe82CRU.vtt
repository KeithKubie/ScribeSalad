MALE SPEAKER: So welcome
to Talks at Google,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.720
to this afternoon we're
very thrilled to host

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.430
Greg Ferenstein, who is a
former political journalist

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.730
for TechCrunch, where,
among his other skills,

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.960
he taught mathematics to
journalists, which is always

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.430
an important thing to do.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.990
And he's here
speaking to us today

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.560
about his latest thesis,
which arose out of some Medium

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.780
posts and some articles for
TechCrunch, "Silicon Valley's

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.670
Political End Game,"
so this strange mixture

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.460
of libertarianism and
progressivism we have here.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.460
And what does that mean?

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.590
Where is it going?

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.070
How does it impact the local
and national issues we face?

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.560
So with that, please join me
in welcoming Greg to Google.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.060
Thanks.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.880
GREGORY FERENSTEIN:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.070
I think I kind of want
to thank you guys,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.520
because I think 70% of all
of my internet experience

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.280
is at Google itself--
Google Docs, Google,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.540
Google Maps, everything.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.260
My internet experience
and digital life

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.310
is basically Google.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.239
So thank you.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.750
I appreciate it, guys.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.790
In 1981, the "Ottawa Citizen"
newspaper reported on a story

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.890
from a University of
Carelton professor

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.630
who claimed that if "teachers
don't stand up to the growing

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.020
invasion of computers
in the classroom,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.700
there's a good
chance that literacy

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.000
will disappear in 10 years."

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.280
Obviously, these were
not prophetic words.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.690
When I first began researching
the politics and philosophy

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.200
of breakthrough innovators,
I started with what I knew

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.020
wasn't.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.080
And I knew it wasn't pessimism.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.230
You would dedicate
your life to trying

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.520
to improve the future if you
thought the outlook was bleak.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.580
And indeed, when I then
began systematically

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.230
to interview
breakthrough innovators

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.060
about their philosophy,
what was core to them,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.430
first and foremost,
above all else,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.770
they describe
themselves as optimists.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.449
We're working with two
different devices here.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.620
Wikipedia founder,
Jimmy Wales, "I'm

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.070
a pathologically
optimistic person."

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.262
Mark Zuckerberg,
"I'm an optimist.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.220
I think you need to be,
to be an entrepreneur."

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.490
"I may be the most
optimistic person I know.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.440
I mean I'm incredibly
optimistic.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.380
I'm optimistic,
arguably, to a fault,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.000
especially in terms of new
idea," Marc Andreessen.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.440
Steve Jobs, "I'm an
optimist in the sense

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.590
that I believe humans are noble
and honorable, and some of them

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.830
are really smart.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.340
I have a very optimistic
view of individuals."

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.610
At first, I dismissed
this optimism

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.240
as just kind of like hippie
frou-frou Silicon Valley.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.970
But then I learned
this optimism was just

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.450
a rhetorical wrapper around very
specific business strategies

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.452
and political policies.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.220
The motivation
originally behind this

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.600
was that technologists,
all of a sudden,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.620
are becoming very influential,
at least according to "Forbes."

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.310
Over 80% of billionaires on
the Forbes 400 list under 40

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.580
come from technology.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.250
So whatever these
folks believe is

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.159
going to exert an extraordinary
amount of influence

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.825
over the future.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.220
So I wanted to answer
three questions.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.250
One, does the optimism of
information technologists

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.430
have a unique worldview?

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.180
Is it just that they're
good at technology

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.670
and they happened
to do politics,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.820
or are they somehow combined?

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.370
Does this worldview help
them make technology?

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.370
That is, is there something
about their politics

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.970
and their vision
for the future that

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.380
is behind and almost
a prerequisite

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.860
for billion-dollar ideas?

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.850
And the last is,
is this worldview

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.970
shared by just a small number
of very rich and very successful

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.880
people, or is it part of a
broader political movement?

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.470
The answer to all of
these, I think, is yes.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.330
And because I'm
attention deficit

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.760
and I assume my
audience is too, I

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.564
will just go ahead and tell
you my thesis before I go on

00:04:17.564 --> 00:04:18.439
with the explanation.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.830
The world has
gotten more complex.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.570
As a result, it's given rise
to the knowledge economy.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.720
The knowledge
economy has empowered

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.600
a novelty-seeking
personality that

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.200
has an extreme optimism
in information alone

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.370
to solve problems.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.770
This is built on a
growing demographic

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.060
of college-educated,
urbanized professionals, who

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.540
represent an entirely
new political category.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.895
They are pro-government
and pro-market

00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:52.520
but believe the
government's role isn't

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.040
to regulate capitalism, but
to invest in capitalism,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.790
to accelerate change
by investing directly

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.570
in citizens to be more educated,
entrepreneurial, and civic.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.050
If you take away nothing
else, very simple, betting

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.750
that information
will make the future

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.740
has become a very
profitable belief system.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.430
And that essentially
is why optimists

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.530
will inherit the earth.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.730
The rest is explanation.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.630
So starting with
the first question,

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.640
what do these folks believe?

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.400
The best explanation
actually came

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.380
from the patron of this
organization, Eric Schmidt.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.280
He said, "there's a particular
religion that we all represent,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.420
and it goes something like this.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.330
If you take a large
number of people

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.240
and you empower them
with communication tools

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.630
and opportunities to be
created, society gets better.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.240
The combination of empowerment,
innovation, and creativity

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.760
will be will be our solution.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.310
And that is a religion
in-of-itself."

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.310
So the folks who make
breakthrough technologies

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.770
and help them along
are cognizant that they

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.940
have a distinct world view.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.490
So when I delved deeper into
Eric's and other people's idea

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.340
that somehow citizens,
just through empowerment,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.050
could make the world
a better place,

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.390
I found that their philosophy
was founded on two main ideas.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.550
First, as Reid Hoffman
told me, "if you're

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.440
working towards
progress, your future

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.480
will be better
than your present."

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.010
That is change is
inherently good.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.940
The very nature of change
makes things better.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.610
Now, change can often be
bad over the short term.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.640
You can have a bad
20 or 30 years even.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.320
But eventually, if
you just keep trying,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.110
if you just keep
changing and disrupting,

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.730
eventually things get better.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.390
This is the first
tenant of optimism,

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.810
or at least described
by Silicon Valley.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.790
So then I took
what I was learning

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.550
from Reid Hoffman and
other folks, and I said,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.510
is this just the very
wealthy in Silicon Valley,

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.790
or is it technologists
more broadly?

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.200
So I'm a former writer for a
tech blog called TechCrunch.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.920
They have a database of every
single startup founder ever.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.130
I found their email addresses
and randomly emailed

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.910
them to take a battery of
40 political psychology

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.170
questions, which
became what I think

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.190
is the first representative
political opinion poll of what

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.380
Silicon Valley believes.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.600
And I peppered them with
some of these statements.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.270
Indeed, when you ask, is change
inherently good or productive

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.370
over the long term,
80% of tech founders

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.560
say yes-- near unanimity.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.670
That number is unheard of in
political opinion polling.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.670
You rarely get numbers that big.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.850
When I compare
that same question

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.240
to a survey done of the general
population, only 48% of people

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:57.220
agreed that change inherently
over the long run is good.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.536
Now, this gets into why
the Valley's generally

00:08:00.536 --> 00:08:02.910
kind of considered libertarian--
this kind of free market

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.010
ideology, anything goes.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.110
Let's change as
quickly as possible.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.110
When you compare tech
founders with Libertarians

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.080
and Democrats, they
look like Libertarians

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.930
on a couple big issues.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.027
They're not as big a
fans of labor unions.

00:08:17.027 --> 00:08:19.110
They tend to believe that
labor unions, especially

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.680
teachers unions, tend to
protect the status quo

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.970
and prevent organizations from
experimenting and piloting

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.140
new things and moving into
the future very quickly.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.960
So about 29% of
tech founders think

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.179
that labor unions are
good for the economy,

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.309
and 21% of Libertarians.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.700
On the flip side,
they're radically

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.320
pro-free trade-- NAFTA, TPP.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.650
They want capitalism everywhere.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.950
And that's where this myth that
the Silicon Valley is generally

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.010
Libertarian comes from.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.600
That would be true, except for
the fact that Silicon Valley,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.080
as a whole, is arguably the
most liberal industry on planet

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.180
Earth.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:04.070
83% of donations in the
2012 presidential election

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.170
from top tech firms, like
Google, Facebook, and Amazon,

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.200
went to Obama
versus Romney-- 83%.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.170
If you look at all
donations back to 2008

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.090
from every single tech
founder and investor,

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.380
63% went to Democrats.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.450
In my survey of tech
founders, about 7%

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.830
identify as Republican.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.120
So clearly, if we
want to understand

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.550
what tech founders
and Silicon Valley

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.800
believes, thinking that
they're Libertarian

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.110
was missing something.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.880
Why are they such a big fan
of the Democratic party?

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.330
And this I learned,
when a Libertarian icon

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.930
in the Senate, Rand
Paul, announced

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.380
his presidential candidacy
and came to San Francisco.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.784
And he got up on stage.

00:09:48.784 --> 00:09:49.700
He was really excited.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.704
He wanted to warm up the
crowd, and he led with this.

00:09:53.704 --> 00:09:54.550
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:59.085
-Is there anybody out here from
the leave-me-alone coalition?

00:09:59.085 --> 00:10:00.023
Not that many.

00:10:00.023 --> 00:10:01.097
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:01.097 --> 00:10:02.180
GREGORY FERENSTEIN: Right?

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:07.120
He said, is anyone out here from
the leave-me-alone coalition?

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.600
No one clapped, and
it was really awkward.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.420
Leave me alone, get
government out of my life

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.360
is central to the
Libertarian philosophy.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.184
And yet it was not
popular in San Francisco.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.240
This led me to do
some more questioning.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.850
So one of the central
tenants of Libertarianism

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.780
is that there is a
conflict between government

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.030
and citizens.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.790
On the flipside,
Democrats tend to believe

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.710
that there's a conflict between
citizens and big corporations.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.850
The richer corporations
get, the less citizens have.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:50.890
Tech founders, as a
group, overwhelmingly

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.190
believe that there's is no
conflict between business,

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.270
corporations, or citizens.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:01.240
At 61%, they say everyone
has a role in society,

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.440
and they can all work
together, compared to just 20%

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.050
of the public.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.170
They have an optimism
that collectivism

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.090
and interdependence is possible.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.740
When I dug deeper
into that theory,

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.295
I learned that a popular term
in the Valley is what's called

00:11:19.295 --> 00:11:22.940
"non-zero sum economy--"
a non-zero sum economy.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.694
The idea that you can build
things that benefit people.

00:11:25.694 --> 00:11:27.610
Even if some people
benefit a little bit more,

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.910
you raise the tide for everyone.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.120
The core of this
popular non-zero sum

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.080
meme in Silicon
Valley is that what

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.320
is good for you is good for me.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.620
What is bad for you
is also bad for me.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.590
So I asked this question,
does everything people

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.510
do, including their
personal decisions,

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.520
like whether to be
educated or eat healthy,

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.980
affect enough other
people to justify

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.920
government intervention?

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.980
A near majority, 49% of
founders believed that.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.860
Only 20% of Libertarians
and 60% of Democrats.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.020
That is they think
interdependence

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:15.120
is part of society,
that we are connected.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.580
And so now we have a working
definition of optimism.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.430
There is always
a better solution

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.033
that benefits more people.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.470
I think most reasonable
people, at this point,

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.960
would be asking
themselves, what is

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.180
the connection between
technology and politics?

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.332
You've shown me a
lot of correlations.

00:12:39.332 --> 00:12:42.830
But what do the two have
to do with each other?

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.570
I kind of want to
make the case to you

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:52.530
that technology is if not
mostly political, inherently

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.700
political.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.970
If you build a missile,
you build it for a reason.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.140
You're trying to
protect the country.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.970
Hawkish people, who are
fearful of other countries

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.850
or terrorists, build
military technologies.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.840
If any of you guys
know any Bitcoin folks,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.990
the anonymous
crypto currency that

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.290
is an alternative to
money, the community

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.600
started out hyper Libertarian.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.830
They wanted to free the
economy from the confines

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.740
of the government and its
control over the cash supply

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.730
So what I did is I
found a way to predict

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.870
someone's political ideology
from the products they built.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:37.350
I looked at every single public
political donation, Federal

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.820
Elections Commission, and I
matched that to tech founders.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.090
And I found that,
indeed-- you might have

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.760
troubles reading the slide.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.070
But this is the
political orientation

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.760
grouped by startup category.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.130
If you work in finance,
in cyber security,

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.370
you're more likely to
be a hawkish Republican

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.820
or a Libertarian, which is
kind of what we thought.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.510
The most liberal category
in all of startup land,

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.840
or one of them,
social networking.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.560
Why is that the case?

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.030
Why is a social network
political at all?

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.660
And that's what I
find fascinating,

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.450
because the actual
politics of Silicon

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.170
Valley and technologists
and tech workers

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.890
are so distinct from our
traditional categories,

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.850
we don't even recognize
that a social network has,

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.960
in fact, a policy analog.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:37.120
The way I want to show you that
is the differences between My

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.810
Space and Facebook.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.000
If you can remember all the
way back in internet history,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.050
back to 2006, My Space
was king of kings.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.890
And they had an idea
that social networking

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.310
was about expression.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:54.470
On the left here, you
see-- or it's you're right.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.669
You see a My Space page.

00:14:55.669 --> 00:14:56.960
You could do whatever you want.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.084
You could make it annoying.

00:14:58.084 --> 00:15:00.000
You could have auto play music.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.130
My Space didn't care.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.210
They encouraged this.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.340
When pornographic
stars were kicked off

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.160
of earlier social networks,
they invited them on My Space.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.530
Do whatever you want.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.855
It is a Libertarian
expression paradise.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.430
And the culture of
their users ate it up.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.800
There was a phrase that went
viral, before we kind of knew

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.875
what viral meant, in 2006
on My Space that said,

00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:27.120
"don't judge me."

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.840
This is what people plastered
all over their profiles.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.800
It was so popular
that it spawned

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.440
its own kind of gaudy t-shirt
and like rhinestone, the

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.230
Don't Judge Me t-shirt line.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:46.240
Zuckerberg and co had
a different philosophy.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.870
Zuckerberg said,
"on My Space people

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.130
got to do whatever they
wanted on their profile.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:54.020
We always thought
people would share more,

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.980
if we didn't let them
do whatever they wanted,

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:00.660
because we gave
them some order."

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.000
Facebook had a North Star.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.090
Sheryl Sandberg,
"Mark really does

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.490
believe very much
in transparency

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.130
and the vision of an open
society and an open world,

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.317
and so he wants to
push people that way."

00:16:12.317 --> 00:16:14.150
So one of the early
things that Facebook did

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.060
was they did auto
tagging of photos,

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.450
and they eventually turned
that into the newsfeed.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.660
And if you remember, there
was a massive backlash.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.220
Zuckerberg personally
had to make

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.405
a statement on the
front page of Facebook,

00:16:25.405 --> 00:16:26.530
or in people's [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.622
He's like, I get it.

00:16:27.622 --> 00:16:28.830
You're worried about privacy.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.150
You're worry about
what's going on.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.320
But we have this
vision for the world,

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.190
and we're going to continue
doing the newsfeed.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.670
And we're going
to continue trying

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.040
to push people to
share more information,

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.180
because he believed--
and this is often

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.284
made fun-- that just getting
people to share cat videos

00:16:42.284 --> 00:16:43.700
or what they're
doing at a wedding

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.970
or what they believe
or an article, just

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.610
sharing information was a way to
make the world a better place.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.840
Doesn't seem very political.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:59.370
We know it is because one
of Facebook's first users

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:05.829
was this guy, Harvard University
Professor Robert Putnam.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:10.220
Putnam became famous for
this idea of social capital.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.670
It's a theory that says
the best way to improve

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.930
the governance of a city,
to make people healthier,

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.430
to make economies more equal,
to make the bureaucracy more

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.819
efficient is simply to
get people to hangout more

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.940
on an informal basis--
bowling leagues,

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.510
book clubs, rotary clubs.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:33.320
He found this in a
25-year-long study of Italy.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.870
And he wanted to know why
some sections in the north,

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.940
like Amelia, were
much more prosperous

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.750
and equal and healthy.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.690
And after 25 years of
studying every variable

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.630
in political science, he
found one simple pattern.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.440
In the north, there
was more community.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.670
Specifically, people
just hung out more.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.640
That simple fact
of Northern Italy

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.922
made them a much better society.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.120
And now governments around the
world-- sometimes with the UN--

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.420
it is a policy, a public policy,
to get people to hang out

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.600
more on an informal basis.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.770
Social capital as
a political theory

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.170
has been replicated
dozens of times, sometimes

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.160
experimentally.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.294
They find out if you
share informal things,

00:18:21.294 --> 00:18:24.390
things get better.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:30.900
Facebook was the technological
manifestation of that policy,

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.300
and a rather optimistic
policy at that.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.440
You want the world
to get better?

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.550
Just have people talk more.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.910
Ultimately, it's an
informational philosophy.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.770
People share information
about government services

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.400
or what people are doing wrong
or right in their neighborhood,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.570
and they also exchange empathy.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:51.897
They get to know each other.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.890
So if Silicon Valley
represents an entirely new

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:06.060
political category,
people often ask me,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:12.330
what does this look like in
an actual policy, modern day?

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.330
Google's backyard,
San Francisco.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.000
One of the distinct
beliefs that I learned

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.940
about Silicon Valley
was they believed

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:27.630
that cities, bringing people
to cities, was a moral good.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.560
Often the San Francisco
housing crisis

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.919
is often kind of couched
in terms of tech people

00:19:34.919 --> 00:19:36.460
just wanting cheaper
rent, and Google

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.532
not having that have to pay
higher salaries because that's

00:19:39.532 --> 00:19:40.990
the only way that
their workers can

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.766
afford to live close to campus.

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:45.140
And if you're not familiar
with the San Francisco housing

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.330
crisis, although I
assume most folks in here

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.460
are-- or the Bay Area
housing crisis, for those

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.710
watching online--
only 8% of housing

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.760
is now affordable
in San Francisco

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.250
because the city has tried
to protect its suburbs

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.270
and won't allow buildings
to get taller or more dense.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:04.070
They've just
literally restricted

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.240
a lot of dense buildings.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.990
Even if you can't buy
a home, median rents

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.480
have skyrocketed
about $4,000 a month.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.590
Thousands of people have
been evicted from their homes

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.040
from landlords who
see that they can now

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.980
sell a relatively inexpensive
home for over $1 million or $2

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.380
million.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.000
So as a result, you have
this massive conflict

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.080
between technologists and some
renters who want to build more,

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.824
and critics who say that
Google and tech companies

00:20:34.824 --> 00:20:37.240
and the rest of the creative
class that are coming in just

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.365
want to take over the city.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:48.170
For 6,000 years of
technological history,

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:53.680
cities have been the birth place
for information technology.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:21:01.800
Writing likely happened around
the time of Mesopotamia,

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:07.040
when people gathered for the
first time in such large groups

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.140
that they began to
have grain surpluses,

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.550
and they couldn't account
for what everyone had.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.590
So they had cuneiform
tablets, and they

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.020
made little tick marks.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.060
And that's how they
were able to keep track

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.430
of who had what food and items.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.970
Complexity,
especially in cities,

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.650
is the birthplace of many
information technologies,

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.450
and it's been that
way for 6,000 years.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.570
So to believe in
cities isn't just

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.220
to believe you
want cheaper rent,

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.870
is to believe that
one of the best

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:40.085
things you can do for humanity
is to bring them to cities.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.730
This is what San Francisco looks
like as an affordable city.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:54.510
That's a simulation I did based
on econometric estimates of San

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.420
Francisco with almost double
the housing stock it has now--

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:02.140
200,000 more units.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.630
Now we know that,
I think-- well,

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.910
I've made the case that
information technologists,

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.300
Silicon Valley, and
urbanized professionals

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.530
have a distinct
political category.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.151
And we know what it kind
of looks like in policy.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.620
The title of the talk
is "Why Optimists Will

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:26.440
Inherit the Earth."

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.870
It turns out that
the dividing line,

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.400
at least within the
Democratic Party,

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.640
over people who are more
optimistic about change,

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.590
a little bit more
collectivist in orientation,

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.370
a bigger fan of free
trade, and investment

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.300
orientation of
government happens

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.750
to be college education.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.120
The more college
educated you are,

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.340
the more you tend to
believe in this philosophy.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.950
Over the last decades,
if you can see the slide,

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.770
the share of people voting
in Democratic elections,

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.890
or presidential elections
that are Democrats,

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:03.340
are college educated
have grown a lot

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.950
and are now the
majority of voters.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.580
This radically
altered the leadership

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.080
of at least one party.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:18.720
The picture you see above
is congressional leadership.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.990
So the blue areas represent
leaders in Congress

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.820
who were at one time
very popular, measured

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:30.876
by when they introduce a bill,
a lot of their colleagues sign

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:31.376
on.

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:34.650
It used to be Union County--
the middle of the country.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:39.020
But as urbanized professionals
and college educated people

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.900
went to the cities, it split.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.730
30 years later, the leadership
is now on the coasts,

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.410
think Nancy Pelosi in San
Francisco, Hillary Clinton

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.252
in New York.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.510
This is how systematically the
people who are most optimistic

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.430
built technologies.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:01.780
They made some money.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.020
They wanted to move to cities.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:08.060
They became a majority of
voters and large donors.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.710
And at least in one
party, it is now

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:14.020
shifted more towards
that orientation,

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.742
towards a more investment
orientation of government.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.600
I'll leave why I
think it's going

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.560
to be the most influential.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.850
This is a map of every
major information

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:35.194
technology ever invented,
all the way back

00:24:35.194 --> 00:24:35.985
to the Macedonians.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.260
When I began studying the
history and the philosophy

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.820
of those who invented
big technologies,

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.610
they sounded like
Silicone Valley folks.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.720
Socrates, who, with
Plato and Aristotle,

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.400
invented the academy, some of
the first official schooling,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.980
said, there is only
one good, knowledge,

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.830
and one evil, ignorance.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:09.570
Socrates was killed
for that belief.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.520
Centuries later,
Charles Babbage,

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.820
who created one of the first
programmable computers,

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.860
said, knowledge is power.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.100
Babbage wasn't killed, but
he wasn't a very wealthy man,

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.912
and the government,
at the time, decided

00:25:23.912 --> 00:25:25.120
not to invest in the project.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.590
They didn't see any
future for a computer.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.460
Sean Parker, founding
president of Facebook,

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.480
told me it's the hacker
ethic that a lot of problems

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.994
in the world are
information inefficiencies.

00:25:39.994 --> 00:25:40.952
And he's a billionaire.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:49.050
The growing complexity
of the world

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:53.350
will, for the first
time in human history,

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:59.220
allow this very ancient
ideology to become

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:05.860
either the most powerful or
a very powerful influence

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.880
over the world.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.022
And that is where optimists
will inherit the earth.

00:26:12.022 --> 00:26:13.480
MALE SPEAKER:
Through your research

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.650
and through your
interviews, is it

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.320
a matter of the sort of big
voices carrying the most

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:19.820
weight?

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.690
I'm thinking of the folks
who want to split California

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:26.870
into six different states--
the Libertarian paradise to be

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.200
established in
international waters.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.750
How does that impact
the studies you

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.590
found with the overall
progressive mentality

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.930
of the Silicon Valley?

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.060
GREGORY FERENSTEIN:
So I don't know

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.230
where the myth that Silicon
Valley was Libertarian

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.600
came from.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.410
I suspect it fit into
a kind of narrative,

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:49.410
speaking as a writer.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.010
It was easy to say,
OK, these folks don't

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.030
like government regulation.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.540
And they're big
fans of capitalism.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.190
And they also like money.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:03.610
Therefore they must
be Libertarian.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.570
And so these kind of
like weird projects,

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.210
like trying to split
California into six states

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.580
or create a floating city
of the coast of California

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.300
that doesn't have any US
government regulation,

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.890
it fit into that narrative.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:22.980
And so it was given an
outside voice in the press.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.960
What you didn't
see was, in fact,

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.100
that almost all donations
from top tech companies

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.050
go to Democrats in
presidential elections.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:33.890
So I think what happened was it
was just the media picking up

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.680
on a narrative that wasn't true.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.280
AUDIENCE: To what
extent do you think

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.380
people are fooling
themselves about knowledge

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.260
and what they really
consider knowledge?

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.510
Like there's a lot
of knowledge in, say,

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.760
the third world that probably
isn't thought about very

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.330
much in Silicon Valley.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.260
There's knowledge that
is not optimistic,

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.810
say unions are seen
as like complaining.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.620
So that knowledge seems
to get discounted.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.460
I think knowledge here
is seen as optimism

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.050
and seen as knowledge that's
around Silicon Valley.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.540
Do you think that's true?

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:09.310
Do you think that the knowledge
is really narrower than really

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.660
all knowledge, I guess?

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.020
GREGORY FERENSTEIN: Well, I
think, just philosophically,

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.837
the idea that most
folks, when they

00:28:15.837 --> 00:28:17.920
start a company or at least
information technology

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.894
companies, they have this
kind of general theory

00:28:20.894 --> 00:28:23.310
that whatever knowledge they're
putting out into the world

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:25.750
somehow makes it better.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.110
In the case of
Facebook, they believe

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.910
that people sharing information
and pictures of their family

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.502
would create more
connections between people.

00:28:34.502 --> 00:28:35.710
People would develop empathy.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.320
We would be a more bipartisan
nation, things like this.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.530
When it came to Twitter,
the founders of Twitter

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.450
told me that it started out
as kind of like an information

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.780
broadcasting service, where one
of the founders was on a BART.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.300
And if he experienced
an earthquake,

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.730
he would want to let everyone
know that he was OK, right?

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.760
So when I say
information, it's tackled

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:06.270
like one product at a time,
and it's one bill at a time.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:11.280
So the idea of cities building
very dense and tall cities,

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.920
the idea is that you can invite
people of all income brackets

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.900
into the same area.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.250
They can enjoy the same
schools and job opportunities.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:22.000
And you can invite smart people
from all over the country

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.275
to work in the most
productive companies.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.790
I mean, I'm using knowledge
kind of writ large,

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.314
but it's tackled one policy,
one product at a time.

00:29:32.314 --> 00:29:34.105
I don't know if that
answers your question.

00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:35.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:37.360
But just to pick up on
the city, so the idea

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.450
is people could all
come together in a city.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:44.070
But the actual reality is
the rentals have gone up,

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:47.010
and so it's people
have to leave the city,

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:49.470
and it's becoming more of
a monoculture in that sense

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:50.390
and in some way.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.556
GREGORY FERENSTEIN: And
that's because San Francisco

00:29:52.556 --> 00:29:54.990
systematically refuses
to build more housing.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.515
More people could live here,
if it was denser and taller

00:29:57.515 --> 00:29:58.890
and you could
build faster, there

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.760
wasn't as much
regulation around.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.150
That would solve, I think,
that monoculture problem.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:09.041
Seattle, the New York
area, much more diverse,

00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:10.540
because a more
diverse set of people

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.150
can afford to live there.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.920
And that's why solving the
San Francisco housing crisis

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.930
is very core to the technology
political philosophy.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.890
And I will just say this--
thank you for bringing that up--

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:29.790
that if you're interested
in solving the crisis,

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.710
you can go to
affordableSanFrancisco.com,

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:35.340
and I am going to be
helping out with others

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.340
who are doing campaigns to
actually introduce legislation

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.760
that allows San Francisco
to become denser and taller

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.350
and build more quickly.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:47.200
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
the non-zero sum game

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.220
outlook of technologists.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:54.920
And for things like material
benefit, health care,

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.340
that is absolutely true.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.940
But for political power,
there is a fixed amount

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.650
of political decision making
which happens in the world.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:08.080
And disparity in political
agency is growing as well.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.540
This has been complained about
by both the Bernie Sanders

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.200
supporters and the
Donald Trump supporters,

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.060
this growing populist
movement that

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.140
is saying they have no voice
in the governance of the world.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.980
How do you see the growing
power from the politics

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.810
of the technologists interacting
with this populist movement?

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.410
GREGORY FERENSTEIN: What I
see from the civic sector

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:34.120
of startups is trying
to empower more voices.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.720
So if you look at change.org,
Sean Parker's and Matt Mahan's

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.110
brigade, what
they're trying to do

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:46.000
is build technologies that
allow people with out much money

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.190
to influence politics.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:51.110
So change.org-- you don't
need to give any money.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.000
All you need to do
is sign a petition.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.820
And if enough people do that,
it gets media attention.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.230
Some people believe
that helped at least

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:04.240
influence the Boy Scouts
decision to accept LGBT scout

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.340
leaders.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.690
So I think it is the hope of
many people in Silicon Valley

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:15.890
that their technology will
distribute political influence

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:17.601
more evenly.

00:32:17.601 --> 00:32:19.100
AUDIENCE: What
happens when you talk

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.400
to people who are not in
Silicon Valley about this who

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.270
don't have a favorable view?

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.120
How do they react
to this philosophy,

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.742
and what do they think of it?

00:32:28.742 --> 00:32:31.200
GREGORY FERENSTEIN: So I think--
when I say Silicon Valley,

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.760
I mean kind of a cultural
movement, so broadly urbanized,

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.750
educated professionals.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.280
That's a lot of people.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:44.830
Not everyone agrees with it, and
everyone has their own issues.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.610
So traditional
Democrats, especially

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.900
out of like the
Bernie Sanders camp,

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.420
fear inequality of any type.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:59.330
They think if you are rich and
you're part of a tech company,

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.030
inherently what
you're going to do

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.474
is just try to empower yourself
and screw everyone else.

00:33:04.474 --> 00:33:06.140
And so what they want
to do is they want

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.130
to limit technology companies.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.290
They want to slow growth,
whether it's Uber and Lyft,

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:14.360
through regulations
and redistribute

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.560
like power and money.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.190
That's generally
the reaction I get.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.250
They do not believe,
or at least they

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.840
have a resistance
to believe, that you

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:27.100
can be a big corporation
or a widely used product

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.730
and be generally
good for most people.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.250
Power inherently corrupts.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.620
That's kind of the orientation.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.620
And against that, there's
not a lot you can say,

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.330
because to be a
popular tech product,

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.140
you need to be used
by a lot of people.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:44.620
To have it be sustainable, it
needs to make a lot of money.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.070
You can win them
over on some issues,

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.020
like housing in San
Francisco or education,

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.876
if you make education cheaper,
like Udacity and Coursera,

00:33:52.876 --> 00:33:54.750
top universities in the
world which were once

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.490
reserved for very wealthy
people who could afford Stanford

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:58.420
and Harvard.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.670
Now everyone can take
their classes for free.

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:04.080
So I think on some
issues you'll win

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.580
that crowd over--
philosophically probably not,

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.030
but on the issues, yes.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:11.874
I don't know if that
answers your question.

00:34:11.874 --> 00:34:15.520
AUDIENCE: What about rural
conservatives, same question?

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.704
GREGORY FERENSTEIN:
Rural conservatives--

00:34:19.704 --> 00:34:21.870
maybe just because I don't
have a lot of touch point

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:25.250
with rural conservatives,
but I haven't

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:29.400
seen a lot of complaints
from that camp.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.550
So I don't know.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.980
I have no idea.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.439
If I hear, like if someone
pings me on Twitter and says,

00:34:35.439 --> 00:34:36.480
I'm a rural conservative.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.830
I don't like you, then
I'll be able to engage

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:39.710
with that person.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.290
Or if anyone listening online
is a rural conservative,

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.889
email me, tweet at me.

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:45.130
We'll have a conversation.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:47.600
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
you based a lot of this

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.659
on this survey that you did.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:54.380
Now was there controls?

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.880
Because that's somewhat of
self-selection as to who

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.250
returns the survey.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.050
Perhaps it was just
all the Libertarians.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:01.500
Perhaps it was all Democrats.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.690
How did you do
controls for that?

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:07.340
GREGORY FERENSTEIN: Well, so you
can't do controls in a survey.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.950
All surveys-- all
political opinion

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:11.491
surveys-- unless you like strap
someone down and torture them

00:35:11.491 --> 00:35:14.970
until they answer questions,
are, by definition, voluntary.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:19.220
What you hope is that you get a
broad enough sample of people,

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.669
and that the people who answer
your question-- I guess what

00:35:22.669 --> 00:35:25.210
you hope is that the reason why
someone answers your question

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:28.220
is independent of their
political ideology.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.250
So if you believe that if you're
more Libertarian or culturally

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.730
conservative you're more
likely to answer any opinion

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.830
poll, than yes, it's a problem.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.220
Just speaking kind of broadly
about public opinion polling--

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.840
political opinion
polling-- I think

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.854
some surveys show
that conservatives

00:35:46.854 --> 00:35:48.520
are popular in some
states, and liberals

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.820
are popular in other states.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.290
So just answering a
survey seems to be

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.680
independent of your
political ideology.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.430
I tried to sample
enough founders.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.342
I sampled about 144.

00:35:59.342 --> 00:36:01.300
The margin of error was
about plus or minus 7%.

00:36:03.847 --> 00:36:05.930
AUDIENCE: I guess like
historically the Democratic

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:12.180
Party has, I think, of as like
having in mind the concerns

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.340
of working class people.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:18.070
And it seems like this new
movement within the party

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:22.720
seems like very meritocratic
and is OK with inequality.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.930
And how do you see
the future playing out

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:29.250
in terms of like kind
of the Bernie Sanders

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.412
camp of the Democratic
Party, I guess,

00:36:31.412 --> 00:36:33.120
and the people who
seem to be looking out

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.850
for the interest of
working class people

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.530
and the more
meritocratic side, that

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:40.060
seems to just want
to empower people

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:45.690
but may not look out for people
who are like super motivated

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.772
and driven to capitalize
on those opportunities?

00:36:48.772 --> 00:36:50.980
GREGORY FERENSTEIN: So that's
a really good question.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:51.810
I'm glad you asked it.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.060
I'm going to give it a little
bit of a lengthy answer.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.250
But I'll try to keep it short.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:37:01.147
So I once thought this ideology
was pretty tied to income.

00:37:01.147 --> 00:37:03.480
If you made a lot of money
and you were highly educated,

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.854
you tended to
believe this thing.

00:37:04.854 --> 00:37:06.630
I was wrong.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:11.460
I started doing surveys-- thanks
to the Google Surveys team

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.200
actually.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.250
They're great-- of gig economy
workers in San Francisco.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.560
I was able to filter
people who worked for Uber

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.330
and Lyft an InstaCart
and TaskRabbit.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:25.230
Gig economy workers
have a political profile

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.770
much closer to tech workers,
than people who tell me they're

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.500
in a union.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.690
This makes sense.

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.320
They have a more
entrepreneurial lifestyle.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.250
They are bigger fans of
high-skilled immigrants

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:41.740
like tech workers, because
high-skilled immigrants

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.770
help create the products
that give them a job.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.890
On presidential
candidates, they're

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:50.870
bigger fans of Hillary Clinton
than Bernie Sanders, who

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:54.560
potentially could be the
person to regulate technology,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.810
if he ever got to be president,
more so than Clinton.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:01.480
Because they live an
entrepreneurial existence,

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.400
they're more like tech
workers, and they need

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.868
a similar role for government.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.130
It turns out that
this has happened

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:11.350
before in Democratic history.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.310
The original
progressives, people

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:15.020
who called themselves
progressives

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:22.500
in the Democratic Party, go
all the way back to 1840.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.570
Originally, the Democratic
Party as a whole

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:25.854
was against free trade.

00:38:25.854 --> 00:38:28.270
This was before the United
States had much of a free trade

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:30.484
agreement at all.

00:38:30.484 --> 00:38:32.900
And when the government tried
to introduce more free trade

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.230
principles, the bill failed.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:39.770
When the new high-tech
industry of the time

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:43.820
in the 1840s, the railroads,
partnered with low-skilled farm

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.290
workers, who wanted to
sell their goods abroad,

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.400
they banded together a
high-skilled industry

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.360
and a low-skilled industry
to fundamentally change

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:57.330
America's economic stance
to the rest of the world.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:01.220
This is happening, I
believe, 150 years later,

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.820
with tech workers
and gig economy

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:07.044
workers, the same alliance
just different policies.

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.180
That was a long answer.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.860
Thank you.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:20.860
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering about
this urban versus rural theme

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.590
you have though, because I have
a feeling it's a little bit

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:29.170
too biased towards like high
density big cities and so on.

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.314
When you actually
look at the places

00:39:31.314 --> 00:39:33.480
where most of the major
innovations are coming from,

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.870
I think it's actually suburbia--
University campuses, suburbia,

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.920
and so on, and they're
not very dense.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.740
So like obviously
we're at Google.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.250
It's not that urban.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.880
If you look at the
other companies--

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.930
Facebook, all the
big heavy hitters,

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:53.580
like even recent ones-- WhatsApp
was Mountain View downtown,

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.908
I think.

00:39:55.908 --> 00:39:57.860
And if you go further
back, like if you

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.570
look at the history
of Silicon Valley,

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:04.420
IBM invented basically just
this corporate campus something

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.130
in the South Bay.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.420
And if you look
through the history,

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.500
my point is that cities
are not a prerequisite

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:15.580
for-- I mean dense,
high-density cities are not

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:21.140
a prerequisite and probably not
the best place to really move

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.010
the need with innovation.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:26.330
And San Francisco has
certainly some startups,

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.840
and I think the
scene has shifted

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.050
more toward San Francisco
in recent years,

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:32.780
but I'm not sure of the
cause and effect there.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.050
So maybe you can talk
about this a bit.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:37.258
GREGORY FERENSTEIN: No,
that's an excellent question.

00:40:37.258 --> 00:40:39.520
The idea is that especially
Silicon Valley, when

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.410
it started in the '60s and then
kind of grow, '70s and '80s,

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.990
tended to be a little
bit more suburban.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.280
So why are cities necessary?

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.510
So there's two
responses to that.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:56.740
One is, relatively
speaking, the Bay Area

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.667
is still extremely
dense, compared

00:40:58.667 --> 00:40:59.875
to the middle of the country.

00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:03.510
Where I'm from, Omaha,
Nebraska and the rest of these,

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.490
even though it
doesn't look as dense

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:08.310
because there's kind of
single family home houses,

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:10.490
there's a lot of them.

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:14.770
And no one really has
big yards here, right?

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:17.220
So compared to the rest of
the country and in New York

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.450
as well, still relatively dense.

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:26.820
The other argument is that
even if all of the invention

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.240
is kind of happening
in the outer suburbs

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:35.680
of major metropolitan regions,
a lot of the technologies

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:40.000
are built for folks living
in cities to solve city

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.760
problems-- Google Maps, right?

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.890
The idea that you
need to look at a map

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.300
because you don't know
where you're going

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.470
is a city phenomenon.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.219
When I lived in Omaha,
I didn't need a map.

00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:54.260
I knew where I was going.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.260
I went to basically the
same places every day.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.690
Airbnb-- the idea
that you would need

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.460
to sleep on someone's
couch-- one,

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.860
there would be
enough couches, B,

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.609
there would be that
many people to support

00:42:06.609 --> 00:42:11.381
an entire industry only
happened because of cities.

00:42:11.381 --> 00:42:13.130
So a lot of the new
technology, especially

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.120
the sharing economy--
Craigslist-- all

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.355
happened because there was so
much complexity and so much

00:42:18.355 --> 00:42:20.980
stuff in the system that someone
needed to simplify it and help

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.660
people share resources.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.012
In small towns, you can
do that analog style.

00:42:25.012 --> 00:42:25.970
You just know everyone.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:34.160
So that's generally why
cities are important.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.000
On the data side,
economics, there's

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.050
a Berkeley professor
named Enrico Moretti.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:42.380
He calculated that housing
restrictions in three cities--

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:47.450
San Jose, San Francisco, and
New York-- kneecaps national GDP

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:52.810
by 10%, because there's a lot
of talented coders in the world.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.740
If a coder in Oklahoma
can move to Mountain View

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.370
and work at Google, they're
are a lot more productive

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:02.365
than any company they're going
to work for in the Midwest.

00:43:02.365 --> 00:43:04.240
AUDIENCE: So with
something you said earlier,

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.620
kind of alluded to something.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:09.090
You don't really know that
many rural conservatives.

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:11.350
This is a growing trend.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.510
Not the not knowing of
rural conservatives,

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:19.320
but the ideological
purity of social groups.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.510
Social networks
are growing larger,

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:25.340
but they are becoming
described as echo chambers.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.450
Do you see this is
a trend which is

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:31.960
related to the technologists
continuing, declining?

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.060
What do you see the future
path of the composition

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.030
of social groups
and how it relates

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.177
to what you talked about?

00:43:38.177 --> 00:43:40.760
GREGORY FERENSTEIN: I would love
to be optimistic on this one.

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.160
I am not.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:46.080
I do believe that ultimately
people who are optimistic

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.500
are going to shape the future.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.120
Hence the presentation.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.880
By the internet is a
very large echo chamber.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:44:00.650
If you look at-- let's just
take Donald Trump supporters.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:04.260
There are websites that cater
to them-- Breitbart.com,

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.175
to some extent the
blaze.com, Fox News.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.010
Even though they are incredibly
popular-- tens of millions

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:19.900
of readers, some of the
largest and most powerful news

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:24.010
organizations on the
internet-- they are rarely

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:26.355
quoted by mainstream
media-- "Washington Post,"

00:44:26.355 --> 00:44:29.990
"New York Times," and even some
of the more liberal outlets.

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:35.710
An entire movement was
built to elect a president,

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:40.020
and it was considered a joke by
most of the mainstream media.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.960
Not because they
necessarily disagreed,

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.130
but because they
had so little touch

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.848
with the other half
of the country,

00:44:45.848 --> 00:44:47.556
that they didn't even
realize it existed.

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.530
If we are to solve this
problem, we will likely

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:53.860
have to bridge those groups.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.900
I don't know how to do that.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.570
That said, still an optimist.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:00.200
MALE SPEAKER:
Well, on that note,

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.300
thank you very much for
speaking with us today,

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.790
and we look forward
to hearing more

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.210
about your research
in the future.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:07.293
GREGORY FERENSTEIN: Great.

00:45:07.293 --> 00:45:09.500
Thanks, guys, Thanks, internet.
