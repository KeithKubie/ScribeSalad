00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.460
Why Some Countries Drive on the Right and
Some on the Left

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.660
Have you ever wondered why some countries
drive on the left and others on the right?

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.540
Well, wonder no more.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.040
The origin of this practice varies based on
the time period and country, but primarily,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.850
throughout history, people used the “keep-left”
rule.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.000
Only very recently did the world predominately
switch to “keep-right”.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.460
The first real archaeological evidence of
a keep-left or keep-right type rule for a

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.570
road originates in the Roman Empire, which
shouldn’t be surprising as they built a

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.460
lot of massive, well-trafficked roads spanning
Europe and thus would have needed to establish

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.430
certain rules governing how people were to
interact on the roads.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.050
So which side did the Romans use?

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.280
Archaeological evidence suggests it was common
for the Romans to drive on the left side of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.280
the road.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.380
One confirmation of this was discovered in
1998 where a Roman quarry in Swindon, England,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.530
had grooves in the road going away from the
quarry on the left side that were significantly

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.190
deeper than those on the right, due to the
added weight of the stone.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.250
It is not precisely known why they would have
chosen this side, but it is probably similar

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.170
to one of the main reasons this practice continued
into the Middle Ages.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.630
During the Middle Ages, the roads weren’t
always very safe for travelers; meeting people

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.110
coming the other way on the road was something
best done defensively.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.030
From this, many historians believe the keep-left
rule was adopted because, on a horse, if you

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.560
were right-handed and you met some unsavory
company on the road, you could draw your weapon,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.430
typically attached to your left side, with
your right hand and bring it to bear quickly

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.880
against the person who is going the opposite
way of you on your right; all the while, controlling

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.440
the reigns with your left hand.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.110
Then of course, if you happened to meet a
friend on the road, you could more easily

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.990
offer your right hand in greeting without
needing to reach across your body when on

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.990
horseback.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.119
Back then, people on horseback typically ruled
the road, so everybody else followed suit.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.390
This keep-left rule was so common that in
1300 AD Pope Boniface VIII decreed that all

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.850
pilgrims headed to Rome, from wherever they
were coming from, should abide by the keep-left

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.420
rule of the road along their journey.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.310
This held across most of the Western World
until the late 1700s.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.829
The switch to the keep-right rule occurred
in the eighteenth century when teamsters in

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.039
the United States would drive large wagons
with a team of horses, as the name implies.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.159
These wagons tended to dominate the streets
and forced everybody else to abide by the

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.809
rule of the road the teamsters were using.

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:22.489
Very importantly, in many of those old, large
American wagons, they did not include a seat

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.090
on the wagon for the driver.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.049
Rather, the driver would typically sit on
the rear left most horse, when the driver

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.249
was right-handed.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.769
This allowed him to easily drive a whole team
of horses with a lash in his right hand.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.440
This forced the issue of having oncoming traffic
on your left as the drivers would want to

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.129
make sure that no part of their team or wagon
collided with oncoming traffic.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.760
When sitting on the rear left-most horse,
this was much easier to do when using a keep-right

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.980
rule of the road.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.840
Gradually, this system spread so that by the
late eighteenth century, the first laws concerning

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.340
this in the United States were passed, starting
in 1792 in Pennsylvania, where the rule of

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.510
the road was now officially a keep-right rule.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.620
This quickly spread throughout the United
States and Canada.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.780
So how did this spread through Europe?

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.389
It started with France.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.340
The reasons why the French switched to a keep-right
rule instead of the traditional keep-left

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.299
rule aren’t completely clear.

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.279
Some say it is because the French Revolutionists
didn’t want anything to do with something

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.659
that a Pope had decreed.

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.180
Others say it was because they didn’t want
to use the same rule of the road the English

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.180
used.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.620
Still others say it was entirely Napoleon’s
doing.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.959
The reasons why he may have done this, if
that is the case, are even more a matter of

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.849
pure speculation.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.900
Whatever the real reason, France switched
to the keep-right system.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.120
Napoleon spread this system throughout the
countries he conquered.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.379
Even after he was defeated, most of the countries
he had conquered chose to continue with the

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.829
keep-right system.

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.859
The most important of these countries, as
far as eventually further spreading the keep-right

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.639
system, was Germany.

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.430
Fast forward to the twentieth century and,
as Germany conquered countries in Europe,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.809
they forced their keep-right system onto those
countries.

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:03.299
England never adopted this method primarily
because massive wagons, as became common in

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.919
the United States, didn’t work well on narrow
streets, which were common in London and other

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.749
major English cities.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.219
England was also never conquered by Napoleon
or later Germany.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.759
Thus, they kept the classic keep-left rule
of the road that had endured for hundreds

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.139
of years before.

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.600
By 1756, this “keep left” rule was made
an official law in Britain, originally referring

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.030
to protocols when traveling over the London
Bridge.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.400
As the British Empire expanded, this keep-left
rule, as a law, also spread somewhat.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.270
This hasn’t endured in most of the former
British ruled countries, primarily thanks

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.759
to Germany and the growing popularity of the
keep-right system.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.479
There are still a few holdouts though, probably
the largest of which, by population, is India.

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.669
Although, if you’ve ever driven in most
regions of India, you’ll know that any supposed

00:04:49.669 --> 00:05:07.110
“rules” of the road are more just extremely
loosely followed guidelines.
