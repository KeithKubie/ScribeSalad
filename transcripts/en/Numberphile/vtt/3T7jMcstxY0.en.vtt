00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
So infographics are a way to present data in a visual way

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.680
and by doing so, hopefully to give us a better understanding of the data.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.100
And what I've got to show you today is what's been called

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.220
the greatest infographic of all time.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.360
Here it is, it was devised by a man called Charles Minard.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.680
He was a French civil engineer.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.980
He used to make infographics in his retirement.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:31.900
And this describes Napolen's disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.820
Through this infographic, you see, at the beginning of 1812

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.500
Napoleon's empire was at its height.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.160
He had, what, an army of size 422,000 men.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.960
Now, you can see the size of this army

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.820
by the width of this line.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.720
So here they are, they're in Kowno, it's in Lithuania.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.520
They're here and they decide to attack Russia.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.220
So they're going through Lithuania.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.640
They're going through Belarus.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.600
And they're going, moving onwards to Russia.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.320
They're trying to encounter the Russian army,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.300
but the Russian army, they keep falling back.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.840
That pushes the French army forwards.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.140
They keep being dragged forwards, then the Russian army fall back.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.540
And they're being dragged forwards again.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.840
As the Russian army fall back, they are burning villages down.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.460
They are burning the crops to prevent the French army from living off the land.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.080
So in that case the French have to live off the supplies they brought with them.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.340
To supply this large army,  it wasn't possible.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.540
There was starvation, people were drinking out of puddles,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.500
they were eating rotten food.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.480
People were going off-camp at night trying to find food.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.680
If they did, the Russians would find them, they would kill them.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.700
So we can see how many men they're losing by the way this brown line

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.900
is getting thinner, and thinner, and thinner.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.980
They're moving in to Russia, they're going up to here.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.700
They finally catch up with the Russian army just outside of Moscow.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.940
So now at this point they have only 127,000 men left.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.360
And this is the location of a great battle.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.900
A very bloody battle.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.680
So, at this battle they lost 27,000 men here.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.320
They started with 127,000 and then here, as they move on forward,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.460
you can see they now have 100,000 men.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.080
So we've got this step here that shows you that sudden decrease.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.540
The Russian army, they retreat, they disappear.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.760
And so Napoleon now can ride in to Moscow victorious.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.420
So he rides in to Moscow, with his 100,000 men.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.640
However, the Russians deny him his victory.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.380
They refuse to concede, they evacuate the town.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.780
The people who are left in Moscow are given orders to burn the place to the ground.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.660
So here they are in Moscow, and they are forced to go back.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.480
They've still got no supplies

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.060
They're still in their summer gear.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.360
It's now winter.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.320
Down here it tells you the temperature of that winter.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.000
A very cold winter

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.560
It goes down to minus 21 degrees C.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.900
And this is the black line showing them going back the way they came.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.420
You can see the number of men who are dying when it

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.840
gets thinner and thinner at these points.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.420
This is Charles Minard using the data that he got from historical documents.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.900
He's representing that data, these drops in numbers,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.360
using his black line here getting thinner and thinner.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.740
There are more men who died through starvation and disease, desertion,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.340
than died in all the battles combined.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.880
Now by the time they get to this river,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.740
they had a disasterous crossing.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.160
They started with 50,000 men.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.280
By the time they crossed this river, they only had, what is that?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.160
28,000 men.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.500
This not only does this tell us the temperature of that winter.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.080
Not only does it tell us how many men they were losing as they marched across.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.540
It also shows us other things, it shows us offshoots.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.800
As troops of men have offshoots, they go off somewhere else

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.260
and then they rejoin.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.700
So we can see here 60,000 men on the way to Moscow.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.120
60,000 men break off, they stay 'round here, they have their own problems here.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.020
33,000 men come back and join the retreating French army here.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.000
They rejoin so now you can see that this line does increase in size.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.740
Edward Tufte who's an expert in these infographics,

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.140
he described this infographic as six variables plotted,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.040
including the size of the army, its location on a two dimensional surface,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.780
the direction of the army's movement,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.680
the temperature at various dates during the retreat from Moscow,

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.880
and it's perhaps the best statistical graphic ever drawn.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.720
We're marching through Lithuania, Belarus.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.860
We're through, marching into Russia.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.580
We are encountering Russian armies, we're having a battle over here,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.500
a sudden drop in the number of men.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.560
We finally walk in to Moscow only to be disappointed.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.040
We have to return, we have no supplies, we have to return.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.740
We return back with this black line.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.940
As we return, death, famine, disease

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.920
follows us as we return.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.840
The men is decreasing and decreasing.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.440
We are not prepared, we don't have what we need.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.500
We do have a rejoin here of some men from, who have been waiting for us.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.380
But even there we try and cross this river; disaster again:

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.960
a sudden drop in men.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.560
Back the way we came, all the way to where we started in Lithuania.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:18.260
At the end we have 10,000 men, where we started with 422,000 men.
