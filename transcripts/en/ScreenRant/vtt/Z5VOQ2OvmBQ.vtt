00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.460
As video game releases continue to bring in
millions, or billions of dollars for major

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.530
publishers, movie studios are turning to video
game movies as their next big thing.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.410
But the ties between movies and games have
existed longer than most fans, or executives,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.070
probably realize.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.880
As you watch, let us know in the comments
below if we missed some movies that could

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.790
be inspired by your favourite games!

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.970
Here are ScreenRant’s Movies You Didn’t
Know Were Influenced By Video Games.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.250
Edge of Tomorrow

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.370
Tom Cruise gave a face to this sci-fi war
movie about a soldier reliving a day over

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.370
and over again, but the story started as a
Japanese comic series called "All You Need

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.609
is Kill."

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.019
The writer came up with the idea after noticing
how video games used death to train players,

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.429
turning them from beginners into veterans
- just like the movie's hero.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.499
If the video game ties weren't clear enough,
the idea for the movie's robotic exoskeletons

00:00:53.499 --> 00:01:01.059
was also introduced in Call of Duty: Advanced
Warfare - released just months later.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.059
District 9

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.580
A Halo movie is still just a dream, but when
Peter Jackson was producing the film back

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.340
in 2006, he saw Neill Blomkamp as the perfect
director for the project, who turned heads

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.900
by mixing CG creatures with lo-fi camerawork
and realistic sets instead of massive green

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.940
screen spectacle.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.940
When the movie plans were scrapped, Jackson
decided to produce Blomkamp’s District 9

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.890
instead, featuring alien creatures, conflicts,
weapons and action scenes torn right out of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.420
a first person shooter.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.840
The movie was based on one of the director’s
short film, but Blomkamp’s original goal

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.210
and similarities have led many to claim that
District 9 is as close a vision of Blomkamp’s

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.130
Halo movie as fans will ever see.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.430
Crank

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.670
No game series has taken as much heat as Grand
Theft Auto, embracing violence, destruction,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.050
and general carnage in the name of fun.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.140
The movie Crank took that dedication to heart
– literally – with a hero who needs to

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.850
keep his adrenaline pumping just to stay alive.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.580
The directors made the similarities to chaotic
gaming obvious, including nods to video games

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.230
throughout the movie, and even going completely
into the digital world in the film’s final

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.660
credits, putting star Jason Statham exactly
where his character belongs: a bullet-fueled

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.770
16-bit shooter.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.770
Zombieland

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.310
Pitting four survivors with a sense of humor
against an army of the undead made Zombieland

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:32.320
a hit, but one video game series was using
zombies for fun, not fear long before.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.080
The zombie shooter Left 4 Dead followed the
same formula, even shaping its campaign and

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.890
marketing to resemble a Hollywood film, but
fans soon turned the game into an online sensation,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.000
where hilarious kills were the top priority.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.350
Zombieland kept the sense of humor and tension,
and even “Kills of the Week” competitions

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.910
intact, not to mention a finale set in a zombie-filled
amusement park - a location included in Left

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.790
4 Dead 2, released shortly after the movie.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.940
Die Hard, Dredd &amp; The Raid

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.730
Modern game makers can dream up entire universes,
but games made in the ‘80s and ‘90s had

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.200
to rely on levels, and chains of boss battles
for success.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.910
Die Hard may be the most famous movie to actually
take the idea of fighting enemies from level

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.330
to level literally, but the original writer’s
idea for the story was basically a live-action

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.640
version of Elevator Action, a game released
just a few years earlier.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.050
Since then, movies like Dredd and The Raid:
Redemption have embraced the same structure,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.330
sending heroes up against gangs of enemies,
mini-bosses and one massive final battle to

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.330
achieve victory.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.330
The confined settings and levels may just
be a way of keeping a story simple, but the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.330
solution is one that game developers were
the first to really exploit.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.330
Pacific Rim

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.209
The story of giant mechs fighting giant monsters
pulled from decades of Japanese anime and

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.590
films, but director Guillermo del Toro didn't
copy any one movie when developing his own.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.350
But as a die hard gamer, it's no surprise
to see futuristic pilots in VR helmets working

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.170
in unison to launch special attacks, taking
on more and more difficult enemies.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.959
Del Toro even called on a star of the Portal
game series to supply the voice of his own

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.459
futuristic mechs.

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.709
Sucker Punch

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.990
Zack Snyder’s adventure of female warriors
was an original idea, but Sucker Punch took

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.790
its influences from 20th century warfare,
steampunk, Japanese mecha and anime as much

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.410
as any modern fantasy game.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.590
Whether it’s Nazi Zombies made famous by
Call of Duty, or mixing bullets and blades

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.539
with dragons and orcs like Final Fantasy and
too many RPGs to count, the source material

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:18.539
is clear.

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.040
Snyder stated that he wanted the movie to
be less chaotic than a video game, but the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.980
constant need to defeat waves of enemies or
steal key quest items was spotted by critics…

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.720
and their comparisons to one massive video
game adventure weren’t usually meant as

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.340
a compliment.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.600
Act of Valor

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.850
Some of the most popular and profitable video
games in history have followed elite soldiers

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.470
into battle, with the Call of Duty series
painting the picture of modern war for a generation.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.830
So when the minds behind Act of Valor turned
to REAL Navy SEALS, not actors to show audiences

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.830
what war really looks like, video games were
impossible to ignore.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.630
With millions of gamers experiencing combat
down the barrel of a gun, the directors made

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.560
sure to recreate that sensation in live-action.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.510
You could say that video games simply copied
the real tactics of the soldiers, but filming

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.190
and editing them to look like a game is something
else entirely.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.850
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.449
Did we miss any of your favorite films that
have video games to thank for their story,

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.940
characters, or action?
