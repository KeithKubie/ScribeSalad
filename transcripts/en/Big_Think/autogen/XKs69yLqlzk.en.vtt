in Africa human infants are incredibly

in Africa human infants are incredibly
 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.890
in Africa human infants are incredibly
helpless and it's very hard for one

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900
helpless and it's very hard for one
 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.750

person to take care of an infant and

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760

from predators and so having some sort

of core familial group makes lots of
 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.230
of core familial group makes lots of
sense and so there are evolutionary

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240
sense and so there are evolutionary
 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.370

psychologists and biologists who would
 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.130
psychologists and biologists who would
say we evolved a propensity for romantic

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140
say we evolved a propensity for romantic
 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.100
say we evolved a propensity for romantic
love to create families so that it's not

just the mother taking care of the child
 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.890
just the mother taking care of the child
but a father as well mothers have this

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900
but a father as well mothers have this

child comes from the mother has to feed

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030
child comes from the mother has to feed
 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.870
child comes from the mother has to feed
and breastfeed with the mother fathers

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880

are less inherently attached to the

are less inherently attached to the
 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.490
are less inherently attached to the
child and so there is a theory that

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500

males evolved this propensity to fall in

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180
males evolved this propensity to fall in
 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.449
males evolved this propensity to fall in
love so they would stick with their

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459

their partners

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830
 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.060
an evolutionary biologists would say

an evolutionary biologists would say
 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.440
an evolutionary biologists would say
yeah we have this propensity that's

yeah we have this propensity that's
 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.150
yeah we have this propensity that's
evolved that creates all of these
