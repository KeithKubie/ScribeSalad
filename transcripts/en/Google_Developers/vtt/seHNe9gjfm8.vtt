MODERATOR: Thank you
guys for joining us here

00:00:02.045 --> 00:00:05.700
at the second day of I/O at
the YouTube Distribute Space.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.170
And basically, we want to
get at one question here.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.380
Once you build a great product,
how do you get it out there?

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.780
We've talked so much about
design and development

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.030
in other I/O sessions.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.300
And that's what we
really want to get at,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.800
is once you've done those two
things, how do you distribute?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.340
I couldn't be more excited to be
joined by Victoria Ransom, who

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.090
is the co-founder of
Wildfire and this talk

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.500
is aptly called "How to Spread
Your Product like Wildfire."

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.350
We're big fan of puns here on
the YouTube team and at Google.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.440
So Victoria, before we dive into
details, why don't you tell us

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.323
a little bit about what Wildfire
is and how it got started.

00:00:39.323 --> 00:00:40.270
VICTORIA RANSOM: Sure.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.560
So Wildfire is a social
media marketing SAAS company.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.977
So basically, we have a suite
of tools that help companies

00:00:45.977 --> 00:00:48.268
with different aspects of
their social media marketing.

00:00:48.268 --> 00:00:50.740
So whether it's being able to
track what people are saying

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.260
about a brand and
respond to them,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.920
or track analytics to see
how they're performing

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.340
across different
social networks,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.620
creating engaging campaigns.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.245
It sort of like a one-stop shop
for your social media marketing

00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:02.100
needs.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.002
We started a company in
2008 actually because we

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:08.960
had our problem and we
were trying to solve it.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.790
So we had a travel
business at the time.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.470
We created a Facebook brand
page for that business.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.980
Immediately experienced
what I think

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.646
a lot of brands
experience, which is OK,

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:19.050
I created my fan page, now what?

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.700
I have no fans.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.890
They're not engaging.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.740
How do I spread the word?

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920
We wanted to give away
a free trip as a way

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.212
to drive engagement.

00:01:26.212 --> 00:01:28.170
Had to built a Facebook
application to do that.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.656
We felt like that
was going to be

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.030
a barrier, the entry for a
lot of small and medium sized,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.017
and it turn out, large
businesses as well.

00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:36.100
So rather than build
something just for ourselves,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.140
we build a really simple,
initially simple--

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.760
it grew over time-- application
for running these kinds

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.840
of engaging campaigns
on Facebook,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.210
initially and then we spread
to Google+ and YouTube

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.620
and Pinterest and others.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.120
So yeah.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.350
That was the initial idea.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.200
It grew like wildfire.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.920
So I've heard that pun before.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.060
And I guess when we got
acquired by Google in 2012

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.750
we were 400 employees, had
about 30,000 customers,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.170
and had grown a pretty
successful business.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.380
So we hit on a good idea.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.380
MODERATOR: That's right.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.830
And I want to-- I saw this
video when they announced

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.930
the Wildfire acquisition
to their entire team.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.590
And you almost announced it
as a surprise in this video.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.755
VICTORIA RANSOM: It was
a total surprise, yeah.

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:17.085
MODERATOR: And it almost
seemed like an episode

00:02:17.085 --> 00:02:18.240
of Oprah's "Favorite Things."

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.420
It was like everyone was
getting a gift and going crazy.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.620
And just-- it was one of
the most passionate videos

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.317
I've seen.

00:02:23.317 --> 00:02:25.025
So your team must have
been super excited

00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:26.110
about the acquisition.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.210
VICTORIA RANSOM: Yeah,
the team was great.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.140
We had a great team and
a great team culture

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.720
and then combining
that with people

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.855
being excited about
joining Google.

00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:31.730
MODERATOR: Of course.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.940
VICTORIA RANSOM: It was
a lot of excitement.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.690
MODERATOR: So let's
rewind a bit because I

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.520
think for a lot of I/O attendees
that maybe are developing

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.230
their own apps or starting
their own businesses, that's

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.900
the dream, to one
day be in a position

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.220
to successfully exit or be able
to grow such a big business.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.837
So who were some of your
first clients that you--

00:02:47.837 --> 00:02:49.420
You said you identified
the pain point

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.260
and how did you
bring on the clients

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.784
to develop the Wildfire platform
and get your product out there?

00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:55.700
VICTORIA RANSOM: Yeah.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.760
I mean I think initially,
we did whatever

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.260
we could bring the
first clients in.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.750
So getting those first
reference client,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.060
typically if you're a B2B
business like we were,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.350
is everything.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.310
So the first clients were
companies we got Kayak,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.760
we got Zappos.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.651
How did we get them?

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.650
Zappos, I knew a friend
of a friend of a friend.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.394
I dug until I could
get in the company.

00:03:17.394 --> 00:03:19.060
MODERATOR: And what
would you tell them?

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.630
Would you reach out with emails?

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.650
Or how would you?

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.440
VICTORIA RANSOM: Well,
you know what actually

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.960
did that was quite
effective back then is--

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.985
and as my co-founder over here,
he set a lot of these pages up.

00:03:27.985 --> 00:03:29.360
We would actually,
at that stage,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.401
it was so early with brand
pages, a lot of brands

00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:33.750
haven't even claimed their
brand pages on Facebook.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.789
So we'd go in and create a
brand page for a company.

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.080
And then we'd put a Wildfire
campaign on the brand page

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.810
because our product was so
easy, it took us five minutes

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.020
to create a campaign.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.100
And then we'd write
to them and say, "Hey,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.740
do you want to claim this Page?

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.590
And while you're at it,
you should use Wildfire."

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.630
So that was good hook.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.360
I mean, it was
very early on lead.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.280
But basically, we
used our network.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.166
The product was free
for those first clients.

00:03:57.166 --> 00:03:58.540
And then a little
bit later, when

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.956
we got a little
bit more traction,

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:02.350
we were able to
attract bigger brands.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.570
So actually Facebook was
one of our first clients.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.062
And we did a campaign
that we probably

00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:10.270
should have charged tens of
thousands of dollars for.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.150
We charged them I think $5,000.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.192
It was a token amount.

00:04:13.192 --> 00:04:15.400
We stayed-- I remember-- we
stayed up for pretty much

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.376
three nights in a
row getting it done.

00:04:17.376 --> 00:04:19.000
Once you have that
reference like that,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.630
then all the doors open.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.620
So I think we were scrappy
with us first clients,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.585
to get the references.

00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:27.960
And then later, we employed
a lot of marketing techniques

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.895
to really scale that.

00:04:28.895 --> 00:04:30.270
But those were
the first clients.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.730
MODERATOR: That's awesome.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.560
So you hit on something that
I think is so important.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.280
You didn't wait.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.770
You didn't stop and
think, OK, maybe

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.220
we should create a presentation,
talk about our product,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.095
and get it out there.

00:04:40.095 --> 00:04:43.609
You literally created
a page for the brand

00:04:43.609 --> 00:04:46.150
and put your product on it and
give them the proof of concept

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.600
right there.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.766
VICTORIA RANSOM: Totally
and in fact, added to that,

00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:50.880
is we created a prototype.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.450
And that's what we
got out to market.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.300
And that took two
and a half months

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.559
or something, or two months.

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:59.975
That was not the product that
we then went to market with.

00:04:59.975 --> 00:05:02.520
But with that, we're able
to validate the market,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.150
get some client on
board, and then we

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.316
could say, "Wow, this is
really worth investing in."

00:05:06.316 --> 00:05:08.807
Then the main product that
ended up really scaling

00:05:08.807 --> 00:05:10.140
took a year and a half to build.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.760
But the more you can
prototype, get it out

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.670
to clients, the better.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.740
And I would say, I think,
some entrepreneurs are really

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.050
afraid of getting their idea out
because someone might steal it.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.600
Maybe that's what worth being
afraid of but I would say much

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.849
more often businesses fail
because you don't get out

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.390
there quick enough,
you don't get out

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.270
there aggressively enough
then because someone

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.340
comes in and steals your idea.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.930
MODERATOR: Do you ever have
a moment where you thought

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.210
you were being too aggressive
with how you got out Wildfire.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.335
They're like, "Oh man, if
we put out this campaign,

00:05:38.335 --> 00:05:40.430
somebody else may see it
and they may take it up

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.679
or another big business can--"

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:44.360
VICTORIA RANSOM:
You know it never

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.870
ceases to amaze me how there's
so many times with the business

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.970
where we felt like
we were doomed.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.656
So we're a big player.

00:05:51.656 --> 00:05:54.030
There several times where
really big players, much bigger

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.630
than us, looked like they
were entering our space,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.140
or they were entering a space.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.219
And we were tiny.

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:01.010
We might have been four
people at the time.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.152
And we felt like,
"Oh, it's all over."

00:06:03.152 --> 00:06:04.610
And it never ceases
to amaze me how

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.060
slow, especially big
companies, big companies are

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.614
in moving into a market.

00:06:10.614 --> 00:06:12.530
So I just wouldn't worry
about them that much.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.040
I just get on and do your thing.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.748
And then with startups,
there's generally

00:06:15.748 --> 00:06:16.860
room for a few startups.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.140
It's weird that
one startup's going

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.098
to come in and just
totally take over from you.

00:06:20.098 --> 00:06:24.410
So I think competitors are
really great because they make

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.280
you move faster and they
scare you a little bit

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.810
and they motivate you.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.467
They're not worth focusing that
much, though, I don't think.

00:06:32.467 --> 00:06:34.800
MODERATOR: So in addition to
being aggressive, Victoria,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.633
I think something that's
so smart about what

00:06:36.633 --> 00:06:38.870
you and the Wildfire team
did is that you guys tried

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.460
to be industry leaders
for social marketing

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.702
by putting content out there
and developing white papers

00:06:44.702 --> 00:06:46.160
and webinars there
were so popular.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.330
Can you talk about
what exactly those were

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.420
and how they became so popular?

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.980
VICTORIA RANSOM: Yeah, I
think Wildfire actually

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.990
never-- we're a
very lean company.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.300
We never raised a lot of money.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.639
So marketing, we never did a
ton of big brand marketing.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:00.680
We were not in magazines.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.290
We were not all over airports.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.100
Some of our competitors were
and it was quite successful

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.720
for them.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.210
So we had to be a
lot more scrappy

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.980
and I think creative
with our marketing.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.340
And what we really found
was very, very successful

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.120
was basically
building an expertise

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.720
in the market and
really great content

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.095
to help people be
more successful

00:07:18.095 --> 00:07:19.230
with social marketing.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.850
And we distributed via
very successful webinars.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.540
So we got to the point where we
were having tens of thousands

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.280
of companies signing
up for webinars.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.627
Our social channels
were all about content,

00:07:30.627 --> 00:07:31.460
educational content.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.580
We would do things like
have question hour,

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.690
we could write in to
our experts and would

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.980
respond with questions.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.110
MODERATOR: That would be
you and Alan responding?

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.520
VICTORIA RANSOM: Uh, initially.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.950
MODERATOR: Waiting for
the questions to come in.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.366
VICTORIA RANSOM:
After a time, no.

00:07:45.366 --> 00:07:46.980
We had a fabulous
social marketing,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.563
Social Media Manager
called [? Maya ?]

00:07:48.563 --> 00:07:50.130
who would do a lot of that.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.220
And newsletters.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.260
So all of those things are
were really successful for us.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.420
Of course, you've also got
to have a big mailing list.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.280
So we were able
to build that up.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:00.880
But, yeah.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.820
And I think that was great
for us for two reasons.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.220
One, it was a really cost
effective form of marketing.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.520
But the other thing
is, in our industry,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.870
it was as much
about the perceived

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.050
expertise of the company
as it was the product,

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.550
whether someone was
on board or not.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.580
So it turned out to be
really strong sales tool

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.260
because many times,
we would close deals

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.280
because we had a great
product and the client really

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.970
believed we knew how to help
them with social marketing.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.210
So it was critical
for us, I'd say.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.200
MODERATOR: Absolutely so talk
to talk to me about-- I want

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.230
to empathize with the
I/O attendee who is here,

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.929
the developers.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.780
Maybe I need to focus
on my product 100%

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.620
and develop that,
as opposed to you

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.331
guys did so many things where
I wonder, like around the table

00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:41.789
at Wildfire, do
you guys talk about

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.090
like "Oh, this newsletter
could be distracting

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.430
from our main focus,
this webinar."

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.990
This isn't what our
product is about.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.240
Because I feel like when
you're so lean and so scrappy

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.320
like you said, it's so
hard to do so many things.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.043
But you guys were able to.

00:08:53.043 --> 00:08:54.251
VICTORIA RANSOM: Yeah, it is.

00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:56.250
And I'd say that content
marketing came later

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.208
when we'd already got a
little bit of traction.

00:08:58.208 --> 00:09:00.020
Actually in those
early days, what

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.800
really mattered most
was one, as I described,

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.910
was reaching out and
getting reference customers.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.580
So sales, basically.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.370
And it started with the two
of us being sales people.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.930
And then we bought
sales people in.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.340
But the other thing
is, our product--

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.820
our product itself was a great
lead gen tool for two reasons.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.310
One, it was actually
a very viral product.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:26.360
So any time a company published
a campaign via Wildfire--

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.080
so basically what the
initial product that Wildfire

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.656
has was a really
easy way for you

00:09:30.656 --> 00:09:35.240
to run a giveaway or a
coupon or a photo contest.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.039
So that would get
published and potentially

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:39.330
thousands or tens of thousands
or hundreds of thousands

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.519
of consumers would then
engage with that campaign.

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:43.060
Well at the bottom
of every campaign,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.160
it said "Powered by
Wildfire" with a link right

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.340
through to our product.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.160
So that turned out to be
really viral way for us

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.099
to generate leads.

00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:51.890
Then when you click
through to the product,

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.346
it was dead simple to sign
up for the product for free.

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.220
Many people did not go
any further than that.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.080
But then we'd capture
their email address.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.746
And we were getting,
initially, hundreds

00:10:01.746 --> 00:10:03.700
and then thousands
of emails a day.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.520
That's when it then became
valuable to re-market

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.239
to those people.

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:08.780
At the beginning,
we didn't have time

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.117
to do that, to do webinars.

00:10:11.117 --> 00:10:12.700
So we just did it
in an automated way.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.627
So basically, if
someone signed up,

00:10:14.627 --> 00:10:16.210
three days after you
signed up, you've

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.650
got this friendly
email from Victoria

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.189
saying, "Hey, I
saw you signed up.

00:10:21.189 --> 00:10:22.730
Here's some tips
for how to succeed."

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.140
And then seven
days later, it said

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.056
"I noticed you haven't
finished your account."

00:10:26.056 --> 00:10:28.640
And the amazing thing is,
people would respond to that

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.306
and they say Victoria,
"I can't believed

00:10:30.306 --> 00:10:31.330
you emailed me at 2 AM.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.370
You're so dedicated."

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.600
MODERATOR: So kind of you.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.230
VICTORIA RANSOM:
It's an auto email

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.580
but they didn't even realize.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.720
So, that was how we
did it initially.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.750
And then we really
had enough bandwidth

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.022
to do the content marketing.

00:10:41.022 --> 00:10:42.277
MODERATOR: That's fantastic.

00:10:42.277 --> 00:10:43.860
So it sounds like
it started with more

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.895
of an email newsletter and
became more of a webinar,

00:10:46.895 --> 00:10:48.270
the white papers
came afterwards.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.930
VICTORIA RANSOM: Yeah,
those were additives.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.885
Yeah, the newsletters
were always important.

00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:55.032
And this automated nurturing
was really important to us.

00:10:55.032 --> 00:10:55.740
MODERATOR: I see.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.000
And the other thing that you
talked about-- its sounds

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.182
like you embedded the
distribution of your product

00:10:59.182 --> 00:11:00.140
within the development.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.640
You put in the
"Powered by Wildfire"

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.160
to make sure that any
product went viral.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.730
Was that a tension
point internally?

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.690
Did people talk about we want
to make the product as pure

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.480
to the brand of our
clients as possible

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.870
and keep Wildfire away from it?

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.329
Or did you guys,
was that a clear--

00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:14.745
VICTORIA RANSOM:
Well, it actually

00:11:14.745 --> 00:11:17.030
ended up becoming a really
nice differentiator for us

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.260
in our pricing tiers.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.670
So what ended up happening
is for a large brands,

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.440
they actually cared
about branding.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.560
So we took away the
"Powered by Wildfire"

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.700
and were able to charge
them 10 times more--

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.295
I'm not joking-- than the
smaller businesses who really

00:11:31.295 --> 00:11:33.420
didn't care about having
the "Powered by Wildfire."

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.397
So the smaller businesses were
largely using the same product.

00:11:36.397 --> 00:11:37.980
We didn't make as
much money from them

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.330
but they help us this market it.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.680
And the large brands
would get what

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.180
was called our
"white label product"

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.800
and there's no
"Powered by Wildfire."

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.550
So it was actually a
really nice pricing--

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.258
MODERATOR: Sounds like
a total a win-win.

00:11:47.258 --> 00:11:48.010
That's fantastic.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.950
So Victoria, you
talked a bit about how

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.360
to become content
leader in terms

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.240
of distributing your product.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.970
What other advice would you have
for a developer entrepreneur

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.178
who's just trying to get
their product off the ground

00:11:57.178 --> 00:12:00.296
and struggling a bit.

00:12:00.296 --> 00:12:02.170
VICTORIA RANSOM: I've
tried different things.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.522
I mean I wish I could say
there's one magic bullet.

00:12:05.522 --> 00:12:07.980
In our case, we ended up finding
that content marketing was

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.729
really successful.

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:11.510
PR, by the way, was highly
successful for us as well.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.470
MODERATOR: What did you guys do
for PR to push your product out

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.390
there and expand
the distribution?

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.650
VICTORIA RANSOM:
We were persistent.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.640
So that was one thing.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.260
You can't just send
one email to a blogger

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.910
and expect to suddenly take off.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.993
Having said that, don't
piss off bloggers, either.

00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:28.010
So that's important.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.980
I think we were fairly creative.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.340
So we tried to think about,
both with our content marketing

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:38.620
and with blogs, that instead of
just thinking about pushing out

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.007
some information about
product or our company,

00:12:41.007 --> 00:12:43.590
we tried to think about what's
a different angle that we could

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.440
take that might be really
interesting to the readers

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.160
of that blog.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.740
So I remember when Facebook
launched their Timeline,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.860
we basically came
out with an app.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.070
We did it, we built it
really, really quickly that

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.140
would make it really easy
for brands to switch over

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.370
to the new Timeline format.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.420
And got that out to the blogs.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.360
And basically said
this is free for the x

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.180
first 1,000 people to
sign up or something.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.640
That was a win for
the bloggers' readers

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.205
so then they got it out there.

00:13:14.205 --> 00:13:16.330
So instead of being a
promotion pitch for Wildfire,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.545
it was something that
was great and useful

00:13:18.545 --> 00:13:19.670
for the bloggers' audience.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.378
Therefore, they're
willing to get it out.

00:13:21.378 --> 00:13:23.417
So I think thinking
a little bit out

00:13:23.417 --> 00:13:25.083
of the box of like
"I don't want to just

00:13:25.083 --> 00:13:26.330
want promote my company."

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.004
How can I in a roundabout way
promote the company and it'll

00:13:30.004 --> 00:13:32.170
address the needs of the
bloggers' audience as well.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:32.910
MODERATOR: Of course.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.100
Yeah, it seems with so many
of your distribution moves,

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.110
you're trying to offer
more value than you take.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.020
And in some ways, I
bet a lot of consumers

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.916
got value out of
what you put out

00:13:41.916 --> 00:13:43.790
there between the white
papers, the webinars,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.245
the early sign-ups without even
signing up for the product.

00:13:46.245 --> 00:13:46.510
VICTORIA RANSOM: Right.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:46.900
Oh yeah.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.590
Tons of them were
getting a lot of value

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.180
and never became our customers.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.150
But I think you're
absolutely right.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.100
It's so much easier
to get someone to tune

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.100
in if you're talking about
"to 10 tips to distribute

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.229
via Facebook" than "look
at my product features."

00:14:00.229 --> 00:14:01.770
But enough of them
converted, though.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.187
It was very
worthwhile doing that.

00:14:03.187 --> 00:14:05.478
MODERATOR: And I think that's
such an important insight

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:07.420
because so many times,
nowadays, people just

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.002
try to push the product in
your face and get it out there.

00:14:10.002 --> 00:14:11.460
I think the roundabout
way that you

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.856
went about promoting
Wildfire was so smart.

00:14:14.856 --> 00:14:17.230
VICTORIA RANSOM: Yeah, I think
it's much more successful,

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.370
otherwise people are being
bombarded all the time

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.610
with the new product.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.910
MODERATOR: Before we open
it up to you guys as Q&amp;A

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.480
with Victoria, I wanted to ask.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.610
What's something that you
look back at your time

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.260
in starting Wildfire,
your journey

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.030
up to the acquisition
by Google, what

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.280
would you've done differently?

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.160
What mistakes did you make?

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.140
What wold you've changed
about your journey?

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.400
So perhaps people in the
audience could avoid them.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.390
VICTORIA RANSOM: Yeah.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.700
I think probably some of the
mistakes we made, and they

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.750
maybe so relevant for
the stage that you're at,

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:51.480
so if I can think of an
earlier mistake, I'll add it.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:57.280
Sort of around scaling that I
think we didn't always catch up

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.830
fast enough, in terms of
putting the right leadership

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.644
in the right structure
in the company.

00:15:02.644 --> 00:15:04.560
It's great when you're
a really small company,

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.630
you want to be flat.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.540
And it's all about flat and
we don't have any hierarchy.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.650
We don't have any
structure and you

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.780
realize over time, that's
actually a mistake.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.630
So I think that was
something that we

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:17.170
had some pain points
because of it.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.670
Actually, I mentioned before
that we mostly focused on

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.762
content marketing,
social marketing,

00:15:23.762 --> 00:15:25.220
didn't do a lot of
brand marketing.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.511
As it turns out, building
your brand is important, too.

00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:29.950
And we had a competitor
did that very well.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.880
They had to raise a
lot of money to do it

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.814
but your perception
in the market

00:15:34.814 --> 00:15:36.980
actually counts for a lot,
especially when it's time

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.430
to get acquired, for example.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:43.190
So don't neglect just building
your brand perception.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.690
There's a lot of
companies out there

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:49.730
that are riding a heck of a wave
on the perception out their,

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.100
of the size of their
company that's not even true

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.485
but it pays off.

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:55.610
So I think we could have
done more around branding,

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.854
getting the word out there
about how well we were doing.

00:15:58.854 --> 00:16:01.270
MODERATOR: So with that, I
want to open it up to you guys.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.680
If you have questions, ask
Victoria about the Wildfire

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.280
journey and how she got started.

00:16:10.449 --> 00:16:12.990
AUDIENCE: Hi, is there anything
that you would do differently

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:17.415
if you were starting today?

00:16:17.415 --> 00:16:18.540
VICTORIA RANSOM: Let's see.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.130
What would I do differently
if I started over today?

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:31.890
You know, so I'm-- my co-founder
and I are not developers

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.750
ourselves.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.930
So I think we got the
product up and running

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.110
in a very scrappy way.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.340
We hired a couple of
developers in Estonia

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.540
and we built this great product.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.960
We would have done
better to bring

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.810
more senior technical leader
into the company early on.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.660
I think it was a great way to
get the product off the ground

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.711
and validated in a really
scrappy way, that's

00:16:53.711 --> 00:16:54.210
really good.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.299
But once it started
taking off then

00:16:56.299 --> 00:16:58.590
we found there was a hell a
lot of a lot we had rebuild

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.650
and the whole foundation
needed to be redone.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.462
So looking back,
I think we could

00:17:04.462 --> 00:17:05.920
have bought in--
we initially found

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.040
a really fantastic
technical leader, CTO,

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.570
but we probably should have
bought that person in early.

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:15.069
Having said that, it's a bit
of a chicken and an egg, right?

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.010
Because you create this
beautiful foundation

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.099
that's going to
scale beautifully

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:19.598
and if the product
doesn't take off.

00:17:19.598 --> 00:17:21.500
So I'm not sure that
it is such a bad thing

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.780
but we got some pain points
because of that decision,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.540
I think.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:30.515
So one thing I'd
probably do differently.

00:17:30.515 --> 00:17:32.390
AUDIENCE: Actually, you
answered my question.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.700
But in a more general
way, what is the winning

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.810
teams that you
see for a startup?

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.134
What's the combination of the
talents that needs to be there?

00:17:41.134 --> 00:17:42.550
VICTORIA RANSOM:
A great question.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.841
So first of all, I'd say when
you're picking your team,

00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:47.040
especially co-founders,
first of all,

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.195
just make sure that you have
very complimentary skills

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:51.540
and not overlapping skills.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.530
I think so often, people
become co-founders

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.654
because they met at work.

00:17:55.654 --> 00:17:56.820
They met at business school.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.350
They met wherever.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.330
And they'd quite often end
up having quite similar skill

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:01.830
sets.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.900
And I think, not
only is that a waste,

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.170
it's a recipe for disaster.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.170
Because you end up stepping
on each other's toes

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.500
and power struggles can ensue.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:17.320
So I would say, clearly if it's
some kind of technical product,

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.280
then you need a
technical leader.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.030
Maybe not right away
because we didn't.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.370
We are able to test
out market first.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.892
But pretty soon, you do.

00:18:26.892 --> 00:18:29.100
And then, and this is where
I think a lot of startups

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.140
make mistakes as
well, you need someone

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.400
who's just going to be
really aggressive on the go

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.220
to market side.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.030
So many fabulous
products never make

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.870
it get off the ground
because nobody really

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.369
thought about how
to get them there.

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:43.530
So in our case,
in the B2B space,

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.010
someone they can really build
out a sales organization

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.770
is absolutely critical.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.240
If it's not B2B,
then someone who's

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.710
a real genius with
marketing, content

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.830
marketing, viral marketing
absolutely critical.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.280
And then, you need
someone who can really

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.810
express the vision
of the company,

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.000
motivate people, get
investors excited.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.970
Someone in the company
needs to basically

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:09.210
be a salesperson but not a
salesperson going to clients,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.250
a salesperson for the company.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.250
And don't take the negative
connotation of that.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.330
I mean getting the vision out
there, getting people excited.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.810
Because that's a huge part--
it's basically taking an idea

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.670
and getting people
to give you money,

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.170
getting people to work for
you for many hours a day,

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.450
often, for not as much as they
could make somewhere else.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.540
So someone's going to
have to be a rallying

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.514
point for the company.

00:19:30.514 --> 00:19:32.430
Now I just listed about
five different things.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.165
You can find that in two people.

00:19:34.165 --> 00:19:35.611
You can find that
in three people

00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:37.902
but you've got to have all
of those components I think.

00:19:40.802 --> 00:19:41.760
AUDIENCE: Hi, Victoria.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.800
Thanks so much for coming.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.660
Just two questions.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.660
So I was wondering if you
elaborate a little bit

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.240
on the Google acquisition.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.490
So did they approach you?

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.687
Did you approach them?

00:19:51.687 --> 00:19:53.020
VICTORIA RANSOM: Great question.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.140
They approached us.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.012
So-- and that's ideal.

00:19:58.012 --> 00:19:59.470
I mean, if you can
get to the point

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.930
where actually the
acquirers coming to you,

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.080
that's a really good thing.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.300
In our case, what happened is
a couple of other companies

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.080
were interested in
acquiring Wildfire.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.800
I think Google got wind of that.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.980
There was consolidation
happening in our industry

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.730
and Google reached out and it
all happened very, very quickly

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.410
actually.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.130
But for everyone who
is an entrepreneur,

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.212
I would say you ideally don't
want to be in a position

00:20:24.212 --> 00:20:25.920
where you're going to
an acquirer saying,

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.300
"I want to sell my company."

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.960
But it's really
important to make

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.800
sure the acquirers
know who you are.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.240
So something, talking
about other things

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.310
we could have done
differently, we probably

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.520
should've done more of
is building relationships

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.230
with the Googles, the
Salesforces, the Oracles,

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.180
the IBMs of the world.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.230
You do it under the
guise of a partnership.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.770
So you reach out
and there's always

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.811
a way to potentially
partner with these companies

00:20:48.811 --> 00:20:50.180
just so they know who you are.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.370
Then you're on
their radar and then

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.240
hopefully, when they're to
acquire, they'll reach out.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.410
So that's actually
been quite [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.650
that is quite
important, I think.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.150
AUDIENCE: And then
my other question

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.190
is, can you elaborate
on your experience?

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.630
So you said that you didn't
have technical experience

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.160
but I'm assuming you have
a marketing background

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.077
or something in that field.

00:21:10.077 --> 00:21:11.410
VICTORIA RANSOM: You'd think so.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:15.130
But what my experiences is,
I grew up in New Zealand,

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.640
came over to the US for college.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.330
I did two years in the finance
industry, which was useful

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.947
because it exposed me
to lots of entrepreneurs

00:21:23.947 --> 00:21:25.780
and I learned how to
build financial models.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.880
I guess that was useful.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.499
Was not passionate about that.

00:21:29.499 --> 00:21:31.415
Started-- Alan and I
started our first company

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:32.442
in the travel industry.

00:21:32.442 --> 00:21:34.150
So we did learn a lot
from that business.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:38.450
It was an online business
about marketing, SEO content

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.830
marketing, building
a great website.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.675
So I guess, not a
marketer by trade

00:21:45.675 --> 00:21:49.221
but learned a lot
through that business.

00:21:49.221 --> 00:21:50.720
And I then did go
to business school

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.430
and then started Wildfire.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.607
But truthfully, there's
nothing about my background

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:57.940
that said I should have started
a social media marketing

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.714
software company.

00:21:58.714 --> 00:22:01.130
And I think that's kind of the
nature of entrepreneurship.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:05.300
Truly, it is so much about
common sense, intuition,

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.760
creativity, and not at all about
what you read in a textbook

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.300
or learn in a classroom.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.590
And what you don't know, you
can read online or ask someone.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.820
So, I don't think anyone--
there's no background that's

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.251
ideal for an
entrepreneur, I think.

00:22:19.251 --> 00:22:20.750
MODERATOR: So with
that, I just want

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.310
