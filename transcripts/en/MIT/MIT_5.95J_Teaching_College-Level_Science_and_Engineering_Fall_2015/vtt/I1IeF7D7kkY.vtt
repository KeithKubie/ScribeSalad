JANET RANKIN: The
technique of debate

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.100
is a really interesting
and useful technique.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.070
I make sure to arbitrarily
assign students

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.110
the side that they'll
be taking in the debate

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.350
because it's pretty
easy to debate something

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.850
you feel passionate about.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.770
It's not so easy
to debate something

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.600
that you don't feel
passionate about,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.170
or where you feel the
other side is correct.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.760
In terms of learning, I
think it's a great exercise

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.020
because it forces people
to, at least superficially,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.590
understand the stated arguments
for the side they're taking

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.020
and then find a
way to at least be

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.409
semi convincing about
those arguments.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:44.950
And then I give them
a period of time

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.380
to prepare, to sort of
prepare their arguments

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.760
about how they're going
to defend their positions.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.890
And then I have them
voice their arguments

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.750
for the particular side
that they've been assigned.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.570
So in crafting the arguments,
pro if you're a con,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.370
you really have to
start to understand

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.650
what goes behind those
arguments a little bit

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.190
better, and so that's where the
learning takes place I think.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.500
The other thing is
that the students get

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.660
a little bit
competitive, so they want

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.500
to construct a good argument.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.990
They want to sound convincing.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.440
And so that extra little
bit means that they really

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.110
do put in the effort to
construct a good argument

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.635
and to make it believable.

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:27.010
If I were making recommendations
to someone who had never

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.390
used a debate before I would say
that you should, first of all,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.140
don't pick anything that's
really emotional to start out

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.770
with.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.620
So people can have a pretty
strong opinion about it,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.800
but it's not something
that's really deep.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.190
So I would stay away from
something too touchy.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.290
The other thing
is that it should

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.080
be something where it's
really not a slam dunk one

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.040
way or the other.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.560
So you want to make sure
that the topic that you

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.190
choose really does have
two reasonable positions.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.710
You don't want to give one
team just a terrible thing

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.700
to have to argue.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.241
The other thing you
want to make sure

00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:05.830
is that you give students enough
time to craft their arguments

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.289
and to debate the points.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.770
So that if you cut the debate
short after three minutes,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.936
it's just not going to help.

00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:15.930
So you have to set aside a
pretty good chunk of time.
