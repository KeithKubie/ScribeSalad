hi my name is Tom Jackson I was just

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760
hi my name is Tom Jackson I was just
 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.309
hi my name is Tom Jackson I was just
wondering in regards to what Stephen

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319
wondering in regards to what Stephen
 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.349
wondering in regards to what Stephen
Hawking said about something happening

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359
Hawking said about something happening
 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.519
Hawking said about something happening
in the universe for the universe to

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
in the universe for the universe to
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.370
in the universe for the universe to
start itself whether that provides

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380
start itself whether that provides
 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.740
start itself whether that provides
evidence for the theory about multiple

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
evidence for the theory about multiple
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.379
evidence for the theory about multiple
universes hi Tom so you're asking about

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
universes hi Tom so you're asking about
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.939
universes hi Tom so you're asking about
Stephen Hawking in the theory of

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
Stephen Hawking in the theory of
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.420
Stephen Hawking in the theory of
multiple universes to tell you the truth

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430
multiple universes to tell you the truth
 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.529
multiple universes to tell you the truth
again I'm not a theorist I'm measuring

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
again I'm not a theorist I'm measuring
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.740
again I'm not a theorist I'm measuring
things so so far we have no visual

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750
things so so far we have no visual
 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.900
things so so far we have no visual
evidence no observational evidence of

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
evidence no observational evidence of
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.359
evidence no observational evidence of
multiple universes on the other hand

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
multiple universes on the other hand
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.400
multiple universes on the other hand
since we don't know why our universe

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410
since we don't know why our universe
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560
since we don't know why our universe
exists we have no reason to think that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
exists we have no reason to think that
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.290
exists we have no reason to think that
other universes can't also exist so

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
other universes can't also exist so
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.900
other universes can't also exist so
there could very well be in my opinion

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
there could very well be in my opinion
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.720
there could very well be in my opinion
and multiple universes but probably in a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
and multiple universes but probably in a
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.040
and multiple universes but probably in a
way that we would not know that they

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
way that we would not know that they
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.440
way that we would not know that they
exist
