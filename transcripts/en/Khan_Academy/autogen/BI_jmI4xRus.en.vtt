00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.420
 . 

00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.860
 Let's solve some quadratic equations by analyzing the factors 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:12.490
 Let's assume that I have x ^ 2 + 4x = 21 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.260
 Perhaps your motivation now is to try to extract x as a common factor 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.250
 Make the equation equal to 21 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.650
 This will not lead you to the right solution 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.670
 You may end up doing it 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.880
 Nothing is considered satisfactory 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.910
 What you need to do here is to put the whole squared phrase 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.460
 On one side of the equation 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.460
 We will do this and put it on the left side 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.710
 So let's subtract 21 from both ends of the equation 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.680
 The left side therefore becomes x ^ 2 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.080
 + 4x - 21 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.130
 And then the right side is limited to 0 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.710
 And the way you will use them to solve these 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.170
 Ie, this quadratic equation 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.230
 We have a quadratic statement equal to 0 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.560
 The way to solve them is to analyze them into their factors 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.500
 She says, well, each of these factors can 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.470
 That equals 0 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.040
 So how do we analyze them? 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.910
 Well, we've seen the last show that we had to find 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.040
 There are two numbers with a total of 21, and the sum of them 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.580
 Equals 4 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.900
 This will be a + b = 4 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.990
 As the result of their multiplication is negative, it must be 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.270
 Their signals are different 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.050
 So let's see, the number that will appear 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.530
 In front of me is 7 and 3 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.280
 If I have 7-and-3-positive, I'll get it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.580
 4 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.210
 So let's put positive 7 and 3 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.180
 If a and b are positive 7 and 3 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.250
 When I take the hit, I get 21 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.660
 When I take their sum, get a positive 4 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.070
 So I can rewrite this equation here 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.180
 I can rewrite it as (x + 7) (x - 3) 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.150
 = 0 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.680
 Now I can say this, see, I have 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.690
 Two amounts 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.040
 Their multiplier equals 0 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.610
 This means that one or both must equal 0 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.770
 This means that x + 7 = 0 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.040
 So x 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.580
 Or that x - 3 = 0 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.419
 I can subtract 7 from both ends of the equation 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.990
 I will get x = -7 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.270
 Here, I can add 3 to both ends of the equation 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.320
 I will get x = 3 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.540
 Each of these numbers is considered a solution to this equation 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.750
 You can try it 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.300
 If you take the 7 - 7 = 2 = 49 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.200
 -7 × 4 = -28 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.010
 This is really worth 21 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.280
 I will let you try the 3 yourself 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.290
 In fact, let's do it 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.190
 3 ^ 2 = 9, + 4 × 3 = 12 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.170
 9 + 12 = 21 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.920
 Let's solve more examples 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:58.300
 Suppose I have x ^ 2 + 49 = 14x 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.090
 Again, when you see something like this, make it all 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.140
 Phrases on one side of the equation to get 0 on 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.540
 the other side 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.410
 That is the best way to solve a quadratic equation 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.090
 So let's ask 14x from both sides 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.430
 We can write it as x ^ 2 - 14x + 49 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.570
 = 0 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.140
 Clearly, the 14x - 14x = 0 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.780
 This amount - 14x = this amount 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.590
 Now we just have to think about what the two numbers are when 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.580
 I take a hit, get 49, and when I take it 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.670
 Their total, I'll get -14 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.520
 If first, they must have the same signal as this 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.880
 Positive number 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.290
 Both will be negative because 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.940
 Their total is negative 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.480
 There is something interesting here 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.400
 49 is a complete square 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.890
 Its factors are 1, 7 and 48 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.020
 Maybe 7 will succeed, or better, maybe 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.530
 -7 will succeed 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.410
 It is 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.980
 -7 × 7 = 49 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.100
 And -7 + 7 = -14 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.540
 We have this style here, so we have 2 x 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.250
 Number, and then we have the number box 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.000
 This is a full box 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.209
 This is equal to (x - 7) (x - 7) 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.839
 = 0 

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.750
 I do not want to forget that 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.000
 Or we can write as follows (x - 7) ^ 2 = 0 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.120
 If this is a bipolar and constitutes a whole square 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.010
 If (x-7) ^ 2 = 0, we take 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.220
 Square root for both parties 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.990
 You get x - 7 = 0 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.890
 I mean, you can say that x - 7 = 0 or x - 7 = 0 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.210
 But that would be too much 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.640
 If we get x - 7 = 0 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.400
 We add 7 for both parties, and we get x = 7 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.620
 We have one solution here 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.240
 Let's make one more solution in pink 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.350
 Suppose we have x ^ 2 - 64 = 0 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.630
 Now that seems to be something interesting 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.160
 this is interesting 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.780
 Maybe a bell will ring in your head 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.010
 Suggest you solve 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.300
 There is no x phrase here, but we can believe 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.410
 That is our x 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.660
 We can rewrite it as x ^ 2 + 0x - 64 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.070
 If in this case, we can say, well, what are the two numbers 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.130
 When I hit them, I get 64, when 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.580
 Collect them Get 0? 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.720
 And when I take their hit, I'll get it 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.980
 A negative number, is not it? 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.080
 This is a × b 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.220
 It's a negative number 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.195
 If this should mean that their signals are different 

00:05:43.195 --> 00:05:46.600
 This should mean that their signals are different 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.590
 When I collect them, I get 0 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.740
 This should mean that a + -b = 0, or that 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.870
 a = b, so we are dealing with the same number 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.500
 We are dealing with the same number, negative images 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.790
 For both of them 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.270
 What could it be? 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.650
 Well, if we are dealing with the same number they are passive 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:14.505
 64 are 8 ^ 2 

00:06:14.505 --> 00:06:17.300
 But it is -64, so maybe we are dealing with 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.010
 8, and the other we deal with is positive 8 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.250
 And if we combine them 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.720
 We will get 0 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.840
 So it can be (x - 8) (x + 8) 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.300
 Now you do not always have to go through this 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.250
 The process you have done here 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.790
 Maybe you already remember that if I have (a + b) x 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.000
 (a - b), this equals a ^ 2 - b ^ 2 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.400
 If you see something like this and fit into this pattern, that is a ^ 2 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.100
 - b ^ 2, you can say directly, that this 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:58.330
 Equals (a + b) --a = x and b = 8 - × (a - b) 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.720
 Let us solve more general examples, and I will not tell you 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.270
 What kind 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.110
 Let me change colors 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.490
 This has become an intrigue 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:14.280
 Let's assume that we have x ^ 2 - 24x 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.530
 + 144 = 0 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.650
 Well, 144 is clearly 12 ^ 2 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.290
 This is clearly worth 2 × 12 

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.570
 Or that this is a -12 ^ 2 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.510
 If this is 12 x 12 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.400
 This is -12 + -12 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.060
 If this statement can be rewritten as (x - 12) x 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.050
 (x - 12), or (x - 12) ^ 2 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.550
 This will be equal to 0 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.790
 This is equal to 0 when x-12 = 0 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.230
 You can say that none of these are equal to 0, but they are 

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.510
 Equal anyway 

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.580
 Add 12 to the ends of that equation and get x 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.560
 = 12 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.020
 I realized that, from this top question, which I analyzed 

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.830
 But I have not really solved this equation 

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.200
 If this should equal 0 

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.070
 Let's take a step back into this equation 

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.470
 The only way that makes this equal to 0 is 

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.670
 If x - 8 = 0 or x + 

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.110
 8 = 0 

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.200
 If we add 8 to both ends 

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.100
 We get x = 8 

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.460
 We subtract 8 from both parties 

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.770
 We get x = -8 

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:33.820
 Let us solve another example 

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.159
 So realize the idea completely 

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.650
 Let us solve another example 

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:47.180
 Suppose we have 4x ^ 2 - 25 = 0 

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.870
 Maybe you've seen this pattern already 

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.870
 This is a ^ 2 

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.780
 This is b ^ 2 

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.180
 Our pattern is a ^ 2 - b ^ 2 

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:02.140
 Where a in this case is equal to x, right? 

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.020
 This is 2x ^ 2 

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.230
 And b = 5 

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.570
 If you have -b ^ 2, this is 

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.820
 Will equal (a + b) (a - b) 

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.590
 In this case, this means that 4x ^ 2-25 

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:26.660
 It will be (2x + 5) (2x - 5) 

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.520
 Of course, this equals 0 

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.400
 This equals 0 only if it is 2x + 5 = 

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.870
 0 or 2x - 5 = 0 

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.500
 And then we can solve each one of these 

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.210
 We subtract 5 from both parties 

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.550
 We get 2x = -5 

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.280
 Divide both sides on 2 

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.030
 You can get one solution which is -5/2 

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.950
 Here, add 5 for both parties 

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.020
 And you get 2x = 5 

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.420
 Divide both sides on 2 

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.310
 We get x = 5/2 

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.920
 If both of them achieve that equation 

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.000
 .
