00:00:00.562 --> 00:00:03.395
- [Instructor] So, I'm
defining the random variable x

00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:07.670
as the number of workouts that
I will do in a given week.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.789
Now right over here,

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.063
this table describes the
probability distribution for x.

00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:14.073
And as you can see,

00:00:14.073 --> 00:00:17.502
x can take on only a
finite number of values,

00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:19.859
zero, one, two, three, or four.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.520
And so, because there's a
finite number of values here,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.364
we would call this a
discrete random variable.

00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:28.130
And you can see that this is a valid

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.255
probability distribution because

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:33.084
the combined probability is one.

00:00:33.084 --> 00:00:34.167
.1 plus 0.15,

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.219
plus 0.4, plus 0.25, plus 0.1

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.290
is one.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.703
And none of these are
negative probabilities,

00:00:42.703 --> 00:00:44.528
which wouldn't have made sense.

00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:47.800
But what we care about in
this video is the notion of

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.208
an expected value of a
discrete random variable,

00:00:51.208 --> 00:00:53.505
which we would just note this way.

00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:55.125
And one way to think about it is,

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:58.513
once we calculate the expected
value of this variable,

00:00:58.513 --> 00:01:00.275
of this random variable,

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:03.048
that in a given week, that
would give you a sense

00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:06.492
of the expected number of workouts.

00:01:06.492 --> 00:01:10.084
This is also sometimes
referred to as the mean

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:11.699
of a random variable.

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:14.619
This, right over here,
is the Greek letter mu,

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.738
which is often used to denote the mean.

00:01:17.738 --> 00:01:20.510
So, this is the mean of
the random variable x.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.230
But how do we actually compute it?

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.895
To compute this, we essentially just take

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:28.969
the weighted sum of the various outcomes,

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.367
and we weight them by the probabilities.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:34.201
So, for example, this is going to be,

00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:36.791
the first outcome here is zero,

00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:39.981
and we'll weight it by
its probability of 0.1.

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:41.526
So, it's zero

00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:42.359
times 0.1.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.641
Plus, the next outcome is one,

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:51.518
and it'd be weighted by
its probability of 0.15.

00:01:51.518 --> 00:01:52.518
So, plus one

00:01:53.357 --> 00:01:54.274
times 0.15.

00:01:56.632 --> 00:01:59.381
Plus, the next outcome is

00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:02.313
two and has a probability of 0.4,

00:02:02.313 --> 00:02:03.501
plus two

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:04.334
times 0.4.

00:02:06.483 --> 00:02:08.112
Plus,

00:02:08.112 --> 00:02:12.384
the outcome three has
a probability of 0.25,

00:02:12.384 --> 00:02:13.904
plus three

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:14.821
times 0.25.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.111
And then last but not least,

00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:22.310
we have the outcome
four workouts in a week,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.730
that has a probability of 0.1,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.263
plus four

00:02:26.263 --> 00:02:27.096
times 0.1.

00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:31.339
Well, we can simplify this a little bit.

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.082
Zero times anything is just zero.

00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:35.582
So, one times 0.15

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:38.177
is 0.15.

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.524
Two times 0.4

00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:42.357
is 0.8.

00:02:44.272 --> 00:02:46.321
Three times 0.25

00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:47.154
is 0.75.

00:02:49.232 --> 00:02:51.732
And then four times .1 is 0.4.

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.921
And so, we just have to
add up these numbers.

00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:57.095
So, we get

00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:57.928
0.15,

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.032
plus .8,

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:04.288
plus .75,

00:03:07.494 --> 00:03:08.327
plus .4,

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.670
and let's say 0.4,

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:13.812
0.75,

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:15.956
0.8.

00:03:16.855 --> 00:03:18.602
Let's add 'em all together.

00:03:18.602 --> 00:03:21.869
And so, let's see, five plus five is 10.

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.148
And then this is two plus eight is 10,

00:03:24.148 --> 00:03:26.981
plus seven is 17, plus four is 21.

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:32.854
So, we get all of this is
going to be equal to 2.1.

00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:35.859
So, one way to think about it is

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.186
the expected value of x,

00:03:38.186 --> 00:03:41.512
the expected number of
workouts for me in a week,

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:45.963
given this probability
distribution, is 2.1.

00:03:45.963 --> 00:03:48.374
Now you might be saying,
wait, hold on a second.

00:03:48.374 --> 00:03:51.224
All of the outcomes
here are whole numbers.

00:03:51.224 --> 00:03:53.836
How can you have 2.1 workouts in a week?

00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:55.959
What is .1 of a workout?

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.580
Well, this isn't saying
that in a given week,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.957
you would expect me to
work out exactly 2.1 times.

00:04:01.957 --> 00:04:04.286
But this is valuable
because you could say, well,

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:06.867
in 10 weeks, you would expect me

00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:09.034
to do roughly 21 workouts.

00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:12.714
Sometimes I might do zero
workouts, sometimes one,

00:04:12.714 --> 00:04:15.217
sometimes two, sometimes
three, sometimes four.

00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:16.566
But in 100 weeks,

00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:20.559
you might expect me to do 210 workouts.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.199
So, even for a random variable

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.460
that can only take on integer values,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.209
you can still have a
non-integer expected value,

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:30.996
and it is still useful.
