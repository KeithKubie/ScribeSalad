00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.870
 Winter is coming. All of us were asked to wear a jacket when we left, otherwise we would get cold 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.090
 Of course, the common response today is "Do not be ridiculous", _ Translation Team (Arasns) _ 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.930
 Being cold can not cause you to get cold, or you can! Who wins the battle of these beliefs? 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.689
 The link between cold weather and disease is already there. Between (5-20)% of Americans 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.359
 They get colds almost every year late fall and winter. Not to mention that it is called "colds". 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.679
 But there are some important things to consider. First, the most important thing: 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.140
 Is that the colds and flu caused by viruses, if none of them in your surroundings, you will not get them 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.520
 No matter how cold you feel. It's that simple 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.859
 If it is related to low temperatures? First: People tend to stay at home for a while 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.230
 Often longer during the winter, which in turn makes them in contact with more people. 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.109
 More people, means greater exposure to the spread of pathogens. Above all, 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.340
 Humidity plays a role in the spread of certain viruses. In low humidity in winter 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.179
 Not only does the virus spread quickly, but the mucus also dries up in your nose. 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:00.230
 In other cases, mucus acts as a protective shield against pathogens. 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.759
 The loss of vitamin D that we get from the sun can negatively affect our immune system. 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.140
 Both stay longer at home and the fact that winter has shorter days 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.740
 Together, they make a great impact on your health. 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.250
 If your parents have proved wrong, right? Not so fast! 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.930
 While some previous studies have shown that it has nothing to do with temperatures, recent evidence has suggested otherwise. 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.020
 In a study made _ and as test materials _from the feet of some people in icy water, they found that they were in fact more vulnerable 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.189
 To develop symptoms of colds in the following days, from those who did not undergo the test 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.229
 The hypothesis resulting from these results is that the cold temperature causes blood vessels to contract. 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.180
 Which slows the arrival of white blood cells to the virus, 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.590
 Thus inhibiting the immune response. Levels of cortisol - which hinder the functioning of the immune system_ 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.670
 It increases with heat induced by intensity. Further, studies have been conducted on both mice, 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.939
 Human respiratory tract cells that the immune response to the cold virus is based on heat. 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.509
 Infected and warm cells are more likely to succumb to programmed cell death 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.840
 To reduce the spread of sepsis. 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.450
 Finally, studies of the virus itself revealed unique secrets. In winter temperature 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.130
 The outer virus layer, or casing, becomes more powerful and plays a shield role. 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.450
 This virus can spread from person to person more easily. In warm temperatures 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.229
 This layer is closer to a gel that is not strong enough to protect the virus from external factors. 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.599
 As a result, their deployment capacity is weak. 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.090
 So, maybe your parents were not completely wrong after all this. A happy settlement can be reached out 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.870
 Dressed in warm clothes will ensure the passage of winter without causing you any harm. 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.349
