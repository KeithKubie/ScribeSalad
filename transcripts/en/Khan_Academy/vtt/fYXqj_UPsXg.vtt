00:00:00.146 --> 00:00:01.752
- [Voiceover] So again, we've
been talking a lot about

00:00:01.752 --> 00:00:06.059
the early stages of the Civil
War which were about slavery

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.486
and the spread of slavery,

00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:11.227
and I think in popular culture,
when we think about things

00:00:11.227 --> 00:00:14.669
like Abraham Lincoln and
the Civil War and slavery,

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.922
the term Emancipation
Proclamation, or the idea

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:19.722
of the Emancipation
Proclamation comes to mind

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:23.586
and I think a lot of folks
imagine it to be this really

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.590
amazing speech that at
some point, you know,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.028
Lincoln makes this proclamation,

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.294
and after that point,
slavery is just gone from

00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:31.215
the United States,

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:33.094
is that what it was?

00:00:33.094 --> 00:00:35.074
- [Voiceover] No, it's
actually a lot more complicated

00:00:35.074 --> 00:00:35.692
than that.

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:38.488
So, the Emancipation Proclamation itself

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:40.038
was not a speech.

00:00:40.038 --> 00:00:42.971
It was actually closer to a decree.

00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:47.659
Even though Lincoln didn't
originally come in to

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.068
his presidency intending to end slavery,

00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:54.401
it became pretty clear in the
first year of the war that--

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:55.526
- [Voiceover] He was anti-slavery.

00:00:55.526 --> 00:00:56.654
He just didn't want it to spread.

00:00:56.654 --> 00:00:58.260
He didn't think he could end it.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.467
- [Voiceover] Right, so he

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:02.544
specifically says in his
inaugural address that he has

00:01:02.544 --> 00:01:06.616
no intention of ending slavery
and that if the slave states

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:09.261
returned to the Union,
everything will just go back

00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:13.075
to the status quo, but it
very quickly becomes apparent

00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:17.071
in the Civil War that ending
slavery is going to have

00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:19.785
to be a goal of the North.

00:01:19.785 --> 00:01:24.643
For one thing, the slaves
provide so much of the production

00:01:24.643 --> 00:01:28.864
for the South that interfering
with that production

00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:32.714
is really important for
the North to secure victory

00:01:32.714 --> 00:01:36.016
but it also is important
on a moral ground.

00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:39.273
Almost as soon as the war begins

00:01:39.273 --> 00:01:41.953
and slave men and women
in the South start going

00:01:41.953 --> 00:01:45.864
to Union lines hoping for
the army to protect them,

00:01:45.864 --> 00:01:48.031
they want to be part of the war effort,

00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:50.588
they interpret it as a war to end slavery

00:01:50.588 --> 00:01:53.885
long before Abraham Lincoln
interprets it as a war

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:54.896
to end slavery.

00:01:54.896 --> 00:01:59.887
So it becomes clear by
the summer of 1862 that

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:02.302
the Union is going to
have to deal with slavery,

00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:03.162
one way or another.

00:02:03.162 --> 00:02:04.737
- [Voiceover] Now, once
again, the reason why it's

00:02:04.737 --> 00:02:06.737
strategically important is
that this war is not going

00:02:06.737 --> 00:02:08.732
as well as the North would have hoped

00:02:08.732 --> 00:02:09.712
or as Lincoln would have hoped.

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:12.123
It's lasting longer,

00:02:12.123 --> 00:02:14.574
the first years as we mentioned
in the previous video,

00:02:14.574 --> 00:02:18.576
the South was winning and it
was going on the offensive,

00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:20.393
and then also on the moral argument,

00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:24.339
it gave the North something
more to fight for.

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:28.916
- [Voiceover] Yes, and even
in some pockets of the South,

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:32.349
individual Union generals were even

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.181
making their own small
Emancipation Proclamation.

00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:38.279
So it became clear that
the North was going to need

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:43.279
an overall stance on whether
this was a war to end slavery.

00:02:43.512 --> 00:02:46.504
Lincoln decides, yes,
this is going to be a war

00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:48.173
to end slavery.

00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:49.726
- [Voiceover] And so, does
he announce it, you know,

00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:52.882
just all of a sudden, or,
is he kind of waiting for

00:02:52.882 --> 00:02:54.448
the right time?

00:02:54.448 --> 00:02:56.487
- [Voiceover] He's definitely
waiting for the right time.

00:02:56.487 --> 00:03:01.487
In the summer of 1862,
he makes the first draft

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.684
of the Emancipation Proclamation,

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.805
and even in the summer,
he shows it to the members

00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:10.266
of his cabinets, and they're shocked.

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:13.759
Most of them are, themselves,
strongly abolitionist

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:17.825
but they are terrified that
this document is going to be

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:22.615
so revolutionary at a time
when the North is already

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:26.316
struggling, that it's going to
force the border states out,

00:03:26.316 --> 00:03:29.475
that many of the whites in the North

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:32.547
who don't care about the fate of slaves

00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:35.109
are going to leave the war effort,

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.109
so they advise Lincoln
not to just proclaim

00:03:40.268 --> 00:03:43.309
the Emancipation Proclamation,

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.716
but rather to wait for a big Union victory

00:03:46.716 --> 00:03:50.702
to kind of put a stamp on the document.

00:03:50.702 --> 00:03:52.075
- [Voiceover] And just to
make sure we understand,

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:54.804
I mean, the fear of his advisors was

00:03:54.804 --> 00:03:56.769
not all the Union states were free states.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.717
You had states like Missouri and Kentucky

00:03:59.717 --> 00:04:03.753
and Maryland that were

00:04:03.753 --> 00:04:06.516
slave states but still part of the Union

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:08.859
and so the fear is, if you emancipate,

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.407
or if you make this
proclamation, all of a sudden,

00:04:11.407 --> 00:04:12.703
those states would leave.

00:04:12.703 --> 00:04:16.053
- [Voiceover] Right, and those
are very important states.

00:04:16.053 --> 00:04:19.476
They have a very large white population,

00:04:19.476 --> 00:04:22.109
relative to their enslaved population,

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.949
which means that if they go to the South,

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.717
all of those fighters
will go for the South,

00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:30.320
and it's also where a lot
of the South's industry is

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.486
so it would mean that a
tremendous amount of man power

00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:38.012
and also industrial power
would join the South,

00:04:38.012 --> 00:04:41.397
so Lincoln and his
cabinet are very concerned

00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:44.041
about alienating these states.

00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:46.380
They want to make sure that their power

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.277
doesn't go with the South.

00:04:48.277 --> 00:04:49.415
- [Voiceover] Does the
Emancipation Proclamation

00:04:49.415 --> 00:04:50.717
end slavery in those states,

00:04:50.717 --> 00:04:52.922
or the entire United States,
or just in the South,

00:04:52.922 --> 00:04:54.497
or just in the Confederate states?

00:04:54.497 --> 00:04:59.497
- [Voiceover] So this is a
strategy of military necessity,

00:04:59.504 --> 00:05:01.070
as Lincoln says.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.597
He specifically exempts
the border states from the

00:05:04.597 --> 00:05:06.180
Emancipation Proclamation.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.842
- [Voiceover] He exempts them?

00:05:06.842 --> 00:05:07.640
- [Voiceover] He exempts them.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.797
- [Voiceover] He says, this
does not apply to them.

00:05:09.797 --> 00:05:13.337
So, it's not a pure moral
grounds that slavery is evil

00:05:13.337 --> 00:05:15.126
and needs to be gone from the Earth.

00:05:15.126 --> 00:05:19.087
He's saying, in the states
that are trying to secede,

00:05:19.087 --> 00:05:20.438
he's banning slavery.

00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:23.402
- [Voiceover] Right, and,
he almost makes it like

00:05:23.402 --> 00:05:27.818
a form of enticement for
the South to come back.

00:05:27.818 --> 00:05:29.663
He says,

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:32.438
here is my plan for emancipation.

00:05:32.438 --> 00:05:36.271
I am going to put it into effect

00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:39.688
on the first day of January, 1863.

00:05:39.688 --> 00:05:43.644
He puts it out in

00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:46.307
September of 1862

00:05:46.307 --> 00:05:49.906
just after the Union victory at Antietam,

00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:54.844
so this big Union victory gives him the...

00:05:54.844 --> 00:05:56.289
- [Voiceover] Confidence, or--

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:56.946
- [Voiceover] The confidence.

00:05:56.946 --> 00:05:58.423
- [Voiceover] the backdrop, the context.

00:05:58.423 --> 00:05:59.454
- [Voiceover] The context

00:05:59.454 --> 00:06:00.811
- [Voiceover] to do this.
- [Voiceover] in which he

00:06:00.811 --> 00:06:02.894
can put the Emancipation
Proclamation out there,

00:06:02.894 --> 00:06:04.154
but he says,

00:06:04.154 --> 00:06:08.470
if the states that are in
rebellion come back into the Union

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.067
before January 1st, then
it will be null and void.

00:06:12.067 --> 00:06:13.748
- [Voiceover] I see, so he's
still trying to get them back

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.650
in the fold, and he's
willing to accept slavery,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.971
at least for the time being,

00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:19.797
if he can end this war that's
turning out far bloodier

00:06:19.797 --> 00:06:22.334
and far longer-lasting
than frankly anyone,

00:06:22.334 --> 00:06:23.702
especially folks in the North,

00:06:23.702 --> 00:06:24.707
had expected it to be,

00:06:24.707 --> 00:06:26.873
so didn't immediately
say, hey, no more slavery,

00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:29.299
which might have made the
South fight even harder.

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:32.226
It's like, hey, well, I'm
going to make this effective

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:35.290
in January 1863, which
would be another year,

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.089
so you have a couple months to come back,

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:39.723
come back to the mother ship so to speak.

00:06:39.723 --> 00:06:42.343
- [Voiceover] Right, and the
South does not take him up

00:06:42.343 --> 00:06:47.343
on this offer, so when
January 1st, 1863 rolls around

00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:50.842
he signs the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:06:50.842 --> 00:06:53.282
- [Voiceover] And, we
have some of the text of

00:06:53.282 --> 00:06:55.966
the Proclamation here, and
what I think is interesting,

00:06:55.966 --> 00:06:58.446
and we have this right
on the Khan Academy site,

00:06:58.446 --> 00:07:00.559
in one of the articles, is that,

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:03.633
it doesn't have the
beauty of the Declaration

00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:06.650
of Independence or even the Constitution.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.537
It actually reads kind
of like a legal document.

00:07:09.537 --> 00:07:10.532
I mean, if I read this,

00:07:10.532 --> 00:07:13.176
"That on the first day of
January, in the year of our Lord,

00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:15.985
"one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-three,

00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:18.632
"all persons held as slaves
within any States or designated

00:07:18.632 --> 00:07:19.459
"part of a State,"

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:21.076
so it's kind of this legalese,

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:24.036
"the people whereof shall
then be in rebellion against

00:07:24.036 --> 00:07:26.369
"the United States, shall
be then, thenceforth

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:27.792
"and forever free,

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:29.253
"and the Executive Government
of the United States,

00:07:29.253 --> 00:07:31.330
"including the military and
naval authority thereof,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.868
"will recognize and maintain
the freedom of such persons,

00:07:33.868 --> 00:07:36.892
"and will do no act or acts
to repress such persons,

00:07:36.892 --> 00:07:39.159
"or any of them in efforts,

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:41.528
"in any efforts they make
for their actual freedom,"

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:42.352
which is a,

00:07:42.352 --> 00:07:44.362
in spirit a really nice thing to say,

00:07:44.362 --> 00:07:45.993
but it reads like a legal document

00:07:45.993 --> 00:07:49.036
and I could keep going and I
encourage the folks listening

00:07:49.036 --> 00:07:52.034
to read it, and it literally
lists the various states

00:07:52.034 --> 00:07:54.672
and as you mentioned, it's
much more of a decree.

00:07:54.672 --> 00:07:56.437
It's not this beautiful speech.

00:07:56.437 --> 00:07:58.566
- [Voiceover] Right, and we
know Lincoln for his beautiful

00:07:58.566 --> 00:08:01.695
speeches, the Gettysburg
Address is perhaps the most

00:08:01.695 --> 00:08:04.243
famous speech in American history,

00:08:04.243 --> 00:08:07.660
and so, it's a little bit
strange that, arguably,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.449
the most important thing
that Lincoln ever does

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:15.066
is arguably the ugliest
piece of writing that Lincoln

00:08:15.066 --> 00:08:17.250
ever put out there.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.315
It's because he's a lawyer,

00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:23.783
and we forget sometimes
about Lincoln's background

00:08:23.783 --> 00:08:26.473
as a lawyer, but he practiced for decades,

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:29.676
and so, what he's trying
to do here is really create

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:33.819
an ironclad legal document that
no one can turn around later

00:08:33.819 --> 00:08:35.689
and say, "Well, here's a loophole."

00:08:35.689 --> 00:08:37.181
- [Voiceover] Yup, although
it has its moments.

00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:38.003
I mean, right here,

00:08:38.003 --> 00:08:41.893
"And upon this act, sincerely
believed to be an act

00:08:41.893 --> 00:08:44.914
"of justice, warranted
by the Constitution,

00:08:44.914 --> 00:08:47.482
"upon military necessity,
I invoke the considerate

00:08:47.482 --> 00:08:49.139
"judgment of mankind,

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:51.024
"and the gracious favor of Almighty God,"

00:08:51.024 --> 00:08:52.540
so, I mean, it's kind of,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.059
yeah, it's still kind of a legal,

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:57.076
yeah, it's not moving to the passions

00:08:57.076 --> 00:08:59.882
or to the moral as much as, kind of,

00:08:59.882 --> 00:09:02.065
and he even also talks about,

00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:03.438
well, it is what it is.

00:09:03.438 --> 00:09:06.926
We'll let other people
judge it on their own.

00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:09.183
- [Voiceover] But, you know,
what's really important

00:09:09.183 --> 00:09:12.683
about the Emancipation Proclamation is

00:09:12.683 --> 00:09:16.216
from that point forward,
even though he's particularly

00:09:16.216 --> 00:09:20.512
putting this on the
southern states where any

00:09:20.512 --> 00:09:24.243
jurisdiction he has is really
just what can be enforced

00:09:24.243 --> 00:09:26.153
by the army,

00:09:26.153 --> 00:09:29.695
it turns the Union army
into an army of liberation,

00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:32.510
that as they go throughout the South,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.616
enslaved people will flock to them

00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:39.393
and want to contribute to the war effort

00:09:39.393 --> 00:09:42.510
and shortly after this, Lincoln will

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.553
make it possible,

00:09:43.553 --> 00:09:47.733
one part of the Emancipation
Population is saying that

00:09:47.733 --> 00:09:51.824
African Americans can join
the Union army as soldiers,

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:54.134
and so, they really,

00:09:54.134 --> 00:09:55.729
from this point forward,

00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:58.818
can play an active role,

00:09:58.818 --> 00:10:02.915
direct and recognized
role in ending slavery

00:10:02.915 --> 00:10:07.065
and this is really the moment when slavery

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.310
truly starts to crumble.
