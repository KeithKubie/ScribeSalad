00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.013
- Good morning.

00:00:01.013 --> 00:00:02.270
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.720
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in
Hunza Valley, Pakistan.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.700
Today we have a very long day.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.030
We're driving from Hunza
Valley to Khunjerab Pass,

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.040
but it is a very high mountain pass.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.360
It's the border between
Pakistan and China.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.950
But along the way, we're going
to stop to eat a local lunch.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.310
We're gonna eat some food along the way,

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.260
then after Khunjerab
Pass, we'll be driving

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.450
back down to Gilgit.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.210
So it's gonna be a very
long day, a lot of driving.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.090
So before we start anything, I'm having

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.401
breakfast at the hotel.

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:28.568
(lively upbeat music)

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.870
One of the local breakfasts
is a type of pancake.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.993
One is made from buckwheat,
seasoned with apricot oil.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.840
Mm, oh that's like more,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.680
more like gummy than I had imagined.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.120
Since coming to this region
entire Gilgit-Baltistan region,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.410
I have just thoroughly
loved that apricot oil.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.453
It's so fragrant.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.540
That one almost kind of has
a French toast taste to it.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.820
Also, breakfast in Pakistan, I
just cannot resist the keema.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.720
I think this one looks like chicken,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.233
which is like a mincemeat
fry, or mincemeat curry.

00:01:07.813 --> 00:01:09.310
Mm, oh it's good.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.510
Oh, thank you very much.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.583
Thank you.

00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:14.220
This is a local granola.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.540
All with nuts grown here, and

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.010
I'm not sure what type
of seeds those are in

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.243
also some of the local yogurt.

00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:22.990
There's some type of seed in there.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.550
It tastes like sesame,
but it's really crispy,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.850
really crunchy and then you've got,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.399
it's like almonds and walnuts
just crushed up in there.

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.230
(lively upbeat music)

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.063
Good morning Ali,

00:01:32.063 --> 00:01:34.451
- Good morning, I don't work
today just leave me here.

00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:35.284
(Mark laughing)

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:37.950
- This morning, the peak that
we tried to see yesterday,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.640
Rakaposhi, which is one
of the tallest mountains

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.643
in this region, in this area
it was shining in the sun.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:46.749
Hayzum, good to see you.

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:50.220
(lively upbeat music)

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.220
We're all packed up and loaded on our way.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.900
Its gonna be about a four
hour drive all the way

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.150
to Khunjerab Pass but of course,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.600
we're gonna stop along the way.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.980
Though we just looked at the forecast,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.490
it's a high of negative
12 degrees celsius,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.870
a low of negative 22 and snow.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.550
So it's gonna be arctic
conditions up there,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.472
it's gonna be freezing cold,
we're on our way for the day.

00:02:09.472 --> 00:02:10.586
(horn honking)

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:13.753
(lively upbeat music)

00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:19.931
We're in the middle of
the mountain right now,

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.570
massive tunnel just going through the,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.133
cut straight through the rock.

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:29.966
- [Passenger] We're in
the middle of this, rock.

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:32.216
(laughing)

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.360
- Stunning, what's the name of this lake?

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.193
- [Man] Attabad Lake.

00:02:36.193 --> 00:02:37.026
- This is Attabad lake, okay.

00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:41.130
- What happened was this mountain
had due to the earthquake,

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.000
the mountain had come down all the way.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.743
This lake, this used to
be a valley right here.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.580
Very small Hunza River just
going through the valley,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.873
but then because of the rock slide,

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:54.890
the way of the Hunza river was stopped

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.030
and this entire lake was
formed in 2007, 2008.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.360
- We're actually gonna
stop at this lake though,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.750
on another place, right?

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.350
It's gonna get better than this.

00:03:06.062 --> 00:03:08.110
We're gonna stop here
just for a cup of tea.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.890
Then after that we are gonna head down

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.263
to the water's edge for a boat maybe.

00:03:12.263 --> 00:03:13.970
(wind blowing)

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.713
It is cold up here.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.230
There's nothing better than a toilet,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.480
with a breathtaking view.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.533
Sorry about the quick toilet shot.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.989
(customers talking)

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.123
That feels and tastes so
good, just warms going down.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.060
We are lakeside now,
time to fully gear up.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.210
It's the wind that is
really whipping through

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.018
this valley and the lake
that's really making it

00:03:45.018 --> 00:03:46.653
frigidly cold.

00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:50.088
(rocks crunching)

00:03:50.088 --> 00:03:53.780
(lively upbeat music)

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.240
We've chosen to take this
big boat, and it actually

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.610
has a lot of historical value.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.860
This used to be a boat that was a ferry,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.530
that used to transport and
they would even carry vehicles,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.770
trucks in here across the
lake to the other side.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.940
Before they built the tunnel.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.894
So the tunnel was actually
built quite recently.

00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:11.977
(boat motor running)

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.473
Once again, just unimaginable beauty.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:21.623
It's so freezing cold but it's
so unbelievably beautiful,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.630
words cannot even describe.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.270
- Beautiful beyond my years,

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.385
it's so beautiful that you can't imagine.

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:28.969
Just can't put it into words.

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.969
(boat motor running)
(lively upbeat music)

00:04:41.473 --> 00:04:43.013
(woman speaking Urdu)

00:04:43.013 --> 00:04:44.220
- Thank you.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.530
A little bit of a random situation.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.410
We're trying to arrange
dinner on the way back

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.670
from Khunjerab Pass, so
we're just in this village,

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.392
what is the village called?

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:53.225
- Gulmit.

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:55.100
- Gulmit.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.310
Then we're just checking out their,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.760
we ordered some food and then we're gonna

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.500
be in this traditional house for dinner,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.603
but she's just offered me
some traditional bread.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.203
Really kinda like a cracker bread,

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.530
really like thick and hearty.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.770
But we're kinda getting late on time,

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.900
things kind happening at a slow pace.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.440
But, hopefully the plan is
to come back to this house

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.280
later tonight were they
will, there's actually

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.530
a restaurant where
they'll cook food and then

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.323
they'll serve it to us in that home.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.600
But they were so welcoming,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.380
again so welcoming and hospitable.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.580
We've gotta make a move, it's gonna get

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.310
dark and cold very soon.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.520
- How's the house?

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.130
- The house is nice, it
like last night kinda.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.073
- 6 p.m.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.880
- But this is gonna be a
totally, the food looks

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.610
very similar to Hunza,
the food we ate in Hunza.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.070
But a little bit different
because this is actually,

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.543
Pamirian cuisine, like the
next ingredient sort of.

00:05:50.543 --> 00:05:53.460
(truck driving by)

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.903
Hey guys,

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.923
nice flock.

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.120
- They got some big horns on them.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.240
- Nice flock of sheep and goats.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.580
We're almost to a place called Sost,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.993
were we're gonna stop for lunch hopefully

00:06:20.993 --> 00:06:23.460
Everyday they serve
biryani except for today,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.370
today happens to be Friday so he cooked

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.073
all sorts of different curries and dishes.

00:06:27.073 --> 00:06:29.990
(speaking in Urdu)

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.700
We ordered pretty much everything he has.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.440
It smells so good in here.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.203
Here it comes, the beans and
the dahl, it smells so good.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.700
A vegetable dish, we got some
dahl and also some beans.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.640
- Let me just try.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.820
- This is the mixed
vegetable, there's potato,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.963
there's onions in here and peppers.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.053
Mm, oh yeah.

00:06:58.288 --> 00:07:00.170
It's as good as it smells.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.173
Everything is just cooked down so soft,

00:07:03.398 --> 00:07:06.170
oh yeah that's wonderful.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.290
It looks like a variety of
lentils, maybe black lentils.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.140
Then onions, there's carrots in here.

00:07:14.257 --> 00:07:17.220
(people speaking in Urdu)

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.143
All I want is to stir.

00:07:19.194 --> 00:07:20.027
- This is it.

00:07:20.027 --> 00:07:21.640
- It tastes like healthy.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.373
Less of the butter, more of the spice.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.206
Hopefully this chili warms me up.

00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:32.373
(lively upbeat music)

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.050
This is good simple food,
beans maybe sweetened

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.090
with some carrots, and
some chili's in there.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.253
And just a light blend of
spices, it just tastes so good.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.830
- [Man] To Khunjerab Pass.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.577
- [Another Man] Cheers, dudes.

00:07:51.577 --> 00:07:54.744
(lively upbeat music)

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.498
- [Mark] That's a mouthful of chili.

00:07:59.498 --> 00:08:01.033
- [Man] These Zibiti spices are awesome.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.530
- I didn't think from riding
in the car, winding around,

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.740
you do get pretty hungry too.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.766
This just feels so good.

00:08:09.766 --> 00:08:13.660
(lively upbeat music)

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.385
Mandatory beverage after lunch.

00:08:16.385 --> 00:08:18.930
(lively upbeat music)

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.730
And that was vegetarian
actually come to think of it,

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.710
I didn't even realize
that as I was eating it

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.883
because it was so good.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.210
We have about two hours still
until we reach Khunjerab Pass,

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.360
so we gotta get moving.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.057
(lively upbeat music)

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.570
Traffic blocked wall.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.008
That's just a sea of sheep and goats.

00:08:42.008 --> 00:08:43.425
- [Woman] Oh, my.

00:08:44.288 --> 00:08:47.288
(greeting herdsman)

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.578
Some of them look really
warm and cozy out there.

00:09:00.578 --> 00:09:03.745
(lively upbeat music)

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.980
Getting really high in elevation.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.703
We're probably at about 4,400 meters now.

00:09:09.703 --> 00:09:12.150
Gonna be at the pass in a few minutes.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.343
I can actually feel a little bit,

00:09:13.343 --> 00:09:14.270
(horn honking)

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.110
Starting to get a little lightheaded,

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.563
I believe from the elevation.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.126
Okay, we are almost to the top.

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:23.293
(lively upbeat music)

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.513
This is where it's time to
put on the hat and the gloves.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.920
Yeah, it is other-worldly here.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.470
It looks like we are
literally on top of the world.

00:09:42.118 --> 00:09:43.160
Oh, yeah.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.700
Oh, that is cold.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.410
Oh, that is freezing cold.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.630
Should be about negative 12.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.200
I can just feel it in my throat.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.760
Look at this landscape.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.050
It's just other-worldly though.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.077
- We literally are on top of the world.

00:10:00.221 --> 00:10:03.138
(greeting in Urdu)

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.480
- There it is, that's the border.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.533
That's the famous
landmark gate over there.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.345
Yeah, just taking a
little walk down the road

00:10:13.345 --> 00:10:15.420
I am breathing.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.100
I can feel that.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.610
I think I'm gonna
probably stop right here,

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.510
but those mountains they must be in China.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.560
Yeah, there's the sign,
Urumqi and Kashgar.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.745
Just down the road.

00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:28.912
(lively upbeat music)

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:30.703
Okay, well.

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:33.500
Back in the car.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.953
That is some serious elevation,

00:10:34.953 --> 00:10:37.110
this is the highest
elevation I've been to.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.060
It's freezing cold out there but wow,

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.240
it was just other-worldly.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.533
- [Mark] Turn the light all the way up.

00:10:47.435 --> 00:10:49.580
Oh, you can smell the bread.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.330
And now we made it back to the village

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.730
where we had reserved the food.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.030
So dinner is ready, we're in the home.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.753
This smells and looks delicious.

00:10:56.753 --> 00:11:00.586
(Group indistinct chattering)

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.790
- [Mark] A vegetable dish too.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.310
Vegetable and meat.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.090
They just kept bringing more and more food

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.610
and it looks incredible.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.930
So this is Pamiri cuisine,

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.130
which is kind of like central Asian,

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.150
Tajikistan, Afghani food.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.300
Very, very low on the meat.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.350
I think the soup, she
said the soup might have

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.480
a little bit of meat in it.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.610
But other than that
it's mostly vegetables,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:26.910
especially a lot of wheat.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.980
A lot of warming food,

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.600
and a lot of pancake,
bready looking dishes.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.570
They kind of look like
flaxseeds and then some,

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.390
I think there's something
in the center as well.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.400
I think like an almond, maybe nut paste.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.610
I think that might be apricot oil.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.777
(lively upbeat music)

00:11:48.745 --> 00:11:51.020
I think that is apricot
oil brushed on top.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.900
Yeah, definitely.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.840
I can taste that unique flavor.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.070
But it tastes kind of
like flaxseed on top,

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.760
and then maybe black pepper.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.343
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.590
Two different types of soups.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.380
One is like a noodle, creamy looking soup.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.670
One is actually a very unique soup

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.770
it's filled with apricots
and you can just see those

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:10.740
apricots just in there.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.910
So it's kind of a, I'm sure
it's gonna be kind of sweet

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.743
with the apricots.

00:12:13.743 --> 00:12:14.830
Let's try the noodle soup first.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.900
Brought us an amazing
assortment of dishes.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.200
There looks like a little
bit of meat in here.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:29.390
Whoa, that has like a
surprising sour taste to it.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.150
Maybe from yogurt.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.970
But at the same time, it kind
of has an animaly taste to it

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.740
or like a smokey point taste to it.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.260
The apricot soup now.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.180
Okay and you can see just
those chunks of apricot,

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.400
there's the noodles in here.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.779
Wow, that's just like whoa.

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:46.500
Just in one serving, there
must be five apricots in here.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.100
And even the sauce is just
pure melted down apricot.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.473
Wow.

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:56.723
(laughing)

00:12:58.404 --> 00:13:01.071
(calming music)

00:13:05.468 --> 00:13:06.610
I'm hoping it,

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.000
I hope you could hear
Mica's fart on camera.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.020
That apricot soup though, that is like-

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.910
It is like melted apricots,
cooked down apricots

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.850
with noodles in it.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.840
It's almost like an apricot jam soup.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.050
Next dish, this one is like a vegetable.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.300
Really simmered down
also, with potato in it.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.933
Mm, mm.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.013
Oh that's superb.

00:13:26.013 --> 00:13:27.140
It tastes kind of like mustard green,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.487
because it has that
slight bitterness to it.

00:13:28.487 --> 00:13:30.340
You can taste the chilis in there,

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.240
you can taste the richness
of it but it's so-

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.140
Onions in there too.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.970
This one is another wheat-based dish.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.340
You can see it glistening from the oil,

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.600
I'm sure that's apricot oil.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.268
Let me grab a piece of this.

00:13:41.268 --> 00:13:43.881
(calming music)

00:13:43.881 --> 00:13:44.714
Mm.

00:13:44.714 --> 00:13:47.120
You can definitely taste
the nuttiness of this again.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.097
Possibly walnuts, but then
also possibly apricot seeds.

00:13:51.097 --> 00:13:53.764
(calming music)

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.748
There's also a staple
dish it was just like a,

00:13:58.748 --> 00:13:59.960
it almost looks like a porridge.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.320
And this dish is actually
called molita here.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.610
It looks like it could be wheat made

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:05.943
into kind of a porridge.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.689
Mm, wow.

00:14:11.689 --> 00:14:14.570
That is again, wow.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.420
That tastes like,

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.480
like sour animal sort of.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.700
Wow that's totally unexpected.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.219
You would not even predict that.

00:14:22.219 --> 00:14:24.020
It almost looks like oatmeal.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.820
You'd almost think it tastes like oatmeal.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.430
But that's just a burst of sourness.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.820
They also do have an extra bowl of oil,

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.690
which I believe is apricot oil.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.893
And I think that came
also with the molita.

00:14:33.893 --> 00:14:37.730
(rousing orchestral music)

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.260
Mm, yeah that's definitely apricot oil.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
That goes with the sour, cheesiness.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.170
It's like a cross between
noodles and porridge.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.310
And then finally, to finish the meal

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:47.460
there's a couple of different pancakes.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.690
This one is the sweet pancake, I believe.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.373
Looks like it's kind
of drizzled in a syrup.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.440
Mm, that kind of tastes like molasses.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.860
Maybe it's honey, yeah probably honey.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:03.190
Slightly leathery,
possibly buckwheat pancake.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.616
That's good.

00:15:04.616 --> 00:15:06.050
And it's like juicy.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.250
It's juicy with the honey.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.650
One of the most interesting
meals I've ever had.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.010
- Those greens taste like collard greens,

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.380
surprisingly awesome.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.823
- Final, to finish off the meal.

00:15:16.823 --> 00:15:19.503
I think this is the salty
version of that same pancake.

00:15:20.504 --> 00:15:22.253
Mm, mm.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.640
Yes.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.630
That is a perfect final bite.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.700
The apricot oil is just gushing,

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.070
and the more you chew
the more the apricot oil

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:36.070
just fragrances your entire
mouth and nostril area.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.490
Finally, for dessert we're having tea,

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.550
which is actually not
tea but it's made from

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.840
bozange which is a local herb
grown in these mountains.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.890
Probably grows wild in these mountains,

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.163
and also some kind of cookie fritter.

00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:54.190
Mm, okay to me that immediately
tastes like juniper,

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.280
or like juniper berries.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.090
Or has an evergreen taste to it.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.660
So it's actually called uruzuk.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.661
And there's wheat, there's
egg yolk, and oil in here.

00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:04.211
It looks kind of like a cocoon.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.393
It tastes like a 3D
cracker, kind of crackery.

00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:13.621
And with the drink.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:18.580
Similar to the food in Hunza
that we had the other day,

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.850
oh just yesterday.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.360
But at the same time it was different.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.120
But I don't think we,

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.560
we only had a tiny bit of meat.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.360
There was a little bit of
dairy in the dishes as well

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.440
but almost vegetarian.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.680
Almost completely vegetarian.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.940
A lot of starches, though.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.820
And a lot of whole grains.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.920
From here, we are driving back to Gilgit,

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.330
and then we are actually
tomorrow we'll be catching

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.400
a flight from Gilgit to
Islamabad, Islamabad to Karachi.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.760
And that's gonna complete
this entire Pakistan trip

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.500
food and travel series.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.710
So stay tuned for that.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.410
But for now back to the truck.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.910
I'm just going to take a
nap so I'm going to end

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.870
the video right now.
