EMILY FORTUNA: Hello,
I'm here with Nilay,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.280
and she is one of the program
managers on the Flutter team.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.860
And she also is
the key person who

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.790
is working on building
up our Flutter community.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.840
Nilay, you have
done an amazing job

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.480
at building up the Flutter
community all around the world.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.710
It's-- I am seriously impressed,
and I wanted to ask you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.000
a little bit more about how
you got involved with that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.049
NILAY YENER: I actually
have a story about how

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.340
I started working with Flutter.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.240
So I was working with
the developer communities

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.110
in another team at Google, and
then so with those communities,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.510
they are trying to learn
about Google technologies.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.690
They are running meetups.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.720
They're asking for
some resources.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.480
And all of a sudden,
the communities

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.020
started asking about Flutter.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.900
Oh, we need some
speakers for Flutter.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.570
Can we get some resources?

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.320
And I was like, oh,
what is that, Flutter?

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.370
I should look at that.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.550
Basically, the community
attracted me about Flutter,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.720
and I just looked into that.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.010
And it was a great team.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.361
I'm so happy being in this team.

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:06.360
EMILY FORTUNA: What all
do you take into account

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.305
to build a developer community?

00:01:08.305 --> 00:01:10.680
You got a little bit into
that, but can you tell us more?

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.638
Do you have any advice?

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.780
NILAY YENER: Building
community is not an easy job,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.490
but also it's not impossible.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.190
So it's all about bringing
the right people together.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.670
So if you want to build a
community around something,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.100
you just have to
find the people that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.790
is going to create the
foundation of your community.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.500
They are the people
who is sharing

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.642
the same interest
on shared values,

00:01:30.642 --> 00:01:32.100
and they are trying
to do something

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.370
with their technology.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.220
This will be the
group of people they

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.290
are going to set the
tone of the community

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.910
and the standards
of the community.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.646
EMILY FORTUNA: You work with
the Women Techmakers, I believe.

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:43.020
Can you tell us
a little bit more

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.760
about your
involvement with them?

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.850
NILAY YENER: I was running other
community events for everyone,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.610
and then when we are
looking for speakers,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.440
we got so many
requests, but very

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.690
little-- very less
requests from the women.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.970
But when I did first Women
Techmakers Conference

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.580
in Istanbul, I got 50 women
speakers' submissions.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.270
I was shocked.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.080
Said, why these
women didn't submit

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.550
for the other conference?

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.199
And then I realized that
these kind of initiatives,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.930
it is helping women to feel
more encouraged, more empowered,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.654
so they are participating.

00:02:14.654 --> 00:02:15.570
EMILY FORTUNA: Agreed.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.330
Nilay, thank you so much
for talking with me.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.163
This has been great.
