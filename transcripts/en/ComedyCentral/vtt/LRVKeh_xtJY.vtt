00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:07.907
(low upbeat music)

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.010 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Hey what do you
think my dream means?

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.612
- Probably nothing,
sounds really dumb.

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.180
- I love your hat.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.283 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's the thickest
yamaka I've ever seen.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.686
- Thanks!

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:23.590
- Dude, it's like there's no
place for Islam in America.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.425
- Well, for you there is.

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:28.327
For brown Muslims,
it's worse than ever.

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:29.696
Even in Black Panther.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.365 align:start size:94% position:6%
There's a Muslim terrorist
going, "Wallahi."

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.199
- Really?

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.467
- Yeah.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.702
Wil-kest movie of the
year and there's still

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.603
a Muslim terrorist
with an AK47 going,

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:39.205
"We will kill the
girls, Wallahi."

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.876
- Dude, it's better than
when they go "Alla akbar!"

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:45.612
And then kill everyone.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.047
It's "Allahu akbar."

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:50.483
Just get it right if you're
gonna disgrace the culture.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.551
- Completely.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.119
- Well, guess what.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.054
I'll be your white ally.

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:57.157
Whatever you need,
I got your back.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:00:59.059
- Pay for this meal?

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.327
- No.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.161
- Yes.
- Really?

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.029
- Thank you, my ally.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.866
(sighs)

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:11.171
(soft orchestral music)

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:32.225
(soft orchestral music)

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:36.863
- Dog?

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.102
Hello?

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:44.871
Whose dog is this?

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:47.774
Hey.

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:50.610
Who are you?

00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:54.280
Almost.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.115
Come on.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.284
Hey, do you know
whose dog this is?

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.453 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Nah, but it would suck if
anything were to happen to it.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.721
(gnarling)

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.523 align:start size:84% position:16%
Hey, it's Ramaddan,
do you want some food?

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:06.225
- Rama-nama-dumb shit.

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:08.627
Fuck you, man, you sit up
there in that shitty tower

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:10.797 align:start size:84% position:16%
with your clothes
made by child slaves,

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.299
while I sit here and beg
in the fucking hot sun.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.034 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Dude, I gave
you your clothing.

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:16.269
You're wearing my clothing.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.404
- Yeah, you think I
fucking like this?

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:20.472
(awing)

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:21.807
- Oh my gosh, hi.
- Oh my god, yeah.

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:23.042
- What's her name?

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.477
- Uh, it's Almost.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.478
- That is a great name.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:26.312
- [Hamid] Right.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.480
Yeah.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.981 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Hi, Almost.
- Is she a rescue?

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.650
- No, she just appeared in
my bedroom this morning.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.484
- Oh, my gosh.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.584
- Isn't that crazy?

00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:33.419 align:start size:81% position:19%
- That's so funny.
- Yeah.

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:36.489 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Huh, where are
you guys off to now?

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.492
- Oh, we're going to work,
I deliver food for a living.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.927
(spitting)

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:41.995
- You deliver food?

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:43.897
- Mmm.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.501
- Oh, my god, you're a fucking
loser dude with a capital U.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:52.605
- Almost.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.477
Maybe she just followed
someone in the front door

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:00.646
and then came to your door
'cause she smelled food.

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:03.182 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then your
neighbor let her in

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:04.617
thinking it was yours.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:07.786
- Maybe, or maybe
she's a miracle dog

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:10.690
because she's the
dog from my dream.

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:14.027
- She likes doing that a lot.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.129
- Yeah, she's horny.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.333
- Hamid, I have to
tell you something.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:22.935
- What's up?

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:25.038 align:start size:84% position:16%
- My parents are
trying to set me up.

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:27.540
- Like, on a date?

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:32.211
- Yeah, I mean a
really long date,

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:34.713
like, one where we get married.

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:37.050
- Wait, an arranged marriage?

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.818
Is that even legal?

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:41.119
- I mean, I could
say no, legally,

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.122
but my parents would kill me.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.491 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Perfect, that's great.
- Oh, Hamid, please.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.127
I know this sucks, but
I have to tell you that.

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:50.463
- Who is it?

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.566
- Just a stupid doctor.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.335
- He's a doctor?

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:58.570
- Yeah, he probably won't
even have time for me.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.839 align:start size:84% position:16%
He's always working
or buying cars.

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.509
And he sends me these selfies.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.582
- Oh, my god, he's so creepy.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.917
- Thanks, thanks a lot.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.388
- Maybe you should go.

00:04:16.388 --> 00:04:19.392
