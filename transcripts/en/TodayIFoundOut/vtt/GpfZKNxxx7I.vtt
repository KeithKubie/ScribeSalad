00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.470
Han van Meegeren was born in 1889 and developed
an interest in painting at a young age.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.510
He wasn’t supported in his dream to become
an artist by his father, who forbade van Meegeren’s

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.370
artistic development, trying to steer his
son in the direction of architecture instead.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.870
Undeterred, van Meegeren met Bartus Kortelling—a
teacher and painter—at his school, and Kortelling

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.010
later became van Meegeren’s mentor.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.780
Kortelling loved paintings from the Dutch
Golden Age and likely had a hand in van Meegeren’s

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.960
love of golden age paintings as well.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.720
A particular fan of Johannes Vermeer, Kortelling
showed his protégé how Vermeer mixed his

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.510
colours—a lesson that would have a great
impact on the aspiring artist’s later life.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.290
Still, van Meegeren’s father was not impressed.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.160
He sent his son to school in Delft to become
an architect.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.520
Perhaps he wasn’t aware, but Delft was the
one-time hometown of Vermeer.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.250
Van Meegeren proved to be an adept architect,
but his heart was still set on painting.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.670
He continued his painting lessons and never
took the final exam that would allow him to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.760
become an architect.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.810
Instead, he moved on to art school in The
Hague in 1913.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.290
That same year, he was granted a Gold Medal
from his school in Delft for his painting

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.570
The Study of the Interior of the Church of
Saint Lawrence.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.649
Van Meegeren exhibited his first set of legitimate
paintings in 1917, and they proved to be quite

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.350
popular among critics.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.180
However, as time went on he garnered less
and less attention.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.650
Critics were more interested in the forward-thinking
artists like the Cubists and Surrealists;

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.260
they remarked that van Meegeren had little
to offer because he was focused only on the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.260
past.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.920
He received comments about being unoriginal
and simply “a copycat” without as much

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.019
talent as the great artists who had lived
before him.

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.269
In 1945, van Meegeren declared,

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.220
Driven into a state of anxiety and depression
due to the all-too-meager appreciation of

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.500
my work, I decided, one fateful day, to revenge
myself on the art critics and experts by doing

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.220
something the likes of which the world had
never seen before.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.760
That “something” happened to be “the
perfect forgery.”

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.840
Van Meegeren set out to show the world that
he was just as good as the old artists by

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.950
creating paintings and passing them off as
the old artists’ originals—and make a

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.220
lot of money doing it.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.520
It was easy for him to settle on Vermeer.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.890
He already had a base knowledge of Vermeer
from his mentor, and Vermeer was a good target

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.890
because he’d only produced around 35 paintings—just
a tenth of his contemporaries’ output.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.120
That meant art historians were constantly
on the lookout for undiscovered Vermeers.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.209
The thought that there should be more likely
made it easier for them to believe that they

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.220
saw a new one when they were presented with
one—even if it was a forgery.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.409
Van Meegeren was a careful forger.

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.790
He did extensive research on Vermeer and his
paintings, bought authentic 17th-century canvasses,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.560
and used the original formulas for making
his own paints.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.580
His biggest problem was trying to make the
painting look like it was 300 years old.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.709
Oil paint takes decades to dry completely,
which meant that a newer painting would be

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.140
found out the moment someone touched it.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.180
He was forced to experiment with the original
paint formulas and baking his paintings in

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.180
an oven.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.120
Most of the paints burned or melted, but he
found using phenol formaldehyde on a finished

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.080
painting would make the paint harden.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.780
When it was finished baking, he would roll
a cylinder over it to make more cracks, making

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.209
it look more legitimate.

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.189
Once the process of creating old-looking paintings
was perfected, van Meegeren had another obstacle:

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.920
the content of the paintings.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.730
At first, he painted pictures much like those
that Vermeer had painted, but he found that

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.110
experts looked too closely at them and detected
little differences between the real thing

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.110
and the forgery.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.480
He ended up taking a gamble and painting something
completely different than what Vermeer painted,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.720
but with hints of Vermeer’s style.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.050
The result?

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.240
Millions of dollars straight into van Meegeren’s
pockets.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.020
It was his famous “Christ at Emmaus” painting
that allowed van Meegeren to break into the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.020
market.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.600
The painting was larger than anything Vermeer
had done, and it had religious subject matter,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.400
which was also different.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.909
But art historians had speculated that Vermeer
had painted something like “Christ at Emmaus”

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:46.370
for some time, and they were eager to believe
that the painting really was Vermeer’s.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.330
He even fooled Abraham Bredius, an art historian
who had a reputation for authenticating new

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.330
Vermeers.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.000
The historian wrote an article on “Christ
at Emmaus,” saying,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.020
It is a wonderful moment in the life of a
lover of art when he finds himself suddenly

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.010
confronted with a hitherto unknown painting
by a great master, untouched, on the original

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.800
canvas, and without any restoration, just
as it left the painter’s studio!

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.800
And what a picture!

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.110
… I am inclined to say the masterpiece of
Johannes Vermeer of Delft…

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.480
Van Meegeren continued to churn out paintings
with religious subject matter, and they continued

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.510
to be snapped up by art enthusiasts.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.669
By the time he was found out, he’d made
$30 million on his forgeries (about $400 million

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:29.669
today).

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.250
Unfortunately, his incredible success ended
up being his undoing.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.220
During World War II, Hermann Goerring—“the
No. 2 man in Nazi Germany”—traded 137

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.420
paintings for van Meegeren’s forgery “Christ
with the Woman Taken in Adultery.”

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.110
Unfortunately for van Meegeren, Goerring kept
meticulous papers regarding his transactions.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.140
At the end of World War II, van Meegeren’s
name was found next to the trade for the Vermeer,

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.100
and he was arrested in 1945 for “collaborating
with the enemy.”

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.089
The allegations might have carried a death
sentence, and so van Meegeren was forced to

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:02.810
out himself as a forger.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.870
He claimed responsibility for the painting
of the Vermeer that Goerring had bought, along

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.539
with five other Vermeer paintings and two
Pieter de Hooghs, all of which had been “discovered”

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.630
after 1937.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.710
The astonished court room had him paint another
forgery in front of them to prove it, and

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.270
when he passed the test his charges were changed
to forgery and he was sentenced to just one

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.560
year in prison, which was the minimum prison
sentence for such a crime.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.149
Rather than be angry with van Meegeren, the
Dutch public largely lauded him as a hero.

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:36.080
During his trial, he presented himself as
a patriot—he had, after all, secured 137

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.599
paintings that had been unlawfully seized
by Goerring by duping the famous Nazi into

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.760
thinking he’d purchased a real Vermeer.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.909
As van Meegeren said, “How could a person
demonstrate his patriotism, his love of Holland

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.560
more than I did by conning the great enemy
of the Dutch people?”

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.830
Van Meegeren never served his one year in
prison.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.680
He died of a heart attack two months after
his two-year trial.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.010
Until the end, he believed that—when he
was gone—his name would soon be forgotten,

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:20.800
and his paintings would eventually be remembered
as true Vermeers.
