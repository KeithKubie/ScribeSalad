&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
I'm Stephanie Marcus

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.640
from the Science, Technology,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.200
and Business Division
here at the Library.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.440
I want to welcome you
to our lecture today.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.540
We are going to spend a
day on Titan and it's going

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.760
to be really cold so you L.L.
Bean parkas are not going

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.440
to do you any good at
minus what, 288 degrees?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.740
&gt;&gt; Melissa Trainer: Fahrenheit.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.040
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Fahrenheit.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.490
Which is what we're
used to [laughter].

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.320
Yes. So this ought to be fun.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.600
Recently we were cleaning
out our files in my Division

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.020
and they were really old.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.500
But we're trying to be way
modern, so we're throwing

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.510
out all the old things
and keeping a few things

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.800
that looked interesting
for historical purposes.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.460
And I took the Saturn folder
and it was filled with pamphlets

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.470
from NASA on the Pioneer mission
and the Voyager missions,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.910
and I found one on
Titan and I --

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.040
actually there was a <i>Washington
Post </i>Special Supplement all

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.340
about Titan.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.740
And it was dated December, 1980.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.080
So none of you -- well, at
least your kids were not here.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.730
And I just want to
read you what it said.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.280
Near the end it says, "Titan
has now become a prime candidate

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.120
for a future space mission.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.310
One idea already being toyed
with is to put a spacecraft

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.330
in orbit around Titan,
and then float a balloon

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.290
in its atmosphere,
and land a small robot

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.660
on its frozen ocean surface.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.790
If Carl Sagan is correct,
and the ocean is liquid,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.450
the robot lander would radio
that fact back before it sinks

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.930
into the ammonia and water seas.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.700
Can a mission like that --

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.680
can a mission that
difficult be made to work?"

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.070
Well, you probably heard

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.870
that last year the
Cassini-Huygens mission ended

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.980
with the spacecraft plunging
into the atmosphere of Saturn.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.340
But in 2005 it had
landed the Huygens' probe

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.240
on the surface of Titan.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.430
So today we have Melissa
Trainer from NASA who has gotten

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.160
that data and has
been working on this

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.470
and can tell us what
she has learned

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.100
and what they plan
for the future.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.010
I'll have to tell
you who she is.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.060
She's a Research Space Scientist
and the Associate Lab Chief

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.190
of the Planetary
Environments Lab at NASA Goddard

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.670
out in Greenbelt, Maryland.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.560
She earned her BA in Chemistry
at Franklin and Marshall College

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.080
in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and
then got her PhD in Chemistry

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.350
at the University
of Colorado Boulder.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.420
So please help me
welcome Melissa Trainer

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.510
to the Library of Congress.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.050
[ Applause ]

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.350
&gt;&gt; Melissa Trainer: All right.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.650
Well, thank you, thank
you so much, Stephanie,

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.410
and to the Library of
Congress for inviting me here.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.340
I'm so delighted to be here and
to be talking to you all today.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.270
And I'm just so excited about
the audience that I have here,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.570
including all of your students.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.130
So, thank you, guys, for
spending part of your trip

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.500
to the Capitol here
listening to my lecture.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.980
So as we just mentioned,
we've learned a lot

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.160
about Titan since 1980.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.640
The vision of a mission
architecture that was described

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.150
in that article of the
orbiter and the balloon

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.970
and the surface lander didn't
totally come to fruition.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.300
But I'll discuss a little bit

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.110
about what the Cassini-Huygens
mission was

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.130
like and what it found.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.700
Spoiler alert -- no
oceans of methane

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.900
or ethane all over the surface.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.360
But there are lakes near the
Pole, so there were places

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.050
that we could have
splashed down.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.840
So I'm going to spend some
time talking about the science

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.870
of Titan, what we've
learned about Titan,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.700
and then what are some
future exploration options

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.750
for our next step to
learn more about Titan.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.030
And that's a mission
concept that's currently

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.710
in work right now
that I'm a part

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.010
of called the Dragonfly Mission.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.660
So I'll give you
one group's vision

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.540
of what we should be
doing at Titan next.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.380
So, information about Titan.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.690
It is the largest
of Saturn's moons.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.900
There are 62 of them, but
you can see in this sort

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.500
of family portrait that
it is the largest by far.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.640
And it was discovered originally
in 1655 by Christian Huygens,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.430
the namesake for the
probe that we sent there.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.160
And it's actually the
second largest moon

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.380
in the whole solar
system after Ganymede,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.550
which is a moon [inaudible].

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.240
The assertion of Titan,
harkening back, again,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.300
here's the name of term Voyager
when Voyager did its flyby

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.990
through the solar system.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.000
Voyager One, and we could
see there was previous data

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.490
that there was likely
an atmosphere

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.720
around Titan just based on how
it looked through telescopes

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.380
or ground-based observation.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.010
And that was confirmed in
1944 by retrieving spectra

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.250
of the moon that showed gases
were present in the atmosphere,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.550
and that includes methane.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.480
And then we got this photo
here, and you can see, you know,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.150
Titan looks like
this fuzzy ball,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.980
and then we can see these
layers up high in the atmosphere

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.160
that tells us that there's not
only gases in the atmosphere

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.720
but also solid particles.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.380
You can think of them as
sort of a haze or a smog.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.060
And this comes from
photochemistry that takes place

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.840
up high in the atmosphere.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.700
And so this kicks off
this idea that Titan is --

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.760
well, we like to think of
it as this organic factory.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.540
We have some methane
gas, so that's CH4,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.770
carbon with four hydrogens.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.140
And then there's nitrogen and
the chemistry that's induced

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.850
with those gases,
with either sunlight

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.720
or energetic electrons coming
in the top of the atmosphere,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.600
starts this synthesis of these
really large organic molecules.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.750
And we're only just sort
of learning what they are.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.000
But because of that you have
organic chemistry abound.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.930
And we think about habitability
and what it might be important

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.900
for life in location and
our planetary environment.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.790
That's one of the
big criteria we think

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.980
of because we know our
own biochemistry --

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.080
you and me and the trees and
everything that we eat is made

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.990
up of carbon chemistry and
so we think that that is

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.770
at least one view of what is
needed for life as we know it.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.500
And so Titan is, you
know, abound in it.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.830
Mars we're going and we're
looking for little tiny pieces

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.920
of it in the rocks,
but Titan's full of it.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.340
The other thing that's
cool about Titan is

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.100
that it's actually the only
moon in the solar system

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.940
that has a substantial
atmosphere at all.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.730
And what's interesting is
it's also mostly a background

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.250
of nitrogen gas which should
sound somewhat familiar

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.280
because that's the
background gas that we have

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.120
in the Earth's atmosphere
here, too.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.540
Let's see.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.210
It's mostly nitrogen, has a
few percent of the methane,

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.350
and then, also, some hydrogen.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.100
As I mentioned, it's
the only satellite

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.400
that has a dense atmosphere.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.490
You can see here's
the -- is Ganymede.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.220
That's the one that's
just slightly bigger.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.180
These are the Galilean
satellites around Jupiter.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.160
And it also has the second
highest surface pressure

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.460
of all the solid bodies.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.760
Okay, so what does that mean?

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.070
Its surface is actually
greater than Earth.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.860
It has a denser atmosphere
than Earth -- 1.5 times.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.480
If you were standing on
the surface of Titan,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.980
it would be 1.5 times the
pressure as we experience

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.800
on the surface of Earth,
much less so than Venus.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.100
Venus is the winner

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.790
of the terrestrial bodies
in our solar system.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.030
But many of the other
bodies compared to here,

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.150
Mars has a much thinner
atmosphere and then the moon

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.020
and Mercury, et cetera, are
considered airless bodies.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.880
Exploration of Titan,
as we discussed --

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.080
Pioneer fly-bys in '79,
Voyager One and Voyager 2

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.040
in the early '80s
were able to fly-by

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.330
and get images such
as you see here.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.920
This look that Titan has
in this type of view --

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.810
it's sort of this
fuzzy orange ball.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.400
That was all we could
see for a very long time.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.900
And that's because of this
haze, these particulates

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.200
that are in the atmosphere.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.650
The atmosphere is very
thick and it's hard

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.950
to see down to the surface.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.270
So we think often of Titan as
having been behind a veil prior

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.000
to the Cassini-Huygens mission
when we were really able to get

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.930
up close and personal
and get an idea

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.350
of what was hiding underneath.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.880
And this is why we weren't sure.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.420
Maybe, you know, some
chemical model suggested

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.400
that the whole surface
could be an ocean.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.040
And we weren't entirely sure
what we were going to find

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.190
on the surface until
we were able to go.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.100
There was some imaging
showing surface features

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.400
with telescopes.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.400
And these were both taken after
Cassini either had been designed

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.360
or after it was on its way

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.330
and at Saturn just
showing differences

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.800
in the surface reflection
and giving us an idea, okay,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.060
it's not a homogenous surface.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.680
Something -- there are
some differences here,

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.680
but we don't really
know, well, what are they

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.130
and what is the surface made of?

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.410
This -- here are just
some facts for Titan,

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.350
just to give you an idea of --

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.530
the average diameter is
about 5000 kilometers.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.400
The surface gravity, I
always like to mention that.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.960
It's about 1/7 that
of Earth, right?

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.190
So if you weigh something
like 150 pounds on Earth,

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.220
You'd weigh 21 pounds on Titan.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.720
And everything else
would feel lighter.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.110
The surface pressure I mentioned
is greater than that of Earth.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.440
And [inaudible] it's very, very
cold there, so I often think

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.100
in Kelvins when I go
to low temperatures

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.430
as a temperature
unit -- 94 Kelvins.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.960
What is -- so the rest of us,
you think about weather, right.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.040
Minus 290 Fahrenheit would be
the temperature there, yes.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.470
So you're going to need a lot
more than a North Base parka.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.040
And then the other really cool
thing -- because it's so cold,

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.960
I love this Earth
analogy for Titan.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.640
The bedrock there is
actually made of water ice

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.000
and not silicate rock
like we have on Earth.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.170
So you can think of it in
some ways as an equivalent.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:47.030
So it's so cold that the frozen
water is as hard as rock,

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:51.040
but if you had some
kind of volcano --

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.600
we'll talk about cryovolcanoes
-- or lave erupting,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.070
instead of it being molten
rock, it could be water ice

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.050
or other liquids that
contain a water composition.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.270
So there's a lot of similarities
to the way that rock we have

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.160
on Earth, water ice on Titan.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.410
And that's going to
become important later

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.910
when we talk more about
prebiotic chemistry.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.750
Another thing the
Cassini mission didn't --

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.300
it wasn't an orbiter around
Titan, but it did do many,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.600
many fly-bys and I'll show
all of those in a moment.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.090
We discovered that Titan is what
we would call an ocean world,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.560
and that's because it has an
interior liquid water ocean.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.950
And we could just tell this
as the orbiter is flying by

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.690
and making very precise
measurements with how far it is

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.300
from Earth and how it's kind
of getting tugged and pulled

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.060
by the tidal forces
around Titan.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.240
We could see that it has
variable tidal forces

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.030
which tells us there is
liquid in that center.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.990
And, as I mentioned,
making an analogy to Earth,

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.860
in this case it would be liquid
water or primarily liquid water.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.190
And so this cross section
is our current prediction

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.330
of what we think that
interior looks like.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.800
So you would have a
global subsurface ocean.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.670
It would be covered
in this ice shell.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.610
We're not sure how
thick that is.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.990
And that is sort
of what we think

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.290
of as bedrock or the crust.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.920
And then we have this atmosphere
making all these organic

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.050
molecules, and those
rain down on the surface

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.690
and they coat the surface
sort of like a soil,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.890
so you've got this
organic soil on top

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.040
of this really frozen water ice.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.570
And, again, I mentioned
habitability,

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.160
and we mentioned things where we
consider ingredients for life --

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.710
organic molecules and other
nutrients are a part of that.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.480
But water is always
part of that, too,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.980
at least for life as we know it.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.970
And Titan always inspires
conversations about life

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.970
as we don't know it, but we'll
put that over here for now.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.060
Is that now we've got organics
and we have this potential

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.580
for some kind of liquid water to
be mixing with those organics.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.340
And that starts to sound a
lot more about what we picture

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.310
in a habitable environment.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.730
But it's very, very cold, so
we'll talk in a minute about,

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.110
well, how do you
actually get that mix in?

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.550
So a little bit more info
on the Cassini orbiter

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.850
and the Huygens probe.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.150
So this picture here, you see
with the person for scale --

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.190
this is the probe inside
its little air shell.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.890
And then here it is bolted
to the side of the orbiter.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.600
The orbiter is huge.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.650
And there's sort of a desk
chair and a desk down here.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.450
That gives you a little
bit of a sense of scale.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.450
And then this is a diagram that
just points out where several

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.270
of the scientific
instruments are.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.830
So, again, the Huygens
probe is on the side.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.580
Cassini was an orbiter around
Saturn, and then when it got

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.600
into the right position
it launched

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.580
that probe towards Titan
and then used the rest

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.470
of its instruments
to study Saturn

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.280
and the whole Saturnian system

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.020
for the time that
it was in orbit.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:44.020
This shows all of the orbits
that Cassini made around Saturn,

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.360
all these different lines.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.480
And I tried to highlight
here the Titan's orbit.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.780
So Saturn's here in the middle.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.080
Here's Titan's orbit.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.920
So you can see many of those
fly-bys were near Titan

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.220
at different distances.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.100
And every time it got close
to Titan we had the ability

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.450
to do imaging or
radar measurements

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.580
or compositional measurements
of the upper atmosphere.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.840
And that's how we've learned
everything that we could,

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.770
and these numbered 126
close fly-bys of Titan.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.160
So the fly-bys we consider
that were sufficient

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.710
to get a lot of good
information.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.460
So [inaudible] the
year Saturn and Titan.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:22.360
So Saturn's years 29.5 or our
Earth years, so close to 30.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.470
And Titan travelled to Saturn

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.670
so Titan's year is
the exact same length.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.490
Saturn has an axial tilt

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.330
that also provides Titan's
tilt relative to the sun.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.390
And so because of that, Titan
is going to have seasons just

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.230
like we experience
here on Earth.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.540
They're just going
to be a lot slower.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.300
So you can see these dates here.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.600
The Northern Winter
Solstice in October, 2002,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.900
and they didn't get

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.840
to the Spring Equinox
until 2009, right?

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.930
So that's a really
extended year.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:58.120
Titan's day is defined by
its orbit around Saturn.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.420
And another fun fact, that
Titan is tightly locked

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.450
in a synchronous rotation
with Saturn which is similar

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.750
to our own moon to us.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.270
So if you were -- you can't sit
on Saturn, but if you could sit

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.940
on Saturn and gaze
at Titan in the sky,

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.040
you'd always see the
same side of Titan just

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.410
like we always see the
same side of our moon.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:21.980
So this graphic here kind of
shows the orbit of Saturn and,

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.290
therefore, Titan
going around the sun.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.400
And what the Cassini
mission looks like in terms

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.710
of a single Saturn year --

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.930
you see, it didn't even
complete that full year.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.920
This is kind of another
fun way to think about it.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.580
You won't be able to read it,
but this gives you the idea of,

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.900
again, from the perspective
of a Saturn year, if we relate

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.010
that to our year, it says if
Cassini arrived in mid-January

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.330
and crashed into
Saturn in late June.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.250
So, again, not even a full year.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.450
Just a part of what it was like.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:57.210
So when we think about observing
long-term trends, you know,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.400
we hadn't really even been
there for an entire year.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.240
So a lot of times
when we see something,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.150
we can make predictions
about how it might repeat.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.150
But Cassini itself is
not going to be able

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.750
to satisfy our knowledge
for whether

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.030
or not those predictions
are correct.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.170
Here's some nice views of Titan

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.760
with the imaging
science subsystem.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.280
This is a full-color image,
again, you see that orange ball.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.230
But if we look at certain
key windows in the spectrum

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.600
where we can see all the
way through that atmosphere,

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.920
past those particles, down
to the surface, you can start

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.990
to see some more
surface features.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.760
Here's another view.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.380
The VIM Spectrometer, Visual
Imaging Mapping Spectrometer

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.420
that we've used to learn as
lot about the Titan surface.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.200
So depending and
wavelengths you're looking in

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.810
and how you're studying it is
how we've been able to sort

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.270
of penetrate that
veil that I mentioned

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.080
to learn more about Titan.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:54.420
Here's a map that was generated
at the infrared wavelengths,

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.790
and we'll call out some more of
these features in more detail.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.540
But, you know, this is how
we start to get a picture

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.490
of what Titan is actually like.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.110
All these differences between
dark and bright are places

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.120
where the light is either
reflected strongly or absorbed.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.960
We infer a lot of information
about compositional differences.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.030
We may not know exactly what
this material is, but we can say

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.420
that this is not the
same thing as this

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.460
because they look different,
right, in this image.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.980
One thing -- a couple
of things we'll notice,

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.500
and I'll show closer pictures,
that we have this band

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.640
of darker materials
across the equator, right?

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.030
We can see small features
that start to look

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.190
like craters in there.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.890
And, again, not a global ocean.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.320
You can kind of see in this
image some peppering, though,

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.490
of what we discovered
were lakes near the Poles,

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:45.310
especially near the northern
Pole -- larger seas, really.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.470
This is another image
using radar.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.870
So we overlay radar measurements
on those visual images

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.810
and that gives us better
information on the topography

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:59.140
and where something might
actually be a different altitude

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.530
or have a different
roughness in addition

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.310
to just having a
different light interaction.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.310
So here's one of the
really cool things we found.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.610
Looking at those belts

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:13.230
around the equator,
we found sand dunes.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:14.920
And, you know, we
all experience --

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.010
many of you may have been
near sand dunes on Earth,

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.620
so you kind of have a feel
of what sand dunes are like.

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.590
Now on Titan, the sand, again,

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:24.710
isn't going to be a
ground-up silicate rock

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.670
like we're used to on Earth.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.540
In this case, what we suspect
it is is the organic material

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.300
that's raining down,
these particulates raining

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.100
down from the sky, and some kind

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.050
of interphysical interaction
might lead to them growing

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.360
into larger particles
and blowing around

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.660
and forming these
dune structures.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.380
Maybe there's some water
ice mingled in there.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.690
Again, we're not entirely
sure what they are,

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.090
but we can make a lot
of inferences based

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:54.340
on their direction and how they
are shaped and how they move,

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.400
about how big they might be,
because we have some ideas

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.580
of how windy it can be on Titan.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.430
And so here just some -- I
just love some of these images.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.010
They're a little harder
to see on the projector.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.920
Hopefully those of you --
the screen can see better.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.940
So we have this whole
narrow belt of sand dunes.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.410
Then again under these
sand dunes, in places --

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.230
interdune spaces, sort of
where the sand dune comes down,

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.420
we expect that there's access

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.750
to that water ice bedrock
there in-between those.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.050
We also see impact craters.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.230
Now Titan has a very thick
atmosphere which is going

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.270
to slow down and burn up
enough small impactors

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.260
that you're not going to
get peppered dots everywhere

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.800
like you do on places
like Mercury

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.220
or the moon and airless bodies.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.720
So on Titan we only see impact
craters that are pretty large

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.750
that made it all the
way to the surface.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.030
And then the other
interesting thing again,

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.660
because Titan has this
dense atmosphere, we know --

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.760
we already see sand dunes,
so we know there's sort

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.560
of the interaction of wind
erosion on the surface.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.650
We learned that it rains
on Titan occasionally.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:59.790
In this case it rains
methane rain, not water rain,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.610
because Titan's so cold
that methane, actually,

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:07.770
is the substance that can appear
in ice and liquid and gas.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.070
Because of that we
have the ability --

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.270
Titan has the ability to erode
things like impact craters.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.850
So then we can study these
impact craters and learn

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.870
about how they've been
transformed over time possibly

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.190
by the Titan environment.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.950
And, again, for a lot
of us, we're talking

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.100
about crazy things --
methane rain and organic sand

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.840
and maybe cryovolcanoes
of water and ammonia.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.170
So it sounds really exotic,
but at the same time,

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:36.630
these are very familiar features
and very familiar processes

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.040
to those of us who study the
Earth and study other planets.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.680
And I think that's probably
why I love Titan so much,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.020
and why people are so
fascinated with it.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.730
And so with an impact crater,

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.770
what we expect happened is
you have an impact and, again,

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.010
if you have enough energy put
into that water ice crust,

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.610
just like on Earth you could
get melted rock in an impact.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.500
On Titan you'd get melted
water coming from the impact.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.850
And if it's a big enough impact
and you deliver enough energy,

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.020
you could have melted water
present on the surface

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.090
for actually really
long periods of time.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.270
Maybe 10,000 years, depending --

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.990
more than that, depending
on the size of the impactor.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:16.260
So as cold as it is, we
do have this possibility

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.570
that there have been
periods in the past

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.250
with transient liquid
water on the surface.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.360
And so, again, let's
take all those organics

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.690
that are made in the atmosphere.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.440
Maybe they're around
their coating surface

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.740
when this impact comes in.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.240
And now you've got a melt pool,
and you have this potential

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.260
for a lot of interesting
chemistry.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.880
Here's some other
tectonic features.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.560
We know that we see
mountains kind

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.710
of along here in these areas.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.010
Here's some others.

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.090
They're not super tall
mountains, although this one,

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.250
actually 10,000 feet,
that's nothing to sneeze at.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.810
That's a decent size mountain.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.970
So we see a lot of topography
on the Titan surface.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.950
So this idea of -- cryovulcanism
is one of the things --

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.120
I heard someone say you can say
it in a room of Titan scientists

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.260
and you'll start a fight
because no one can agree

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.370
on whether it happens or not.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.430
But it's certainly possible.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.700
And so we've been searching
for evidence in imaging data

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.540
and the radar data to see
if it's possibly there.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.900
This is one feature that's been
pointed to as possible evidence

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:20.330
where we see what looks like a
central dome and possibly flows

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.630
that are overlaying

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.590
and interfering with
dune structures.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.290
And so that could be a
potential cryovolcano.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.590
And, again, we're
interested in that

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.890
because that's another
opportunity --

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.260
melted water coming out
and over onto the surface

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.040
or water-ammonia mixtures.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.520
So as cold as Titan is,
there's this potential

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.110
to have water coming out and
then placing on the surface

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.480
and interacting with
the environment.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.450
This shows a different view
of what that image looks like.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:51.140
Again, what looks potentially
a volcanic crater in there.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.440
And we see channels.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.220
We see lots of channels that
we can grow the evidence

00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:00.810
of fluvial action, so rain
coming down and forming streams,

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:06.010
and flowing into maybe temporary
lakes or seas on the surface,

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.310
depending on the season.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.460
This is one of of my
favorite ones here.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.290
I mean, if I just
change the color

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.090
on that you couldn't tell me
that that wasn't Earth, right?

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.530
A river channel on Earth.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.960
But in this case it would
be liquid methane raining

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.850
on the surface and
flowing around.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:23.850
And again, we discovered
lakes and seas, particularly

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.170
around the North Pole.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.500
This is a good image here.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.890
This lake here, Lake
Giamari [assumed spelling],

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.270
is pretty close to the size

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.010
of Lake Superior in
the United States.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.460
This is a very --
lake or sea, you know,

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.130
it depends on your perspective.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.320
But it's a very substantial
body of water.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.700
And these other ones
down here have connectors

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.210
where it's actually a
significant system there.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.580
I actually -- years and
years ago, as part of --

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.510
Mission helped us
to study [inaudible]

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.010
that was really a boat that
was flushed down into one

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.040
of those lakes and flowed
around take measurements.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.010
So the Huygens probe,
that was another way

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.630
that we got a view
of the surface.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.640
This was a probe
that was released --

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.500
it's from Cassini and floated
down through the atmosphere.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.620
Titan, you see partly
on parachute

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:09.920
and landed on the surface.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.900
And it took measurements,
chemical measurements,

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.090
and images on its whole way down
and then it lived on the surface

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.220
for about 70 minutes afterwards.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.510
And this is one of the
main photos that it got

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.850
from the surface, kind of
sitting and looking out.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.520
And these pebbles that we see,
these are thought to be, again,

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.120
made of water ice,
that have been eroded

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.190
into round pebbles somehow.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.400
And I think this one is
probably just a couple

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.700
of centimeters across.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.570
You know, very -- you know,
skewed perspective looking

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.890
from just the eye
camera of the lander.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.570
And here's kind of a fun
image showing the moon,

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.750
an equivalent type perspective

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.980
of the moon surface
with a similar scale.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.490
So that gives you an idea that's
a footprint, what size that is.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.040
We've also noticed,
as I mentioned, rain,

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.470
cloud and weather patterns.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:59.870
Because Titan has
thick atmosphere

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.000
and it has the methane
which serves as a similar

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.190
to a hydrological cycle
on Earth, we see things

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:10.460
like convective clouds and
thunderstorms and rain events.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.260
And we were actually able
to witness this image.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.560
So it's clouds.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.860
And I don't think I
have a picture here,

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.240
but we were actually able
to witness a rain event

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.450
through observations of Titan
where you could see kind

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.600
of a cloud come in and then

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.090
after it was gone the ground
looked wetter or darker.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.880
And then after some
time, it looked back

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.700
to the lighter color again
which suggests, again,

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.280
soaking of the ground and
then drying out of the ground.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.330
So, again, similar but
really different, right?

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.110
It's kind of a [inaudible]
a fascinating place.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.520
And then again, get back to
the complex organic chemistry.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.310
So this was hinted at even
before we arrived at Titan.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.370
Just by looking at
the haze and looking

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.890
at the spectral features we
could tell there was some --

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.530
a lot of carbon and
nitrogen bonds in there.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.800
And here by -- in
our fly-bys of Titan,

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.860
a lot of them were
actually close enough

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.180
into the atmosphere -- we have
an instrument called a mass

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.210
spectrometer that can
sniff in the gas as well

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.430
as the very small particles
and look at their composition.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.680
And what we see, and
also visually see,

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.960
just lots of molecules that
kind of look like that.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.550
And I don't know how
far any of you have gone

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.870
in organic chemistry, right,
so you've got all these

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:19.540
like the ball and stick
models here showing carbons

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.840
and hydrogens.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.840
So you see things like propane
or -- that you might use,

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.160
you know, to barbecue,
acetylene,

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.700
hydrogen cyanide, right?

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.660
That's a -- not a good one.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.450
We do see a little
bit of carbon dioxide.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.420
Things like that we can
confirm definitively.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.820
And then we also see what
this spectrum is kind

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.500
of telling you is
that there's a lot

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.940
of complex molecules
going far out.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.280
They just get bigger and
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.220
So as I mentioned,
this organic engine,

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.530
this big synthesis process.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:54.800
But part of our questions are,
you know, these molecules,

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.100
and the kinds of things we make

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.400
when we just starting
adding carbons and hydrogens

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.700
and these long chains, right?

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.000
That's a lot more like gasoline,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.490
like a gasoline slick you
might come across, right?

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:03.990
It's not necessarily we
think of when we think

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:05.820
of prebiotic chemistry.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.830
And so part of our question
is at some point can we get

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.870
to the level of complexity where
you have more like oxygens going

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.770
in there, things that
look more like amino acids

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.570
or nuclear bases or the types
of molecules that we think

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.500
of as the kind of
complexity that's more similar

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.800
to biochemistry?

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.860
And that's just an open question
that we have about Titan again.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.030
These measurements are made
about a thousand kilometers up,

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.850
way, way up, not at the surface.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.150
This is another graphic
that kind of captures

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.120
where the Titan sits in the
[inaudible] system in terms

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.220
of this complex organic
chemistry, right?

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.470
It's actually got
the, other than Earth,

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.300
the most complex organic
cycle that we know

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.900
about in the solar system.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.360
And so this is a comparison,
this graphic, of the level

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.510
of complexity of molecules
on these left bars in terms

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.880
of the size of how big they
are, that we've measured,

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.180
as well as the abundance.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.110
And is you look at, you know --
Titan has a lot of molecules,

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:58.490
but they're pretty small.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.560
So it's a place like Venus.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.200
Venus has a lot of
carbon and carbon dioxide,

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.500
but not big molecules here.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.800
Again, same thing for Mars.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.150
Lots of carbon and
carbon dioxide,

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.880
but so far we've only measured
a couple of small molecules.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.180
Earth we know.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.140
Obviously we can measure it
the best because we're all here

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.440
with out fancy instruments.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.520
But we know it has
big, big molecules,

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.820
the kinds of things
that -- in our DNA.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:22.030
And Titan, again, we know
it has these really big

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.330
complex molecules.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:24.670
We know it has a lot of it.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.580
And then the question is, but
exactly what are they all like?

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.750
And can we find molecules in
there that might be of interest

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.450
to -- for more of the
prebiotic chemistry

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.990
and astrobiology perspective?

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:39.450
This is just again a cartoon
just to kind of bring it --

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:40.750
I keep saying it [inaudible].

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.270
So Titan is this
mysterious moon, right?

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.280
It's covered with all
these unusual materials,

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.580
these exotic materials.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.880
They're talking about
methane rain.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.970
You're talking about
ammonia water volcanoes.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.850
But at the same time there're so
many features about it that are

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:58.600
so similar to our own Earth,
and we can study geology there

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.870
and learn a lot about
what's going on there just

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.130
by making comparisons
to what we already know.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.210
And the atmospheric processes
and as well as this, again,

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.610
this methane cycle and how
often does it really rain and,

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.060
you know, do you get --

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.550
we've only seen a
small part of the year.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.900
Do you have other periods --
do we have a rainy period maybe

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.890
where the south gets
lots of lakes and seas.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.930
And then, finally,
we're interested

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.210
in seeing Titan parts
astrobiology perspective.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.780
Again, carbon and water,
and we have sunlight.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.480
We have all these ingredients
we tend to think of.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.780
And one thing I'll point out.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:35.660
You know, myself and lots of
other scientists love going

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.100
into lab and trying to
mimic the chemistry you

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.400
that you see on Titan.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.870
So we build these chambers
and we radiate them

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.620
with sunlight or, you know,
blast them with electrons,

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.550
and we can make complex
organics.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.270
They just kind of look
like that, that look a lot,

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.950
have a lot of similar
features to those,

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.330
based on what we
can see at Titan.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.200
And what a lot of
experimenters have shown is

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.260
that if you take those complex
molecules and you put them

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.060
in water or water-ammonia
mixtures,

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.930
and you hydrolyze them, and
you're just very, very patient.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.670
And so what we do is we tend to
run them at warmer temperatures

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.800
to speed up reactions that could
take actually like millions

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.860
of years or 10,000 years.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.950
We know that we can see evidence

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.370
of a very interesting
prebiotic chemistry.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.010
So things like amino acids and
nuclear bases has been shown

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:20.460
in the lab, that you
can make those things

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.230
if you just have those
organics sitting in water,

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.090
and you can wait a while.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:28.250
And so we kind of want to know,
well, I can do that in the lab,

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.970
but it's not really
what's happening on Titan.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.760
So where would we go to look
for this kind of biochemistry

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.050
or prebiotic molecules
or biomolecules,

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.350
whatever we want to call it?

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.700
So we'd want to look at
places where we think organics

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.110
and water have in
some way intermingled.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:49.070
And so this is a very
complicated cartoon.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.630
But it highlights
a couple of things.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:56.170
So we've got this
possibility of our steep ocean

00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.040
and our ice crust with
organics on the surface.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.750
And if we have any cryovolcanoes
and cryolava I'm placing

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:04.480
on the surface, then
there's places

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.060
where it would intermingle
organics

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.490
and water on the surface there.

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.460
This doesn't show a
specific impact but I kind

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.760
of painted that picture.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.060
If you have an impactor come in,

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.900
you have this impact
melt mingling

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.680
and more stuff depositing in it.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.920
Then that's another place you
could expect to find evidence

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.250
of this kind of chemistry, maybe
in a frozen-over impact melt.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.390
And then we also -- what
we really don't know --

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.570
we don't know is
there a connection

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:29.990
between the surface
and this deep ocean?

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.540
Like on Earth we have places
where there's volcanoes,

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.730
where there's what we
call subduction zones,

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.350
where you can then
have the cycling.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.800
We don't know if
this happen on Titan.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.100
We have no idea.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.400
We don't even know how thick
this crust is, so we don't know

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.950
if there's places where kind
of you get any connection.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.830
Or are they totally,
totally separated?

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.200
We don't know the
answer to that question.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.000
But if there was some
kind of connection,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.530
you could imagine some really
fascinating stuff going

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.770
on in this deep, deep ocean.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:58.170
So the next step -- you know,
we have learned so much of this

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.280
from Cassini and from Huygens

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.520
that has basically just brought
us more questions, right?

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.080
Every time we go, we learn more.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.480
That makes us want to
go back and, you know.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.080
But now we know better some

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.380
of the things we're
looking for, right?

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.400
We know we're not
going to splash

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.260
down in a 10 meter [inaudible].

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.670
And so our next -- so we --

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.280
some of the questions
that we're asking --

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.480
I've kind of been
sorting to pose them --

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.600
what makes any planet
or moon habitable?

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.930
Is Titan -- what do we
call Titan habitable

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.230
from most certain perspective.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:32.820
And what chemical processes
led to the development of life?

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.120
Carl Sagan, who was referenced
earlier, he really loved Titan

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.420
because we liked
to think about it

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.800
as this frozen prebiotic Earth.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.370
So this idea -- if we could
go back to Earth billions

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.170
and billions of years ago,
before life was everywhere,

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.570
there might have been
a chemistry going

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.870
on in the atmosphere and on the
surface that resembled something

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:51.290
of what Titan's like today.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.330
It's like if you took it and
you were able to move it way out

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:54.630
and just freeze it in place.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:58.730
You know, we don't know for
sure is that is a true analogy.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:01.690
But what we do know is that
at Titan we have evidence

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:05.240
of this immense global
scale organic chemistry

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.920
and all these fascinating
things that are happening,

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.280
but cannot ever get you closer
to a biochemistry or life.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.710
We don't know the
answer to that question,

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.970
and we don't really know
how life formed on Earth.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:19.360
But by learning what the
extent of that possibility is

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.190
in an environment that appears
to have all the ingredients,

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:23.950
that's going to teach
us a lot about what

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.580
that process looks like.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:30.370
Now we make the case
that, like Carl Sagan did,

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.460
Titan is the ideal place
to go look for these things

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.350
because we do think we
have all the ingredients

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.560
for life as we know it there.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.860
There's energy.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.160
We know there's sunlight.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.970
There's a lot of energy
deposited in the surface

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:45.270
of the top of the atmosphere.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.160
And we have lots of organics.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.650
We know we have abundance,
complex organics everywhere.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.170
We also know we have a
liquid medium, right?

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.550
We always say, life needs water.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:55.850
Life as we know it needs water.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:57.430
That's the, you now,
that's the solvent

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:58.810
that all our biochemistry
takes like --

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.800
sorry, we're all just bags
of water walking around.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.180
We're full of chemistry
going on.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.080
So we know that there is liquid
water deep in the subsurface.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.640
We think there are times that
it's been on the surface.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.640
But there's also liquid
methane, and that gets us

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.240
into that whole other,
you know, Pandora's Box.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.910
Well, what if you had
life and liquid methane?

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.620
And that's a really -- it's
a fun thing to think about.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.920
It's a little harder
to think about.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.280
Well, how would we know, right?

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.120
It's going to look
very different.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.510
But there we can draw a lot
of parallels to what kind

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:30.090
of complexity and what kind
of patterns we expect to see,

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:32.590
and an advanced chemistry
that could be going

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.790
on in a different liquid medium.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.570
And then there's also the
potential that the organics

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.600
on the surface are mingling
with that interior ocean

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.120
and that's another place
where you could look

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.930
for really interesting chemistry
taking place in liquid water.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:48.900
And again, even aside from
this whole prebiotic chemistry

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.280
question, it's just Titan's
a fascinating place to study

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.670
because it's got
this methane cycle.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.260
It's a lot like the
Earth's water cycle,

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.120
but it's different, right?

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.420
And it's going to have
its own differences.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.060
And we can learn just a lot

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.680
about how planetary
systems operate in general.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.810
And I don't know how many people
here are interested in things

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.370
like exoplanets, but as we
look out among the other stars

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.370
and think abut exotic worlds
around those other stars, right,

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.270
we want to understand
as much as we can.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.520
We're just getting these little,
little dots of specter from them

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.730
to understand what they're
like, but we also want to have

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.100
in our back pocket
a while catalog

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.580
of understanding how
environments operate with,

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.430
you know, X, Y, Z conditions.

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:32.780
And so Titan -- maybe Titan
is the more prevalent type

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.150
of environment than an Earth is.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:37.880
And we'd want to understand
what is that environment like

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.220
and learn more about
those planets out there.

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:44.110
So, again, this is sort
of this case that we

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.400
like to make is Titan itself --

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.410
it's an ocean world
and it's also this

00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:52.350
fascinating laboratory.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:56.870
It's already been doing these
experiments for us, right?

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:59.480
It's been producing these
organic molecules for millions

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.950
or billions of years, right?

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:04.500
It's had all this time to do
those reactions on the surface

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.900
that people are doing
in the lab.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.830
And all we really just
need to do is go and try

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.220
to make those measurements and
sort of pick up the results

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.060
that Titan has already
been generating for us.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.840
I always point out this.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.140
I like this graphic.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.230
It kind of shows what
do we know about Titan?

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.810
Here we know we have
complex chemistry,

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.120
upper in the atmosphere.

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.980
We think we can get small
biomolecules like amino acids.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.330
But then can we get down
to anything that looks

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.570
like an autocatalytic system or
the complexity of biochemistry?

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:34.590
No, we really don't
-- we don't know.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:40.060
But because we're this far on
this path, it gives us enough

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.860
of a reason to want
to go and find out.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.000
Okay. So another
thing about Titan.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.250
I mentioned those -- the
surface diversity you can see

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:49.550
in those images.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.990
We don't truly know
what the composition

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:53.540
of all those surface
features are, but we do know

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.450
that there's a lot of different
kinds of surface features.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:56.870
And we think of those
-- like on Earth,

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:58.500
there's different
geologic units, right?

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.410
What's the difference
between going to the desert,

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.840
going to the rainforest,
or going to, you know,

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.920
just here where we
live in Maryland.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.710
We don't know what all
these places are, but we --

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:11.480
because we can tell that they're
different, we'd want to be able

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.720
to visit a variety of
locations to understand

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:19.230
which compositional units
might have the most interest

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.570
for habitability

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:23.100
or for prebiotic
chemistry environments.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.400
And so the Huygens
[inaudible] --

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.760
of course, we landed in one
of them and it was there,

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.050
and it was wherever
it landed, right?

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:33.830
But ideally what we would want
is to go to all of these places

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.720
and to be able to visit
all of these locations

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.130
and understand how
they're different

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:40.330
and understand how they all
play into that story of Titan.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.810
And so I think we've made
the big case is that mobility

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.870
on the surface is really key

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.220
to us fully understanding what
the different settings are like.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.230
And what does that mean
for Titan's habitability?

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.960
So we do this on
other planets, right?

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.260
We do this on Mars.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.570
We send rovers that can
visit different places

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.210
and aren't stuck in one spot,
and can take different samples,

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:03.990
and teach us something
about a location.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:08.230
Our paradigm on Mars is
to rove, drive around.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:11.310
It can cause problems sometimes
-- holes in the wheels,

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:13.500
if anyone followed the
story of Curiosity.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.640
Although she's doing,
she's doing better now.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.280
And also it's kind of slow.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.630
I'm actually on the Science
Team for Curiosity as well,

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:26.990
and I'll tell you some days it's
like -- and that's it, right?

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.170
That's as far as
she goes in a day.

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:35.310
Titan, it turns out, has a
lot of advantages over Mars

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:37.780
which help us think a little
bit more out of the box.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.270
I mentioned the atmosphere's
a lot denser than Earth --

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.440
between being colder
and higher pressure,

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.520
you actually have a
really dense atmosphere.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.870
That makes aviation or flight of
any kind, whether it's airplanes

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:52.460
or hot-air balloons, makes that
a lot easier because, again,

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.060
it's easier just to go up.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.360
The other thing is --

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.330
I mentioned the gravity
is a lot lower, and again,

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.250
as you can imagine,
if you were on Titan,

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:03.480
you could jump a lot higher with
the same leg strength, right?

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.520
So it's again, any kind
of airplane or whatever.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.500
You would need a lot
less energy to get lift.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.650
And so those are two things

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.990
that tell us it would be a
lot easier to fly on Titan.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.140
This cartoon, which
[inaudible] can see,

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.360
kind of summarizes
what I'm saying, right?

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:21.370
On Titan you could
definitely easily fly,

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:24.110
just like you do on Earth.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:26.020
Mars, much harder, right,

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.910
because there's just
very thin atmosphere.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.480
It's really hard to fly around.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.090
So we want to take
advantage of that.

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.470
We want to fly on Titan,

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:34.900
and that's how we could visit
all these different surface

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.340
locations, and we could cover a
lot more of the globe that way

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.250
if we're able to gain
that kind of mobility.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:43.380
And so that's going to lead me

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.580
in talking a particular
mission concept.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.230
This one is called Dragonfly.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.720
It's a team I'm working
with to develop a concept

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.820
for the next round of
exploration of Titan.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.520
It's not the only way you could
solve this problem, but it's one

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.230
that we're -- our team
is particularly fond of.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.190
And the idea is that -- you see

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.420
in this image is
basically it's a drone.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:07.830
It's a dual-quad copter
which is a fancy way

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:12.220
of saying it has eight rotors,
one on each corner, up and down.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.560
And it's actually
not too different

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.110
in size from a Mars rover.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:19.050
So it's big enough to carry
a full instrument payload.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.630
But, again, because
there's a lower gravity,

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.530
the denser atmosphere, you're
able to move that payload

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.140
around on the surface
even as far as like tens

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:30.070
of kilometers apart in just
a short amount of time.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.790
And so we'd be able to visit all
those different environments.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:37.000
So, again, the idea is
not to fly all the time.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.560
The idea is to hop, right?

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.580
So you go to a place and
you sit there for around --

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.140
you investigate it
very thoroughly.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.030
Let's say we're in the dunes.

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.170
We would try to scoop
up some of that sand.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:47.680
We're take meteorological
measurements

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.130
and see how windy it
is and watch and see

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.480
if we can see dune sands blowing

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.370
around to understand
what are they made of

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:56.430
and how often are
those dunes migrating?

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.540
And then, when we're
ready to move on,

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.340
we'd fly to a new
location and perform

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.250
that same in-depth investigation
at the new location.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:06.910
So, again, most of the time is
actually spent on the ground,

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.570
but you have this
capability to move around.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.990
All right.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.810
So what would we
want to do there?

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.340
So the things that I
think you'd want to do

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.950
on the Titan surface are
sort of broadly listed here.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:21.280
I've hit a lot on the
probiotic chemistry.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.980
Needless to say, I got
my degree in chemistry

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.220
so that's where my focus is.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:29.020
We'd want to look for evidence
in some of these environments

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.270
that impact craters, et cetera,
for the types of molecules

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:33.950
that could be relevant for life.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:38.610
So, you know, I just mentioned
things like amino acids,

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.810
or a nuclear basis
that form our DNA.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:44.100
We would just in general want
to understand the composition.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.600
Maybe we land in an impact
crater melt, and we're able

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.380
to dig into that ice
and see what kind

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.510
of molecules could have been
formed when that was once water.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:52.880
We would also be
looking for things

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.840
like patterns in molecules.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.080
This is an abiotic pattern.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.240
This represents something
you'd find in biology.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.520
We see very specific
patterns in life on Earth.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.280
And we'd also look for
things like chirality.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.200
I don't know if people are very
familiar, but chirality is a lot

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.560
of molecules can be mirror
images of each other,

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.860
but they have a hand in it.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.170
They're either turned --
we call them left-handed

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.570
or right-handed, right?

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:21.160
And so on Earth, in our
bodies, right, the amino acids

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:25.680
that we have are all biased
towards one side or another,

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.250
and we -- that imbalance
is a signature

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.750
that we believe is
specific to life.

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:34.410
And if you look, if you just
make amino acids, a synthesis,

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:35.970
or if you find them in
a comet or something,

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:40.160
they generally tend to just be
what we call a racemic mixture.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.500
And that tilts it so
much one way or the other

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.800
as indicated on this graph.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.880
And so we'd be looking
for any differences.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.180
We don't know actually how
that arose in life on Earth,

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.910
and so we'd be just
looking for a difference

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.630
like that in this environment.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.670
We'd also just want
context and composition.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:56.230
Are we sitting on a giant
block of ice or not?

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:58.390
Are we sitting on a
big lump of organics?

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.820
What's around us?

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.160
What is everything made of?

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.090
We have a couple of ways that we
just get that kind of context.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.820
One is a gamma ray
spectrometer that can sort

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.990
of bounce neutrons off of the
surface and investigate, again,

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:16.920
whether we are near a water
ice layer or an organic layer,

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.470
and get a general idea
of that composition here,

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:22.270
just as we're sitting
and sensing the ground.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:25.560
And then also we'll -- when
flying around or or an up close

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.100
on the surface, to
get a lot of images.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.270
And, again, images will
give us a good idea

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:31.710
for the geologic context.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:34.090
Are we -- these are, you
know, dune features on Earth,

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:38.210
but we think that they're good
analogs for what exist on Titan.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:42.150
We can see microscopically what
do the materials look like on

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:44.100
that surface, and how do
they compare to the types

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.600
of materials that
we think they are?

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.710
And are they sticky or
are they like powdery

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.590
like cornstarch, you know?

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:53.600
What are those materials like?

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.710
And then we also have a
package for meteorology.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.610
We would want to do winds and
temperature and just learn more

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.500
about the environment for
an extended period of time.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.050
And geophysics, the
ability to kind

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.950
of sense what is the
ground surface like as well

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:10.990
as maybe penetrate and get an
idea of interior structure,

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:13.490
and can we get a sense of
how thick that ice layer is.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:16.440
So all the things that you
can only do on the ground,

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.830
up close and personal, right?

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:20.740
You have to be there
on the surface.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:24.430
So this particular mission
concept is in consideration

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.580
by NASA under what we call
the New Frontiers Project.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.740
So if it were selected
next year,

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.190
then what would happen is
we would launch in 2025,

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.410
so it gives us time to build it
and get it ready to launch it.

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:40.050
And we would not arrive
to Titan until 2034.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.610
So half this audience here --
you guys should do that math

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:45.040
because you would probably
be like primely set

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.340
up to be a major contributor
to the Science Team

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.010
for this mission by the
time it actually showed up.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:54.100
People like me, you know, I'll
be all old and grey by then.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.450
And the idea is we want to
land in those inter-dunes,

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:00.070
those dunes we talked about,
those dunes near the equator.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.840
And we'd want to look at the
dune material and we'd want

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.870
to look at those
interlayered dunes

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:08.830
where we can get the right icy
and it would actually be not

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:10.850
that different of a location
from where Huygens landed.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:12.750
And so what's nice about
that is we know something

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:14.550
about that area because
the probe landed there

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:16.050
and we have lots of good images.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:17.400
But then once we're there,

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:22.180
the probe actually does its
own reconnaissance, the lander.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:25.540
Because it's able to
fly it could go up high,

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.670
look around itself, you
know, you picture a drone,

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:28.970
and then it can come back down.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:32.430
Then it can go up high and fly
a little this way, fly it back,

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.730
come back to the same place.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:35.330
But now we've mapped that route.

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:36.630
It's a very high resolution.

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:37.930
And now we know, okay,

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:39.720
that place over there
is a safe place to land.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.220
And that's how we could
do hops along the surface

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.980
without necessarily having
super-high resolution imagery

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.280
from orbit.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.580
You don't really
need an orbiter first

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.180
if you can do your
own mapping, right?

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:52.020
And so that's kind of how the
mission -- you can pick your --

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.350
leapfrogging itself
around the surface.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:55.870
But eventually migrating to all

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.080
of these different
types of surface places.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.830
So one thing I --
having any questions on

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.380
and I thought I might --
maybe for this audience I want

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:08.550
to mention the new discovery
coming back from Titan recently.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:11.970
It's actually -- you can't
read the dates on these,

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.120
but it's not that new data.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.700
But the example of Cassini --

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.700
we're going to have
discoveries coming from Cassini,

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.290
even though it's crashed into
Saturn, for years and years

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.500
and years and years, because
there's always so much data

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.130
that we collect at
planetary bodies.

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:29.100
And it takes a long time to
understand it and to process it,

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.410
and sometimes it takes a new
person to come along, again,

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:34.870
one of the students here, and
[inaudible] may be 10 years

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:37.940
from now we'll look at it and
say, huh, this is interesting.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.240
I have a question about this.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.900
And dig in a little deeper
and learn something new.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:45.680
People are still doing that with
Voyager data, with Galileo data.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.790
So once, you know, it's going
to -- being in a library,

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:50.090
mentioning that, right?

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:51.390
Once this data has
been collected,

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.210
it's archived for everybody.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.890
NASA archives all of this data.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.520
And then for -- future
generations can still look

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.960
at that data to try
to understand

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.500
as much as we possibly can.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.930
So, this is an example of
something, data from back

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:07.620
in 2009 and 2010
has been looked at,

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.280
and we think there
was a dust storm.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.640
Now we just came out
of a dust storm on Mars

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.320
with a Curiosity rover, so
this is something that's --

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.350
for many of us who work
on multi-planets --

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:19.160
something that was
already on our minds.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.490
As I [inaudible] there
could have been a dust storm

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:22.980
on Titan as well.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.750
And that just comes from
looking at spectral features

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:30.280
that brighten and darken, but
then based on the location

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.940
and the type of movement
that we've seen and trying

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.090
to model it and understand it,

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:38.260
this idea that this could have
been a dust storm that created

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:40.890
with something -- winds
higher than normal.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.860
In this case, on Titan, that
would be something about four

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:48.830
to 25 mile-- per-hour winds
lofting up that dune material,

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.010
we think, or organic
dust, and blowing it

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:52.630
around in this location.

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.560
The artist's concept
is on the right.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.020
It's kind of a fanciful
view of what this might look

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:02.030
like if you'd been sitting on
Titan looking at the dust storm.

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:05.580
And so this is the kind
of thing -- we don't --

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.880
the surface mission
that I'm talking

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.070
about may not actually
experience that.

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:11.560
It's in part because
the thought is

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.630
that it would only occur
during the Equinox.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:17.080
You have to have the solar
energy crossing the equator

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.380
to trigger the right conditions

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.500
to generate these winds
to make this storm.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.920
So that wouldn't time exactly
right with our mission concept.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.770
But that prediction could
be wrong, too, right?

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.690
So it's possible that future
missions that do go either

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:34.350
in orbit around Titan or on the
surface might observe similar

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:36.760
features to this.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.790
[Inaudible] that's
pretty cool new news.

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:44.610
But never fear about
the Dragonfly lander

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:47.310
if we win because,
much like Curiosity,

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:48.610
we're not solar-powered.

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:49.910
We're nuclear-powered.

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:52.190
And so if there were a dust
storm we wouldn't have to worry

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:54.050
about dust covering
our solar panels.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:55.560
And like Curiosity, you
just kind of sit there

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.230
for a little bit and wait.

00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:00.230
And eventually you can
start moving again.

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:01.760
All right.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.310
So, again, just in summary,

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:09.270
Titan itself is a
really fascinating place.

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:11.440
I think the more we learn
about it, the more we want

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.210
to go back and learn more.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:16.180
And this particular mission
concept you've described,

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:21.210
and I have a little video, is
one way that we could do that.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:25.450
I think it's a really exciting
way that we could explore Titan.

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:26.910
And so I'm keeping
my fingers crossed

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:28.860
that we get to fly Dragonfly.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:33.910
And -- oh, I don't know if
I mentioned the duration,

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:36.630
but we would be there for over
two Earth years on the surface.

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:37.930
So, again, it would
be very similar

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:41.270
to like a Mars rover mission,
just taking a lot of time

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:44.160
to learn a lot about the
surface there at Titan.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.480
I just want to reference --

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.630
if you want to learn more about
that mission in particular,

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:52.140
and also some more about Titan,
there's this website here.

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:57.940
For the Dragonfly mission, sync
to the Mission PI, Zibi Turtle,

00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:59.730
who provided a lot of
these slides for me.

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:03.070
I don't want to take
credit for [inaudible].

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:07.530
And then I wanted to show a
quick video, if I can figure

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.300
out how to do this
on a computer.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:16.950
Kind of a fun video to
imagine what it will be like.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.340
I think so if the bars go away.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.810
So this is the [inaudible]
coming in, landing,

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:28.830
and it would sort of fly itself
down to the surface and cruise

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:31.130
through the interdunes.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.430
It wouldn't have its own
camera drone following it

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:38.730
around though.

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:41.290
We would just get the
first person perspective

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:44.000
through all the imaging
on the drone itself.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.990
Then land.

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:48.690
Put up its antenna
to talk to Earth.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.970
Do surface science or for
science surface science.

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:55.040
And then decide where
it's going next.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.340
And then take off and fly away.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.760
So before I open up to
any questions though,

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:07.330
I also want to mention -- okay,
Titan's a moon of Saturn, right?

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:11.370
We all have our own
beloved moon that we can see

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:13.550
up in close -- much more often.

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:16.350
Next October -- next
Saturday, October 20th,

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.890
unfortunately I don't have
a lot of these to hand out,

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:23.070
but is International
Observe the Moon Night.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:24.970
This happens every
year and they do --

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:28.650
there's groups all around the
globe taking time to look up

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:31.510
and observe the moon and
think about lunar science

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:33.470
and accomplishments of humankind

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.660
and visiting the
moon, et cetera.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:39.310
And there's a hashtag,
hashtag observe the moon,

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:42.970
or moon.NASA.gov
[inaudible] observe.

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:44.880
And if you're interested,
I can share that.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.770
I apologize I don't
have more handouts.

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.940
But I recommend for everybody --

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.550
those of you who are
local there are big events

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:52.040
up at Goddard Space
Flight Center.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.180
But for those of you who
are not, you should look

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.480
into this [inaudible].

00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:58.570
There's other events all over
the place to celebrate the moon

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:03.030
and I know at Goddard we're
doing fun activities to think

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.000
about lunar science and
maybe cratering experiments.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.350
And they always do
something with candy

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:10.810
because everyone loves candy.

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:12.110
So that's one big thing.

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:14.050
And then in the back, for
those who didn't get them,

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:16.490
I did bring some handouts
with images of the moon.

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:19.500
We're coming up this anniversary

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.590
of the Apollo Program,
50th anniversary.

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:24.780
We're hitting lots of
different milestones

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:26.890
with the history
of that program.

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:30.050
And celebrating, again,
that accomplishment.

00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:32.460
And then everything that we've
learned about the moon since

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:35.700
and lunar missions since then.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.010
And please feel free to
pick those up at the back,

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:40.480
and they all have pretty
pictures of Saturn, too,

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.610
my favorite image of Saturn
with the clip seeing the sun.

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:46.960
It kind of looks like
it's glowing from behind.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.140
So, with that, I'm happy
to take any questions.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.670
&gt;&gt; I just want to say thank you.

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:55.690
If you would repeat
[inaudible] --

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:56.990
&gt;&gt; Melissa Trainer: Okay.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:58.290
Yes

00:51:58.290 --> 00:51:59.590
&gt;&gt; Please ask your questions.

00:51:59.590 --> 00:52:01.390
&gt;&gt; Melissa Trainer: Yes.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:09.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.340
Oh, good question.

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.750
Okay. So the question is, how
long is Dragonfly expected

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:16.420
to last, and why didn't they
Huygens lander last longer?

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:18.440
So I'll answer the
second one first.

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.480
It was not designed to.

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.790
So Huygens was actually --

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.510
it was designed as a
probe, not a lander.

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:25.810
So the idea of it having --

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.700
it was on batteries and
had enough battery power

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.960
to make measurements that
took about two hours to float,

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.580
I would say float, because
it seemed so gentle.

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:35.520
And Mars, we just
like crashed in.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.220
Float through them, take
chemical measurements

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.460
and visual measurements
while it went down.

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.660
And then everything we got on
the surface was not guaranteed

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.320
because at the time it really
was thought it was possible it

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.740
would just splash into
an ocean and drown maybe.

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:54.260
And so it actually lasted
longer than it was expected to.

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.980
Dragonfly itself --
I'll give a caveat

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.880
to any questions
about this mission.

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.270
It's under competition
still, and so there's a limit

00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:05.900
to what I can say about it.

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:09.870
But the planned nominal
mission is over two years,

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:14.740
and we always add many
design factors on that.

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:17.940
And so it will be designed to
last much longer than that.

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.740
Yes.

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:35.120
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:38.220
Mm-hmm. So the question is,

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.520
we know that there's
things like wind.

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.270
We know there's a
thicker atmosphere.

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:44.240
And so what kind of
impact could that have

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:47.620
on an organic material
blowing around on the lander?

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.270
And how does that compare
to Mars and the things

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:51.570
that the -- the rovers?

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:54.250
So the biggest difference
there is just the density

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:55.550
of the atmosphere.

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:57.070
Because there's a
denser atmosphere,

00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:59.840
there's more energy in the wind.

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.020
But, in general,
with the exception

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:04.890
of this potential dust storm
that we think we observed,

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:09.010
the winds on Titan are
expected to be fairly low,

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:11.680
about less than one
meter per second,

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:15.210
particularly in these areas.

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:19.680
It's been -- it's not
meant to be weaseling out,

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:23.750
but it's something that the
experts in Titan meteorology are

00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:27.190
on our team and are actively
engaged in the design

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:29.170
and making sure that
it would be robust

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:30.470
against any of those conditions.

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:33.100
The most important
thing to remember is

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.010
that we aren't flying
most of the time.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:38.450
Most of the time we're just
sitting on the surface.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:43.100
And so, like any good pilot
would, we will only fly

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.330
when conditions are
safe and appropriate

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:50.380
and the organic material
-- actually it --

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.450
the conditions of Titan and the
dust would probably not behave

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:56.490
that differently than dust
that's blowing around on Mars,

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:58.790
than silica dust on Mars.

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:02.510
Yes, definitely.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:14.050
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:17.500
So the question is about
contamination of moons

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.330
and planets and the types
of fuel that we bring,

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:21.700
and how will that be addressed?

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:23.610
So this is -- NASA handles this.

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:25.860
It's called planetary
protection.

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:29.280
And so there's an officer in
an office at NASA headquarters

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.420
that thinks about the
conditions that we observe

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:35.860
on different bodies
that we might visit,

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:39.550
and what are the standards that
we need to hold our spacecraft

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:41.790
to when we send them there
for concerns about things

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:43.090
like forward contamination.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.930
And what's interesting is
all the different bodies

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:47.510
in the solar system
are classified

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:48.860
at different levels of risk.

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.540
And then you go to a place
like Mars and different areas

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:55.270
of the surface are classified
as different areas of risk.

00:55:55.270 --> 00:56:01.000
So, for example, we have a --
the same nuclear power source

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.320
that we've proposed for this
drone on Titan is what's sitting

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.700
on the Curiosity rover at the
equator of Mars right now.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:09.360
Because of where it's
sitting on the surface,

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.080
it's considered far enough away
from any potential liquid water

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:18.240
which is where microbes might be
living that it was deemed okay.

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.320
If you go further north
to the Polar Regions

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.290
where there are icecaps,

00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:25.310
you wouldn't necessarily be
able to do that right now.

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:26.920
And then, depending
on where you go,

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.900
you're held to a different
standard of cleanliness

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.980
on just the material itself.

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:33.800
So it turns out that right
now, given everything we know

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.520
about Titan -- it's
at a different class

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.700
than these regions on Mars are.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:42.940
And so we have a strict set
of procedures that we have

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.110
to follow for Titan,
and we're able to do

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:46.800
that with this mission.

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:50.670
It is possible that when we
go and we learn a lot more

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:52.810
about it, that we may find

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:56.560
out that maybe it isn't a
different classification.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.010
But right now, based on
what we know, it's --

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:02.770
we have a set guideline
that we have to sort

00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:04.870
of clean the Rover
to, and we're able

00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:08.190
to use the nuclear power source.

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:09.990
Yes.

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:13.100
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.600
That is definitely above my
paygrade question [laughter].

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.640
The question is, will there
be enough plutonium for us

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.050
to put it on this drone?

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:25.690
When the opportunity to propose
a mission was put out by NASA,

00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:27.920
they said there would be,
and that we were allowed

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.230
to propose this power source.

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:33.650
So that's what we were
told, so we're hoping so.

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:38.360
That's kind of on upper level
NASA to work out for us.

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.160
Yes.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:46.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.340
That's a good question.

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:50.030
So the question -- I think
is that -- the question is,

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:52.190
are there places on the surface
where there could be a chance

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:55.290
of us actually witnessing an
eruption, a cryovolcano eruption

00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:57.570
and then sampling that eruption?

00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:01.930
I would say that we don't know
enough about the likelihood

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:05.210
or prevalence of cryovulcanism.

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:07.490
Again, some people don't
actually believe it happens --

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:11.740
it's sort of controversial --
to be able to predict that.

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.720
However, should be
stumble upon it,

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.750
that would be phenomenal, right?

00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:18.050
A great opportunity.

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:19.820
So we can just hope, yes.

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:21.620
Back.

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:28.150
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:31.050
It will be -- it's being
recorded, and so it --

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:32.920
the question is, is the
presentation online?

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.150
So if you're watching
online, you know the answer.

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:36.880
It should be recorded
and archived

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:42.800
and I believe the material
they'll be sharing as well.

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.600
Yes.

00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:49.090
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:52.990
So the question is, what is the
ultimate goal of this project,

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:54.290
the particular project
I'm pointing to?

00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:57.550
And there were really
other expiration of Titan.

00:58:57.550 --> 00:59:02.110
To find out what makes life
possible or just to learn more

00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:03.410
about the solar system.

00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:05.360
So the answer is yes, it's
all those things, right?

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.250
So that's what we're
always trying to do.

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:11.820
And every time we go to a new
place and we ask new questions

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:14.160
and get new data, we kind
of learn a little bit more

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.560
on all of those goals.

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:19.700
So the idea is this mission does
help to address our questions

00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:21.860
about what makes
the place habitable?

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:23.890
What ingredients do
you need for life?

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:25.190
And where could we find them?

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:28.420
And that's all true of this
longer goal of are we alone

00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:30.340
in the universe, right?

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:33.150
This is a big just human
question that NASA has taken

00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:36.250
on as part of its mission.

00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:38.540
And in the same time,
you're looking at that,

00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:40.270
you're learning more
about the solar system.

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:41.850
And we're learning more
about environments.

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:44.440
And this is another thing
I would like to point out.

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:49.890
I may be a Planetary Scientist,
but my favorite planet is Earth

00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:53.000
because I live here, and so
do all the people I love.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.820
And every time we go out in
exploring new environments

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:57.180
in the solar system,
we actually learn more

00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:59.400
about our own planet,
too, right?

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.480
Because we build all our models
and everything we understand

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.160
about how Earth works is based
on a datapoint of Earth, one,

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.650
right, and when we go to new
places and we get new data,

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:12.510
we can try to understand
how those fundamental

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:13.810
processes work.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.770
And it's easy to
tell if we're wrong

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:18.100
if we make incorrect
predictions based

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.650
on what we think we understand
about how things work.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.870
And so, actually, exploring
new planets and trying

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:24.770
to model new planets
is some of --

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:28.890
the most progress is made
towards better understanding our

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:30.970
own planet and our own climate.

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:35.660
So, all of those things I would
think of are part of the goals,

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.380
that this mission addresses
part of those goals.

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:40.790
Those are big, big goals
that we have for NASA.

01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:42.090
But a great question.

01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:43.890
Yeah.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:57.830
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:00:57.830 --> 01:00:59.130
Oh, such good questions.

01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:00.430
Okay. Let me get the all right.

01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:03.560
So, the question is, on Mars
we know the atmosphere has been

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.560
lost, stripped over time.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.920
It doesn't have a [inaudible],

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.110
so the sun has stripped away
a lot of the atmosphere,

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:11.920
and that's party why it's a lot
colder and drier than it is --

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.510
than it was in the past.

01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:16.290
How come that hasn't happened
to Titan, is one questions.

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:20.160
And, is there talk of
terraforming Titan?

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.920
So the top level answer --

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.860
Saturn has a giant
magnetosphere.

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:29.310
It actually interacts a lot
with the Titan atmosphere,

01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:30.930
and we think that
that's part of where some

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:35.060
of the chemistry comes from
in the atmosphere of Titan.

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.690
So, partly Titan is
protected by that.

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:41.330
And -- but there's
a lot of things

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.260
that we don't actually
totally understand

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:44.600
about Titan's atmosphere.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.380
So why is it so thick, right?

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.720
How has it held onto
that atmosphere

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.020
when it's got low gravity?

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.320
That's the big question
I always get.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.720
Where did the methane come from?

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.540
And has it been there all along?

01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.880
Or was it just there for a
temporary amount of time?

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.590
So there's a lot of
questions that we still have

01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:03.740
about Titan's atmosphere that I
think we need more explanation

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:07.150
to be able to answer
has it always been?

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:09.760
Maybe it was thicker
and lost some of it.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.060
You know, we don't really know

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.160
for sure the whole
history there.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.780
Terraforming Titan would be
an enormous challenge just

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:20.580
because it is so cold, right?

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.630
And there's a lot of ways
-- you know, Mars, you know,

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:28.720
with all of its shortcomings
is -- it's closer to the sun.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.000
It's still that more familiar
to Earth and there is --

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.160
you know, there is
water there, et cetera.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.410
And it's sure a lot closer, so.

01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:40.450
And if you caught it
will take us nine years

01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:42.430
to get this mission
out to Titan,

01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:45.790
and that's just the
small little robot.

01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:49.210
Getting everything you
would need even just

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:52.300
to have a human presence
on Mars is daunting.

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.120
And so the idea of
getting everything

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.830
out there to Titan moreso, so.

01:02:56.830 --> 01:03:00.380
But I'm sure there are people
thinking about it [laughter].

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:02.510
Yes.

01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:12.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.440
Hmm. There are always
advantages to having humans

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.060
in an environment
doing the exploration

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:22.120
from the science
point of view, right?

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.370
You and I could walk over there
and take a sample and measure it

01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:27.050
with an instrument,
you know, way,

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:30.050
way faster than the robot does.

01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:32.770
And we also just with
all of our senses --

01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:36.400
you know, it's impossible to
totally mimic that with any kind

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.700
of robotic [inaudible].

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.000
So there's a lot of advantages.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.900
I forgot to repeat the question.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.140
Are we thinking beyond Mars
to sending people to Titan,

01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.740
which is -- sort of relates
to the terraforming question

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.230
and are there advantages?

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:50.500
So, yes, there would
be advantages,

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.840
but the Titan environment,
as I mentioned,

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.770
poses a lot of challenges.

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:56.030
It's extremely cold.

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:57.990
That's the biggest one.

01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:59.760
And it's very, very far away.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.690
So it would take a
long time to get there.

01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:08.400
So until we, I would say, meet
and conquer all those challenges

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.120
for Mars, it's daunting
to think about that idea.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.780
But it would be great.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.420
I know people who'd
volunteer, for sure [laughter].

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:19.510
Any other questions?

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:27.170
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:29.560
Mm-hmm. The question is, would
the flight plan, like this video

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.780
that keeps looping,
be predetermined

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.870
or determined from the Earth?

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.810
So we call that ground
in the loop planning.

01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:38.640
All the planning for this type

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.620
of mission would definitely
be ground in the loop

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:44.230
because it would all be
based on the data we get

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:46.750
on the ground other
than the first landing.

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:49.780
Everything after that would
follow on the measurements

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.640
that we take, what we learn,
where we decide to go.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.490
And it's much like
the model that we use

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:57.220
for the Mars rovers right now.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.610
In the front, do you
have any more questions?
