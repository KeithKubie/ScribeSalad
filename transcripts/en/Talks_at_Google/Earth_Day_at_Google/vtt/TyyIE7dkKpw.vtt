00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:10.970
MALE SPEAKER: Dr. Hargraves
has written articles and made

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.080
presentations about the
Liquid Fluoride Thorine

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.480
Reactor-- or LFTR, as we
affectionately call it--

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.110
and energy cheaper than
coal, the only realistic way

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.220
to dissuade nations from
burning fossil fuels.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.000
His presentation, "Aim
High," about the technology

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.260
and social benefits
of LFTR, has been

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.450
presented to
audiences at Institute

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.400
for Lifelong Education
at Dartmouth College,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.920

Earth Institute, Williams
College, Royal Institution,

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:47.090
the Thorium Energy Alliance,
the International Thorium Energy

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.180
Association, Google-- at
Mountain View in both 2009

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.720
and 2010-- the American
Nuclear Society,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.300
The President's Blue Ribbon
Commission of America's Nuclear

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.090
Future, and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.879
With co-author Ralph Moir,
he has written articles

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.360
for the American Physical
Society Forum on Physics

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.790
and Society, "Liquid
Fuel Nuclear Reactors"--

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.580
that was January 2011--
and "American Scientist,"

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.630
"Liquid Fluoride Thorium
Reactors," July 2010.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.050
Robert is a study
leader for energy policy

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.680
at Dartmouth Ilead.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.600
He was chief information
officer at Boston Scientific

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.750
Corporation, and previously
a senior consultant

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.020
with Arthur D. Little.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.410
He founded software firm
DTSS Incorporated while

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.110
at Dartmouth
College, where he was

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.860
assistant professor
of mathematics

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.630
and associate director of
the computation center.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.610
He graduated from Brown
University with a Ph.D.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.640
In physics in 1967,
and Dartmouth College,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.080
AB mathematics and
physics in 1961.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.410
It is with appreciation
that we welcome

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.410
Robert to speak
to us here today.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.737
Thank you.

00:01:56.737 --> 00:02:01.507
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:01.507 --> 00:02:03.900
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES: Well,
besides the climate crisis,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.200
we have an economic crisis.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.039
Here's an example
of it in India.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.494
You can look at that picture and
see that the Indian economy is

00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:14.620
not doing particularly well.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.460
You also notice that they are
collecting biofuels, which

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.737
is not really an environmentally
friendly activity.

00:02:22.737 --> 00:02:24.570
The other thing to
notice is that that's not

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.450
a great source of energy.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.930
And another thing to notice
is that these are all women--

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.632
women who are quite
under-employed in this country.

00:02:32.632 --> 00:02:34.090
So there are a lot
of problems that

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.400
are encapsulated in this photo
that we want to try to address.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.770
First thing to notice,
though, is government debts.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.320
It's not just the US
that has a debt crisis.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.370
It's many of the
nations on earth

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.530
have a growing debt compared to
their gross domestic product.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.020
It's not just us.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.340
How do we solve that problem?

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.690
We have the risk of
default on the debt.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.520
We have a potential
risk of inflation,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.880
if we all print more money.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.840
GDP might contract, destruction
of people's savings,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.650
and the collapse of the
welfare state in Europe.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.710
There are solutions
that are proposed.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.350
The conservatives and
Republicans generally say,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.380
let's cut back on spending.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.510
That's the way to
solve the debt crisis.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.660
The more liberal
economists would say, well,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.790
let's spend more money and
get us out of this situation

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.400
by sparking economic growth
with deficit spending.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.340
Or perhaps we should devalue
the dollar and export more.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.050
But that doesn't work if
all the countries do that.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.870
That's a zero-sum game.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.480
So what can you do instead?

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.630
One example is
productivity growth.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.000
And you all in the IT industry
should remember the Y2K crisis.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.600
During that crisis, which
was caused by people

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.100
worrying about the two-digit
year number not being enough,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.900
and causing failures and
control systems and so on,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.940
many CEOs of Fortune 500
companies were scared.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.100
So they invested tons
of money in products

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.530
like Google's system.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.000
Or SAP for
enterprise-wide software

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.200
to control everything
from personnel

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.630
to purchasing to production
control, bills and materials--

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.150
the whole package, in multiple
locations, multiple currencies.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.410
In fact, that
investment paid off.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.410
It did increase GDP.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.140
It's one of the factors that
was responsible for the growth

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.550
in economic
productivity in the US

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.910
in the early part
of this century.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.560
So what about the idea
of productivity growth

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.610
to cheap energy,
instead of new software?

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.580
Cheap energy can make
a big difference.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.220
We'll talk about that.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.300
Meanwhile, we have a few
crises sitting in front of us.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.210
We have the iconic polar bear,
symbolizing global warming.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.390
We have world population growing
from perhaps seven billion

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.020
today to nine or more.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.880
We're running out of food.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.300
The fish in the
ocean are largely

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.220
depleted-- at least the large
ones that we like to eat.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.850
And don't forget we have
wars over natural resources.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.890
This is a picture
of a war in Kuwait,

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.740
where Iraq invaded for oil
and then burned the oil

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.270
wells on the way out.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.360
So the competition for natural
resources-- particularly,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.670
energy is a problem.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.280
Coal emissions in
the US, according

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.070
to the Environmental
Protection Agency,

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.020
and according to the local
Cambridge Clean Air Task Force

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.700
Group, says that there
are 13,000 deaths a year

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.220
from respiratory illnesses
caused by inhalation

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.400
of small particulates, 2.5
microns in diameter and less.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.830
There are perhaps
a half a million

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.880
or a million such deaths
in China and other places

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.240
where the particulates
are even larger.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.390
In the case of global
warming, my concern

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.210
mostly is food production.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.120
This is an example
of the Rongbuk

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.450
Glacier in India, decades apart.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.850
In one case, we had lots
of ice flowing down.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.690
In the other case,
it's nearly dry.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.550
The glaciers are the
source of summer meltwater

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.250
that enables
agriculture to thrive

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.060
year round in these places.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.260
The loss of this
kind of water supply

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.630
is a threat to food
supply worldwide.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.820
Now, that's my biggest
take on global warming.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:50.960
This is a chart of data that
was compiled by the CIA.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.770
On the horizontal axis
are, for each nation

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.140
in the picture, the number of
children per women birthed,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.520
on the average.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.790
And on the vertical axis,
the gross domestic product

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.520
per capita, which is very
closely related to income.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.020
One of the things
you should notice,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.690
just looking at it instantly,
is that the stable replacement

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.730
rate of about 2.2
births per woman

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:26.780
is only exceeded in the
poorest countries in the world.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.960
Those countries that
are relatively well off

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.670
from a GDP per
capita point of view

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:37.090
have a sustainable, or
diminishing, birth rate.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:44.180
So prosperity is an important
stabilizer for population.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.900
If we look closely
here, we notice

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:51.090
that that occurs at somewhere
around $7,500 per year,

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.910
gross domestic
product per capita.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.990
That's the number
we'd like to get to.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.720
If we could do that, it
appears we could really

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.170
stabilize the
earth's population.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.260
Why?

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.420
Because women who are
in prosperous countries

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.610
have time to get
off their chores,

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.510
time to relax, time to go
to school, time to get jobs,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:20.160
time to have money of their
own and exert the independence

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.210
they need to control births.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:28.180
Prosperity has cut
the birth rate.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.620
Prosperity is also largely
dependent upon energy.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.240
Now, energy's not
the only component

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.559
to make a prosperous nation.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.150
We need good government.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.450
We need the rule of law.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.760
We need education.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.880
But we also critically
need energy.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.870
And, specifically, we
need electric energy--

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.770
the kind of power you need for
refrigeration, for commerce,

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:58.190
for transportation, for
safety, for machine tools.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.500
Everything depends upon
that rather useful form

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.950
of energy, electric power.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.730
And here, it's about-- again,
about 2,000 kilowatt hours

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:14.120
per capita seems
to be a number that

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.740
is associated with the
level of prosperity

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.530
needed to control population.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.190
For comparison, the US
is off the chart here.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.380
We're at about 12,000
kilowatt hours per person.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.180
Canada, 14,000.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.000
And occasional countries have
even more electric consumption.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.270
But somewhere around 2,000
kilowatt hours, or 600 watts

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.440
average power per
person, seems to be

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.960
a number that suggests
achieving the prosperity

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.220
for stable population.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.130
The other thing to
notice is that prosperity

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.890
depends upon cheap energy.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.180
This is a "Wall
Street Journal" chart.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:02.380
And the arrows pointing
down to the vertical bars

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.840
indicate when we've
had recessions.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:10.070
And there's an indication
that when oil prices spike,

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.670
there's a strong
correlation with

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.900
diminished economic performance.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.110
Several economists tried to
model the economic behavior

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.280
as a function of labor, and
capital, and energy, and so on.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.830
And their conclusions
are that if you

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.420
were to take a big world
economy and inject,

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:34.090
for free, about a dollar's worth
of energy in the form of oil

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.260
into it, you can
increase the productivity

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.380
of the whole economy
by about five to one.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.640
We still have cheap oil.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.460
It can't stay cheap, though.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.920
Here's the total investments
of the major oil companies

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.880
over the last 10 years or so.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.850
It's quintupled!

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:59.420
So if you're spending that much
money to explore for new oil,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.725
the prices have
only got to go up.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.500
Now, developing
nations know full well

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.570
that electric power
and energy are

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.120
critical to their
economic development.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.040
And so they are
desperately seeking

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.940
to get new energy sources.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.560
Coal plants-- there are
something like 1,400 gigawatts

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.840
of coal plants in production
around the world today.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.070
And although we kind
of think in the US

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.210
we are diminishing that number,
as we pass laws and the coal

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.280
plants shut here--
some of them--

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.840
the number of coal plants
worldwide, under planning,

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.890
is going to double.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.880
It's going to be another
1,400 watts of power,

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.190
doubling CO2 emissions.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.650
So that's the reality of
the projections worldwide.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.180
What we do in the US
is not so important,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.020
compared to what the developing
nations are going to do.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.630
A lot of people say, well,
we ought to pass carbon taxes

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.140
and get the developing nations
to not burn so much energy.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.790
But the developing nations
like China say, wait a minute.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.400
The US and the OECD nations
gained their prosperity

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.070
by cheap energy
from burning coal.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.800
Now it's our turn.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.245
How can you say that you
achieved your prosperity,

00:12:21.245 --> 00:12:23.910
and we can't?

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:30.535
Here's this CO2 emissions per
capita of the United States--

00:12:30.535 --> 00:12:32.860
a little over 1,000
tons per person.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.860
China says, well, we've
only done 76 tons.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.460
When we get to 1,000,
we'll talk about it.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.430
And that same story will be
repeated in India, Indonesia,

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.580
and so on.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.080
Economics is a powerful force.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.510
I like Fareed Zakaria.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.450
He's got a book.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:54.090
And he tries to point out
the importance of economics.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:59.050
And a very mundane thing is
change economics and trade

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.720
over the last few decades.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.200
And that's the container.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.160
The container ship has
made world commerce

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.360
possible-- inexpensively,
without pilferage,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.010
in a standardized form.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:19.870
That trade takes place between
a whole network of 250 nations.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.520
So the occasional
bilateral treaty

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.940
we sign to stop some
sort of behavior

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.310
we don't like about energy
doesn't matter much.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.130
Economics always works
around these things.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:37.250
Economics is the most
powerful force, not politics

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.280
We need energy
cheaper than coal.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.130
We tried politics
to contain CO2.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.750
But nations resist carbon taxes.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.330
Even a wealthy nation,
like the United States,

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.690
will not pass a carbon tax.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.470
And yet, we have conferences
where people go and talk

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:59.820
about how to have a political
agreement to pass carbon taxes.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.110
And here are all some
of the recent failed

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.550
conferences that led nowhere.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.060
And yet, we keep trying
to do that again.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.260
We need energy
cheaper than coal.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:17.190
That's the only way we can
stop people from burning coal.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.060
Provide them with a more
attractive and more economical

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.551
alternative.

00:14:22.551 --> 00:14:24.176
A lot of people say,
well, why don't we

00:14:24.176 --> 00:14:25.800
just cut back on our power use?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.170
We're gluttons here.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.600
We're using too much energy.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.210
And perhaps we are.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:35.110
In the US, we generate and
use about 434 gigawatts

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.690
of power on the average,
throughout the year.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.280
So let's suppose that
we are really good

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.190
and we cut back our electric
power use to half of that.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.910
And then the rest of
the nations in the world

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.910
who want to achieve that
good standard of living

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:59.230
we have in the US also achieve
that level of use per capita.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.090
That's the projected
electric power consumption

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:07.790
for the world, if that
scenario I described is true.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.580
So again, what we do in the
US is important, a little bit.

00:15:14.086 --> 00:15:15.830
But what the earth
depends on mostly

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.080
is what the rest
of the world does,

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.950
because there's so
many people there.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.950
We need energy cheaper
than coal, again.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.280
Now, in the book, I went
through a little scenario

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.330
to do a very crude model of
the costs of electric power

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.570
from various sources.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.020
And this is going to
summarize these things.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.300
I break costs into three
components-- capital cost

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.850
recovery for the investment
in the power plant,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:47.420
the fuel it takes, and the
operations cost and so on.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.430
Now, given an investment in a
power plant like a coal power

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:57.500
plant, a brand-new costs on
the order of $2.80 for capital

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.330
investment for every watt of
capacity that that coal plant

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.660
will have.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.270
So we want to convert
that capital cost

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.300
to the expense of
recovering that capital.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:18.160
So we want to know what is the
equivalent payment to achieve

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.530
that $2.80 investment.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.220
And you have to learn a little
bit about present value,

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.290
if you haven't done that.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.490
The question is, would
I like $1,000 now?

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:33.490
Or would I like a penny an
hour for the next 40 years?

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.220
The answer to that depends upon
the discount rate you choose.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.390
And people can argue about that.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.110
I picked, in this example, 8%.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.120
But you can do the
math any way you like.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.454
And I also picked a lifetime
for most things of 40 years.

00:16:48.454 --> 00:16:50.620
In the case of coal plants
and nuclear power plants,

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.860
I picked a capacity
factor-- that

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.510
is, the time it's
running-- of 90%.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.730
That is, you only
get your penny back

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.670
when the plant's
actually running.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.819
Doing that, the
math is really easy.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:10.470
Because $2.80 per watt
investment turns out to be 2.8

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.329
cents per kilowatt hours.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:14.500
So the math is easy.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.980
OK, we'll use that I model.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:24.040
In the lower left of this
screen is the only running plant

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.650
that actually has the
ability to capture CO2.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.856
It's an integrated
gasification combined cycle.

00:17:31.856 --> 00:17:33.230
It's the kind of
power plant that

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.110
burns coal in oxygen,
instead of air.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.730
So there's no nitrogen oxides
in the fuel, or no nitrogen.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.440
It makes it easy to extract the
CO2 from the exhaust stream,

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.002
because it's only water and CO2.

00:17:47.002 --> 00:17:48.460
But it was very
expensive to build.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.620
There's only one been built.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:57.280
That cost was about
$4.76 per watt,

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.160
just for the capital
cost of the plant,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.540
without storing
the CO2 anywhere.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.220
Just in the last week, we
saw announcements in the "MIT

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:10.000
Technology Review" of two new
plants in Louisiana and Canada

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.180
that have a capital cost
in excess of $9 per watt,

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.960
just to get the CO2 out,
not to dispose of it.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.730
So carbon capture
and storage, which

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.620
has been touted by the coal
companies as clean coal,

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.570
is economically infeasible.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.560
Natural gas-- that's
the current darling.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.560
A couple of things here.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.750
One is that the capital cost
for natural gas power plants

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:43.350
is relatively low, on
the order of $1 per watt,

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.210
for the capacity.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.090
And the fuel, right,
today is relatively cheap.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:53.270
Fuel has been as low as
$2 or $3 a million BTUs.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.880
And now it's up to five, about.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.510
And that number-- 2.8
cents a kilowatt hour--

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.670
is the contribution
of the fuel cost.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.360
Again, I just said operations
cost in this really simple

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.570
model are $1-- a penny
per kilowatt hour.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.330
You can do better.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.690
But, I mean, that's to maintain
the generator, and the power

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.210
station, and the transformers,
and all that sort of thing.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.920
That's not unreasonable.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.150
Again, a simple model.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.730
Couple other
points, though-- one

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.460
is that most of the
gas plants in the US

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.470
are the ones that were
designed to do peaking.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.990
That is, to come online
fast, speed up the power,

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.770
and generate electricity.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:35.000
And their efficiency
is only about 30%.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.480
That is, 30% of the
potential thermal energy

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.340
for burning the fuel is
converted into electric power.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.870
Whereas the fancier ones
that are combined cycle that

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.230
have the gas turbines, for
which the turbine heats water

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.790
to make steam in a
secondary generation scheme,

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.710
are about 60%.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.520
Much more so-- a bit
more expensive to run,

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.960
a lot more conservative
of fuel, but they

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.350
take hours to start up,
as opposed to minutes.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.990
So they're not used for
backing up wind power.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.220
They're used as energy sources.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.330
They're pretty good.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:18.290
So that's the situation
with natural gas.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.670
In the case of wind,
it's very hard,

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.050
because you read all the
newspapers about how cheap it

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.650
is and how it keeps dropping.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:29.990
OK, my approach was to try and
find out what the total capital

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:35.130
investment was to
create a wind farm.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.140
Not the wind farm
after the subsidies,

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.310
after the renewable
energy credits,

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:45.720
after the capital tax
writedowns, and so on.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.050
Try and find out the real
cost, the total cost--

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.900
because it doesn't
matter who paid.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.827
From a society point of view,
or from a global point of view,

00:20:52.827 --> 00:20:55.410
it doesn't matter whether it was
the taxpayer, the rate payer,

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.490
the bondholder-- whoever
put the money in.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:02.400
The question is, as a society,
we need to do the right thing.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.220
Because we're talking
about a global problem.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.030
So find out that total
cost, if you can.

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:12.240
Here's some cost
estimates from the EIA--

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.990
the Energy Information Agency
of the Department of Energy,

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.640
which is usually pretty good.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.690
Their example is $2.44 a watt.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:25.090
But if you look at the price
for the Deepwater Horizon--

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.490
Deepwater Wind farm, off
the coast of Rhode Island,

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.430
that was $7 a watt.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:36.080
Right nearby, Cape
Wind is $5.80 for watt.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.570
Their capacity factor
is only 30%, though.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:44.330
So to do the capital
cost recovery, remember,

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.100
we only would cover
that capital cost

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.910
when the wind is
generating electricity.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:52.750
So you have to divide that
capital cost by .03 in order

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.520
to figure that out.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.160
Now--

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] number
for the table on the left?

00:21:59.865 --> 00:22:01.240
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES:
I think so.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.698
I think that's the
number I picked.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.700
The Cape Wind cost
of the utility,

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.550
as a sort of a reasonableness
check, is in this range.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.780
They signed contracts with the
utilities in Massachusetts.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.660
They have an escalation cause.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:22.840
And they'll go up to $0.24
an hour, if that happens.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.340
So the model's not crazy.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.180
It's about right.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:28.480
All right.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.700
So electricity-- same idea.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:36.820
Here's that Ivanpah plant at
Brightsource, is the company.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:40.120
OK, there again, capital
cost recovery-- figuring out,

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:46.880
in this case, I think I used
25% percent capacity factor.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.160
We have to look in the book.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.080
$0.22 a kilowatt hour.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.980
Fuel is cheap.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.300
Ops are about a penny.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:23:00.120
Again, here are some
examples of capital costs.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.890
And here are some examples
of contracted power costs,

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:08.810
but for which the company
sells power to the utilities.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.790
So the utilities have been
bludgeoned by law and public

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.920
utilities into purchasing
wind power and solar power

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.910
at the prices-- OK--
were the first priority.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.500
And thereafter, go and
buy natural gas, or coal,

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.140
or nuclear, or whatever.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.090
And here again are some prices
that are being paid today.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.700
AllEarth is-- I don't know if
[INAUDIBLE] is up and running.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.020
AllEarth is getting paid
$0.30 a kilowatt hour.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.710
Remember, coal is about 5.6%,
nuclear typically around $0.06

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.810
today.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.220
Biomass-- people say,
well, that's renewable.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.590
Let's try that.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.280
OK, so I looked again
at some examples

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.610
of what these units
cost to build.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.430
And here are a couple examples.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:57.770
The fuel, well, delivered to
the plant is those numbers.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.105
I called up and I found out what
it costs to buy tons of wood.

00:24:01.105 --> 00:24:02.250
And put it in a plan.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.480
Figure out how many BTUs
you get out of the wood.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.360
And run through the
efficiency calculation.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.050
And we get fuel costs about
$0.47 a kilowatt hour.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.460
So again, the total-- $0.09.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.380
So my conclusion is,
green energy is not

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.560
cheaper than coal.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.200
Here's a summary of
what we just covered,

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.200
right-- on the far left, coal.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.550
Gas today is a little
cheaper than coal.

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.500
That's why coal use has
been diminishing somewhat.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.090
And we can probably see that
happening for a few more years.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.070
But the others are
more expensive.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:40.230
Again, the reason the press
reports their cheapness

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.710
is because of
unstated subsidies.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.430
For example, AllEarth
renewables in Vermont--

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:50.220
the capital cost of that
plant was paid for 30%

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.240
by the federal government
as a tax credit.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.930
Not only that-- the tax
credits, by special exemption,

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.070
were not paid at the
time the taxes were paid.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:02.680
They were paid
upfront, in advance.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.960
The state of Vermont
gave a 30% capital

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.180
tax credit to that organization.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:14.500
They get a $0.24 per kilowatt
hour production tax credit.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.750
They get priority on the grid.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:16.960
They can always sell it.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.140
The utility must take that
power whenever they can.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.150
And so on.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:24.190
And they get $0.30 a kilowatt
hour for the electricity they

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:25.050
do sell.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.040
So here's my calculation.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.460
Do your own.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.220
When you're curious, try and
find out what the plant costs.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.400
Figure out what the
capital cost is, really.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.870
And spread it out over
the lifetime and capacity

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.320
factor of the plant.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:45.070
So here's carbon intensity
of the electric power sector

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.370
worldwide.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.100
It hasn't changed a bit.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.640
So I say, green doesn't work.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.930
Can nuclear work?

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.330
Well, back to
nuclear for a second.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.750
Alvin Weinberg is a
guy who patented--

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.950
or was co-patentor-- of the
light water reactor that

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.930
was used originally in
Rickover's submarine, and today

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:12.080
in all the US power plants and
most of the ones worldwide.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.890
Rickover was a dynamic and
forceful and obnoxious person

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.960
who managed to get it
installed in the submarines

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.960
and also was tapped
by Eisenhower to lead

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.580
the domestic nuclear
power program.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.590
And he basically
took the same design

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.423
and was going on an
aircraft carrier, put it

00:26:28.423 --> 00:26:30.740
in a shipping port
in Pennsylvania.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:36.100
And that was the seed for all of
the power plants, nuclear power

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.210
plants that were
built there after.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.460
Not only that-- the Navy
was training admirals

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.250
and generals-- not generals,
admirals and captains and so

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.470
on-- to run these
nuclear power plants.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:52.700
And it was a source and supply
of skilled nuclear technical

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:58.070
people to run the
power plants on land.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.750
But what about yesterday's
solid fuel nuclear reactors?

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.990
Can they compete
with natural gas?

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.420
Last year, this plant, out
of the blue, shut down.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.290
They said their operations
costs alone were such

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.940
that they couldn't
make money competing

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.690
against natural gas,
which surprises me.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:20.015
I'm still flabbergasted
why it was so expensive.

00:27:20.015 --> 00:27:22.850
At that time, gas
was about-- was

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.790
making 4.3 cents electricity.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.700
They couldn't do it,
even incrementally.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.860
They shut the plant.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.530
And once you shut it,
it's basically gone.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.580
Right locally in
Vermont, this plant

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.680
is shutting down at
the end of the year.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.040
Same argument--
can't make money.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.450
So what about the new power
plants, the new generation 3

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.660
plus plants that
Westinghouse is now building?

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.810
Two in Georgia, and
two in the Carolinas.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:56.460
That plant costs $6
per watt of capacity.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.280
So it looks to me
like it's going

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.830
to generate electric
power somewhere

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.740
around $0.08 a kilowatt hour.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.380
Well, remember coal is about
$0.56, so that's kind of tough.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.510
So that doesn't look
too promising yet,

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.110
unless we can get the
cost of those points down.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.970
Which, by the way, China is.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.730
Westinghouse is building
those same plants in China,

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.810
and their capital cost
for the first ones

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.440
are $2 per watt, not $6.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.635
So there's something different
about the costs in the US.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.740
Those of you who like Bill
Gates and his investments

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.920
in TerraPower--
remember, he's building

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.660
a kind of a power plant, which
is cooled by liquid metal.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.460
It's a so-called fast reactor.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.980
In the US, that program was
called integral fast reactor

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.150
at one time.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.560
This is a
PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimate

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.490
of the cost of power from that.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.220
Gates would say he's
aiming to compete

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.810
with other nuclear power plants.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.280
But it's certainly
not cheaper than coal.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.790
So we need innovation.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:05.270
Let's look at the space program
as a source of cost innovation.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.650
SpaceX-- remember
Elon Musk, right?

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:11.840
And things like
PayPal, and SpaceX,

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.750
and Tesla, and all
those good things.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:20.560
He saw a cost-innovation
opportunity there,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.020
because of the
shuttle complexity.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.180
And because of the fact
they used 1970s technology.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.700
Now, that kind of
rings a bell when

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.790
you think about light water
reactors in the United States.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:36.860
So what he did was assemble a
small team with low overhead

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.340
and design an entirely
new rocket engine.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.310
And do it quickly.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:42.980
Between the time
of incorporation

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:48.200
and the first rocket
flight was only six years.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.030
The SpaceX Falcon, which
is their first product,

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:57.330
flew for $443 million--
compared to the NASA estimate

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.510
for what it was going
to cost NASA to do it

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:03.780
if the government did that
project at $1.44 billion.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.680
So he's proving
that sometimes there

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.530
is a technical
cost-innovation opportunity.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:16.160
What about liquid fuel reactors
instead of solid fuel reactors?

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.810
That's my idea.

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:20.720
This is a picture of a liquid
fuel reactor at Oak Ridge

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.200
National Laboratory.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.630
It's a lot of pipes,
and the reactor

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:29.370
in the sort of top middle,
on the right a little bit.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:33.230
Oak Ridge started
this way back in 1953.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.720
This man, Richard
Engel, is still

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.850
a consultant in this area.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:40.770
He, at that time, was putting
together a water reactor.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:50.130
That is heavy water that had
dissolved in a uranium sulfite

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.170
salt.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:55.174
And it generated electric
power, as a power plant.

00:30:55.174 --> 00:30:56.590
Had all the things
about stability

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.410
and so on that we like.

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.460
They couldn't make it really
big enough to generate

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.400
commercial power.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.720
But that was their
first adventure

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.830
in liquid fuel reactors.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:12.810
Thereafter, Weinberg-- the guy
who invented the light water

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:17.220
reactor-- also was the
director of Oak Ridge

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.700
and a designer and promoter
of the molten salt reactor.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.900
So, in this case, the
liquid was not water.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.430
It was salt that was melted.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.580
And the salt was a
fluoride-- fluorides

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.840
of lithium, or beryllium,
and so on-- picked

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.290
because they have
low atomic numbers.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:38.070
And picked because the
fluoride-- fluorine

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.610
doesn't absorb neutrons.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.580
So they ran a reactor
way back in '54

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.800
at a red-hot temperature.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.350
A current reactor is what,
300 degrees centigrade or so?

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.540
This is quite hot.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.110
So the proof of concept worked.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:57.460
Later on, after a
lot of machinations,

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.220
they tried to put
together one that

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.970
was going to be more
commercially oriented

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:07.900
and that also worked
in that time period.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.460
Here's kind of how
these things work.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:14.930
Here's a chart of the nuclides.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.880
The horizontal axis
is the atomic number,

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.040
the number of protons.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.540
The vertical axis is
the atomic weight,

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.155
the number of
neutrons plus protons.

00:32:25.155 --> 00:32:26.530
Right in the middle
of the chart,

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:30.800
you see the U-235
symbol for fission.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.270
But if we look up at the
top, on the 238 line,

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.900
you can see that
uranium 238, which

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:44.400
is 96% of all the uranium that's
in a power plant reactor today.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.700
That uranium, when it absorbs
a neutron in that blue arrow

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.390
symbol, it becomes
U-2-- I'm sorry.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:55.310
It becomes U-239,
which is unstable.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:59.250
And over a period of
days, it decays, finally

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:04.150
to become plutonium 239,
which is a fissile material.

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.940
And that fissile
material, in turn,

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:11.690
fissions and generates heat
and power in a reactor.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.330
Few people realize that
in today's power reactors,

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:17.279
we're not only
fissioning uranium 235.

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:19.320
A third of the power at
the end of the fuel cycle

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.690
is from plutonium.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.750
We actually manufacture
and burn plutonium

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.130
right in the solid fuel reactor.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.050
In the same scheme,
Weinberg and crew

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.270
pointed out that
thorium 232, when

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:38.560
irradiated in the same
scheme, becomes uranium 233,

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.280
another fissile material.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.940
So there's another avenue
and has a technical reason

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.380
why that's sort of convenient.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:54.670
And that is, it can happen
at low neutron energies.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.677
So that's what's happening.

00:33:56.677 --> 00:33:58.760
Now, we can actually design
one of these reactors.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.030
So this is a kind
of a busy diagram.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.580
OK, so that big,
yellow circle is

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.020
meant to be the reactor,
a liquid pot or vessel.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.460
And there's a lot of reactions
that go on inside there.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:13.719
At the top left is an
example of a U-233 fission

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:15.989
which releases neutrons.

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:18.250
And those neutrons have
a couple of purposes.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:22.449
One is they can promote
something like U-238

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:25.780
to become plutonium 239, which
could be fissioned and make

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.670
power, just as the
U-235 or anything else

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:32.070
can release neutrons
when fissioned

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:39.690
and promote 232 thorium
to becomes fissile U-233.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.730
So it's a good scheme.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:45.166
It's very-- relatively
inexpensive to construct.

00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:48.639
It's a highly
proliferation-resistant scheme

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:52.480
of things, more so even
than today's reactors.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.889
And I'm a fan of
this reactor today,

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:59.350
because I think we can build
it relatively inexpensively.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.470
It will run for decades,
before eventually you

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.390
have to change the salt.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.750
Meanwhile, at the
top left, there's

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.610
a waste-separator thing.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.450
And some of the fission
products, like Xenon,

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:13.819
tend to absorb neutrons
and impede the reaction.

00:35:13.819 --> 00:35:15.610
There's a scheme in
these kinds of reactors

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.350
to remove some of the
fission products on the fly,

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:19.520
in the liquid.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.450
That's the reason why liquid
fuel reactors are attractive.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:26.640
And that is, the
online quick processing

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:32.280
makes them relatively
inexpensive.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.740
I say that that
kind of reactor has

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:40.130
the potential-- $3 per kilowatt
hour-- to undersell coal.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.630
Why?

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.730
One is-- I looked up
some estimates that

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.440
had been done over
the past decades

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.380
for building these
kinds of plants.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.380
And I just promoted
them up to the current,

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.350
I think, 2012 dollars.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.110
And they're in the
range of about $2

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:02.910
a watt capital cost recovery.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:06.420
I'm sorry, $2 a watt
capital cost-- that range.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.380
So we're in the ballpark.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:12.320
But the technical reasons
have to do with, principally,

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.610
the molten fluoride salt.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:16.880
Now, the name of my book
starts off with thorium,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.690
because it's a short word.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:24.310
But the real technology key
is the liquid fuel form.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.670
The fuel, again,
is, again, fluorides

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:30.880
of lithium and beryllium.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:38.950
Fluorine, lithium, and beryllium
all have low atomic numbers.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.410
Good moderators, they
slow the neutrons down,

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:44.310
enabling reactions.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:49.080
Uranium is just dissolved
in that molten salt.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.250
The salt, of course,
has good heat transfer.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.560
The reaction is taking
place right in it.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.440
And so you use that molten
salt through a heat exchange.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:02.000
You're external to the reactor
vessel to get the energy out.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.540
The whole thing is an
atmospheric pressure.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.780
There is no-- you know, a
current light water reactor

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:11.557
is pressurized to, maybe,
150 atmospheres of pressure.

00:37:11.557 --> 00:37:13.390
So we have a containment
building around it,

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.534
just in case that vessel
ever explodes somehow.

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:17.450
That's never happened.

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:22.170
But we still have
a safety factor,

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.030
because of the
atmospheric pressure

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:26.560
of the radioactive materials.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.410
Another nice feature
of this project

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.790
is that there's an
overheat protection that

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.870
was designed into
the original reactor.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:39.760
And that is a pipe, you can
see, that would drain the salt

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.850
from the reactor vessel itself
into a specialized drain tank.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:49.210
And that pipe is
plugged with salt

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:54.220
that is kept cool with just
a fan that blows warm or cool

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.116
air on it.

00:37:55.116 --> 00:37:56.740
So that, if the thing
were to overheat,

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.330
or the electric
power were to fail,

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:01.640
or something of that nature,
that freeze pipe-- freeze

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.720
plug-- would just melt.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.100
And the liquid would drain
out into a configuration

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.960
which can't be critical.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.970
There's no propulse of pressure
to spew radioactive materials

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.840
everywhere.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.260
We've talked about that.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.539
And the places are
typically designed

00:38:17.539 --> 00:38:19.830
so that if there was a vessel
rupture, or pipe rupture,

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.650
or something, the molten
salts should spill out and be

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.420
contained on the floor
of the containment.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.560
Now, the other point is that
it's a low-mass project.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:38.150
This original motivation
was to design a jet engine

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.120
for an airplane.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.980
So the first reactor
designed-- second one designed

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.005
was about 1.4
meters in diameter.

00:38:47.005 --> 00:38:50.220
It was a beryllium sphere.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.860
And they'd actually
started to build that unit.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.970
But they decided not to do it.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:00.330
The motivation was to
have Strategic Air Command

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:03.790
bombers circling Russia
for months at a time,

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.080
never refueling, powered
by these kind of engines.

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:13.530
But eventually, the ICBMs we had
were able to supplant bombers.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.250
And we had nuclear
submarines at sea

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.310
with missiles on them as well.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:24.380
So this project never got much
beyond the first prototype

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.644
experiment on the
ground, and this design,

00:39:26.644 --> 00:39:28.560
for which they did build
that beryllium sphere

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.800
and started on it.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.010
Compare that to what's
going on in China right now.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:37.930
You know, the construction
costs are pretty high.

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:43.280
This, just the dome itself,
weighs, what, 780 tons.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.460
They're moving big pieces
of equipment around.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.960
The same thing's
going on in Georgia

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.940
right now, where they're
building two more power

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.375
plants-- again,
Westinghouse's design.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.730
Another point here is
that the high temperature

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:01.860
of these reactors generates
power much more efficiently

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.680
than the lower temperature
of today's pressurized water

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.050
reactors.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:10.620
So we can actually
cut our water use,

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.580
because we're so much more
efficient at converting

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.440
high-temperature energy
to electric power.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.395
And there are versions of this
that will actually work with--

00:40:21.939 --> 00:40:22.980
Is that picture complete?

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.450
Not really, is it?

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.050
Hmm.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.360
--with just air cooling.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.824
You can do that.

00:40:31.824 --> 00:40:33.490
Another thing that's
happening right now

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.670
is a lot of investment
at Sandia, particularly

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.360
in the super-critical
CO2 turbines.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.130
Super-critical CO2 is a kind
of a-- just think of a liquid,

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.115
of CO2.

00:40:45.115 --> 00:40:47.320
And you keep compressing it.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.170
And it becomes, at certain
temperature and pressure,

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:52.540
a kind of a liquid
that's compressible.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.240
And you can make a
very efficient device

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.990
to convert thermal energy
to mechanical energy

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:04.092
to generate power with it.

00:41:04.092 --> 00:41:04.925
Plenty of it around.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:13.150
In the US, 500 tons just would
run the whole US electric power

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:15.400
system for a year.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.330
There's plenty of it.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:21.590
My point is that smaller
reactors can actually

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.620
be produced in a
production line.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.560
Today, we have Boeing aircraft
that can make a $200 million

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.910
aircraft every day.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:30.320
We know how to do that.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.400
And making aircraft
is sort of the same.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.730
We have the same issues about
safety, about materials,

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.480
about thermodynamics.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.460
All those things are
controlled, and result

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.170
in quality production.

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:46.840
The other point here is that,
if you're producing something

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.256
out of a production
line, you have

00:41:48.256 --> 00:41:50.410
the benefit of a learning curve.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:56.190
The concept here is that when
you double the number of units

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:59.120
produced, you
reduce the unit cost

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.380
by a certain percentage
called the learning ratio.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.960
Typically, it's around 20%.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:11.520
In the electronics, high-tech IT
industry, it's been about 50%.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.690
OK, and University
of Chicago was

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:18.250
conservative in their estimate
of 10% in the nuclear industry.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:21.167
But even so, that makes a
tremendous difference in cost,

00:42:21.167 --> 00:42:23.000
when we get to producing
thousands of units,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.890
instead of two or three, in
a production environment.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:34.950
Again, we could make a--
certainly, a $70 billion a year

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:38.960
industry, just by
producing these units.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.730
Suppose we were to
do that, one a day.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:46.180
We could actually cut
down the-- by replacing

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.130
coal plants, the
emissions from coal

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:53.010
in a period of about 40 years.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:56.980
So just by replacing one a day.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.490
It's possible to do that.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:04.080
The other things that we can
do with high temperatures

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:09.880
from these kinds of plants
are have new kinds of fuels.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.360
So, in this example,
we're pointing out

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.790
that, although you know about
electrolysis to make hydrogen

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.100
from water, there's
also a thermal way

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.420
to do it by making
it very hot and using

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.410
a couple of catalysts--
iodine and sulfur,

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:29.290
or copper and chlorine--
to create hydrogen,

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.150
making use of that
high temperature.

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.930
Not electric power, necessarily.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.960
The Honda Clarity you can
buy today runs on hydrogen.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.940
And there are a half a dozen
hydrogen cars that you can buy.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.280
Hydrogen is OK as a fuel.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.720
But you've got to compress it
in a tank in order to do it.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:52.896
So it doesn't-- you don't get as
much fuel in a car as you would

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.760
with gasoline.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.640
But we can also combine hydrogen
with these kind of elements

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.500
in order to make liquid fuels.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:04.680
George Olah wrote the book
about the methanol economy.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.760
He's a big promoter of that.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:11.340
Ammonia, surprisingly,
is a good fuel.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.680
You have to control it.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.690
Dimethylene's a substitute
for diesel fuel.

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:19.430
This car's been touring Europe.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.510
It's an ammonia-powered car.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:26.890
Suppose you wanted to
make carbonation fuels,

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:28.210
like gasoline.

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:30.650
Because we know how to use that.

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:33.050
Where do we get a
carbon source that

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:35.480
is environmentally friendly?

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.910
That is, other than getting
petroleum out of the ground

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.300
and burning it.

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.760
We want a renewable
sort of carbon.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.270
Where can we get something like
that to make these products?

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:50.130
One is thought to be
taking it out of the air.

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:52.120
And people toy with
this all the time.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.700
And the economics of it are
sort of marginal, at best.

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.060
We're thinking that
with really cheap energy

00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.720
from this kind of
reactor, it might

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.130
become economically feasible.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:08.040
But that's again a Sandia
project, well thought of.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.450
Just recently, the Naval
research laboratories

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.740
demoed their process
for getting CO2 out

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.180
of seawater, rather than air.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:23.330
There's a lot more CO2
per liter in seawater

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:24.470
than there is in air.

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:26.200
And that makes it
an efficient thing.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:32.490
So they've done that and
demonstrated how to make fuel.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:35.230
And the point here
is that the Navy

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:37.930
has experience
with nuclear power.

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:39.820
They know-- and they're
looking strictly--

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.800
they're looking
very deliberately--

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.190
to using this kind of
extraction technology

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:50.820
to make jet fuel at sea from
seawater and nuclear power.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.610
And it's not a long way off.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.690
We're talking within the decade.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.260
This demo skid does work.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:58.580
And it's been demonstrated.

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:03.280
And, in fact, just as a game,
they flew a model airplane

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.730
with the kind of fuel that
they manufactured this way.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.380
So they're pretty
pleased about that.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:13.430
Again, biomass is
a source of carbon.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.920
You can get it from farming.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.820
And if we burn that,
and it goes in the air,

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:19.780
it gets reabsorbed and comes
back in a lot, to the land.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:24.230
So it's a zero-impact cycle.

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:26.030
But I say, well, don't burn it.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:29.380
Just use it as the source
of the carbon atoms

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:32.250
you need to make the
hydrocarbon fuels.

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:36.420
We can make a ton of fuel
from 1.7 tons of biomass.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.540
Around the world, we use
a lot of dung, right,

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.860
and other sorts of products,
in order to make fuel.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:44.480
Same idea.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.650
Instead of burning
them, we could use them

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:54.350
as sources for
carbon for synthesis.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:57.830
World cattle dung-- and
people in India collect that.

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:00.320
But it's very labor
intensive to collect it.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.280
I have to point out that we
have a collection process here

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.500
already.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.300
So that could be cheap.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.480
Again, back again
to the benefits.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:14.430
A dollar more energy can
spark our economic growth,

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.950
increase our natural
productivity,

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:20.660
allow tax revenues to
rise, maybe improve

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.300
the government's debt situation.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.530
Again, low cost is critical.

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.766
That's the thing we have
to watch, all the time.

00:47:29.766 --> 00:47:31.390
One of the reasons
I've been interested

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.660
in the denatured
molten salt reactor

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.230
is to get that cost down low.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:38.750
In my books and
other talks, I've

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:41.750
talked to all these benefits
from the liquid fuel

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:43.380
nuclear reactors.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:46.560
All these things
are possible to do.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:50.300
But I'm suggesting now that
you kind of put it off,

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.570
until we get the
economic case solved.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:58.630
If we can get economic liquid
fuel nuclear reactors sold

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:01.410
and being produced
in mass production,

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:04.980
then we get a chance to having
them be accepted worldwide

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:08.530
and delve into these
other opportunities

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:10.780
to make use of that
inexpensive power.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:19.510
Again, economics always
wins in the long run.

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:20.840
China is under way.

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.570
They're building these units.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:28.122
This guy on the left is the son
of the former president, Jiang.

00:48:28.122 --> 00:48:31.550
He's got $350 million
allocated to projects.

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:35.150
And he has 400 people
working on it right now,

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:36.960
trying to build a
molten salt cool

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.000
version, a sort of stair-step
version, by that date.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.870
And a molten salt
reactor, per se, in 2020.

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:47.750
Recently, that's
been accelerated.

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:51.010
Here's a slide that
Jiang used in his talk.

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:54.570
He points out the
crisis in China today.

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:57.760
And that is, air pollution
has become terrible.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.560
And the people are
very upset about it.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.800
So his project has
been goaled to going

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.330
into commercial
production in 2024.

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:07.620
Of course, China's trying
one of everything, right?

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:10.250
They've got big dams and four
kinds of nuclear reactors

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.100
and so on.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.350
But they're pursuing
this intensely today.

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:19.200
In the US, today's
environment, we can't do that.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.560
We really cannot.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.490
All the rules and
regulations of the NRC

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:25.260
are very specific to the
light water reactors we have.

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:28.750
And they're being
very difficult.

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:31.790
There's no sort of
overview risk-informed,

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:33.520
performance-based regulation.

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.350
It's "comply with this rule."

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.060
And that's how the
whole system works.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:42.050
Cost-benefit analyses, which
are used even by the EPA,

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:45.126
are not used in the NRC.

00:49:45.126 --> 00:49:46.500
The NRC says safety
is paramount.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.130
We make no cost-benefit
trade offs.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:51.490
That's the mental
attitude going in.

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:55.010
The idea of the nuclear
quality assurance technology,

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:59.010
and rules, and so on is quipped
that every nuclear reactor

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:04.870
design has to have a paper
that outweighs the reactor.

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:06.920
A lot of the quality
and assurance issues

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.780
have been substituted
for by paperwork.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.500
And so it's quite a difficult
thing to do in the US.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.480
TerraPower, Gates'
company, has given up.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.830
They're in China, trying
to do the preliminary work.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:23.790
Of the four or five
ventures that are in the US

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.400
today, trying to do molten
salt reactor research,

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:31.380
only one says they want to
try and do it in the US.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.810
The EPA, again, has a
problem with anything

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:36.590
that has to do
with radioactivity.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:41.460
There is sort of a
concept of as low as

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:45.920
reasonably achievable,
in terms of limiting

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.490
radioactive exposure to people.

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:51.770
And so, the problem
with that is it's

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:55.950
created a sort of a horror
or fear of radiation

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:59.521
that's been endorsed
and encapsulated

00:50:59.521 --> 00:51:04.210
in rules and regulations
that make it-- again, it

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:06.480
isn't so much the
technology and the limits.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.050
But the sort of the attitude
of people and so on that

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:14.510
makes it hard to get plants
licensed or research done.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.630
So that's the situation
we have in the US.

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:19.350
Probably this work's
going to come to fruition

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:24.630
outside the US.

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:26.870
So that's my summary.

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:32.730
Low-cost clean energy from
liquid fuel nuclear reactors

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:34.710
has two great potentials.

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:37.760
One is to improve
the economics of both

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.470
the industrialized
world that could

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:42.290
use a little shot of GDP boost.

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.960
It could also
improve the lifestyle

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.470
and overcome the poverty
of the developing

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:51.160
world without
increasing pollution.

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.310
And help us solve our
energy and climate crises.

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:54.810
Thank you.

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:05.700
I'm open to questions.

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:11.264
AUDIENCE: So I think what I
saw in your presentation here

00:52:11.264 --> 00:52:14.460
was that you're basing
the estimated cost

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.205
of these molten
salt reactors based

00:52:17.205 --> 00:52:22.049
on the cost for a bunch of
experimental reactors projected

00:52:22.049 --> 00:52:25.627
out to [INAUDIBLE] analysis.

00:52:25.627 --> 00:52:29.395
Are there reasons why we think
that the commercially produced

00:52:29.395 --> 00:52:32.670
reactor-- one that was
continuously running

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:36.990
on a experimental one-- would
actually be cheaper to run,

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:39.390
and cheaper to build,
than [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:40.830
light water reactors?

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:42.220
What are those reasons?

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:43.636
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES:
The question

00:52:43.636 --> 00:52:45.950
is that the presentation
cited some old research

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:47.680
papers about the costs.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.300
Is there any reason to believe
that in today's world, that

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.920
might happen to make the
costs as low as I suggested?

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.740
I have one friend who's done a
lot of design work, ex-MIT guy

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.440
who's within the last three
or four years designing

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.840
our nuclear power plant
production facility.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.380
And he's come up with
numbers of $0.03 to $0.05

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:12.550
per kilowatt hour for
a denatured molten salt

00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:16.600
reactor that is in a design
that he's right now still got

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.580
under wraps.

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:20.370
But yeah, I've seen the
papers, seen the calculation.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:22.190
So it's feasible.

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:26.150
Again, it all depends
eventually upon what

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:28.510
are all the sudden
rules and regulations

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:32.710
that come into play, if your
work is suspended for two years

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:35.830
while there's a hearing or
something of that nature that

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:38.000
drives the costs
up very rapidly.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.790
So his estimates
are in what I would

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:44.285
call a rational
regulatory environment.

00:53:44.285 --> 00:53:46.660
So that's what we would have
to achieve as well, in order

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:48.459
to get those costs in line.

00:53:48.459 --> 00:53:52.615
AUDIENCE: And I have a sort
of related question, which

00:53:52.615 --> 00:53:54.640
is, I think you
agree that in the US,

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.920
given how people feel
about nuclear power today,

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.175
we couldn't build a reactor
that wasn't obviously

00:54:01.175 --> 00:54:03.238
much more safer
than the light water

00:54:03.238 --> 00:54:05.683
reactors we've
built in the past.

00:54:05.683 --> 00:54:08.617
Are there reasons to
believe that a molten salt

00:54:08.617 --> 00:54:11.062
reactor wouldn't
potentially be safer?

00:54:11.062 --> 00:54:14.000
One of the [INAUDIBLE] seems
to be it also would be cheaper.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.125
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES: Yeah.

00:54:15.125 --> 00:54:18.950
The question is, why would the
molten salt reactor be safer

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:20.350
than the light water reactor?

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:24.340
First thing I would say is
that the light water reactor

00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:28.360
accidents have generally
been few and not

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.780
quite as devastating
as you might think,

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:34.460
beyond the Chernobyl issue.

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:37.130
So compared to other
energy sources,

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.810
the nuclear power, to
date, has been quite safer,

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:42.255
in terms of loss of life.

00:54:42.255 --> 00:54:43.750
So it's a good source.

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:47.660
The molten salt
reactor is designed

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.250
with all the
experiences people have

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:52.470
had about passive
safety and so on.

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:56.810
So again, it isn't so much
that it's molten salt.

00:54:56.810 --> 00:55:01.130
It's that molten salt enables
good engineering with fewer

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:07.180
systems and able to achieve the
passive safety that's needed.

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:11.250
So, you know, we won't
know until we actually

00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:13.720
build them and test
them thoroughly.

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.620
But I would say universally that
people who are designing these

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:19.450
believe that to be
absolutely correct.

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:24.227
Please.

00:55:24.227 --> 00:55:25.810
AUDIENCE: Let's say
that, in 10 years,

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:28.184
the people doing [INAUDIBLE]
finally have a breakthrough.

00:55:28.184 --> 00:55:31.540
And they achieve net
positive fusion energy.

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.805
How would you compare the
liquid fuel fission reactors

00:55:34.805 --> 00:55:38.261
to potential, say, a
Tokamak-designed fusion

00:55:38.261 --> 00:55:38.760
reactor?

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.766
Do you think we
would actually have

00:55:40.766 --> 00:55:41.890
a world with both of those?

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:43.640
Or do you think that
if fusion ever comes,

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:47.250
it will end up just supplanting
all the fission designs?

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:50.110
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES: Well, I
think if fusion comes, great.

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:52.710
But it's going to be quite
a while, in any case.

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:56.190
The Tokamak designs are still--
people are working hard on.

00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:59.760
There's a big project,
ITER, in Europe.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.030
We have that facility
in California.

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:06.090
And then we also have private
ventures in New Jersey,

00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:10.480
using, what do they to call
it, non-neutronic approaches--

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.366
proton on beryllium, I think.

00:56:13.366 --> 00:56:16.860
So there's some potential for
something to happen there.

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:19.600
Most people don't think
it's going to happen.

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.200
But it does, wonderful.

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.350
If we have two sources, great.

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:29.220
I don't see the downside to
fission that a lot of people

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:29.720
do.

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:38.390
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
this molten salt reactor

00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:41.300
is less conducive
to proliferation.

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:44.320
But I didn't quite follow why.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.730
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES: I
didn't cover that in a talk.

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:48.850
But there's a lot
of comments that

00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:50.320
have been a bit overstated.

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.430
People say, oh, you can't
make a bomb out of it,

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:53.377
and this and that.

00:56:53.377 --> 00:56:55.085
Well, you know, you
can't make a bomb out

00:56:55.085 --> 00:56:56.240
of a light water reactor.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.350
It sits there like a plant.

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:02.160
But if you have the
technical skills--

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.630
like they did in India or South
or North Korea, and so on--

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:10.340
you can figure out how to make a
special kind of nuclear reactor

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:17.530
that generates, say, either
plutonium 239 from uranium 238,

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:22.450
or generates uranium
233 from thorium 232.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.160
You can do that by building
a special-purpose reactor

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.720
to build material for nuclear
weapons, in both cases.

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:32.960
Now, the hangup with the
thorium-uranium cycle

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:37.120
is that it also creates
uranium 232, which

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:41.150
is a hazardous material in the
sense that it decays quickly

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:45.480
and is likely to injure
or kill the people working

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.880
on the weapons fabrication.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:53.030
So it's a little harder
to use the thorium U-233

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:56.140
cycles to build nuclear
weapons that way.

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:01.660
So I would say the
denatured molten salt

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:06.400
reactor is highly
proliferation resistant.

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:11.620
But nothing is-- anyone
with enough money

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:14.910
and enough technology, enough
science, could do that.

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:16.880
But the other evidence
is that the US

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.100
did try to build a
U-233 weapon way back,

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.210
I don't know, 40, 50 years ago.

00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:25.600
And they did one test and they
were unsatisfied and never did

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.690
again.

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:31.080
So that's the only technical
evidence I have for it.

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.660
So the answer,
again, in summary,

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:36.660
is you can build a nuclear
weapon out of almost anything,

00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:39.660
if you have all the skills
and money and expense.

00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:44.970
But even developing nations,
like India, Pakistan, North

00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:48.470
Korea, and so on, were able
to build nuclear weapons

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:51.200
with the technologies
that exist today.

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:56.410
So my suggested hurdle
is that you only

00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:59.779
build reactors that are
no more proliferation

00:58:59.779 --> 00:59:01.320
resistant than the
one we have today,

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.695
as we don't want to increase
the probability that someone

00:59:03.695 --> 00:59:04.410
can build a bomb.

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:05.910
But we can't eliminate
it, because we

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:07.868
have all these paths that
are in there already.

00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:11.889
Please.

00:59:11.889 --> 00:59:13.430
AUDIENCE: You showed
a table of costs

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:16.870
that compared various
forms of energy

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:20.060
as actually produced
today in real plants,

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:23.110
and then compared this
thing that we don't yet

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:25.480
do that you'd like
us to develop.

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:29.160
So I'm curious how they compare
to a few other technologies

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.460
that we don't yet
do today, but people

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.440
want to develop in wind and
solar and other renewables.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.140
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES:
Now, your question

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.057
is, what other
technologies are there

00:59:38.057 --> 00:59:39.890
that I ought to be
looking at in that table?

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:40.780
Is that the question?

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:44.109
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like, most
of those were today's cost.

00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:46.150
And then you added this
one at the end, which is,

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:47.380
here's one we could develop.

00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.769
And I wonder how it would
compare to other things

00:59:49.769 --> 00:59:50.560
that you could add.

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:50.970
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES:
Well, you're

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:52.940
talking about things
like hydro, for example.

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.520
I didn't put hydro in the
table because we really

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.150
can't expand hydro very much.

00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:58.045
It's a nice source.

00:59:58.045 --> 00:59:59.610
It's relatively inexpensive.

00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:01.830
It's not very polluting.

01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:02.525
It's renewable.

01:00:02.525 --> 01:00:03.410
It's green.

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:04.230
It's good.

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:07.710
But there aren't too many sites
left to do a lot of hydro.

01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:09.760
Geothermal, I didn't
put in, because it's not

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.574
that expandable.

01:00:10.574 --> 01:00:11.990
There aren't that
many sites where

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:14.945
you can get enough
geothermal energy out.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.070
So I tried to pick just
the examples that I thought

01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:19.330
would produce enough electricity
to make a difference.

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:19.890
AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:21.348
No, that's not
exactly my question.

01:00:21.348 --> 01:00:23.740
My question is, you know,
here's the cost of wind,

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.330
as done right now.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.434
Here's the cost of
solar, as done right now.

01:00:27.434 --> 01:00:29.804
Here's the cost of
nuclear, as done right now.

01:00:29.804 --> 01:00:31.587
None of them do it.

01:00:31.587 --> 01:00:33.170
OK, here's the cost
of a different way

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:35.410
of doing in theory
that could be cheaper.

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:37.875
But isn't there a
different way of doing,

01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:39.552
you know, solar, that
could be cheaper,

01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:41.510
that people could also
develop within a decade?

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:43.470
Are there things like
that on the horizon?

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.730
How do they compare?

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:45.896
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES: I see.

01:00:45.896 --> 01:00:47.865
The question is, why
didn't I sort of project

01:00:47.865 --> 01:00:50.330
the future costs
of wind and solar

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:52.020
and see if it might
not be cheaper?

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:56.960
And, like I said, I haven't
got a good answer to that,

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.450
except to say, for example,
in the case of solar power.

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:02.570
And it's pretty clear
right now that photovoltaic

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:06.800
is going to outrun the
concentrated solar.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.360
It's going to be less expensive.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.620
And there is a
lot of improvement

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:15.740
in the cost for
photovoltaic panels.

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:18.910
It's down now to $1
a watt for the panel.

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:22.030
But the panel is only
a part of the plant.

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:28.820
And so the costs for the
mounting, for the heliostats

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:31.420
to follow the sun, all
those kinds of things

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:34.870
have brought the costs up to
the numbers I've suggested.

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:36.540
So maybe there's
some opportunity

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.330
to reduce costs there.

01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:41.740
But again, in the case
of solar and wind,

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.160
we also have the
storage problem.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.610
We don't have energy storage.

01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:50.960
So we need to have some
kind of backup power

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.060
at all times for those.

01:01:59.408 --> 01:02:02.384
Go ahead.

01:02:02.384 --> 01:02:06.470
AUDIENCE: I gather as
an unstated conclusion

01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:10.295
of the talk that somehow what's
going to happen in the future

01:02:10.295 --> 01:02:13.620
is that China is going
to actually develop

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:16.355
this technology and start
sending it back to us

01:02:16.355 --> 01:02:18.090
en masse, right?

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:21.840
You know, here's your
two-ton, you know,

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.282
power-generation thing.

01:02:23.282 --> 01:02:24.490
You can buy it for this much.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:26.024
And here, you have it, right?

01:02:26.024 --> 01:02:26.627
Go get it.

01:02:26.627 --> 01:02:27.230
Here.

01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:30.585
And so how do you develop
here in the States?

01:02:30.585 --> 01:02:32.210
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES:
No, you're right.

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:34.940
China has been
notorious at capturing

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.330
intellectual property.

01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:39.120
In the case of the
Westinghouse arrangement,

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.160
Westinghouse is building
four AP 1000s in China.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.190
But China required Westinghouse
to surrender all IP

01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.900
to that product.

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:50.140
And the deal they
have is that China

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:54.050
is allowed to build
power and export power

01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:56.830
plants that are 1.4
gigawatts and up.

01:02:56.830 --> 01:03:00.390
So the AP 1,000 is a
Westinghouse product.

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:05.090
The AP 1,400 is a China product.

01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:07.395
So they have the
rights to do that.

01:03:07.395 --> 01:03:10.000
And they intend to, I think.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.380
In fact, one of their power
companies just went public.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:17.505
So the same thing would happen
with the molten salt reactor.

01:03:17.505 --> 01:03:21.310
AUDIENCE: So that makes it
like [INAUDIBLE] to actually

01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:25.004
make it easier, in the sense
that there is some energy

01:03:25.004 --> 01:03:27.840
rights and energy
technology rights happening.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.580
And unless, you know, similar
to the space technology rights,

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:41.020
right, that cannot facilitate
new laws and regulations

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.020
to make this go forward.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.869
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES:
So I didn't quite

01:03:46.869 --> 01:03:47.910
understand this question.

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:50.430
You said is it now between the
technology race and the energy

01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:50.930
race.

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:52.400
But what is the question?

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.456
AUDIENCE: Is that something--
is that a simple message that

01:03:56.456 --> 01:04:00.150
could be sold to
politicians as a reason

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:03.136
to change regulations
that we've tried?

01:04:03.136 --> 01:04:04.510
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES:
I'm trying.

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:06.970
I have a whole other
topic I've been working

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:09.759
on called radiation
is safe within limits.

01:04:09.759 --> 01:04:11.550
And at the end of the
talk, you can pick up

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:12.799
one of these little brochures.

01:04:12.799 --> 01:04:15.290
I'm trying to get the
public to understand

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:17.930
the difference between the
real harm from radiation

01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:20.650
and the regulatory
rules that deal with it.

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:22.410
But I don't quite
know how to get

01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:23.630
the politicians to agree yet.

01:04:26.323 --> 01:04:28.322
AUDIENCE: So I think the
thrust to this argument

01:04:28.322 --> 01:04:32.890
is that the thrust of your talk
seemed to be very fatalistic.

01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:34.700
China's going to do it.

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:42.060
And that's the end of it,
without an exhortation that we

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:47.140
should do something to better
change that, which is, I think,

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.800
perhaps we all expected to hear.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.470
AUDIENCE: If somebody's
going to-- sorry.

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:54.340
If somebody, you know,
in China or anyplace else

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.130
is going to invent this
reactor, and it's going to work,

01:04:57.130 --> 01:05:00.130
and it's going to be cheaper
than coal-- [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:01.490
take over the world?

01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:02.954
Why not be optimistic?

01:05:02.954 --> 01:05:04.620
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES:
Right, good point.

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.680
If we're trying to solve
the world's CO2 problem,

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.785
does it matter whether China
solves it or the US solves it?

01:05:09.785 --> 01:05:10.368
AUDIENCE: Yep.

01:05:13.389 --> 01:05:15.680
AUDIENCE: The reactor with
which I am somewhat familiar

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.520
is the research reactor at MIT.

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:23.770
And they're routinely getting
spreads, shutdowns, emergency

01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:27.350
shutdowns due to various
monitoring glitches

01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:30.760
and all sorts of things
they're doing for tests.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:37.610
And the model that you
showed a sketch of is dumping

01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:43.125
a liquid-only-when-hot fuel
into a tank for it to solidify

01:05:43.125 --> 01:05:45.615
in, as far as I can tell.

01:05:45.615 --> 01:05:49.060
It seems that would be
burdensome to go back

01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:51.843
into operation after
such a shutdown.

01:05:51.843 --> 01:05:53.634
Is that something that,
as far as you know,

01:05:53.634 --> 01:05:55.097
has been looked at?

01:05:55.097 --> 01:05:57.430
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES: Sure,
they're looking at all that.

01:05:57.430 --> 01:06:00.930
I'm sure that the design
would try to keep it warm.

01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:03.700
First of all, it's got-- it has
a lot of fission product decay.

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:06.280
It's going to take a long
time before that salt would

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.770
get cool enough to
actually become a solid.

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:12.580
And you'd probably want to have
some external heating there

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:15.385
to keep it from getting
solid, because it would make

01:06:15.385 --> 01:06:19.020
it hard to restart
with some salt in all

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.562
the pumps and things.

01:06:20.562 --> 01:06:21.895
So it could be quite a problem--

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:22.180
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:22.680
I'm sorry.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.695
As you pull off the cap,
whenever safety is established,

01:06:25.695 --> 01:06:28.029
and dump it back into the
reaction chamber, effectively?

01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:30.111
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES: Well,
you have to repump it.

01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:31.560
If it all solidified,
I don't know

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.700
how you'd get it restarted.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:36.034
But yeah, those kinds
of issues are up front

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:38.283
with all the people who are
working on those projects.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:46.482
AUDIENCE: But so did
you mention that China

01:06:46.482 --> 01:06:48.786
is spending, what, some
hundred million dollars a year

01:06:48.786 --> 01:06:51.682
or more building
this design reactor?

01:06:51.682 --> 01:06:53.390
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES:
This design reactor

01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:56.880
has a budget of $350 million
for the first five years.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.870
That was up until
a few months ago,

01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:01.690
when it was given a
new spike of funding--

01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:04.640
I don't know what it is-- with
the objective of speeding up

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.500
the development.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.370
I don't know what the
answer to that is.

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:09.180
We could learn.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:14.170
Jiang himself is going to talk
at the American Nuclear Society

01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:15.470
meeting in Reno.

01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:16.500
I think it's next week.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.237
Please.

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:23.722
AUDIENCE: I saw an article
in "Wired" magazine

01:07:23.722 --> 01:07:24.716
a couple of years ago.

01:07:24.716 --> 01:07:25.710
It really excited
me about this stuff.

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.698
And one of the things
they talked about

01:07:27.698 --> 01:07:30.183
was, well, at least when
I see nuclear plants now,

01:07:30.183 --> 01:07:31.177
they're all right
next to the ocean.

01:07:31.177 --> 01:07:31.674
They're above ground.

01:07:31.674 --> 01:07:33.165
They've got giant
cooling powers.

01:07:33.165 --> 01:07:34.656
They kind of
mentioned that they're

01:07:34.656 --> 01:07:35.930
kind of big terrorist targets.

01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:37.638
Like if terrorists
had a bunch of planes,

01:07:37.638 --> 01:07:39.129
they'd crash them into
all our power plants.

01:07:39.129 --> 01:07:41.117
We'd be kind of out of
luck for a long time.

01:07:41.117 --> 01:07:42.111
But no one [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:42.111 --> 01:07:45.590
And they mentioned that some of
these thorium reactors-- maybe

01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:50.063
the molten salt [INAUDIBLE]
ones-- they could be buried,

01:07:50.063 --> 01:07:55.033
sort of to protect them from,
like, airplanes, I guess.

01:07:55.033 --> 01:07:58.015
But they also mentioned that
they could be made smaller.

01:07:58.015 --> 01:08:00.003
Like each city could
have one, sort of

01:08:00.003 --> 01:08:02.985
keep it buried and run
for kind of a long time.

01:08:02.985 --> 01:08:05.967
Just kind of seal it up and
use the power for a long time.

01:08:05.967 --> 01:08:07.955
Are those two benefits to these?

01:08:07.955 --> 01:08:08.949
Can they be buried?

01:08:08.949 --> 01:08:10.804
And can they be much smaller?

01:08:10.804 --> 01:08:12.720
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES:
Yes, they-- the question

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.490
was, how do you protect
these kinds of plants

01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:17.899
against terrorist attacks
from airplanes and so on?

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:19.390
Can they be buried?

01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:21.649
And the answer,
ever since 9/11, is

01:08:21.649 --> 01:08:23.950
that people are very
concerned about that.

01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:27.680
So even the AP
1,000 reactor design

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:31.670
is capable of withstanding
an aircraft crash.

01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:35.319
It won't collapse the dome,
nor the big tank of water

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.140
that's at the top of it.

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.740
Many of the small,
modular reactor designs,

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:45.680
like the one being built, were
proposed by new scale or by BW,

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.010
and are designed to
be underground power

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:51.859
plants, for that kind of reason.

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:55.670
And my co-author, Ralph
Moir, had a paper with Teller

01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:59.310
that designed and showed an
underground molten salt reactor

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:00.020
plant.

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.779
So, yes, they can
be underground.

01:09:02.779 --> 01:09:05.089
And that seems to
be the strategy

01:09:05.089 --> 01:09:08.097
that a lot of new reactors
are going to follow.

01:09:08.097 --> 01:09:09.680
AUDIENCE: And smaller
reactors, right?

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.290
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES: And
smaller reactors, yeah.

01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:13.590
I'm proposing smaller
reactors principally-- well,

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:14.649
a couple reasons.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:17.380
They're easier to
cool in a situation

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:21.130
where you have no
external power,

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:24.390
like we had in Fukushima.

01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:26.399
And, you know, they're cheaper.

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:28.290
There's less
investment up front,

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:30.680
less risk capital
for the utility

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.220
for the first two or
three of these plants.

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:36.390
And because you get the
benefit of mass production.

01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:39.189
We have a big engineering
controversy constantly going

01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:42.770
on about the economy of scale
and bigger and bigger plants.

01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:47.569
But the bigger plants sometimes
bring new problems to bear.

01:09:47.569 --> 01:09:50.149
So if you give up
economy of scale,

01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:52.510
you also get, in
return, the economy

01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:54.270
of the learning
curve, because you're

01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:56.070
going to produce more units.

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:59.400
So I think the smaller
units are going to win out.

01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:04.210
Go ahead.

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:04.890
AUDIENCE: Me?

01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:06.015
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES: Sure.

01:10:06.015 --> 01:10:08.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah, Bob, a
question on your chart showing

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:11.090
the kilowatt cost
per kilowatt hour

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:13.710
of the various alternative.

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:17.060
Is there any attempt to
include the transmission costs?

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:19.870
Or are transmission
costs not relevant?

01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:23.150
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES: I did
not include transmission costs.

01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:26.060
They can make a
difference, if you

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.650
are thinking about powering
the US with renewables

01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:32.710
from long-distance power
sources-- something like,

01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.150
figure a penny per kilowatt
hour per 1,000 miles

01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:37.082
of high-voltage DC transmission.

01:10:37.082 --> 01:10:38.790
Keep that number in
the back of your mind

01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:40.539
when you're trying to
design these things.

01:10:43.415 --> 01:10:44.956
Please.

01:10:44.956 --> 01:10:46.644
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:10:46.644 --> 01:10:50.620
Is the nuclear waste
produced by these plants

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:53.883
different in some sense than
waste produced by light water

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:55.034
reactors?

01:10:55.034 --> 01:10:57.200
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES: Is
the nuclear waste different

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.440
than the waste produced
by light water reactors?

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.120
Yeah, it's quite different.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.660
The light water
reactors' waste is

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.770
in the same fuel
form it went in,

01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:10.130
so fuel rods that are
then to be disposed

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:13.950
of at some future,
undetermined place.

01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:19.640
The molten salt reactor can
continue to operate and consume

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:24.930
a lot of the sort of
actinides-- the heavy uranium--

01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:28.970
the heavy elements, like
plutonium, americium,

01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:31.570
californium, well, and so on.

01:11:31.570 --> 01:11:37.130
So the long-lived heavy
metal, radioactive products

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:39.860
continue to be consumed.

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:41.620
Now, when you finally
stop the reactor,

01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:43.410
you're going to have
some of those left.

01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:47.110
So the amount of that
waste per kilowatt hour

01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:48.500
that was generated is lower.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.830
But you're still going to
have that kind of waste

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:52.720
to deal with at some point.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.860
In addition, both
kinds of reactors

01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:59.130
generate the fission products--
that is, the cesium or iodine

01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:03.570
or whatever it is, xenon,
strothium, and so on,

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:05.810
that you've heard of--
which come from splitting

01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:10.470
those big, heavy nuclei
of uranium and plutonium.

01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:12.500
Both kind of reactors
generate the same kind

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.820
of fission products.

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.910
But the decay time for those is
on the order of a few hundred

01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:22.840
years before they're really more
or less benign for handling.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:27.320
So the answer is, there's less
of the waste per kilowatt hour

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.860
generated-- less of a long-life
waste per kilowatt hour

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:34.380
generated, about the
same amount of waste

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:37.060
per kilowatt hour generated
for the fission products that

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.295
have the shorter lifetimes.

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:43.873
AUDIENCE: So, if we were to,
say, try and replace as much

01:12:43.873 --> 01:12:47.450
of the coal and natural
gas power infrastructure

01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:50.760
with liquid thorium
reactors instead,

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.310
how much would we
still need in the mix

01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:56.224
to provide peak and
on-demand power?

01:12:56.224 --> 01:12:58.390
Because I'm assuming even
the smaller thorium plants

01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:02.224
won't be able to come up on
demand to respond to the grid.

01:13:02.224 --> 01:13:03.890
DR. ROBERT HARGRAVES:
Yeah, the question

01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:06.370
is, would you need some kind
of peaking plants in addition

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:08.078
to the nuclear power
plants, because they

01:13:08.078 --> 01:13:10.950
are slow to respond
to demand changes?

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:12.444
Well, the current
plants are slow,

01:13:12.444 --> 01:13:14.360
basically because they
were designed that way.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.050
And they could have been
designed to be more responsive.

01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:19.320
But they haven't.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:23.860
They are designed to recover
all their costs at full power.

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:28.410
So the owners of those plants
don't want to turn them down.

01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:30.630
Now, the newer plants
will have the same issue,

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:36.660
in the sense of, can we-- do
we want to turn them down?

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.120
The owners will say, no, I
want to keep generating money.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.370
So that's the real issue.

01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:44.435
You can engineer it to make
it go-- turn it down pretty

01:13:44.435 --> 01:13:45.120
easily.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.834
The plants do what's
called load following.

01:13:47.834 --> 01:13:50.000
That is, if you diminish
the load on the power plant

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.260
by turning off the lights
or breaking a pylon

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:58.910
and ruining the
load on the plant,

01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:01.560
the ability to dissipate
heat disappears.

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.650
The temperature of
the reactor goes up.

01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:06.320
And the physics of
the reactor designs

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.570
shuts it down, or slows it down.

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:10.520
That same principle
means it automatically

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.020
does load following.

01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:17.910
So you can indeed have these
plants run at a lower speed

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:22.302
and not require backup
from, say, natural gas,

01:14:22.302 --> 01:14:23.260
or something like that.

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:31.050
Thank you.
