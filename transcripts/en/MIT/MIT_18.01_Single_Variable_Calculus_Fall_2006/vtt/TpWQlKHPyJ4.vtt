ocw.mit.edu.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.630
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.220
Now, today we get to move on
from integral formulas and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.620
methods of integration back
to some geometry.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.290
And this is more or less going
to lead into the kinds of

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.120
tools you'll be using in
multivariable calculus.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.510
The first thing that we're going
to do today is discuss

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:58.220
arc length.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.940
Like all of the cumulative sums
that we've worked on,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.710
this one has a storyline and the
picture associated to it,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.360
which involves dividing
things up.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.650
If you have a roadway, if you
like, and you have mileage

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.400
markers along the road, like
this, all the way up to, say,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:28.060
sn here, then the length along
the road is described by this

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.560
parameter, s.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.930
Which is arc length.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.080
And if we look at a graph of
this sort of thing, if this is

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.390
the last point b, and this is
the first point a, then you

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.460
can think in terms of having
points above x1, x2, x3, etc.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.940
The same as we did with
Riemann sums.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.710
And then the way that we're
going to approximate this is

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:09.470
by taking the straight lines
between each of these points.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.260
As things get smaller and
smaller, the straight line is

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.210
going to be fairly close
to the curve.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.980
And that's the main idea.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.050
So let me just depict one
little chunk of this.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.900
Which is like this.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.530
One straight line, and here's
the curved surface there.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.940
And the distance along the
curved surface is what I'm

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.000
calling delta s, the change in
the length between, so this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.920
would be s2 - s1 if I
depicted that one.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.170
So this would be delta s is,
say s. si - si - 1, some

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.240
increment there.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.500
And then I can figure out what
the length of the orange

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.750
segment is.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.630
Because the horizontal
distance is delta x.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.290
And the vertical distance
is delta y.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.390
And so the formula is that the
hypotenuse is delta x ^2 +

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.470
delta y ^2.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.420
Square root.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.870
And delta s is approximately
that.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.980
So what we're saying is
that delta s ^2 is

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.370
approximately this.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.870
So this is the hypotenuse.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.500
Squared.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.520
And it's very close to the
length of the curve.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.120
And the whole idea of calculus
is in the infinitesimal, this

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:44.150
is exactly correct.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.010
So that's what's going to
happen in the limit.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.000
And that is the basis for
calculating arc length.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.060
I'm going to rewrite that
formula on the next board.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.460
But I'm going to write it in
the more customary fashion.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.200
We've done this before,
a certain amount.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.460
But I just want to emphasize
it here because this

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.390
handwriting is a little
bit peculiar.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.710
This ds is really
all one thing.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.690
What I really mean is to put
the parenthesis around it.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.660
It's one thing.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.070
It's not d * s, it's ds.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.020
It's one thing.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.940
And we square it.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.940
But for whatever reason people
have gotten into the habit of

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.650
omitting the parentheses.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.070
So you're just going to have
to live with that.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.050
And realize that this is not d
of s ^2 or anything like that.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.470
And similarly, this is a single
number, and this is a

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.130
single number.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.060
Infinitesimal.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.300
So that's just the way that this
idea here gets written in

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.350
our notation.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.710
And this is the first time we're
dealing with squares of

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.070
infinitesimals.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.600
So it's just a little
different.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.490
But immediately the first thing
we're going to do is

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.750
take the square root.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.780
If I take the square root,
that's the square root of dx

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.640
^2 + dy ^2.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.640
And this is the form
in which I always

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.400
remember this formula.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.030
Let's put it in some brightly
decorated form.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.200
But there are about 4, 5, 6
other forms that you'll derive

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.110
from this, which all mean
the same thing.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.520
So this is, as I say, the
way I remember it.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.270
But there are other ways
of thinking of it.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.070
And let's just write a
couple of them down.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.380
The first one is that you
can factor out the dx.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.480
So that looks like this.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.680
1 + (dy / dx)^2.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.630
And then I factored
out the dx.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.820
So this is a variant.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.780
And this is the one which
actually we'll be using in

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.490
practice right now
on our examples.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:57.260
So the conclusion is that the
arc length, which if you like

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:06.800
is this total sn - s0, if you
like, is going to be equal to

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.180
the integral from a to b
of the square root of 1

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:20.490
+ (dy / dx)^2 dx.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.680
In practice, it's also
very often written

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.090
informally as this.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.750
The integral ds.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.490
So the change in this little
variable s, and this is what

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.410
you'll see notationally
in many textbooks.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.430
So that's one way of writing it,
and of course the second

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.950
way of writing it which is
practically the same thing is

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.040
square root of 1 +
f ' ( x^2) dx.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.330
Mixing in a little bit
of Newton's notation.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.250
And this is with y = f (x).

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.310
So this is the formula
for arc length.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.770
And as I say, I remember
it this way.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.060
But you're going to have to
derive various variants of it.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.120
And you'll have to use
some arithmetic to

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.650
get to various formulas.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.190
And there will be more later.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.030
Yeah, question.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.820
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:27.350
PROFESSOR: OK, the question is,
is f ' (x)^2 = f '' (x).

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.020
And the answer is no.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.090
And let's just see what it is.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:39.360
So, for example, if f ( x) = x
^2, which is an example which

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:46.450
will come up in a few minutes,
then f ' (x) = 2x and f ' ( x

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:52.380
)^2 = = (2x), which is 4x ^2.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.180
Whereas f '' ( x) is equal to,
if I differentiate this

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.750
another time, it's equal to 2.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.440
So they don't mean
the same thing.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.700
The same thing over here.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.360
You can see this dy / dx, this
is the rate of change of y

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.190
with respect to x.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.780
The quantity squared.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.400
So in other words, this
thing is supposed to

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.450
mean the same as that.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:13.800
Yeah.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:19.580
Another question.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:25.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.850
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
you got a little nervous

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.430
because I left out
these limits.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.800
And indeed, I did that on
purpose because I didn't want

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.530
to specify what was going on.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.230
Really, if you wrote it in terms
of ds, you'd have to

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.760
write it as starting at s0 and
ending at sn to be consistent

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.180
with the variable s.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.730
But of course, if you write it
in terms of another variable,

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:46.940
you put that variable in.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.990
So this is what we do when we
change variables, right?

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.570
We have many different choices
for these limits.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.530
And this is the clue as to
which variable we use.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:59.060
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.180
PROFESSOR: Correct. s0 and
sn are not the same

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.310
thing as a and b.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.290
In fact, this is xn.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.740
And this x0, over here.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.990
That's what a and b are.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:13.250
But s0 and sn are mileage
markers on the road.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.450
They're not the same thing as
keeping track of what's

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.950
happening on the x axis.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.240
So when we measure arc length,
remember it's mileage along

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:27.980
the curved path.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.410
So now, I need to give
you some examples.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:40.820
And my first example is going
to be really basic.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.630
But I hope that it helps to give
some perspective here.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.560
So I'm going to take the example
y = m x, which is a

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.550
linear function, a
straight line.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:58.630
And then y ' would = m, and so
ds is going to be the square

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.650
root of 1 + (y ') ^2 dx.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:10.840
Which is the square root
of 1 + m ^2 dx.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:17.700
And now, the length, say, if
we go from, I don't know,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:24.990
let's say 0 to 10, let's say.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:29.620
Of the graph is going to be the
integral from 0 to 10 of

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.990
the square root of
1 + m ^2 dx.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:39.910
Which of course is just 10
square root of 1 + m ^2.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.810
Not very surprising.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.360
This is a constant.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.570
It just factors out and
the integral from 0

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:51.210
to 10 of dx is 10.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.340
Let's just draw a
picture of this.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.530
This is something which
has slope m here.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.020
And it's going to 10.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.340
So this horizontal is 10.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.930
And the vertical is 10 m.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.030
Those are the dimensions
of this.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:12.050
And the Pythagorean theorem says
that the hypotenuse, not

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.530
surprisingly, let's draw it in
here in orange to remind

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.840
ourselves that it was the same
type of orange that we had

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.850
over there, this length
here is the square

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:27.160
root of 10 ^2 + (10m)^2.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.400
That's the formula for
the hypotenuse.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:38.520
And that's exactly
the same as this.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.540
Maybe you're saying duh,
this is obvious.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.160
But the point that I'm trying
to make is this.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.220
If you can figure out these
formulas for linear functions,

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.510
calculus tells you how to do
it for every function.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.370
The idea of calculus is that
this easy calculation here,

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:01.100
which you can do without any
calculus at all, all of the

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.050
tools, the notations of
differentials and limits and

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.430
integrals, is going to
make you be able to

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.040
do it for any curve.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.000
Because we can break things
up into these little

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.070
infinitesimal bits.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.380
This is the whole idea of all of
the methods that we had to

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.620
set up integrals here.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:25.770
This is the main point
of these integrals.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:32.480
Now, so let's do something
slightly more interesting.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:41.140
Our next example is going to be
the circle, so y = square

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:48.590
root of 1 - x ^2.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.820
If you like, that's the
graph of a semicircle.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:57.040
And maybe we'll set it
up here this way.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.030
So that the semicircle goes
around like this.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.310
And well start it
here at x = 0.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.250
And we'll go over to a.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.560
And we'll take this little
piece of the circle.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.150
So down to here.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.850
If you like.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:16.010
So here's the portion of the
circle that I'm going to

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.660
measure the length of.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.110
Now, we know that length.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.160
It's called arc length.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.760
And I'm going to give it a name,
I'm going to call it

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.400
alpha here.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:39.640
So alpha's the arc length
along the circle.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.660
Now, let's figure
out what it is.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.560
First, in order to do this,
I have to figure

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.970
out what y ' is.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.960
Or, if you like, dy / dx.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.680
Now, that's a calculation that
we've done a number of times.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.830
And I'm going to do it
slightly faster.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.180
But you remember it gives
you a square root in the

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.160
denominator.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.070
And then you have the derivative
of what's inside

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.180
the square root.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.260
Which is - 2x.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.320
But then there's also 1/2,
because in disguise it's

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.840
really (1 - x ^2)^2 1/2.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.160
So we've done this calculation
enough times that I'm not

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.500
going to carry it
out completely.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.290
I want you to think
about what it is.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.950
It turns out to - x up
here, because the

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:22.890
1/2 and the 2 cancel.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:27.410
And now the thing that we have
to integrate is this arc

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.190
length element, as
it's called. ds.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.970
And that's going to be
the square root of

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:38.350
1 + (y ') ^2 dx.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.060
And so I'm going to have to
carry out the calculation,

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.970
some messy calculation here.

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:47.020
Which is that this is 1
+ ( - x / square root

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.610
of 1 - x ^2) ^2.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.410
So I have to figure out what's
under the square root sign

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.740
over here in order to carry
out this calculation.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.570
Now let's do that.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:03.310
This is 1 + x ^2 / 1 - x ^2.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.140
That's what this
simplifies to.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.700
And then that's equal
to, over a common

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.190
denominator, (1 - x ^2).

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.580
1 - x ^2 + x^2.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.500
And there is a little bit
of simplification now.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.190
Because the 2x ^2's cancel.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:28.640
And we get 1 / 1 - x^2.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:36.350
So now I get to finish off the
calculation by actually

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.580
figuring out what the
arc length is.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.460
And what is it?

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:47.630
Well, this alpha is equal
to the integral

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.990
from 0 to a of ds.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.510
Well, it's going to
be the square root

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.110
of what I have here.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.950
This was a square, this is just
what was underneath the

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:58.710
square root sign.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.500
This is 1 + (y ') ^2.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.270
Have to take the square
root of that.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:13.350
So what I get here is dx / the
square root of 1 - x ^2.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:18.590
And now, we recognize this.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.100
The antiderivative of this is
something that we know.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.790
This is the inverse sine.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.830
Evaluated at 0 and a.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:30.380
Which is just giving us the
inverse sine of a, because the

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:35.860
inverse sine of 0 = 0.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:43.980
So alpha = the inverse
sine of a.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:51.320
That's a very fancy way of
saying that sine alpha = a.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.870
That's the equivalent
statement here.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:17:00.150
And what's going on here is
something that's just a little

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.950
deeper than it looks.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.120
Which is this.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.180
We've just figured out a
geometric interpretation of

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.350
what's going on here.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:13.680
That is, that we went a distance
alpha along this arc.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:28.570
And now remember that the
radius here is 1.

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:34.430
And this horizontal distance
here is a.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.450
This distance here is a.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:43.710
And so the geometric
interpretation of this is that

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:51.000
this angle is alpha radians.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.950
And sine alpha = a.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.480
So this is consistent with our
definition previously, our

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.530
previous geometric definition
of radians.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:07.190
But this is really your first
true definition of radians.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.380
We never actually, people told
you that radians were the arc

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.570
length along this curve.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.770
This is the first time
you're deriving it.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:18.420
This is the first time you're
seeing it correctly done.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.780
And furthermore, this is the
first time you're seeing a

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.100
correct definition of
the sine function.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.590
Remember we had this crazy
way, we we defined the

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.190
exponential function, then we
had another way of defining

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.660
the ln function as
an integral.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.900
Then we defined the exponential
in terms of it.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.690
Well, this is the same
sort of thing.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.040
What's really happening here
is that if you want to know

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.900
what radians are, you have
to calculate this number.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.070
If you've calculated this number
then by definition if

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:49.280
sine is the thing whose alpha
radian amount gives you a,

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.520
then it must be that this
is sine inverse of a.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.530
And so the first thing that gets
defined is the arc sine.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.940
And the next thing that gets
defined is the sine

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.250
afterwards.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:04.500
This is the way the foundational
approach actually

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.730
works when you start from
first principles.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.200
This arc length being one
of the first principles.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.720
So now we have a solid
foundation for trig functions.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.150
And this is giving
that connection.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.020
Of course, it's consistent with
everything you already

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.730
knew, so you don't
have to make any

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.220
transitional thinking here.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.700
It's just that this is the first
time it's being done

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.570
rigorously.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:36.380
Because you only now
have arc length.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.520
So these are examples,
as I say, that

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.220
maybe you already know.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.820
And maybe we'll do one that we
don't know quite as well.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:49.300
Let's find the length
of a parabola.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:59.180
This is Example 3.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.740
Now, that was what I
was suggesting we

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.140
were going to do earlier.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:09.800
So this is the function
y = x ^2. y ' = 2x.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:20.120
And so ds = the square root
of 1 + (2x) ^2 dx.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.600
And now I can figure out what
a piece of a parabola is.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.830
So I'll draw the piece of
parabola up to a, let's say,

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.840
starting from 0.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.680
So that's the chunk.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:45.450
And then its arc length, between
0 and a of this curve,

00:20:45.450 --> 00:21:02.400
is the integral from 0 to a of
square root of 1 + 4x ^2 dx.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:08.490
OK, now if you like, this is
the answer to the question.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:12.270
But people hate looking at
answers when they're integrals

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.800
if they can be evaluated.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.830
So one of the reasons why
we went through all this

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.800
rigamarole of calculating these
things is to show you

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.120
that we can actually evaluate
a bunch of these functions

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.340
here more explicitly.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.850
It doesn't help a lot, but
there is an explicit

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:28.680
calculation of this.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.560
So remember how you
would do this.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.040
So this is just a little
bit of review.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.420
What we did in techniques
of integration.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.000
The first step is what?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.700
A substitution.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.950
It's a trig substitution.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.030
And what is it?

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.250
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.270
PROFESSOR: So x equals
something tan theta.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:54.930
I claim that it's 1/2 tan, and
I'm going to call it u.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.910
Because I'm going to use theta
for something else

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.325
in a couple of days.

00:21:58.325 --> 00:21:58.660
OK?

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.420
So this is the substitution.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:10.620
And then of course dx =
1/2 sec ^2 u du , etc.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.750
So what happens if
you do this?

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.265
I'll write down the answer,
but I'm not going

00:22:15.265 --> 00:22:16.330
to carry this out.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.090
Because every one of these
is horrendous.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.190
But I think I worked it out.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.370
Let's see if I'm lucky.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.300
Oh yeah.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.380
I think this is what it is.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:40.740
It's a 1/4 ln 2x + square root
of 1 + 4x ^2 + 1/2 x ( square

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:46.540
root of 1 + 4x ^2).

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:52.190
Evaluated at a and 0.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.090
So yick.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.810
I mean, you know.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.720
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.850
PROFESSOR: Why I did
I make it 1/2?

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:01.400
Because it turns out that
when you differentiate.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.780
So the question is, why
there 1/2 there?

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.420
If you differentiate it without
the 1/2, you get this

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.650
term and it looks like it's
going to be just right.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.990
But then if you differentiate
this one

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.950
you get another thing.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.170
And it all mixes together.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.660
And it turns out that
there's more.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.280
So it turns out that it's 1/2.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.750
Differentiate it and check.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.530
So this just an incredibly
long calculation.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.220
It would take fifteen minutes
or something like that.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.220
But the point is, you
do know in principle

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.840
how to do these things.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:43.900
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.550
PROFESSOR: Oh, he was talking
about this 1/2, not

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.110
this crazy 1/2 here.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.600
Sorry.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.800
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.470
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.740
So sorry about that.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.080
Thank you for helping.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.270
This factor of 1/2 here comes
about because when you square

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.690
x, you don't get tan ^2.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:03.410
When you square 2x, you get 4x
^2 and that matches perfectly

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:03.930
with this thing.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:07.550
And that's why you need
this factor here.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:07.800
Yeah.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.970
Another question,
way in the back.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:18.190
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.780
PROFESSOR: The question is, when
you do this substitution,

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.040
doesn't the limit from
0 to a change.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.020
And the answer is,
absolutely yes.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.830
The limits in terms of u are not
the same as the limits in

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.800
terms of a.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.000
But if I then translate back to
the x variables, which I've

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.820
done here in this bottom
formula, of x = 0 and x = a,

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.740
it goes back to those in
the original variables.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.100
So if I write things in the
original variables, I have the

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.980
original limits.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.020
If I use the u variables, I
would have to change limits.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.840
But I'm not carrying out the
integration, because

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.060
I don't want to.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:00.630
So I brought it back
to the x formula.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:07.080
Other questions.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.180
OK, so now we're ready to launch
into three-space a

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.250
little bit here.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:41.310
We're going to talk about
surface area.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:46.660
You're going to be doing a
lot with surface area in

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.550
multivariable calculus.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.990
It's one of the really
fun things.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.870
And just remember, when it gets
complicated, that the

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.180
simplest things are the
most important.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.090
And the simple things are, if
you can handle things for

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.450
linear functions, you know all
the rest. So there's going to

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.390
be some complicated stuff but
it'll really only involve

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.480
what's happening on planes.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.680
So let's start with
surface area.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:18.630
And the example that I'd like to
give, this is the only type

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:28.560
of example that we'll have, is
the surface of rotation.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.990
And as long as we have
our parabola there,

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.300
we'll use that one.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:51.920
So we have y = x ^2, rotated
around the x axis.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.480
So let's take a look at
what this looks like.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.910
It's the parabola, which
is going like that.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.850
And then it's being spun
around the x axis.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:08.390
So some kind of shape like
this with little circles.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:17.880
It's some kind of trumpet
shape, right?

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.850
And that's the shape
that we're.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:20.980
Now, again, it's the surface.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:27.770
It's just the metal of the
trumpet, not the insides.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:32.600
Now, the principle for figuring
out what the formula

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:37.160
for area is, is not that
different from what we did for

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.530
surfaces of revolution.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.600
But it just requires a little
bit of thought and

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.610
imagination.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:50.360
We have a little chunk of
arc length along here.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:55.580
And we're going to spin
that around this axis.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:02.230
Now, if this were a horizontal
piece of arc length, then it

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.500
would spin around just
like a shell.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.550
It would just be a surface.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:12.660
But if it's tilted, if it's
tilted, then there's more

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.040
surface area proportional to the
amount that it's tilted.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.650
So it's proportional to the
length of the segment that you

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.890
spin around.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:27.370
So the total is going
to be ds, that's one

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.430
of the factors here.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.220
Maybe I'll write that second.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.560
That's one of the dimensions.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.660
And then the other dimension
is the circumference.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:43.180
Which is 2 pi, in this case y.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.300
So that's the end of
the calculation.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:55.990
This is the area element
of surface area.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.860
Now, when you get to 18.02, and
maybe even before that,

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.000
you'll also see some people
referring to this area element

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.190
when it's a curvy surface like
this with a notation d S.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:10.770
That's a little confusing
because we have a

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.070
lower case s here.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.450
We're not going to
use it right now.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.620
But the lower case s is
usually arc length.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:23.950
The upper case s is usually
surface area.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.650
So.

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:32.510
Also used for dA.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.730
The area element.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:39.780
Because this is a curved
area element.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:47.630
So let's figure out
this example.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:54.230
So in the example, is equal to x
^2 then the situation is, we

00:29:54.230 --> 00:30:01.280
have the surface area is equal
to the integral from, I don't

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.350
know, 0 to a if those
are the limits that

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.040
we wanted to choose.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:10.470
Of 2 pi x ^2, right?

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:17.960
Because y = x ^2 ( the square
root of 1 + 4x ^2) dx.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.300
Remember we had this from
our previous example.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:32.850
This was ds from previous.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:41.930
And this, of course,
is 2 pi y.

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:49.150
Now again, the calculation of
this integral is kind of long.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.060
And I'm going to omit it.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.950
But let me just point out that
it follows from the same

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.350
substitution.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:31:01.870
Namely, x = 1/2 tan u.

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.150
Is going to work for
this integral.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.200
It's kind of a mess.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.590
There's a tan ^2 here
and the sec ^2.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.170
There's another secant
and so on.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.955
So it's one of these trig
integrals that then takes a

00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:19.670
while to do.

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:22.940
So that just is going to
trail off into nothing.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.200
And the reason is that
what's important

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.250
here is more the method.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.650
And the setup of
the integrals.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:32.450
The actual computation, in
fact, you could go to a

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.790
program and you could plug in
something like this and you

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.300
would spit out an answer
immediately.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.100
So really what we just want is
for you to have enough control

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.640
to see that it's an integral
that's a manageable one.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.760
And also to know that if
you plugged it in, you

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:50.970
would get an answer.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.630
When I actually do carry out a
calculation, though, what I

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:59.090
want to do is to do something
that has an answer that you

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:00.190
can remember.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.090
And that's a nice answer.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:05.530
So that turns out to be
the example of the

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.580
surface area of a sphere.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.110
So it's analogous
to this 2 here.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:15.170
And maybe I should remember
this result here.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:24.390
Which was that the arc length
element was given by this.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:38.700
So we'll save that
for a second.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.710
So we're going to do this
surface area now.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.930
So if you like, this
is another example.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:54.820
The surface area of a sphere.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:33:00.170
This is a good example, and
one, as I say, that has a

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:01.160
really nice answer.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:07.130
So it's worth doing.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.850
So first of all, I'm not going
to set it up quite the way I

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.840
did in Example 2.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.080
Instead, I'm going to take the
general sphere, because I'd

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.790
like to watch the dependence
on the radius.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:22.160
So here this is going
to be the radius.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.250
It's going to be radius a.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:31.890
And now, if I carry out the same
calculations as before,

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:35.290
if you think about it for a
second, you're going to get

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:39.680
this result.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.780
And then, the rest of the
arithmetic, which is sitting

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:53.120
up there in the case, a = 1,
will give us that ds = what?

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.670
Well, maybe I'll just
carry it out.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:58.510
Because that's always nice.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:03.630
So we have 1 + x ^2
/ a ^2 - x ^2.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.060
That's 1 + (y ') ^2.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.630
And now I put this over
a common denominator.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.800
And I get a ^2 - x ^2.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.030
And I have in the numerator
a ^2 - x ^2 + x^2.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:17.590
So the same cancellation
occurs.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:25.390
But now we get an a ^2
in the numerator.

00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:28.070
So now I can set up the ds.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.200
And so here's what happens.

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:35.370
The area of a section of the
sphere, so let's see.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:39.270
We're going to start at some
starting place x1, and end at

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:40.760
some place x2.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.110
So what does that look like?

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.140
Here's the sphere.

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.490
And we're starting
at a place x1.

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:49.810
And we're ending
at a place x2.

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:53.830
And we're taking more or less
the slice here, if you like.

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:59.480
The section of this sphere.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.150
So the area's going
to equal this.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:06.730
And what is it going to be?

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:12.820
Well, so I have here 2 pi y.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.310
I'll write it out, just
leave it as y for now.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:19.190
And then I have ds.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.110
So that's always what the
formula is when you're

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:25.880
revolving around the x axis.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.920
And then I'll plug in
for those things.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:38.700
So 2 pi, the formula for y is
square root a ^2 - x ^2.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.860
And the formula for ds, well,
it's the square root

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.970
of this times dx.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:51.760
So it's the square root of
a ^2 / a ^2 - x ^2 dx.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.880
So this part is ds.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:02.170
And this part is y.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:05.230
And now, I claim we have a nice

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.590
cancellation that takes place.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.770
Square root of a ^2 = a.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.740
And then there's another
good cancellation.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:13.990
As you can see.

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:17.805
Now, what we get here is the
integral from x1 to x2, of 2

00:36:17.805 --> 00:36:21.160
pi a dx, which is about
the easiest

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.340
integral you can imagine.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.940
It's just the integral
of a constant.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:36.810
So it's 2 pi a ( x2 - x1).

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:40.780
Let's check this in a
couple of examples.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:48.390
And then see what it's saying
geometrically, a little bit.

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:54.190
So what this is saying, so
special cases that you should

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:58.220
always check when you have a
nice formula like this, at

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.250
least. But really with anything
in order to make sure

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.250
that you've got the
right answer.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:05.710
If you take, for example,
the hemisphere.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:08.920
So you take 1/2 of
this sphere.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.090
So that would be starting
at 0, sorry.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:14.300
And ending at a.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.270
So that's the integral
from 0 to a.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:21.890
So this is the case
x1 = 0. x2 = a.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:29.190
And what you're going to
get is a hemisphere.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:36.270
And the area is (2 pi a ) a.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:42.410
Or in other words, 2 pi a ^2.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:50.520
And if you take the whole
sphere, that's starting at x1

00:37:50.520 --> 00:38:02.640
= - a, and x2 = a, you're
getting (2 pi a) ( a - (- a)).

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.380
Which is 4 pi a ^2.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.230
That's the whole thing.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.140
Yeah, question.

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:21.780
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.590
PROFESSOR: The question is,
would it be possible to rotate

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:27.730
around the y axis?

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.330
And the answer is yes.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:34.550
It's legal to rotate
around the y axis.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:41.400
And there is, if you use
vertical slices as we did

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.710
here, that is, well they're sort
of tips of slices, it's a

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:46.790
different idea.

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:50.910
But anyway, it's using dx as the
integral of the variable

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:52.670
of integration.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.800
So we're checking each little
piece, each little

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.750
strip of that type.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.540
If we use dx here,
we get this.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.130
If you did the same thing
rotated the other way, and use

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.140
dy as the variable, you get
exactly the same answer.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.120
And it would be the
same calculation.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:14.080
Because they're parallel.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:14.870
So you're, yep.

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.280
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.770
PROFESSOR: Can you do service
area with shells?

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:23.330
Well, ah shell shape.

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:26.540
The short answer is not quite.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:32.340
The shell shape is a vertical
shell which is itself already

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.850
three-dimensional, and
it has a thickness.

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:37.270
So this is just a matter
of terminology, though.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:41.210
This thickness is this dx, when
we do this rotation here.

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:43.820
And then there are two
other dimensions.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.080
If we have a curved surface,
there's no other dimension

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:56.460
left to form a shell.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.760
But basically, you can chop
things up into any bits that

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.670
you can actually measure.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:04.020
That you can figure out
what the area is.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:08.270
That's the main point.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.960
Now, I said we were going to,
we've just launched into

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.910
three-dimensional space.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:21.650
And I want to now move on to
other space-like phenomena.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:26.780
But we're going to do this.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:31.980
So this is also a preparation
for 18.02, where you'll be

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.840
doing this a tremendous
amount.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:49.530
We're going to talk now about
parametric equations.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:57.150
Really just parametric curves.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.320
So you're going to see this
now and we're going to

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.890
interpret it a couple of times,
and we're going to

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.580
think about polar coordinates.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.920
These are all preparation for
thinking in more variables,

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.570
and thinking in a different
way than you've

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:09.720
been thinking before.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.520
So I want you to prepare
your brain to make

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.130
a transition here.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.540
This is the beginning
of the transition to

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:21.580
multivariable thinking.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:26.350
We're going to consider
curves like this.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:29.850
Which are described with x being
a function of t and y

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.410
being a function of t.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:35.630
And this letter t is called
the parameter.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:38.150
In this case you should think
of it, the easiest way to

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.700
think of it is as time.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.840
And what you have is what's
called a trajectory.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:48.090
So this is also called
a trajectory.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:52.410
And its location, let's
say, at time 0, is

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.590
this location here.

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:58.310
Of (0, y ( 0)), that's
a point in the plane.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:00.640
And then over here, for
instance, maybe

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.410
it's (x ( 1), y (1)).

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:07.630
And I drew arrows along here to
indicate that we're going

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:10.110
from this place over
to that place.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:16.190
These are later times. t = 1
is a later time than t = 0.

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:20.560
So that's just a very casual,
it's just the way

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.680
we use these notations.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:33.040
Now let me give you the first
example, which is x = a cos t,

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:40.340
y = a sin t.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.140
And the first thing to figure
out is what kind

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.490
of curve this is.

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:48.770
And to do that, we want to
figure out what equation it

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:52.000
satisfies in rectangular
coordinates.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.880
So to figure out what curve this
is, we recognize that if

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.720
we square and add.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.300
So we add x ^2 to y^2, we're
going to get something very

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.670
nice and clean.

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:11.990
We're going to get a^2 cos
^2 t + a ^2 sin ^2 t.

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.500
Yeah that's right, OK.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:16.842
Which is just a ^2 (cos^2
+ sin ^2), or

00:43:16.842 --> 00:43:19.230
in other words a^2.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:23.450
So lo and behold, what
we have is a circle.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:27.840
And then we know what
shape this is now.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:33.850
And the other thing I'd like
to keep track of is which

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.990
direction we're going
on the circle.

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:40.020
Because there's more to this
parameter then just the shape.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.570
There's also where we
are at what time.

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:44.000
This would be, think
of it like the

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.610
trajectory of a planet.

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:52.060
So here, I have to do this by
plotting the picture and

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.250
figuring out what happens.

00:43:53.250 --> 00:44:02.770
So at t = 0, we have (x, y) is
equal to, plug in here (a cos

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:06.190
0, a sin 0).

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:10.570
Which is just a * 1
+ a * 0, so a0.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:11.830
And that's here.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:14.660
That's the point (a, 0).

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:18.810
We know that it's the
circle of radius a.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.360
So we know that the curve
is going to go

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.140
around like this somehow.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:26.390
So let's see what happens
at t = pi / 2.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:32.500
So at that point, we have
(x,y) = ( a cos pi /

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:37.310
2, a sin pi / 2).

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:41.580
Which is (0, a), because
sine of pi / 2 = 1.

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.190
So that's up here.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.100
So this is what happens
at t = 0.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.220
This is what happens
at t = pi / 2.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.390
And the trajectory clearly
goes this way.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:54.800
In fact, this turns out
to be t = pi, etc.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.330
And it repeats at t = 2 pi.

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:01.600
So the other feature that we
have, which is qualitative

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:11.560
feature, is that it's
counterclockwise.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:17.020
No the last little bit is going
to be the arc length.

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.030
Keeping track of
the arc length.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:23.390
And we'll do that next time.
