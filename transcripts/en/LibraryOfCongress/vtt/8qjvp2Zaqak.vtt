He's an ordained minister.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.980

minister for 35 years,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.500
since you were seven years old.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.580
Is that correct [laughter]?

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson:
Bless you [inaudible].

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.440
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: He's also
a professor of sociology

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.100

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.110
and many other publications.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.650
Ibram X. Kendi is the author
of Stamped From the Beginning,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.640
Stamped From the Beginning,
which is the definitive history

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.440
of racist ideas in America.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.570

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.800
and Policy Center at American
University here in Washington,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.230
D.C. Thanks very much
to both of you.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.030
I really appreciate it.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:06.150
[ Applause ]

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.090
Before we seek answers, gentlemen,
I'd like to frame a question.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.220 position:56%
When you think about the issues that
you focus on, what is the question

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.670
that America faces right now?

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.440
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: Well
[laughter], so first of all I'd

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.950
like to thank you all for coming
to hear this conversation on race.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.190
And, of course, I'd like
to thank my co-panelists.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.160
And it's truly an honor to be here.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.960
The irony of this sort of is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.210
that it's really been the same
question throughout the history

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.520
of the United States.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.520
I think the major question
today is the same question

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.840
that the United States
faced in 1776,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.440
or in 1787 when the U.S.
Constitution was written,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.040
and that is, why does racial
inequality exist in this country?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.780
Why in 1776 were so many
black people enslaved

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.630
and so many white people free?

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.490
Why is it today there are so
many black people in another type

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.730
of slavery, in prison, and so
many more white people are free?

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.170
Why are black people on the losing
and dying end of American society

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.530
and whites are on the
sort of winning

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.740
and living end of American society?

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.030
And we've been debating this
question for quite some time.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.220
And there's largely
been two major answers.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.210
The first is that this
inequality exists

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.590
because there's something wrong
and inferior about black people.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.060
That black people are
reckless with the police

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.620 position:56%
and that's why they're being shot
in more cases than white people are.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.730
That black people are more
criminal-like and that's why 40%

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.890
of the incarcerated population
in this country is black.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.850
The other side of the equation
is racial discrimination.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.200
Racial discrimination
causes racial inequality.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.420
And then some Americans have
argued both, that it is the case

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.060
that black people are
inferior, but it's also the case

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.090
that racial discrimination exists.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.530
And really this three-way debate is
debate that I chronicle in Stamped

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.320
From the Beginning, seeking to
answer this singular question.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.880
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: I
appreciate you raising that,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.960
because you look back even
the period of the Civil War

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.230
when people were arguing
about slavery.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.960
Many of the people even who argued

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.690 position:56%
against slavery nevertheless did not
feel African Americans were equal

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.090
and didn't want to
give them equality.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.160
It's a complicated question then,
and you're saying it is now.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.900
What is the question on your
mind, Michael Eric Dyson?

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson:
Well, it's to pick up on,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.130
and I want to echo Dr. Kendi's --

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.290
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: It'll be a
better panel if you say he's wrong

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.260
about something [laughter].

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson:
We'll wait and see.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.860
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: All
right [laughter].

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: He
ain't saying nothing wrong yet.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.410
But it's an honor to be here with
such a distinguished journalist

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.620
and a great intellectual.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:20.280
You know, the question is to what
degree is America prepared to go

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.870
in order to preserve a myth
that it knows is a lie?

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.330
Now [applause] -- right?

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:37.590
That's building on rhetorically
the intellectual genealogy

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.650
in both the [inaudible] sense
that Professor Kendi has laid

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.650
out in brief form,
but in powerful form.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.400
Because the bottom line is,
what you going to do in the face

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.340
of obvious mischaracterizations of
human beings and your situation?

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.360
Because you ain't just lying
about black folk, you got to lie

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.300
to yourself about who you are.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.530
In order to maintain black
inferiority you've got

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.730
to exaggerate white superiority
to be redundant, white superiority

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.680
in terms of exaggeration.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.310
Right? Now, the only
thing I can say is

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.980
that the present administration
is the most irrefutable evidence

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.510
of the mythology of
white superiority.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:30.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.280
And I got to tell you, I probably
owe an apology to George Bush.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.700
I was, you know [laughter] -- I was
like going in man, the soft bigotry

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.950 position:56%
of low expectations, that's
autobiographical and dumb presidents

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.610
and doing stupid -- excuse me, sir,

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.990
by far you were the
not worst [laughter],

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.070
the guy in office now is.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.200
So to me, but Donald Trump
is the easy translation

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.010 position:56%
for what black folk have been trying

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.230
to tell white folk and
others for so long.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.380
Like white supremacy
is narcissistic,

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.820
it's self-involved,
it's self-aggrandizing.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.490
It is unconscious of its own
privilege and the extension

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.950
of that privilege as the predicate
of a kind of victimizing discourse.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.930
It's interesting to me that
a lot of, you know, bunches

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.860
and bunches and, you know, goo-gabs
[phonetic], and goo-gobs [phonetic]

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.820
of white folk who tell black folk,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.290
oh stop victimizing,
stop playing the victim.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.880
How do you explain
what's going on now?

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.320
Then the white working class
has been led to believe,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.510
and white people in general,
have been led to believe, right,

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.140
and not just older white folk,
in the millennial generation too,

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.140
they believe that we
talk about race too much,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.010
that black folk get too much ink.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.470
And they believe that some of the
greatest victims of race are white.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.790
So when you think about that,

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.780
how in the hell did we
get to that position?

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.520
The victimization, the victim
mongering, the self-pitying

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.080
that has collectively been
articulated as the basis

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.190
of American politics
is rather astonishing.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.230
So the question for me is, to what
degree are white people willing

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:17.590
to commit themselves collectively
to the delusion of white supremacy

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.950
and understand that until we
get rid of that we won't be able

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.390
to shatter the real bonds
that continue to maniacal us,

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.790
and we won't be ultimately free
until we ca free each other.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.090
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: This might --

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.220
go ahead, you can applaud
if you'd like to [applause].

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.600
This might be a good
moment to mention

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.740 position:56%
that Michael Eric Dyson's book takes
the form of a sermon [laughter].

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.100
I'll just mention.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: I'm going
to get that collection at the end,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.960
don't worry about it [laughter].

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.350
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: So you raised
the present administration.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.700
Let me mention a number
of ways that people try

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.760
to discuss the relationship of race
to the politics of this moment.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.720
People will say President Trump
is a racist, or he's not a bigot

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.490
but the people around him are,
or he's taking advantage of race,

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:08.380
or there may be racists among his
supporters, or this is all a bunch

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.850
of bunk and why are you
raising this issue so much,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:16.390
the guy is actually just saying
things that need to be said.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.140 position:56%
And when you talk to voters you hear
all kinds of things from people,

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.530
ranging from racial remarks

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.090
to genuine economic concerns
to a lot of confusion.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.970
Is the politics of this
moment really all about race?

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: So I think any --

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.940
you know, I wrote a book about
the history of racist ideas.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.640
In order to truly write this
book I had to show the ways

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.530
in which race was constantly
intercepting

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.050
with other identities
or other phenomena.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:52.160
And so in other words, I had to
show that really black people

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.780
in this book was really a history

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.590
of anti-black racist ideas are
a collection of racial groups,

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.500
or a collection of
racialized groups.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.540
And so you don't just have black
people, you have black women,

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.640
you have black men, you have the
black poor, you have black elites,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.200
you have black professors, right?

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.200
You have many of these
different groups,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.380
and each of these groups have
been targeted by racist ideas.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:20.200
But depending on the group chances
are the idea itself inter sort

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.220 position:56%
of sected with another type of idea.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.300
So in other words, the idea
that poor people are lazy,

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.470
and the idea that black people
are lazy, comes together to say

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.830
that black poor people are
lazier than white poor people.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.670
Right? Does everybody sort of
see the way that sort of works?

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:47.270
Or, the sexist idea that women
are weak, and the racist idea

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:53.640 position:56%
that black women are not really
women intersects to create this idea

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.940
of the strong black woman,
which is in sort of --

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.300
isn't the opposite of the idea
of the pinnacle of womanhood

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.600
which is the weak white woman.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.900
Right? And so, you know,
I had to sort of show all

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.110
of these other intersections,
and so racist constantly sort

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.160
of intersecting with class
and with gender and with --

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Is that
[inaudible] politics now?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.780
It's race intersecting
with each other?

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.080
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: Oh, precisely.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.380
I mean, I don't think
it's just black people

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.690
who are outraged by
the 45th president.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.860
Right? Black people
aren't the same --

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.550
I mean, women are outraged
[applause],

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.070
poor people are outraged, right,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.070
disabled people are outraged,
Muslims are outraged.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.080
I mean, I'm looking for somebody
who's not outraged [laughter],

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.380
right?

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.680
I mean, so it's -- no.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.980
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: What do
you think about people say

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.280
that the Trump phenomenon

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.030
that what's behind it is
economic anxiety, or unhappiness

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.230
with elitism, or -- you're rolling
your eyes practically there.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.370
Go on [laughter].

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:53.760
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: Well, I think --
I think some of these people are --

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:59.220 position:56%
the easiest way to understand them
is sort of post racial progressives.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.550
And what I mean by that is,
they're progressive in the sense

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:07.450
that they recognize that
class or even poverty

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.890
or even economic inequality
is a problem, right?

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.300
But they simultaneously
want to reduce everything

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.470
to economic anxiety,
to income inequality.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.810
And so that's where the post
racialism sort of comes in,

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.180
because in their mind, right,
race is no longer a problem.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.330
All of these issues
are issues of class.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.630
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Michael,
[inaudible]?

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: Well,

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.730
the two are not diametrically
opposed are they?

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.440
You could be [inaudible]
economically and a racist.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:43.660
I mean, so to ask if -- is it
really relevant to ask a kind

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.130
of deconstruction

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:50.480
of the psychological mendacity
that is purveyed by 45?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.320
Does it matter whether --
race is as racist does.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.590
We -- I'm not a Freudian or
a [inaudible] archetypal,

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.560
analytical psychologist, or a
Carl Rogers indirect approach

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.830
where I can put him on a couch
or, you know, psychoanalyze him.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.880
The thing is, I ain't
really interested

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.210
in the existential anxieties that
fuel and feed your demonization.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.490
I'm just saying the shit you're
doing is racist [laughter].

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.630
Right? That's what it is.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:30.720
So look, Donald Trump is proud of
being namechecked in rap music.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.340
Look at the jarring
juxtapositions that confuse us.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.440
A guy who's proud of the fact

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.040
that rappers have namechecked
him, hanging out with --

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.340
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: That's given --

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.640
that's given as evidence
that he's not racist.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson:
That's what I'm saying.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.940
So I'm saying, you -- he's
hanging out with black people.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.340
He's got black friends
that come to him.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.420
What does that have to do with --
this is -- this is our problem.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.760
We think racism, right?

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:59.850
The guy, Justin Volpe, who
plunged the plunger up the anus

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:05.390
of Abner Louima was
dating a black woman.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:10.860
So, you can sleep with a black
woman and still be a racist.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.150
So you can be namechecked by
black folk and still be racist.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.070
Even a champagne company was
being namechecked by them

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.740
so much they said,
hey, we don't even want

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.360
to be namechecked by them anymore.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.340
So they had to go from [inaudible]
to ace of spades, but that's inside

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.700
and out, there's no worry about it.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:30.100
So my point is -- my point is that
in this culture in which we live,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.860 position:56%
racism is not simply bigotry, right,

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.280
which is Howard Thurman said a
bigot is a person who makes an idol

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.850
of his or her commitments.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:42.860
Bigotry is real but
racism is also structural.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.520
It's also a set of ideas,
which is why racist ideas,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.360
he didn't say racist people.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.570
His book is a genealogical analysis
and the finest philosophical

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.700
and historical form of
ideas that motivate people,

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.750
even people who ostensibly
lay claim to being white

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.450
and liberals may be
subject to racist ideas.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.550
Martin Luther King, Junior
said, it's not the bigot,

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.720
it's not the KKK that turns me off.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.020
I see them.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.320
I know who they are.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.530
It's the white moderate who tells
me to slow down who's the problem.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.100
So what I'm saying to
you [applause] is that --

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.050
if that if you've got a
president who stands up and tries

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:23.720
to draw a functional equivalence
and a moral and ethical parallel

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.020
between neo-Nazis and fascists
and white supremacists,

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.370
and anti-fascists and Black
Lives Matter folk, you're dealing

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.340
with a guy whose corrupted
sensibilities are manifest,

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.700
and whose inability
to make a distinction

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.420
between the two reveals
the very racist logic

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.870
that is so evident to us.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.640
So we don't want to admit
the fact that here's a guy

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.000
who seems pugnacious
and willing to fight,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.660
but he also reinforces the
pathological beliefs about race

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.180
that have been the basis for
what Professor Kendi has talked

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.590
about in his book, and what we know
to be the case for interactions

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:02.940
with Americans across the board.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.690
So at that level, and then
finally when white folks say, look,

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:11.140
it's just my anxiety, it's just
that I'm nervous about the future,

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:16.220
so you elect a billionaire
[laughter] as your president.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.550
I ain't really sure that you were
that anxiety stricken that you get

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.190
in office a guy who
has no understanding

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.490
of what the everyday person is.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.330
Martin Luther King, Junior
is in jail in Birmingham,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.020
and his white jailors come to him
and say, you know what Dr. King,

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.500
you know, segregation is right
and immigration is wrong.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.800
He said, no, it's not.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.500
And then they start arguing.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.010
And he says, how much
money do you make?

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.960
And when they tell him he say,
well, hell, you need to be

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.740
out here marching with
us [laughter].

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.170
So why then -- this
is what I began with.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:54.040
The white working class is now
being celebrated as an ideal prism

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.340
through which to view things.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.460
First of all, they
can be racist, too.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:01.700
In fact, white working-class people
tend to be a bit more egregious

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.460
in the external manifestation
of race because they're

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.780
in direct competition with black
people over scarce of resources.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.340
Economic anxiety is the
translation of racial resistance

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.300
and black animus at the
level of the pocketbook.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.330
So white folk who say, oh yes, all
people should live together live

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.280
in suburbs away from Negros who
don't have to deal with housing,

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.790
who don't have to deal with their
kids going to the same school.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.050
Leave the burden to white
working-class people to work

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:31.870
out the mathematics and
algebra of racial conciliation.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.800
So, yeah, these are the people who
don't want black people in unions,

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.820
they don't want them
in pipefitter unions.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.850
They want to dominate
the concrete industry.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.560
In other words, white
working-class people have done some

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.130
of the most vitriolic things
against black working-class

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:51.170
and Latino working-class people,
so to elevate them automatically

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.160
as the kind of paragon of
virtues is problematic,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.070 position:56%
and then I'll end it by saying this.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.370
Then we got --

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Again,
it's a sermon.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: I'll say
this -- I'll say this [laughter].

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:04.200
What trips me out even further
though is even in the aftermath

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.980
of the election, Bernie
Sanders, my man, joined, right,

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.280
but look at what Bernie did though.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.100
Bernie joined with other people on
the right and on the left who said,

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.440
hey, identity politics
is killing us.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.660
So in other words, concerned
about queer people, gay, lesbian,

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.960
transgender, bisexual people,

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.720
concerned about black
people, about women's issues.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.020
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.450
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Is identity
politics killing you by the way?

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.820
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: Yeah,
it's called whiteness [laughter].

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.600
The greatest identity
-- let me tell you what.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.250
It's the Kyser Soze
approach [laughter].

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.550
It really is.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.840
If you know that movie and you know
usual suspects, the very thing,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.220
white folk [inaudible]
talking about,

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.720
oh my God, it's identity politics.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.810
What in the hell do
you think whiteness is?

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.570
Whiteness is the greatest
identity politics perpetrated

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.340
as a hoax upon American
consciousness in history.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.240
So, yes, I think identity
politics are destroying us.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.610 position:56%
And there were no identity politics,
notice this, until black people,

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.860
brown people, people of
color, indigenous people,

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.170
began to challenge
the unspoken hegemony

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.550
of whiteness as a universal norm.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.150
Look at what Professor Kendi did.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.640
So the ideal is this, white
people think that they are human.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.940
They are not white.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.340
We are American, not white.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.650
When you people come along saying,
oh, why don't you stop being black

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.310
and be human and be American,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:18.220
that's because whiteness has been
co-equivalent with what it means

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.220
to be human, and white people
don't see themselves as white.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.970
White folk got to come out
the closet and be a race

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.770
and an ethnicity as well.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.040
[ Applause ]

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.340
Sorry.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: No,
it's okay, it's okay.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.220
There's a lot to say and
there's a lot more to say.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.930
You made a reference there to
the Charlottesville situation,

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:41.950
the tragedy there around
demonstrations and around trying

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.640
to preserve a statue of Robert
E. Lee, which last I saw

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.750
in the news has been placed under
a sheet, is that right [laughter]?

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson:
So to speak [laughter].

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.650
So to speak.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.270
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: I'm just
leaving it right there [laughter].

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.680
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: I think the
black folk would rather have it not

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.980
under sheet.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson:
That's right, yeah, exactly.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.580
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Well,
that raises a question.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.880
The president himself
raised this question,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.860
and other people have been
raising this question and talking

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.040
about other things
they want to take down,

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.240
statues of the founding
fathers, other things.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.440
What monuments stay if
it's up to you gentlemen?

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.110
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: Well, I
think for me -- let me --

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:26.780
let me just say that as an African
American it's very difficult

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:33.210
to live by, walk by, even work
or go to school in a place named

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.290
after somebody who if they were
still living I would be enslaved.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.870
In the case of the Confederacy,

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:46.520 position:56%
I think it was crystal clear what
they intended if their nation lived.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.690
I mean, the vice president of the
Confederacy, Alexander Stephens,

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:54.030
weeks after the Confederacy
was founded in 1861,

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:59.070
stated that our new government
is founded upon the great truth

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.420
that the Negro is not
equal to the white man,

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.560
and that slavery is subordination

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.460
to the superior race is a
natural and normal condition.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.460
And Jefferson Davis, who
of course was the president

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.080
of the Confederacy, my book,
Stamped From the Beginning,

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.500
is named after when he said the
inequality between the black

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.410
and white races was
stamped from the beginning.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:24.550 position:56%
Right? And so it's clear and obvious
what these Confederate leaders stood

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.280
for, but we should also remember

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.590
that these Confederate leaders
were inspired by American leaders.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:34.090
Jefferson Davis was named
after Thomas Jefferson.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.650
His father specifically named
him after Thomas Jefferson

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.510 position:56%
because he admired Thomas Jefferson.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:43.890
And so there are all of these
sort of ideological relationships

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:48.200
between the Confederacy and
the slaveholding America,

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.190
and slaveholding America that
dominated America before,

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.910
of course, the Civil War.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:59.070
And so one of the things that I
think about is that people state

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:03.380
that the -- you can't really take
down the monuments of presidents.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.070
Like those are -- that's
the president.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.710
Like how are you going to take down
a monument for George Washington

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.860
or Thomas Jefferson or
one of these other people?

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.170
But then when I look at
Germany and I remember

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:18.270
that Hitler was the leader of
Germany and I don't see monuments

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.310
to Hitler, even though he was
the leader of that nation.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.910
Right? And so for me to
me, if it was up to me,

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.460
I would allow those
monuments of people

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:34.670
who truly represented what
America is -- says itself to be,

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:40.950
which is freedom, which is the
equality, which is meritocracy.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:44.080
Now, you see how I say
ideal says itself to be,

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.990
it's not necessarily that, right?

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.290
But the people --

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.590
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: It's
not that they were perfect

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.890
but that they stood for this idea.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:51.190
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: Precisely.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.440
And I think slaveholders
did not stand for that idea.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.950
And so -- and I think people
who are clearly racist

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.210
who instituted discriminatory
policies, not --

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.950
you know, not just sort of
racist but bigoted, you know,

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.800
people who divided people, who
discriminated against people,

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.160
who rendered particular
groups to be inferior.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.680
These are not the people
who should be represented

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.020
and honored, honored by a monument.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.110 position:56%
We have to -- we have to remember
that monuments, or when you're named

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.840
after something, that's an honor.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.160
Like this, you know, we're
honoring people in this way.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: What about -- what
about Thomas Jefferson, slave owner,

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.830
in some ways the classic kind

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.920
of liberal progressive
who's delaying progress

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.170 position:56%
that you described, and yet he wrote
the Declaration of Independence

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.440
and the phrase that got
millions of people free,

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.740
all men are created equal?

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.170
What would you -- what
would you do for him?

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: So for me, again,

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:48.790
the concept all men are created
equal has long been rendered an

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.570
antiracist idea.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.750
When in fact I sort of
demonstrate in the way

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.750
in which that's actually
a foundational

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:02.220 position:56%
or assimilationist idea, which in
my work I classify as a racist idea.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.160
And the way that works
is you can believe

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.680
that the racial groups
were created equal,

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.590
but then black people were raised
in that pathological culture,

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:17.780 position:56%
black people were raised in barbaric
Africa, black people were raised

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:22.150
in southeast D.C., and so
they have became inferior.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.300
And so now it's my job,
either liberals today

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.100
or Thomas Jefferson then, to
civilize and develop people.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:34.330
And so like that idea, the notion
of created equal, is actually not

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:38.910
by its very nature an
assimilation -- an antiracist idea.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:45.250
What actually is antiracist idea
is if we say groups are equal.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.450
You see the difference [applause]?

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:53.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: So great monuments
on the Mall, Washington Monument,

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:55.110
the Jefferson Memorial,
the Lincoln Memorial,

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.600
it sounds -- I hope Lincoln stays.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.900
Does Lincoln stay?

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.220
Lincoln okay [laughter]?

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.520
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: So I think --

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.010
I think Lincoln we can
have a little debate.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Oh,
all right [laughter].

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.820
How about you?

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.950
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: Well, I
mean, I'm getting schooled.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.000
I mean, but here's the things.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.320
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: You would have
said something different five

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.620
minutes ago, is that
what you're saying?

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: I'm
going to say it now [laughter].

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.520
I'm just going to say it now.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.970
I mean, you wanted us to disagree,

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.640
now you've got your wish
fulfilled, but not ultimately.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Typical
media figure [laughter].

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson:
So here's the deal.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.220
I think that Professor Kendi has
broken down here is extremely,

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.450
extremely important,
especially in the ideological

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.560
and philosophical argument about
creation versus existence, right?

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.170
That's, you know, what the
philosophers would call both an

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.580
ontological assertion
about the being of people.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.650
And a category mistake, how we --

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.210
how we convince ourselves to
lump them under the rubric

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.410
of a particular description.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.630
So that's really sophisticated
and nuance.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:53.700
But when it comes to the monuments
for me to apply that thinking,

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.760
here's my thought, right.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.230
There is a distinction
between Jefferson Davis

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.370
and Thomas Jefferson for me, right.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:04.400
In the sense that at least
one of them was trying

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.660
to articulate an ideal that
could be governing and regulative

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.940
of the notion of democracy so
that his words could be used,

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:18.180
even if not with original
intent, to subvert his own beliefs

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.460
and to include Martin Luther King,
Junior, to include Fanny Lou Hamer,

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:29.320
who could use those words as
powerful arguments in behalf

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.150
of the very people who
have been excluded.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.210
In other words, there was
interpretative flexibility.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:37.430
There was what we might call an
interpretation that was countered

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.340
to the dominant one that -- of the
original one, but King later on,

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.610
we hold these truths
to be self-evident.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:48.980
When King says that in
'63, August 28 at the --

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:54.470
behind, in front of Lincoln,
he's doing such imaginative,

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.540
ingenious reinterpretation of the
origins that he makes us think

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.840
about them in fresh ways.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.090
So for that matter, to
me, Lincoln, Washington,

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:06.350
and Jefferson would be
different than Jefferson, Davis,

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.650
and Stonewall Jackson,
who -- you know why?

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:11.900
Because first of all,
they were not patriots.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.220
Right? I mean, how you
[applause] -- right?

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.730
You [inaudible] have a statue of
Huey Newton before you got one

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.290
of Stonewall Jackson [laughter],
because Huey Newton wasn't trying

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.850
to go nowhere but here, right?

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:28.410
Bobby Seale, Angela Davis should
have a statue long before Stonewall

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:29.710
Jackson [applause].

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.490
So my point is, why?

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.770
Because they were secessionists.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.000
They didn't even love your country.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.700
They wanted to leave your country.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.000
They said it was inferior.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.120
It was the wrong argument for
the protection of democracy.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.520
So how are you celebrating
anti-patriot?

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.540
That would be like,
if had a president

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.140
who was selling the
election to Russia.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.990
That stuff could never happen
[laughter and applause].

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:59.100
So for me -- so for me, I think
that frail, flawed human beings,

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.480
because there's another
monument there

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.620
to Martin Luther King,
Junior, right?

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:10.370 position:56%
And some have tried to argue, right,
plagiarized his dissertation, right,

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:14.970
used other men's words
to substantiate his claim

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.050
as intellectual, and other things
that we don't need to get into up

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:21.970
in here, so some have argued,
well, the moral depravity

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.780
of the man contradicts the ethical
ideas for which he gave his life.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.530
And yet what I would argue, because
in my book on King I have tried

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.190
to say anything you going to
say, I'm going to take that,

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.000
deal with what it means,
and still argue

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.680
that he's the greatest
American we've ever seen.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.900
Why? Because those flaws
mitigate the incredible degree

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.590
to which he poetically,
prophetically,

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.660
and analytically put forth the
ideals of American democracy

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.440
in such a fashion that he
made this nation better.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:54.980
I would argue [applause] -- I would
argue that Lincoln at his best,

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.350 position:56%
in his reinterpretation, especially
reading Kendi's book, and Washington

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.590
and Jefferson and a few others,

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:05.910
as flawed as they were laid the
groundwork for reinterpretation

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.350
that subverted their very
moral trajectory that gave rise

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.890
to a movement that
contradicted them.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.720
I would keep them, and I'm
going to tell you why we get rid

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.810
of the monuments for
the Confederacy as well.

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:20.350
People say, well, this
is a teachable moment.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:21.900
Ain't nobody teaching nothing.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.280
There ain't no -- ain't
no teaching going on.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:29.770 position:56%
I don't see white southerners taking
their children to a Confederate flag

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:33.120 position:56%
or to a monument going, you know, we
want to deconstruct white supremacy

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.630
at its base [laughter],
and this man was the man.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.770
No, because when you have a
monument, as professor Kendi said,

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.070
you are celebrating an ideal.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.190
In a neutral environment
we could teach everything.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.400
This is not a neutral environment.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.590
And when you celebrate on
sacred soil the public rituals

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:55.590
of American democracy, everything
that's rooted there must have the

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:59.300
ultimate intent of embracing
the Democratic energy

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.310
that has made this
nation what it is today.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.130
That's why I would keep them and
get rid of the other cats as well.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:05.430
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: All
right [applause].

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:09.350
I want to ask two more
questions, if I can,

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.650
and just get a get
a few more minutes.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.610
I invited people on this social
media platform known as Twitter

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.470
to -- I just said, I'm going to
be talking to these gentleman,

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:18.870
anything you'd like to know,

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.910
and two questions stick
in my mind from people.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.540
I don't know who they are actually.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:28.630
But one of them said, would
you ask them, you gentlemen,

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:31.540 position:56%
if they feel they have done anything

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.610
that have worsened racial
divisions in America?

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:38.560
As public figures,
as public speakers,

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.430 position:56%
weighing in on controversial topics,

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.980 position:56%
is there anything you think didn't
work out the way had hoped it would?

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: Well,
that's a different question.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.940
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Okay [laughter].

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:52.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: Well, it
ain't always worked out [laughter],

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.940
but it ain't because I -- now, I'm
not presuming that whoever asked

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.290
that question is one
of the many kvetching

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.050
and complaining white people
who say you're a race baiter

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.350
because you acknowledge race.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:06.000
I'm not going to presume
that [laughter].

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.260
Because let's make it
a legitimate question.

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.690
See, here's the irony, I meet
many white people who think

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.780
because I talk about
race I'm creating race.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.080
I ain't created it.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.650
I'm revealing it to you.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.400
I'm just showing you
the chasm, the abyss.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.710
I'm showing you the ugliness.

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:23.010
And I'm not perfect.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.310
Am I flawed?

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:25.610
Of course.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:26.910
Have I made statements

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.040
that ultimately may
not serve the interests

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.620
for which I claim to serve?

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.920
Absolutely.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.600
But here's the problem.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.900
Here's the difference.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:40.490 position:56%
Many white people who are themselves
racists will see me and my mistake

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:44.730
as the unalterable manifestation
of an inherent inferiority

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.710
and a race baiting that they
never see in themselves,

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.740
or other white brothers
and sisters, number one.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.820
And number two, at the end of
the day what we are here to do,

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.900
and I don't want to speak
for Professor Kendi.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: He's about to.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: He's
going to speak for himself.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.780
But I'll say this, as a guy
who's been a public intellectual

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.120
for 30 some years, and has been on
this front line and writing books

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.660
and thinking, and thinking
out loud and stuff,

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.520
I have never claimed to be perfect.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.100
But Grace Jones said,
I ain't perfect

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.400
but I'm perfect for you [laughter].

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.910
So the great philosopher,
Grace Jones,

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:19.340
is sufficient for me [laughter].

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.600
And I think ultimately we are
trying to do the right thing.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.470
We're trying to make things better.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:29.200
We're trying to bring a spotlight
to issues, including our own.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.110
I'm trying to squeeze out the
sexism in myself as a feminist.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.410
Am I perfect?

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:35.710
Absolutely not.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.010
Do I need to be reprimanded
constantly?

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.500
Yes. Should I re-examine
my own principles daily?

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.320
Yes. But what we must
commit ourselves

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.110
to together is not demonizing each
other, but looking at the problems

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.650
that exist so that we can --

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:51.100
we can concretely eradicate the
possibility of white supremacy.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.220
That's what I'm about every
day and all day [applause].

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.220
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Dr. Kendi?

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.930
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: So it's --

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.310
I'm actually struggling
with this question,

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.140
because I'm actually seeking

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.670
to answer this question
I guess for my next book.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.150
And I think early in Stamped

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.080
From the Beginning I
talked about the way --

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: Don't give it
all away though, let them read it.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.770
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi:
All right, of course.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.120
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: Just
tease, just tease a little bit.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.170
Don't give them the answer.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:21.470
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi:
You know, I write --

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: They
got to pay $25 for that.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.910
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: Yes.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:29.460
Yes. So I'm not going to give
you that much [laughter].

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.990
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: So you're
wrestling with this question?

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:34.760
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: So I
think early in Stamped

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.780
From the Beginning I state
that the only thing wrong

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.100
with black people is that
we think something is wrong

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.740
with black people.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.370
And the only thing extraordinary
about white people is that,

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:48.710
anybody want to take a guess?

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:52.970
They think something is
extraordinary about white people.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:33:00.040 position:56%
But going back to black people,
once I, through studying the history

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:05.260
of racist ideas, once I realized
the fundamental functional

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:12.130
of racist ideas, and that
function was to prevent people

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:15.100
from resisting racial
discrimination,

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:21.510
from even preventing people from
seeing racial discrimination,

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:26.180
because they are so
infected by racist ideas

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:31.630
that when they see inequality they
see what's wrong with black people.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:34.220
Right? And so that means
those who were discriminating

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.410
against black people, and those
who were creating those inequities,

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:42.150
those who are benefiting from those
discriminatory policies are able

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:45.990
to continue to do so
because we can't even see --

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:48.850
we're not even looking for the
racial discrimination, right,

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:50.850
because we think black
people are criminal-like.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.150
We think black people are poor.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.510
We think black people
are hyper-sexual.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.690
Right? So we're not even going
to look for the discrimination

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.600
in the criminal justice system.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:04.290
And so I asked myself very simply,

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.690
are these ideas affecting
black people, too?

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:13.620
Do you have black people blaming
black people for racial equality?

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: Bill Cosby.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.220
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: Do you have
black people who are refusing

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.470
to resist racial discrimination
because they think

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:22.230
that the problem fundamentally
is black people?

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.900
And clearly the answer is yes.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.120
And so in writing sort of Stamped
From the Beginning, you know,

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:34.070
before I could chronicle and study

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:38.220
and reveal anyone else's
racist ideas,

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:42.270
I first had to chronicle
and reveal my own.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:44.090
I first had to come
to grips with the fact

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:48.310
that I had spent the better
part of my life thinking

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:53.080
that there was something
wrong with black people.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.330
And so to answer your
question, yes, I mean,

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.420
I grew up in the '80s and '90s.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.320 position:56%
Particularly in the '80s and '90's
you all know all of the racist ideas

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.060
that were swirling, even
within black neighborhoods,

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.040
which people were patting Bill
Clinton on the back for passing

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.970
and pushing through the Crime
Bill and antagonizing Angela Davis

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.040
who weeks before was
saying he should not do

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.340
that because that's going to lead

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.360
to what we now see as
a mass incarceration.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.490
Right? You know, you have black
people who were pushing for that

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.910
because they were so scared of who?

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:24.700
Black people.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:28.360
Right? And so I realized,
you know, that I too, again,

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.070
had consumed racist ideas.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:35.050
I also realized that really
racist ideas had principally,

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:38.900
historically targeted black minds.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:44.060
They didn't want you to run away
because they wanted you to believe

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.210
that you should be enslaved
because you are black.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:53.170
They did not want you to think that
you should have more resources,

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:57.270
that you should have more wealth,
that you should not be in poverty,

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.190
that you should not be in that
impoverishment neighborhood.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:04.000
They didn't want you, black people,
to think that because, right?

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.620
Then if black people
did they would resist.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.960
And those black people
who recognized

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:13.160
that inequality is
abnormal, who do not think

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.110
that white people are superior,

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.100
these are the very people
throughout our history

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.260
who have resisted, right?

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:23.860 position:56%
And so I realized, again, that I had
not done enough resisting in my life

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.990
because of the racist
ideas I had consumed.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.720
So I mentioned a new book.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.670
So, you know, I'm actually
writing a book that really sort

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:37.450
of takes the reader through
my own sort of upbringing,

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:42.410
consuming racist ideas,
and how I ultimately strove

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:43.710
to be an antiracist.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:48.470 position:56%
Right? Because really, I mean, we
like to talk a lot about non-racism.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.820
Everyone in America likes to
stand up and say I'm not a racist.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.590
But really, there's no
such thing as nonracist.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:56.790
Right? Either we believe
in racial hierarchy

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:58.860
or we believe in racial equality.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.510 position:56%
Either we look at racial disparities
and see what's wrong with people,

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:04.390
or we see what's wrong
with policies.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:06.560
Right? There's no in
between in that.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.140 position:56%
Right? And so, you know, I'm sort of
writing about how I came to realize

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.850
that there's nothing wrong with
people and everything wrong

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:15.650
with this nation's policies.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:19.120
[ Applause ]

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.920
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: One
final questions.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.050
[ Applause ]

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:25.620
Also from Twitter.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.630 position:56%
The question was, is there any hope?

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:35.130
&gt;&gt; Ibram X. Kendi: Well, I
think reading Dyson's Sermon

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:38.170
to White America, you know, it's --

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:41.190
I mean, I should say

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:50.700
that philosophically I believe
that change is possible.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.440
And what I mean by that is,
I feel like an activist,

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.870
I feel like somebody who
desires to bring about change has

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:02.520
to believe that change is possible.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.130
You -- how are you going
to bring about change

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.100
if you don't even believe
it's possible, right?

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.480
That's the first step
[applause], right?

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.560
And so I feel like I
have all of the evidence

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.170
as to why we should not
be hopeful [laughter].

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:17.770
I know all the evidence, right?

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:20.720
Trust me, I do, and I know
it throughout history, right?

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.980
I mean, I actually read through
some of the most vicious things

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.880
that have ever been said
and done to black people.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.660
But at the same time, somehow
those black people who were victims

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:35.060
of that viciousness still had hope,

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.370
and I think that's the very
reason why they resisted,

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:41.560
and I think that's the reason why
I'm sitting here right now talking

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.510
to you.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:50.180
[ Applause ]

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Dr. Dyson?

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: I'm sure
this is true for Professor Kendi.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:59.680
Every day I get threats from
white people that they're going

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.970
to kill me, call me nigger.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:07.390
I got so much negative discourse
my only hope is could you call me

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.690
Professor Nigger [laughter].

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.940
Every now and again
just say Dr. Nigger.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:17.040
They're bold and emboldened.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:24.910
They go on my Facebook page, they
send me e-mails, they threaten me.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:27.100
They say, Dylann Roof
had the right idea.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.620
Why does a nigger like me exist?

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:32.020
This is from white people.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:39.540 position:56%
And you can imagine, I'm sure if you
haven't had the experience yourself,

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:44.680 position:56%
what that's meant to do, the kind of
language it is meant to discourage,

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.390
the kind of rhetoric it is meant
to side track, the kind of ideas

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.930
that it is meant to
implant, and the kind of fear

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.760
that it is meant to impart.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:56.640
And furthermore, trying to tell
other white brothers and sisters

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.040
who believe it can't be that bad.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.650
It can't be that rough.

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.810
It can't -- it's not us, it's --

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:08.730
when it's your culture that
is reproducing the pathogens

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:13.550
that lay waste to the moral
ecology of this culture.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:18.610
So the same people who think
it is a farce not to believe

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:25.920
in global warming don't understand
that racism in the moral ecology is

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:33.690 position:56%
such a warped and warping experience
and it is system wide to a degree

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:36.950 position:56%
that many white brothers and
sisters may be afraid to acknowledge

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:41.520
or fearful because their parents
and their cousins and their uncles

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.760
and their children agree with it.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:51.030
So I think that in light
of that, Howard Thurman,

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:57.130
who I end my book with, nearly,
to echo what Professor Kendi said,

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:01.400
he said, our slave for parents
face long rows of cotton

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.250
in the interminable heat.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:08.210
The rawhide whip of the overseer,
and yet what did they do?

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.790
They envisioned a future
beyond where they were.

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:16.790
He said, never become, never
allow the horizon of your dreams

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:20.380
to be reduced to your
present experience,

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.630
that that present experience
cannot hold you.

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:26.870
He said, either you're
going to be a prisoner

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:30.810
of an event or a prisoner of hope.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:34.580
And so I must say that
I am a prisoner of hope,

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.180
that the reason I can talk about
the negativity and the darkness

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.200
and then take it, is because
my pastor used to tell me,

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.780
don't fight for victory,
fight from victory.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.520
And in an anticipatory sense,
in a theological sense,

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.250
we call it eschatology, the
end is realized in the present.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:57.110
So for me, I am a prisoner of that
hope and I think that there has

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.870
to be a way that we can change.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:01.100
I meet so many -- after
having written this book,

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.560
and I'll end here, I meet so
many white brothers and sisters,

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.340
among many others, who say
I gave this to my uncle,

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.650
my cousin, I read your book.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:08.950
It challenged me.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:10.250
It was straight no chaser.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:12.570
You tried to show love
but you demanded

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:13.870
that we deal with something.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:16.900
I think those people are real,
those people who are willing

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.500
to give their lives like
Sister Heather Heyer,

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.880
those people like Viola Liuzzo,
those people who like [inaudible],

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.860
those white brothers and
sisters who are willing

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.590
to pay the ultimate price in
alliance with and in fraternity

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:32.700
and sorority with us, those
of us who can come together,

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.230
we are the manifestation,

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.840
the evidence of the very
thing for which we fight.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.930
So, yes, I am a prisoner of hope.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:41.680
That's why I'm able to swing
against the vicious pathology

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:46.150
of white supremacy, male supremacy,
homophobia, and all of the rest

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:49.700
of the isms that have distorted
the real true democratic spirit

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.930
of this nation, and for
that I'm willing to continue

00:42:52.930 --> 00:43:07.730
to give my life [applause].

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:09.030
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Michael
Eric Dyson,

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:10.330 position:56%
Ibram X. Kendi, thank you very much.

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:11.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Eric Dyson: Thank you.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:12.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Inskeep: Stand
up, stand up [applause].

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:14.230

of the Library of Congress.
