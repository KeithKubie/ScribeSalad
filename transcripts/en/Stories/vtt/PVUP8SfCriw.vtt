00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.920
[PIANO PLAYING]

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.330
These are the words of
women asking for help.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.500
They say they've been falsely
jailed in Tapachula a city

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.370
in the Mexican state of Chiapas.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.810
They've been accused
of human trafficking.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.550
A serious crime with a maximum
penalty of 30 years in prison.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.950
Human trafficking in Mexico
is said to be a $150 billion

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.550
business-- with profits
finding their way

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.180
into the pockets of the
country's biggest cartels.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.710
Mexico recently passed
a comprehensive reform

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.840
of their anti-trafficking laws
insuring harsher penalties

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.370
for those found guilty.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.160
The new focus on
human trafficking

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.720
has increased convictions
and sentences,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.790
which is something Mexico
is touting as a success.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.170
But here in Chiapas,
those numbers

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.058
don't tell the entire story.

00:00:52.058 --> 00:00:56.840
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:29.080
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.000
That is Luis Villagran.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.670
He is an outspoken
opponent of the way

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.280
human trafficking is fought
in Mexico and for good reason.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:51.700
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.620
Luis's false conviction
shed some light

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.280
on how Chiapas is
their successes.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.030
According to Luis, of
those 60 traffickers who

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.770
were convicted and sentenced,
10 of them were eventually freed

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.780
and three of them were
completely exonerated.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.630
These are the people
Luis has been fighting

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.170
for-- the innocent ones.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.650
Women like Santa
Maria Rosales who

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.895
came to Mexico from Honduras--
fleeing violence and gangs.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:32.340
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.380
Santa Maria was arrested in
her home along with her brother

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.460
and cousin and was sentenced
to six years in prison

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.010
for human trafficking.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.040
That's based on accusations
from witnesses who never even

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.640
showed up to her trial.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:03:12.800
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.120
Once in prison,
Santa Maria realized

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.450
her case wasn't unique.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:48.680
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.260
So Santa Maria decided
to help herself.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.100
She and two other inmates
went on a hunger strike.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.240
This helped shed
light on their cases

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.480
and they were eventually freed.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.560
And before she left,
she made a pledge

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.900
to the innocent women
she was leaving behind.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:32.730
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.630
And she continues to fight
along with Luis and others.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.670
They're speaking to
anyone who will listen.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.280
They protest outside
the jail that

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.940
still holds innocent women.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.430
And they won't stop
until there's justice.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.090
Yes, human trafficking
is a major problem.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.740
And yes, the Mexican
government should

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.730
be doing something about it.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.740
But according to
Luis, they're unfairly

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.670
targeting migrant women.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.940
Women who have
done nothing wrong.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.920
Women were forced
to sign confessions

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.670
they don't understand.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.020
Women who because of
where they're from

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.370
are already looked down
upon and stigmatized.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.020
And if the Mexican government
is inflating their numbers

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.310
for PR purposes, to make it
seem like the streets are being

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.690
cleaned up, that only makes the
problem of human trafficking

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.950
worse.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:38.350
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.820
Mexico is not the only
country to be accused

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.470
of jailing the innocent.

America is using their prison

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.140
population as slave labor.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.260
Inmates can be forced to work
as long as they're deemed fit

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and can be punished
if they don't.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.102
Including-- in some cases--
with solitary confinement.
