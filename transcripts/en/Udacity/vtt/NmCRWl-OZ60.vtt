Okay. So what I'd like you to do now

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
is implement the function: escape_html ( ),

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which will take one argument, (s),

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and will replace any occurrence of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the Greater Than symbol on that string with: &gt;

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the Less Than symbol with: &lt;

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Double quotes with: "

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and an ampersand with: &amp;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And then it should return this string

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with this side replaced with this side.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Okay. Good luck!
