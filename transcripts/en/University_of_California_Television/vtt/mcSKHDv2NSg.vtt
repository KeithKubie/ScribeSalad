00:00:00.878 --> 00:00:04.105
- [Narrator] This UCSD-TV
program is presented by

00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:06.388
University of California Television.

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.604
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:25.604 --> 00:00:28.104
Bipedal, naked, large brained.

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.898
Long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:34.898 --> 00:00:38.315
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:42.478
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:44.561
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.260
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.700
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.783
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.206 --> 00:00:55.789
We shape the future from our

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.539
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:03.525
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:07.692
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:11.248
An exploration made possible

00:01:11.248 --> 00:01:14.331
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.312
(mellow piano music)

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.120
- I have been a professor of medicine

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.733
and a clinical cardiologist
at UCLA for about 25 years.

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:21.013
But about 12 years ago
I got a telephone call

00:02:21.013 --> 00:02:22.537
that changed my life.

00:02:22.537 --> 00:02:25.089
And that call came from
one of the veterinarian's

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:26.981
at the Los Angeles zoo.

00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:30.856
And he called me because
one of their chimpanzees

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:33.289
had woken up with a facial droop.

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.412
They were concerned that
she might have had a stroke.

00:02:36.412 --> 00:02:39.565
And he asked if I'd come to
the zoo and image her heart

00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:41.156
to look for blood cloths and other things

00:02:41.156 --> 00:02:42.559
that might have been the problem.

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.904
And this is the hospital
at the zoo that I went to.

00:02:45.904 --> 00:02:49.936
And this is actually me with
me my first non-human animal,

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.646
and I'm going to come back
to her in just a moment.

00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:55.735
But a few weeks after I
visited with this chimpanzee

00:02:55.735 --> 00:03:00.407
I was asked to rule out a
torn aorta in a gorilla.

00:03:00.407 --> 00:03:02.541
And not long after that

00:03:02.541 --> 00:03:04.598
there was a California condor

00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:06.948
that they noted a heart murmur in

00:03:06.948 --> 00:03:08.577
and they asked if I would look to see

00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:11.001
whether one of the valves was torn,

00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:12.886
which in fact it was.

00:03:12.886 --> 00:03:14.704
There was a California sea lion

00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:17.330
whose lower body had filled with fluid

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.057
and they were concerned about
congestive heart failure

00:03:20.057 --> 00:03:22.251
and asked if I'd come.

00:03:22.251 --> 00:03:27.035
And in this picture I'm
listening to the heart of a lion

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:31.343
who had had a collection
of over 700 cc's of fluid

00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:34.758
in the sac in which
her heart is contained.

00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:37.514
And in a collaborative procedure involving

00:03:37.514 --> 00:03:40.438
veterinarian's and human cardiologist

00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:43.120
we drained the fluid from her heart.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.644
And this by the way is a procedure

00:03:44.644 --> 00:03:47.508
that I have done on
hundreds of human patients.

00:03:47.508 --> 00:03:52.008
But I must say that the
procedure itself was

00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:55.364
identical to the procedure
that I've done on humans

00:03:55.364 --> 00:03:58.033
with the exception of this.

00:03:58.033 --> 00:03:59.749
(audience laughing)

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:00.792
And where is it?

00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:02.970
There we go, and that.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.616
Let's get back to the my first patient,

00:04:04.616 --> 00:04:07.786
this chimpanzee who had
the suspected stroke.

00:04:07.786 --> 00:04:10.754
I remember when I first put
the probe into her mouth

00:04:10.754 --> 00:04:12.720
and slid it down the esophagus.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.651
I turned to the screen
and this is what I saw.

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:17.441
A four chambered beating heart,

00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:20.727
a left ventricle, a right
ventricle, two atria,

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:23.147
but I noticed that there were blood clots

00:04:23.147 --> 00:04:25.700
moving these round bouncing balls,

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.037
and that the upper chambers were enlarged.

00:04:29.037 --> 00:04:31.077
And as soon as I saw that picture

00:04:31.077 --> 00:04:34.486
it reminded me of a human
patient I've imaged at UCLA

00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:36.335
some weeks before

00:04:36.335 --> 00:04:39.960
who had the enlarged
atria and the blood clots.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.298
And I realized that these two patients,

00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:44.513
one human and one chimpanzee

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:47.401
had spontaneously
developed the same kind of

00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:49.381
infiltrative heart failure

00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:52.308
that I have been treating for years

00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:56.084
with high technology and
advanced pharmaceuticals.

00:04:56.084 --> 00:04:59.393
And I found myself being
a little bit surprised.

00:04:59.393 --> 00:05:02.573
But then I was more curios
about why I was surprised.

00:05:02.573 --> 00:05:04.427
I mean, I certainly knew that we share

00:05:04.427 --> 00:05:06.894
the common ancestor with chimpanzees

00:05:06.894 --> 00:05:09.410
between five and seven million years ago,

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.467
which of course is a blink

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:14.134
in the scope of evolutionary time.

00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:15.338
And as an undergraduate,

00:05:15.338 --> 00:05:16.743
I've worked for four years in a

00:05:16.743 --> 00:05:19.792
Museum of Comparative Zoology.

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:21.097
But when I gone to medical school

00:05:21.097 --> 00:05:23.120
and like most medical students today,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.636
what I have learned the connection between

00:05:25.636 --> 00:05:28.189
animal and human health was,

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.272
was infectious, pathogenic, zoonotic.

00:05:33.327 --> 00:05:35.653
And of course there is no question

00:05:35.653 --> 00:05:37.649
that animals play an important role

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:39.588
in the transmission of diseases

00:05:39.588 --> 00:05:43.160
that have a high impact
on human communities.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.941
Even more so now the one health community

00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:47.532
is helping us realize

00:05:47.532 --> 00:05:50.584
that the majority of
infections that will impact

00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:55.073
human populations are coming
from animal reservoirs.

00:05:55.073 --> 00:05:58.196
But what I didn't learn and
most medical students don't,

00:05:58.196 --> 00:05:59.972
is that the father of modern medicine

00:05:59.972 --> 00:06:03.176
Sir William Osler is also considered

00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:06.218
the father of modern veterinary medicine.

00:06:06.218 --> 00:06:10.262
And that one of his teachers,
the father of modern pathology

00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:12.893
Rudolf Virchow wrote in the 19th century,

00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:14.650
"Between animal and human medicine

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.194
"there is no dividing
line nor should there be.

00:06:17.194 --> 00:06:19.951
"The object is different
but the experience obtained

00:06:19.951 --> 00:06:23.043
"constitutes the basis of all medicine."

00:06:23.043 --> 00:06:25.022
But what I was finding

00:06:25.022 --> 00:06:26.748
was that while I was taking care

00:06:26.748 --> 00:06:29.284
of my human patients at UCLA

00:06:29.284 --> 00:06:31.522
I would go to the zoo and I would hear

00:06:31.522 --> 00:06:33.207
the veterinarian discuss

00:06:33.207 --> 00:06:36.256
the management of metastatic breast cancer

00:06:36.256 --> 00:06:39.702
or the management of brittle diabetes,

00:06:39.702 --> 00:06:44.511
or the dosage of serotonin
reuptake inhibitor drugs

00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:46.586
like Prozac for some of their patients

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:49.796
who are anxious or compulsive.

00:06:49.796 --> 00:06:53.640
And I realized that as much
as I knew about human medicine

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.785
I knew so little about
veterinary medicine.

00:06:56.785 --> 00:06:59.536
And it turns out there has been a gulf

00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:02.377
between these two fields.

00:07:02.377 --> 00:07:03.815
Now there are many reasons for that,

00:07:03.815 --> 00:07:05.914
some are historical, some are cultural,

00:07:05.914 --> 00:07:08.752
but I'm going to focus
on two for a moment.

00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:11.679
The first I believe has to do

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:14.142
with our essential ambivalence

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:18.103
about embracing our own animal natures.

00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:21.270
But the other is human exceptionalism.

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:24.411
We all are scientist.

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:25.889
Many of us are scientist here,

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:28.218
and we theoretically
accept that human beings

00:07:28.218 --> 00:07:32.094
are merely one species in a
spectrum of other species.

00:07:32.094 --> 00:07:36.371
Not uniquely unique but
unique like all others.

00:07:36.371 --> 00:07:39.308
Like this, and we can zone in and see,

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:40.308
here we are.

00:07:41.405 --> 00:07:45.934
And yet, and yet, even the most
scientifically minded of us

00:07:45.934 --> 00:07:49.767
may harbor some residual
human exceptionalism.

00:07:50.945 --> 00:07:54.437
In fact, I believe there
is a medical expression

00:07:54.437 --> 00:07:57.976
of human exceptionalism
which is contributing

00:07:57.976 --> 00:08:00.640
to this gulf between the fields.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.403
And I became curios.

00:08:02.403 --> 00:08:04.295
What is the extent of the overlap

00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:07.391
in the pathology of humans
and animals and so I asked,

00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:10.153
do non-human animals develop

00:08:10.153 --> 00:08:11.990
heart attacks or failure?

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.874
Type I, type II diabetes?

00:08:13.874 --> 00:08:15.901
Brain tumors, concussions, strokes?

00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:18.155
Asthma, allergies,
breast cancer, leukemia,

00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:21.558
infertility, painful
periods, sexual dysfunction?

00:08:21.558 --> 00:08:22.829
And of course the answer to everyone

00:08:22.829 --> 00:08:25.210
of those questions is yes.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.043
Now of course our bad human habits

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.918
amplified the risk of disease.

00:08:31.918 --> 00:08:34.230
It is the basis of preventative medicine.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.866
And I have spent 25 years encouraging

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:40.316
improved diets and more activity.

00:08:40.316 --> 00:08:42.614
And yet, although our bad human habits

00:08:42.614 --> 00:08:45.203
may increase the risk of disease,

00:08:45.203 --> 00:08:49.784
the essential vulnerability
to disease is ancient.

00:08:49.784 --> 00:08:52.299
Let's quickly talk about two big killers,

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:55.105
breast cancer and heart disease.

00:08:55.105 --> 00:08:58.145
We know that breast cancer
has a high human impact

00:08:58.145 --> 00:08:59.209
on the human community,

00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:03.491
it's the leading cause
of cancer among women.

00:09:03.491 --> 00:09:06.076
But breast cancer is not unique to humans,

00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:09.576
in fact, many of you
who have cats may know

00:09:09.576 --> 00:09:12.101
that cats are at risk,
dogs can be as well.

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:14.669
This is a mastectomy scar from a cat

00:09:14.669 --> 00:09:18.682
whose owner felt a mass
when she was petting her.

00:09:18.682 --> 00:09:21.728
And in fact breast cancer has been found

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:25.895
in mammals of almost every
variety from polar bears

00:09:27.155 --> 00:09:30.739
to elephants, to marsupials, llamas,

00:09:30.739 --> 00:09:33.488
marine marine mammals, beluga whales.

00:09:33.488 --> 00:09:36.042
In fact, notably, there seems to be

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:38.645
a particularly high rate of breast cancer

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:40.613
among some big cats.

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:43.523
We can talk about that in
another time why that might be.

00:09:43.523 --> 00:09:46.855
But it's notable, one
fascinating connection

00:09:46.855 --> 00:09:50.637
is that the reason that some
jaguars have a particularly

00:09:50.637 --> 00:09:53.357
elevated rate of breast cancer

00:09:53.357 --> 00:09:57.407
is probably related to a
mutation of the BRCA1 gene.

00:09:57.407 --> 00:10:01.198
And it is the same mutation
that makes some human females

00:10:01.198 --> 00:10:03.554
at elevated risk for breast cancer.

00:10:03.554 --> 00:10:05.689
Now of course there are
regions of the world

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:10.460
where practices, habits,
genetics, diets are different,

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.623
and the rates of breast cancer are lower.

00:10:13.623 --> 00:10:16.135
But that merely underscores the fact

00:10:16.135 --> 00:10:17.863
that while our bad human habits

00:10:17.863 --> 00:10:20.540
may increase the risk of our disease,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.817
the essential vulnerability
to disease is ancient.

00:10:24.817 --> 00:10:28.690
The age of mammals started
about 200 million years ago,

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.775
and I suspect that the
vulnerability therefore

00:10:31.775 --> 00:10:34.532
to breast cancer can be stated

00:10:34.532 --> 00:10:37.199
in a sense to be as old as that.

00:10:38.241 --> 00:10:40.623
What about heart attacks?

00:10:40.623 --> 00:10:43.591
So cardiovascular disease
it is the number one

00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:45.865
cause of death globally.

00:10:45.865 --> 00:10:50.228
In the United States those
statistics are amplified.

00:10:50.228 --> 00:10:52.697
And we know that most
heart attacks are cause

00:10:52.697 --> 00:10:54.552
by the progressive build up of

00:10:54.552 --> 00:10:57.358
atherosclerosis in the arteries.

00:10:57.358 --> 00:11:00.240
That eventually that
atherosclerosis breaks,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.539
there is a blood clot that seizes

00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:04.870
the flow of blood through the artery

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.419
and the muscle downstream dies.

00:11:07.419 --> 00:11:09.967
And in this section of an artery,

00:11:09.967 --> 00:11:12.647
you see the atherosclerosis, the plaque,

00:11:12.647 --> 00:11:15.540
it has fractured, there is a blood clot

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.595
and this individual died of a stroke.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:21.312
But this individual was not a human.

00:11:21.312 --> 00:11:25.322
What we see here is an
Egyptian vulture rather,

00:11:25.322 --> 00:11:27.335
flying in the base of the Himalayans.

00:11:27.335 --> 00:11:29.710
And it turns out that if you look at

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.877
a phylogeny of atherosclerosis
across avian species,

00:11:35.914 --> 00:11:37.687
every place that there is star,

00:11:37.687 --> 00:11:40.524
there's at least one
species with in this order

00:11:40.524 --> 00:11:44.515
in whom atherosclerosis
and stroke, heart attack,

00:11:44.515 --> 00:11:48.935
and other clinical
syndromes have been seen.

00:11:48.935 --> 00:11:51.209
Now, of course our bad human habits

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:52.775
amplify the risk of disease.

00:11:52.775 --> 00:11:55.197
I've spent my life as a clinician,

00:11:55.197 --> 00:11:58.734
helping patients modify their lifestyles.

00:11:58.734 --> 00:11:59.884
We know that.

00:11:59.884 --> 00:12:01.493
We know that bad human habits

00:12:01.493 --> 00:12:04.174
do contribute to heart disease but

00:12:04.174 --> 00:12:07.184
recognizing that after a sclerosis

00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:10.480
and heart attacks and
strokes have been identified

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.647
in animals as varied as
walruses, dolphins, camels,

00:12:16.408 --> 00:12:18.270
and of course human suggest

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.812
that well bad human habits may
amplify the risk of disease,

00:12:21.812 --> 00:12:24.870
the essential vulnerability is ancient.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.037
And again, the timeline
pointing to atherosclerosis.

00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:33.542
And, if this is true
of the somatic diseases

00:12:33.542 --> 00:12:36.805
like heart attack and breast cancer,

00:12:36.805 --> 00:12:39.449
it is also true for mental illnesses.

00:12:39.449 --> 00:12:42.697
There's a hair plucking syndrome
seen here in this picture,

00:12:42.697 --> 00:12:45.808
where people pluck out the
hair of their eyelashes,

00:12:45.808 --> 00:12:48.037
of their, any part of their body.

00:12:48.037 --> 00:12:51.138
But it is remarkable that
this bears a similarity

00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:53.978
to a hair plucking and
feather plucking syndrome

00:12:53.978 --> 00:12:57.465
that is seen in some bird species.

00:12:57.465 --> 00:12:59.682
You can see that this parrot has plucked,

00:12:59.682 --> 00:13:01.265
denuded his thorax.

00:13:02.326 --> 00:13:06.105
And it is notable that the
compulsive tail chasing

00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:09.881
seen in bull terriers
treatable with Prozac.

00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:11.163
Or the flank sucking,

00:13:11.163 --> 00:13:14.046
the compulsive flank
sucking seen in dobermans,

00:13:14.046 --> 00:13:15.879
treatable with Prozac.

00:13:16.832 --> 00:13:20.999
There's similarities to the
compulsive behaviors we see

00:13:21.861 --> 00:13:25.318
in some humans with obsessive
compulsive disorder.

00:13:25.318 --> 00:13:28.158
And it is notable that
like some human beings

00:13:28.158 --> 00:13:30.307
with anorexia nervosa,

00:13:30.307 --> 00:13:33.371
some non-human animals
respond to social stress

00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:36.534
by starving themselves sometimes to death.

00:13:36.534 --> 00:13:38.748
While others deal with stress

00:13:38.748 --> 00:13:41.418
by causing themselves to regurgitate.

00:13:41.418 --> 00:13:45.293
Our bad human habits may
increase our risk of disease,

00:13:45.293 --> 00:13:50.148
but the essential vulnerability
to disease is ancient.

00:13:50.148 --> 00:13:51.981
Why is this important?

00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:55.079
There are scientific and medical advances

00:13:55.079 --> 00:13:58.053
that can come of thinking comparatively,

00:13:58.053 --> 00:14:00.314
looking across species.

00:14:00.314 --> 00:14:03.490
Translational medicine traditionally means

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.942
taking research that is
being done at the bench

00:14:06.942 --> 00:14:09.818
in the laboratory and
bringing it to the bedside.

00:14:09.818 --> 00:14:13.231
But I would suggest that
there is another way

00:14:13.231 --> 00:14:15.224
of working translationally.

00:14:15.224 --> 00:14:18.961
And that is by looking across
species and across time

00:14:18.961 --> 00:14:22.530
for connections that
generate novel hypothesis

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.530
that can ultimately be
translated into science

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.197
that can save lives.

00:14:28.695 --> 00:14:32.301
Further more, I believe these insights

00:14:32.301 --> 00:14:37.221
have the potential to reduce
stigma and increase compassion

00:14:37.221 --> 00:14:39.360
for people suffering from physical illness

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.943
and mental illness.

00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:45.190
I would like to end by modifying the words

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.482
of the late great Susan Sontag

00:14:48.482 --> 00:14:52.649
to reflect the species spanning
nature of health and disease

00:14:53.869 --> 00:14:57.290
and the deep and ancient
connection we all share

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.739
not just with other human beings

00:14:59.739 --> 00:15:03.528
but with all of the
patients on the planet.

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:04.361
She wrote,

00:15:06.014 --> 00:15:08.606
"Illness is the night side of life,

00:15:08.606 --> 00:15:11.438
"a more onerous citizenship.

00:15:11.438 --> 00:15:15.605
"Everyone and everything who
is born holds dual citizenship,

00:15:16.612 --> 00:15:20.894
"in the kingdom of the well
and in the kingdom of the sick.

00:15:20.894 --> 00:15:24.428
"And although we all prefer
to use the good passport,

00:15:24.428 --> 00:15:26.936
"sooner or later each of us is obliged

00:15:26.936 --> 00:15:31.840
"to identify ourselves as
citizens of that other place."

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.105
Thank you for your attention.

00:15:34.105 --> 00:15:37.188
(mellow piano music)

00:15:41.865 --> 00:15:43.670
- I think I'll start off with a

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.559
evolutionarily very strange photo.

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:50.726
This is Heidi Klum, the
supermodel, with her four children.

00:15:51.776 --> 00:15:55.276
And this is an almost unique sort of photo

00:15:56.511 --> 00:15:58.229
in the mammalian kingdom.

00:15:58.229 --> 00:15:59.729
And why is unique?

00:16:00.653 --> 00:16:03.944
You won't see a chimpanzee mother

00:16:03.944 --> 00:16:07.771
with four children under
her care at anyone time.

00:16:07.771 --> 00:16:12.486
A chimpanzee mother raises
her offspring to independence

00:16:12.486 --> 00:16:14.986
before she has the next child.

00:16:16.687 --> 00:16:19.475
Same with gorillas with orangutans

00:16:19.475 --> 00:16:23.431
and pretty well most
of all other primates.

00:16:23.431 --> 00:16:26.217
A mother can only have another child

00:16:26.217 --> 00:16:29.954
once the previous child is independent.

00:16:29.954 --> 00:16:33.445
But here is Heidi and
she's got four children

00:16:33.445 --> 00:16:35.660
all of different ages,

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.866
and all of them dependent
for their well-being

00:16:38.866 --> 00:16:41.533
on parental care, maternal care.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.555
Now, raising four children
at the time is hard work

00:16:46.555 --> 00:16:49.220
and there's an interesting
evolutionary question

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.387
how human mothers are able to do this.

00:16:53.577 --> 00:16:57.896
But it creates thoughts of
interactions among siblings

00:16:57.896 --> 00:16:59.991
that you don't find elsewhere.

00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:03.647
I should point out that there
are of course other mammals

00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:06.822
that produce multiple
offspring at the same time.

00:17:06.822 --> 00:17:08.129
They produce it later,

00:17:08.129 --> 00:17:12.985
but in those cases all of those
offspring are the same age.

00:17:12.985 --> 00:17:17.152
Now the existence of multiple
children all dependent for

00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:21.690
at the same time from maternal care

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:25.031
means that tend to
compete amongst each other

00:17:25.031 --> 00:17:27.609
for maternal care and attention.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.205
And when I look at photos like these

00:17:29.205 --> 00:17:31.998
I always like to look where are the hands?

00:17:31.998 --> 00:17:34.309
And so if you look at this picture,

00:17:34.309 --> 00:17:36.933
here is Heidi's right hand,

00:17:36.933 --> 00:17:39.153
is holding her youngest child.

00:17:39.153 --> 00:17:41.122
Her other hand is holding the hand

00:17:41.122 --> 00:17:43.573
of her eldest daughter here.

00:17:43.573 --> 00:17:45.791
And she is sufficiently rich

00:17:45.791 --> 00:17:48.172
that she can afford another pair of hands

00:17:48.172 --> 00:17:51.066
to look after her two other children.

00:17:51.066 --> 00:17:53.659
So here's one of her
hands holding this child,

00:17:53.659 --> 00:17:55.788
and then the second hand of the helper

00:17:55.788 --> 00:17:59.075
is sort of hidden behind her body.

00:17:59.075 --> 00:18:01.908
So, raising children is hard work.

00:18:02.823 --> 00:18:06.111
Raising a child is not cost-free,

00:18:06.111 --> 00:18:09.564
and sometimes people
challenge me about that.

00:18:09.564 --> 00:18:11.284
But think about it,

00:18:11.284 --> 00:18:13.592
if raising children weren't costly,

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:16.342
a natural selection X to maximize

00:18:17.275 --> 00:18:19.074
lifetime reproductive success.

00:18:19.074 --> 00:18:21.424
If there were no cost of child raising

00:18:21.424 --> 00:18:23.471
mothers would have evolved to produce

00:18:23.471 --> 00:18:25.982
an infinite number of offspring,

00:18:25.982 --> 00:18:29.078
which they clearly don't do.

00:18:29.078 --> 00:18:33.219
Offspring compete for
maternal care and attention.

00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:37.540
That's if you're using your
right hand to hold one child,

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.554
you don't have the right hand available

00:18:39.554 --> 00:18:43.721
to grab another child when
it's getting into danger.

00:18:44.949 --> 00:18:49.177
Now there's another interesting
thing about that photo,

00:18:49.177 --> 00:18:52.094
and this is that as it's well-known

00:18:53.012 --> 00:18:56.406
Heidi's eldest daughter
has a different father

00:18:56.406 --> 00:18:58.922
from her other three children.

00:18:58.922 --> 00:19:03.202
And this genetically creates
an interesting asymmetry.

00:19:03.202 --> 00:19:05.832
So all of these four children

00:19:05.832 --> 00:19:09.289
are related to each other maternally.

00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:13.680
If you pick a gene in Heidi
its got a one chance in two

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.968
of being present in each of her offspring.

00:19:17.968 --> 00:19:20.676
These are all maternal half-sibs.

00:19:20.676 --> 00:19:23.674
So they're all related maternally,

00:19:23.674 --> 00:19:27.086
but the paternal genes of this child

00:19:27.086 --> 00:19:31.027
unnecessarily absent from
the three siblings there.

00:19:31.027 --> 00:19:34.942
So this child is unrelated
for her paternal genome

00:19:34.942 --> 00:19:37.938
to Heidi's other three children.

00:19:37.938 --> 00:19:42.010
And this leads
evolutionarily to a conflict

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.161
within the genomes of children

00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:48.205
over the extraction of care from mothers

00:19:48.205 --> 00:19:52.842
which ultimately translates
as cost of their care

00:19:52.842 --> 00:19:56.051
having impacts on their siblings

00:19:56.051 --> 00:19:58.636
who might be maternal half-sibs.

00:19:58.636 --> 00:20:01.729
So maternal and paternal genes of a child

00:20:01.729 --> 00:20:05.793
disagree over the value of half-siblings

00:20:05.793 --> 00:20:09.293
who share one parent but not both parents.

00:20:10.551 --> 00:20:13.148
And so here's the sort of a graph

00:20:13.148 --> 00:20:15.580
that you've seen before in earlier talk.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.549
I put fetus here but I'm just
referring to a child here.

00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:21.807
We're looking at affects
on fitness of the child.

00:20:21.807 --> 00:20:25.466
An affects on fitness of it's siblings.

00:20:25.466 --> 00:20:27.737
And just dividing this space.

00:20:27.737 --> 00:20:29.581
There are some sorts of outcomes,

00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:32.074
some things that can happen

00:20:32.074 --> 00:20:36.241
that are a benefit to the
child and to its siblings.

00:20:37.473 --> 00:20:40.687
There are some things
that are a cost to a child

00:20:40.687 --> 00:20:42.532
and to its siblings.

00:20:42.532 --> 00:20:45.282
And then there is this own of trade offs

00:20:45.282 --> 00:20:48.010
where some action is benefiting one child

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.772
at the cost to other children.

00:20:50.772 --> 00:20:53.892
That's the holding of
one child in your hand,

00:20:53.892 --> 00:20:56.278
meaning that that hand is not available

00:20:56.278 --> 00:20:58.695
to look after other children.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.307
So these are the science of
a trade off in parental care.

00:21:06.145 --> 00:21:08.247
And so just looking at
what natural selection

00:21:08.247 --> 00:21:10.429
maximizes in this situation,

00:21:10.429 --> 00:21:12.446
so first of all I'm going to look at

00:21:12.446 --> 00:21:16.032
natural selection acting
on genes of maternal origin

00:21:16.032 --> 00:21:20.199
in a child with respect to
cost on maternal half-siblings.

00:21:21.869 --> 00:21:24.452
The offspring of other fathers.

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:27.972
And so natural selection is predicted

00:21:27.972 --> 00:21:30.935
to maximize this sum here.

00:21:30.935 --> 00:21:34.099
This is the benefit to the child

00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:38.156
and this is the cost of the
fitness of its siblings.

00:21:38.156 --> 00:21:40.114
The child values itself

00:21:40.114 --> 00:21:43.142
evolutionarily twice of your siblings

00:21:43.142 --> 00:21:44.698
because the gene in the child

00:21:44.698 --> 00:21:46.790
is definitely present in that child,

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.209
but it's only got a 50% chance.

00:21:49.209 --> 00:21:53.700
This is a maternal gene of
being present in siblings.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.216
So natural selection will favor behavior

00:21:56.216 --> 00:21:58.837
when this sum is positive,

00:21:58.837 --> 00:22:01.797
which is in this region
of the phase space,

00:22:01.797 --> 00:22:02.736
what's its called,

00:22:02.736 --> 00:22:06.319
matrilineal inclusive
fitness is increased.

00:22:07.335 --> 00:22:11.502
But for paternally derived
genes in a maternal half-sib,

00:22:13.445 --> 00:22:16.033
what's relevant is the effect

00:22:16.033 --> 00:22:18.460
on the fitness of the child itself

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.611
because it is unrelated to its siblings.

00:22:22.611 --> 00:22:25.782
So as long as the benefit
for the child is positive,

00:22:25.782 --> 00:22:27.414
natural selection will favor

00:22:27.414 --> 00:22:29.869
increasing demands on the mothers.

00:22:29.869 --> 00:22:33.195
So combining those two situations

00:22:33.195 --> 00:22:36.779
we have regions where there is an absence

00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:38.810
of evolutionary conflict between genes

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.865
of maternal and paternal origin.

00:22:40.865 --> 00:22:43.671
This is where they both benefit.

00:22:43.671 --> 00:22:45.856
This is where they both suffer a cost,

00:22:45.856 --> 00:22:48.488
a natural selection
would act against genes

00:22:48.488 --> 00:22:50.461
with these sort of effects.

00:22:50.461 --> 00:22:52.850
But then we have a zone of trade off

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.195
of conflict within the genome,

00:22:55.195 --> 00:22:58.357
where genes of maternal
origin would benefit,

00:22:58.357 --> 00:23:01.735
whether allocating more
resources to siblings

00:23:01.735 --> 00:23:04.526
whereas genes of paternal
origin would benefit

00:23:04.526 --> 00:23:09.312
from the child receiving
more maternal care itself.

00:23:09.312 --> 00:23:11.861
This is where the cost benefit ratio

00:23:11.861 --> 00:23:15.474
is setting in between a half and zero.

00:23:15.474 --> 00:23:19.459
This is the zone of intragenomic conflict.

00:23:19.459 --> 00:23:20.974
And for the second half of the talk

00:23:20.974 --> 00:23:24.055
I'm just going to look at
some human genetic disorders

00:23:24.055 --> 00:23:28.478
where genes so called
imprinted genes have an effect,

00:23:28.478 --> 00:23:31.302
and these provide clues
about the action of this

00:23:31.302 --> 00:23:35.385
evolutionary conflict
during human evolution.

00:23:35.385 --> 00:23:38.385
Now an imprinted gene is a gene that

00:23:40.284 --> 00:23:41.770
is expressed differently

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:46.746
whether you get it from your
mother or from your father.

00:23:46.746 --> 00:23:51.270
It has an imprint a record
of its past history,

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.399
what sex of body it was in
the previous generation,

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:59.047
and that affects what it does
in the current generation.

00:23:59.047 --> 00:24:02.467
So paternally-derived genes in offspring

00:24:02.467 --> 00:24:04.774
are predicted to favor greater demands

00:24:04.774 --> 00:24:09.534
on mothers than will
maternally-derived genes in offspring.

00:24:09.534 --> 00:24:12.605
And so here we will look at an example

00:24:12.605 --> 00:24:16.227
of a chromosome region
on human chromosome 11

00:24:16.227 --> 00:24:19.652
where there are some imprinted genes.

00:24:19.652 --> 00:24:21.558
Let's focus here.

00:24:21.558 --> 00:24:26.317
This is a gene called IGF2 for
insulin-like growth factor 2.

00:24:26.317 --> 00:24:28.382
Here we're looking at the chromosome

00:24:28.382 --> 00:24:30.418
a child gets from its mother.

00:24:30.418 --> 00:24:33.798
And on this chromosome
I've got a red dot there.

00:24:33.798 --> 00:24:37.393
The IGF2 gene is not being expressed.

00:24:37.393 --> 00:24:41.454
Where some the copy that the
child gets from its father

00:24:41.454 --> 00:24:44.735
the IGF2 gene is being expressed.

00:24:44.735 --> 00:24:47.402
IGF2 is a fatal growth enhancer.

00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:51.818
This is a gene that is
promoting growth at the placenta

00:24:51.818 --> 00:24:54.826
and is increasing birth weight

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:57.653
and it's not being expressed
when it comes from the mother,

00:24:57.653 --> 00:25:01.544
but being expressed when
it comes from the father.

00:25:01.544 --> 00:25:03.348
Now this is called imprinting

00:25:03.348 --> 00:25:05.609
because this hasn't anything to do

00:25:05.609 --> 00:25:08.040
with the DNA sequence itself.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.123
In my body, the copy of IGF2

00:25:11.123 --> 00:25:13.967
I got from my mother is silent,

00:25:13.967 --> 00:25:17.616
but if I pass that silent
copy on to my children

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:19.742
it's going to be active in my children

00:25:19.742 --> 00:25:22.812
because they got it from their father.

00:25:22.812 --> 00:25:26.240
In this chromosome region
there is a second gene

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.175
with the opposite pattern of imprinting.

00:25:29.175 --> 00:25:33.342
CDKN1C, this is a
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.

00:25:34.404 --> 00:25:37.986
This is an inhibitor of
progression through the cell cycle.

00:25:37.986 --> 00:25:41.845
So this is stopping cells
dividing and growing larger.

00:25:41.845 --> 00:25:44.401
So this is an inhibitor of growth,

00:25:44.401 --> 00:25:47.282
and it shows the opposite
pattern of imprinting.

00:25:47.282 --> 00:25:50.570
It's expressed off the
maternal chromosome.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.493
So the gene coming from the mother

00:25:52.493 --> 00:25:54.553
is acting to reduce growth.

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:59.376
Whereas the gene copy coming
from the father is silent.

00:25:59.376 --> 00:26:02.454
So, in the essence, we have a situation

00:26:02.454 --> 00:26:06.446
where simultaneously
during fetal development,

00:26:06.446 --> 00:26:09.619
we have a paternal foot on the accelerator

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:12.039
of growth here of IGF2 being expressed

00:26:12.039 --> 00:26:15.724
from the paternal
chromosome promoting growth.

00:26:15.724 --> 00:26:18.562
The maternal foot is off the accelerator,

00:26:18.562 --> 00:26:22.592
but the maternal foot is on
the break, reducing growth,

00:26:22.592 --> 00:26:26.637
and the paternal foot in
the child in the same cells

00:26:26.637 --> 00:26:29.688
is not applied to that break.

00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:32.415
And normal fetal development is determined

00:26:32.415 --> 00:26:35.256
by the balance of paternal acceleration

00:26:35.256 --> 00:26:37.089
and maternal breaking.

00:26:37.965 --> 00:26:41.583
And so this internal
conflict can be revealed

00:26:41.583 --> 00:26:43.597
in rare genetic disorders

00:26:43.597 --> 00:26:46.743
where parts of this process go wrong.

00:26:46.743 --> 00:26:47.972
So I'll start off with,

00:26:47.972 --> 00:26:50.732
I'll look at Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

00:26:50.732 --> 00:26:52.952
This is a fetal overgrowth syndrome.

00:26:52.952 --> 00:26:56.614
So these children are born rather large.

00:26:56.614 --> 00:26:58.955
I have a friend who had

00:26:58.955 --> 00:27:01.386
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome as a child,

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:05.256
and she'd given me her
baby photo to look at.

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:06.773
So here she is.

00:27:06.773 --> 00:27:09.523
She was about 13 pounds at birth.

00:27:10.825 --> 00:27:12.737
Typical of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome,

00:27:12.737 --> 00:27:14.866
she has macroglossia,

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:17.807
which is just what medical
people used to say,

00:27:17.807 --> 00:27:20.470
it's Latin for having a large tongue.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.899
I suspect evolutionarily this is,

00:27:22.899 --> 00:27:26.609
the tongue muscle is the
pump during breastfeeding,

00:27:26.609 --> 00:27:30.421
and so paternal genes are
particularly involved in promoting

00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:33.497
the development of the tongue muscles.

00:27:33.497 --> 00:27:38.227
Now what are the causes of
this fetal overgrowth syndrome?

00:27:38.227 --> 00:27:40.660
In a number of cases,

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.392
individuals turned out to
have two paternal copies

00:27:44.392 --> 00:27:46.196
of this chromosome region.

00:27:46.196 --> 00:27:49.212
This is called paternal
uniparental disomy.

00:27:49.212 --> 00:27:52.916
So in this case, they
have two copies of IGF2.

00:27:52.916 --> 00:27:56.372
They have two paternal
feet on the accelerator,

00:27:56.372 --> 00:27:59.125
and no maternal feet on the brake.

00:27:59.125 --> 00:28:01.751
So they have fetal overgrowth.

00:28:01.751 --> 00:28:04.301
It's also associated with a high risk

00:28:04.301 --> 00:28:07.471
of a number of childhood cancers.

00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:10.855
Some other people with the same diagnosis

00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:12.742
of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome,

00:28:12.742 --> 00:28:15.804
the fetal overgrowth have a mutation

00:28:15.804 --> 00:28:20.437
an inactivating mutation in
the maternal copy of CDKN1C.

00:28:20.437 --> 00:28:23.656
So this is the break on fetal growth.

00:28:23.656 --> 00:28:27.029
So the maternal copy which
is normally expressed

00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:29.288
is inactivated by a mutation.

00:28:29.288 --> 00:28:33.898
The paternal copy is
inactivated as normally occurs,

00:28:33.898 --> 00:28:36.166
and so in this case
they've got a paternal foot

00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:38.170
on the accelerator of growth

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.447
and no maternal foot on the brake.

00:28:40.447 --> 00:28:43.535
And this is associated
with fetal overgrowth,

00:28:43.535 --> 00:28:46.448
and the similar clinical diagnosis.

00:28:46.448 --> 00:28:49.306
They'll apparently knot
with the increase risk

00:28:49.306 --> 00:28:51.056
of childhood cancers.

00:28:52.006 --> 00:28:54.923
Such a condition is interesting if,

00:28:56.321 --> 00:28:58.754
if a male who had this mutation,

00:28:58.754 --> 00:29:00.632
and had Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome

00:29:00.632 --> 00:29:03.266
pass the mutant gene onto his children

00:29:03.266 --> 00:29:05.333
they would have normal development,

00:29:05.333 --> 00:29:08.767
because they would get a
normal gene from their mother

00:29:08.767 --> 00:29:13.077
and the mutant gene that is
coming from the affected male

00:29:13.077 --> 00:29:14.632
would have been inactivated anyway.

00:29:14.632 --> 00:29:17.028
So this is a case where a mutation

00:29:17.028 --> 00:29:21.300
is having an effect when
inherited from a parent upon sex

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.906
but not from a parent of the other.

00:29:24.906 --> 00:29:27.543
Silver-Russell syndrome is a

00:29:27.543 --> 00:29:31.334
intrauterine growth retardation syndrome.

00:29:31.334 --> 00:29:36.058
And so here I have a picture
of two girls of the same age.

00:29:36.058 --> 00:29:39.710
This little girl here has
Silver-Russell syndrome,

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.760
it's associated with
very low birth weights,

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.308
not associated with catch-up growth.

00:29:45.308 --> 00:29:47.738
So if not treated, this
individuals grow up

00:29:47.738 --> 00:29:49.911
to be very small adults.

00:29:49.911 --> 00:29:51.880
It's also associated with severe

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.713
feeding difficulties as an infant.

00:29:55.951 --> 00:29:59.287
Some individuals with
Silver-Russell syndrome

00:29:59.287 --> 00:30:03.271
have two maternal copies
of this chromosome region.

00:30:03.271 --> 00:30:04.957
So now they have no paternal foot

00:30:04.957 --> 00:30:07.097
on the accelerator of growth.

00:30:07.097 --> 00:30:10.010
And two maternal feet on the break

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:14.201
associated with intrauterine
growth retardation

00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:16.371
and small birth weight.

00:30:16.371 --> 00:30:20.002
Other individuals have a
loss of DNA methylation

00:30:20.002 --> 00:30:23.330
at what is called the imprinting
control region 1 here.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:27.803
This leads to the inactivation
of the paternal copy of IGF2.

00:30:27.803 --> 00:30:30.760
So now they have no foot on
the accelerator of growth,

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.409
and that's associated with
intrauterine growth retardation.

00:30:35.409 --> 00:30:37.091
For the final part of the tour,

00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:40.300
I want to talk about a
different pair of syndromes

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.502
that are associated with
the different cluster

00:30:42.502 --> 00:30:44.655
of imprinted genes.

00:30:44.655 --> 00:30:47.861
This reside on human chromosome 15,

00:30:47.861 --> 00:30:51.063
and here the imprinting
is specific to the brain

00:30:51.063 --> 00:30:54.577
and doesn't occur in most of her tissues.

00:30:54.577 --> 00:30:57.530
I won't go into the details
of naming these genes,

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.202
just to point out that
there are some genes,

00:31:00.202 --> 00:31:01.722
like this one here,

00:31:01.722 --> 00:31:04.967
that are not expressed on
the maternal chromosome,

00:31:04.967 --> 00:31:07.600
but are expressed on
the paternal chromosome

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.382
and other genes with the
opposite pattern of expression

00:31:10.382 --> 00:31:12.799
expressed on the maternal chromosome,

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:16.009
but not on the paternal chromosome.

00:31:16.009 --> 00:31:18.809
Some interesting things in this region.

00:31:18.809 --> 00:31:22.005
Here is where the
single-nucleotide polymorphism,

00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:25.088
that in European populations
makes the difference

00:31:25.088 --> 00:31:28.279
between blue and brown eyes resides.

00:31:28.279 --> 00:31:29.696
And sitting here,

00:31:31.186 --> 00:31:33.281
a gene that I won't talk about.

00:31:33.281 --> 00:31:35.298
This gene MKRN3,

00:31:35.298 --> 00:31:37.512
so this is a gene that is only expressed

00:31:37.512 --> 00:31:39.433
when you get from your father

00:31:39.433 --> 00:31:41.618
but not expressed from the mother.

00:31:41.618 --> 00:31:43.281
When children have a mutation

00:31:43.281 --> 00:31:45.511
in this paternally derived gene copy,

00:31:45.511 --> 00:31:47.765
recent work from Brazil said,

00:31:47.765 --> 00:31:49.933
they have precautions puberty

00:31:49.933 --> 00:31:54.515
that they go through puberty
usually before age of 10 years.

00:31:54.515 --> 00:31:56.368
So this is suggesting that the paternally

00:31:56.368 --> 00:31:58.894
expressed gene on this chromosome

00:31:58.894 --> 00:32:02.354
is inhibiting pubertal progression,

00:32:02.354 --> 00:32:06.838
which raises some interesting
evolutionary questions.

00:32:06.838 --> 00:32:10.831
Okay, so here is a young child
with Prader-Willi syndrome.

00:32:10.831 --> 00:32:14.655
I'm going to focus on
the childhood symptoms

00:32:14.655 --> 00:32:16.209
of Prader-Willi syndrome.

00:32:16.209 --> 00:32:18.757
These children, some of you might know

00:32:18.757 --> 00:32:21.836
in studying in the second
to third year of life,

00:32:21.836 --> 00:32:25.349
they go from being anorexic,
having no appetite,

00:32:25.349 --> 00:32:29.304
to becoming hypophagic and
they become massively obese.

00:32:29.304 --> 00:32:31.616
But I'm just going to be focusing on

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:34.034
the symptoms that these children have

00:32:34.034 --> 00:32:37.363
in the immediate perinatal period.

00:32:37.363 --> 00:32:40.167
So this girl is showing the hypotonia

00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:42.249
of Prader-Willi syndrome.

00:32:42.249 --> 00:32:44.846
Most individuals with
Prader-Willi syndrome

00:32:44.846 --> 00:32:49.344
have a deletion of the paternal
copy of this chromosome.

00:32:49.344 --> 00:32:52.476
So they've only got
maternally expressed genes

00:32:52.476 --> 00:32:56.226
coming from this region
and no paternal copy.

00:32:57.432 --> 00:33:01.626
A few other people have two
maternal copies of this region,

00:33:01.626 --> 00:33:03.723
and they have Prader-Willi syndrome.

00:33:03.723 --> 00:33:05.583
So what this is showing is

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.721
the Prader-Willi syndrome is caused

00:33:07.721 --> 00:33:10.804
by the absence of expression of genes

00:33:11.885 --> 00:33:14.486
that come from the father.

00:33:14.486 --> 00:33:15.921
Interestingly, an individuals

00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:18.550
with maternal uniparental disomy,

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:23.462
this is one of the most
penetrant causes of psychosis.

00:33:23.462 --> 00:33:26.409
Sitting down in this region of the region,

00:33:26.409 --> 00:33:29.288
this is a GABAA-receptor cluster.

00:33:29.288 --> 00:33:30.714
And there appears to be some sort

00:33:30.714 --> 00:33:33.267
of parent of origin effect occurring here

00:33:33.267 --> 00:33:37.713
that predisposing these individuals
to developing psychosis.

00:33:37.713 --> 00:33:40.296
So Prader-Willi syndrome is associated

00:33:40.296 --> 00:33:44.093
with the absence of expression
of paternally derived genes.

00:33:44.093 --> 00:33:47.354
And therefore evolutionarily
this leads to a prediction

00:33:47.354 --> 00:33:50.155
that Prader-Willi syndrome should exhibit

00:33:50.155 --> 00:33:54.803
an exaggeration of traits
that reduce demands on mother.

00:33:54.803 --> 00:33:58.395
So this region contains
paternal accelerators

00:33:58.395 --> 00:34:00.651
on offspring demands on mothers.

00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:02.943
We're taking away those paternal genes,

00:34:02.943 --> 00:34:05.153
and so you should see in the child

00:34:05.153 --> 00:34:07.284
reduced demands on the mother.

00:34:07.284 --> 00:34:09.633
So let's look at the neonatal phenotype

00:34:09.633 --> 00:34:11.299
in Prader-Willi syndrome.

00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:14.596
It's associated with low muscle tension,

00:34:14.596 --> 00:34:16.900
neonatal hypotonia.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.233
With a weak cry,

00:34:19.324 --> 00:34:23.194
these are low maintenance
children, and with poor suck.

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:27.185
So this children have little
to no interest in feeding,

00:34:27.185 --> 00:34:31.925
and they have very weak or
non-existing suckling reflexes.

00:34:31.925 --> 00:34:35.009
Usually they have to have a
chew put in to the stomach,

00:34:35.009 --> 00:34:39.115
gavage feeding, to give
them adequate nutrition.

00:34:39.115 --> 00:34:41.698
They show excessive sleepiness.

00:34:42.538 --> 00:34:46.148
The child was put to that
bed and it stays asleep.

00:34:46.148 --> 00:34:48.125
So this suggest that paternal genes

00:34:48.125 --> 00:34:50.747
that are absent in Prader-Willi syndrome

00:34:50.747 --> 00:34:54.914
promotes suckling and they
also promote wakefulness.

00:34:55.894 --> 00:34:59.143
So in their absence you have
a child that doesn't suckle

00:34:59.143 --> 00:35:01.451
and a child that sleeps through the night.

00:35:01.451 --> 00:35:04.165
And I have suggest that evolutionarily

00:35:04.165 --> 00:35:07.485
paternal genes are promoting
more intense suckling

00:35:07.485 --> 00:35:11.068
and also night waking
in children in babies

00:35:12.346 --> 00:35:15.591
as a way of essentially exhausting mothers

00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:18.787
and delaying her return to fertility,

00:35:18.787 --> 00:35:21.599
delaying the conception
of a younger sibling

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:26.382
who will compete for
maternal care and attention.

00:35:26.382 --> 00:35:29.058
Interestingly deletions of precisely

00:35:29.058 --> 00:35:30.745
the same chromosome region

00:35:30.745 --> 00:35:32.975
caused a completely differently syndrome.

00:35:32.975 --> 00:35:36.144
This is a boy with Angelman syndrome.

00:35:36.144 --> 00:35:40.500
The majority of cases, 70%
of cases of Angelman syndrome

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.346
have a deletion of the
same chromosome region,

00:35:43.346 --> 00:35:47.381
but in this case it's a deletion
of the maternal chromosome.

00:35:47.381 --> 00:35:50.765
So they only have a paternal
copy of this region.

00:35:50.765 --> 00:35:55.619
So now we would expect an
exaggeration of behaviors

00:35:55.619 --> 00:35:58.202
that increased cost to mothers.

00:35:59.458 --> 00:36:01.847
We know of couple of cases of women

00:36:01.847 --> 00:36:03.536
with Prader-Willi syndrome

00:36:03.536 --> 00:36:07.978
who had a deletion of
their paternal chromosome

00:36:07.978 --> 00:36:09.842
that were fertile and had a child

00:36:09.842 --> 00:36:12.690
and passed the deletion
onto their children.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.860
Their child got it from their mother,

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.161
so the child of a
Prader-Willi syndrome woman

00:36:18.161 --> 00:36:20.127
has Angelman syndrome.

00:36:20.127 --> 00:36:22.632
Some other individuals
with Prader-Willi syndrome

00:36:22.632 --> 00:36:25.174
have been activating mutations.

00:36:25.174 --> 00:36:27.552
In this gene here UBE3A,

00:36:27.552 --> 00:36:30.857
which is normally expressed
only on the maternal chromosome.

00:36:30.857 --> 00:36:34.469
So now the maternal copy
is inactivated by mutation,

00:36:34.469 --> 00:36:39.004
and the paternal copy is
inactivated by genomic imprinting.

00:36:39.004 --> 00:36:41.843
And this suggest that Angelman syndrome

00:36:41.843 --> 00:36:46.326
most of the symptoms are caused
by the absence of expression

00:36:46.326 --> 00:36:51.031
of the maternally derived
copy of this gene UBE3A.

00:36:51.031 --> 00:36:55.520
So Angelman syndrome is
predicted to exaggerate traits

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.008
that increase offspring
demands on mothers.

00:36:59.008 --> 00:37:01.933
And I'll just look at some of the

00:37:01.933 --> 00:37:04.168
symptoms of Angelman syndrome.

00:37:04.168 --> 00:37:06.946
So Angelman syndrome is associate

00:37:06.946 --> 00:37:10.005
with uncoordinated suck and swallow,

00:37:10.005 --> 00:37:13.429
but these children do
not need to gavage fed,

00:37:13.429 --> 00:37:17.386
as it if there's hyper activity
in the suckling reflex.

00:37:17.386 --> 00:37:19.398
They get adequate nutrition,

00:37:19.398 --> 00:37:22.698
so they don't show failure deprived.

00:37:22.698 --> 00:37:25.608
They have adequate
nutrition as I've mentioned.

00:37:25.608 --> 00:37:29.029
They are hypertonic rather than hypotonic.

00:37:29.029 --> 00:37:31.696
They have ataxia, hyperactivity.

00:37:32.619 --> 00:37:34.550
Particularly tiring for parents,

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.969
they have excessive wakefulness as babies.

00:37:37.969 --> 00:37:40.394
I know of clinical reports of babies

00:37:40.394 --> 00:37:43.227
who were awake 21 hours out of 24.

00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:46.889
Parents are advised to get some sleep.

00:37:46.889 --> 00:37:50.119
Sometimes they put the
child in a darkened room

00:37:50.119 --> 00:37:52.085
and close the door.

00:37:52.085 --> 00:37:56.588
Angelman syndrome is
associated with happy affect,

00:37:56.588 --> 00:38:00.623
the laughing smiling child you
saw in the previous picture.

00:38:00.623 --> 00:38:05.153
This is particular in interactions
with potential caregivers

00:38:05.153 --> 00:38:08.197
and it's associated
with frequent laughter.

00:38:08.197 --> 00:38:11.446
These are happy smiling children.

00:38:11.446 --> 00:38:15.525
Curiously, this is associated
with a complete absence

00:38:15.525 --> 00:38:19.395
of the development of speech,
or even of sign language,

00:38:19.395 --> 00:38:23.562
so these children have some
degree of cognitive delay.

00:38:25.127 --> 00:38:28.260
But the absence of speech
seems to be out of proportion

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.694
to the cognitive problems.

00:38:29.694 --> 00:38:32.378
It seems to be a specific deficit

00:38:32.378 --> 00:38:34.959
in this imprinted disorder.

00:38:34.959 --> 00:38:38.044
The suggestion is the children
with Angelman syndrome

00:38:38.044 --> 00:38:41.167
exhibit exaggerated attachment behaviors,

00:38:41.167 --> 00:38:44.094
but normally engage maternal attention

00:38:44.094 --> 00:38:45.943
and elicit maternal care.

00:38:45.943 --> 00:38:48.292
This is the laughing, smiling baby

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:51.935
that the mother wants
to give attention to.

00:38:51.935 --> 00:38:53.823
And I'll finish with another photo.

00:38:53.823 --> 00:38:56.377
And just look at the hands in the photo.

00:38:56.377 --> 00:39:01.031
So here we have mom holding on
to the hands of two children

00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:04.894
and this child misses out and
doesn't get a maternal hand.

00:39:04.894 --> 00:39:06.319
Thank you.

00:39:06.319 --> 00:39:09.402
(mellow piano music)

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:17.235
- When we talk about medicine.

00:39:17.235 --> 00:39:18.671
I think it's quite important

00:39:18.671 --> 00:39:21.995
to think about what is medicine?

00:39:21.995 --> 00:39:23.964
It is the study,

00:39:23.964 --> 00:39:28.151
an intervention of human
physiological systems

00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:31.847
and physical systems
and psychiatric systems

00:39:31.847 --> 00:39:34.351
when they are dysregulated.

00:39:34.351 --> 00:39:37.893
To attempt to correct what is going on.

00:39:37.893 --> 00:39:39.893
To improve human health.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:41.960
And in order to do that

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.249
we have to have a deep understanding

00:39:43.249 --> 00:39:46.181
of not only the dysfunction
of these systems,

00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:49.014
but how they function when

00:39:49.014 --> 00:39:51.872
doing healthy things within our bodies.

00:39:51.872 --> 00:39:55.455
And so to me the term
medicine really means

00:39:56.821 --> 00:39:59.165
applied human biology.

00:39:59.165 --> 00:40:03.452
And as every biologist knows
we have a favorite quote

00:40:03.452 --> 00:40:05.710
which is that "Nothing
biology makes sense,

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.504
"except in the light of evolution."

00:40:08.504 --> 00:40:12.149
And this means that to understand
the organizing principles

00:40:12.149 --> 00:40:15.518
of any organism
biologically on this planet,

00:40:15.518 --> 00:40:18.647
we need to understand
its evolutionary history

00:40:18.647 --> 00:40:20.644
and the theories of selective pressures

00:40:20.644 --> 00:40:23.702
that have shape that organism
to function the way it does

00:40:23.702 --> 00:40:26.539
in the particular context
in which it finds itself.

00:40:26.539 --> 00:40:29.964
And as an anthropologist who studies

00:40:29.964 --> 00:40:31.556
maternal health and infant development,

00:40:31.556 --> 00:40:35.648
I have a particularly favorite
adaptation that I care about.

00:40:35.648 --> 00:40:38.951
And it is the systhesis of
milk from mammary glands

00:40:38.951 --> 00:40:43.569
which is the defining characteristic
of our mammalian class.

00:40:43.569 --> 00:40:45.449
It's as Barbara pointed out,

00:40:45.449 --> 00:40:48.554
why mammals are at risk of breast cancer?

00:40:48.554 --> 00:40:50.533
Because we have mammary glands.

00:40:50.533 --> 00:40:54.855
And mother's milk
initially a random mutation

00:40:54.855 --> 00:40:58.601
for a minor secretion that
perhaps hydrated young

00:40:58.601 --> 00:41:01.253
or provided rudimentary immunofactors

00:41:01.253 --> 00:41:03.589
has been shaped by hundreds
of millions of years

00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:05.855
of evolution and natural selection

00:41:05.855 --> 00:41:08.118
to become increasingly complex,

00:41:08.118 --> 00:41:11.788
such that it provides
nourishment for young.

00:41:11.788 --> 00:41:15.658
It provides comprehensive
immune protection

00:41:15.658 --> 00:41:18.750
for the pathogens babies
are likely to encounter.

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:22.320
And it also provides bioactive hormones

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.612
from maternal circulation that
cross over into the infant

00:41:25.612 --> 00:41:28.688
and influenced infant
physiological regulation.

00:41:28.688 --> 00:41:30.907
It is due to this complex biofluid

00:41:30.907 --> 00:41:34.121
that is food, medicine and signal

00:41:34.121 --> 00:41:36.542
that has led every major governmental

00:41:36.542 --> 00:41:38.355
and nongovernmental organization

00:41:38.355 --> 00:41:42.272
to recognize mother's
milk as both liquid gold.

00:41:43.163 --> 00:41:45.342
And breastfeeding as the gold standard

00:41:45.342 --> 00:41:48.548
of early life input from the mother.

00:41:48.548 --> 00:41:49.381
However,

00:41:50.711 --> 00:41:53.709
because of the ubiquity of
milk within our environment

00:41:53.709 --> 00:41:56.288
and it seeming replication in the form of

00:41:56.288 --> 00:41:59.128
artificial breast milks that
you can buy at the store,

00:41:59.128 --> 00:42:02.376
we have come to take milk for granted

00:42:02.376 --> 00:42:04.630
and think of it as a standardized,

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:07.566
systematized simple kind of thing,

00:42:07.566 --> 00:42:08.751
and we've lost side of the things

00:42:08.751 --> 00:42:11.447
that make it incredibly
complex and special.

00:42:11.447 --> 00:42:14.615
And it's that we have
not actually identified

00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:16.900
what are liquid gold standards.

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.982
We do not have a systematic
understanding of milk,

00:42:19.982 --> 00:42:21.459
how it varies?

00:42:21.459 --> 00:42:23.896
What does variance does
when ingested by the infant?

00:42:23.896 --> 00:42:27.706
And these are fundamental
things that we need to uncover

00:42:27.706 --> 00:42:29.682
in order to better manage infant health

00:42:29.682 --> 00:42:31.960
within the neonatal intensive care unit,

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.999
and better target our
public health intervention.

00:42:34.999 --> 00:42:37.680
And so, I think an
evolutionary perspective

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.369
is incredibly important
in order to both design

00:42:42.369 --> 00:42:45.456
and effectively target research studies,

00:42:45.456 --> 00:42:47.574
but also to help inform our understanding

00:42:47.574 --> 00:42:49.040
of this dynamic system.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.401
Because lactation is a
complex adaptive system

00:42:52.401 --> 00:42:55.318
in which natural selection
has shaped mother's physiology

00:42:55.318 --> 00:42:58.025
and their mammary glands
to synthesize milk

00:42:58.025 --> 00:42:59.358
in complex ways.

00:43:00.329 --> 00:43:01.558
And there's a fundamental thing

00:43:01.558 --> 00:43:03.172
that I think is very challenging

00:43:03.172 --> 00:43:05.213
when we're thinking
about managing the health

00:43:05.213 --> 00:43:06.867
of a mother and an infant.

00:43:06.867 --> 00:43:09.055
Because we think about how do we optimize

00:43:09.055 --> 00:43:12.559
that infant's outcome in that
particular time and place

00:43:12.559 --> 00:43:15.327
for the challenges that infant is handling

00:43:15.327 --> 00:43:17.573
or trying to handle.

00:43:17.573 --> 00:43:18.717
And this is challenging,

00:43:18.717 --> 00:43:20.952
because natural selection
has not shaped mothers

00:43:20.952 --> 00:43:24.233
to optimized the outcome
of a particular infant.

00:43:24.233 --> 00:43:27.093
Natural selection has
shaped mother's physiology

00:43:27.093 --> 00:43:28.561
to allocate investment in young

00:43:28.561 --> 00:43:31.407
across an entire reproductive career

00:43:31.407 --> 00:43:33.859
to maximize her reproductive success

00:43:33.859 --> 00:43:37.194
across her reproductive lifespan.

00:43:37.194 --> 00:43:38.831
And because of this,

00:43:38.831 --> 00:43:41.653
we see that there are going
to be a number of tradeoffs

00:43:41.653 --> 00:43:45.655
in how she allocates
resources between her own body

00:43:45.655 --> 00:43:48.420
and how she is nourishing her infant.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.431
Just like I can only spend a dollar once,

00:43:51.431 --> 00:43:54.378
an organism can only burn a calorie once,

00:43:54.378 --> 00:43:57.712
and if that calories
burned on immune function

00:43:57.712 --> 00:44:02.415
it's not available to allocate
word infant development.

00:44:02.415 --> 00:44:05.561
And we see the signature
of these tradeoffs

00:44:05.561 --> 00:44:08.691
broadly in how mothers
are synthesizing milk.

00:44:08.691 --> 00:44:11.290
But this evolutionary
life history perspective

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:13.504
have not been systematically integrated

00:44:13.504 --> 00:44:16.910
into medical approaches
within infant care management.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:18.866
The important thing there is that

00:44:18.866 --> 00:44:21.694
those food, medicine and signal of milk

00:44:21.694 --> 00:44:24.541
is going to vary across all mothers.

00:44:24.541 --> 00:44:28.113
The presence and abundance
of particular milk bioactives

00:44:28.113 --> 00:44:30.127
is not standardized,

00:44:30.127 --> 00:44:32.260
and in fact the signature in milk

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.184
across each individual mother
is going to be different.

00:44:35.184 --> 00:44:37.872
When we look at milk synthesis

00:44:37.872 --> 00:44:41.546
across every single potential
scale of consideration,

00:44:41.546 --> 00:44:43.268
we find that milk varies.

00:44:43.268 --> 00:44:45.529
It varies across species.

00:44:45.529 --> 00:44:49.025
It varies across
populations within species.

00:44:49.025 --> 00:44:52.360
Across individuals within population.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.673
Within individual across lactations.

00:44:54.673 --> 00:44:57.371
Within individual within a lactation.

00:44:57.371 --> 00:44:59.493
And we can actually see
the synthesis of milk

00:44:59.493 --> 00:45:02.123
and the composition of
particular bioactives

00:45:02.123 --> 00:45:05.214
shift from hour to hour
throughout the day.

00:45:05.214 --> 00:45:08.010
And so to kind of think
about what are the signatures

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:10.517
that we see in a milk
a mother synthesizes.

00:45:10.517 --> 00:45:13.804
So Dr. Elizabeth Quinn has shown

00:45:13.804 --> 00:45:16.221
that just the fat content in milk,

00:45:16.221 --> 00:45:17.952
you can go to the store and it's processed

00:45:17.952 --> 00:45:20.589
and you can get it at 3%, 2%, 1%

00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:22.887
or where the fats entirely removed,

00:45:22.887 --> 00:45:24.567
but across human populations

00:45:24.567 --> 00:45:26.798
the mean value of the
fat content in their milk

00:45:26.798 --> 00:45:28.658
is substantially variable.

00:45:28.658 --> 00:45:31.662
We see gradients between
rural and urban communities

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:35.072
in things like their
minerals, fatty acids,

00:45:35.072 --> 00:45:37.841
hormones and sugars within milk.

00:45:37.841 --> 00:45:40.639
We see the signature of cultural ecology

00:45:40.639 --> 00:45:43.936
in the form of subsistence
patterns in their milk.

00:45:43.936 --> 00:45:46.409
This has been shown for
fatty acids, immunofactors,

00:45:46.409 --> 00:45:48.633
sugars and minerals.

00:45:48.633 --> 00:45:51.683
Melanie Martin now at
Yale University has shown

00:45:51.683 --> 00:45:55.522
that among horticulturist in the Amazon

00:45:55.522 --> 00:45:58.600
that the omega-3 fatty acid
concentration in their milk

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.531
is not only higher than that

00:46:00.531 --> 00:46:02.329
which is found in the breast milk of women

00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:04.496
living in the Ohio River Valley.

00:46:04.496 --> 00:46:07.461
But their ratio of omega-3's to omega-6's

00:46:07.461 --> 00:46:09.753
is closer to what we consider to be

00:46:09.753 --> 00:46:11.551
most healthy for infants.

00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:13.498
Across individuals,

00:46:13.498 --> 00:46:17.839
when we look at dairy cows as
a model for lactation biology,

00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:21.918
humans and monkeys as another
model for human biomedicine.

00:46:21.918 --> 00:46:24.089
We find that maternal characteristics

00:46:24.089 --> 00:46:26.202
are going to lead their signature in milk.

00:46:26.202 --> 00:46:28.237
Mothers who have better body condition,

00:46:28.237 --> 00:46:31.773
lower parasite loads, and
greater social capital

00:46:31.773 --> 00:46:34.879
or access to resources are
going to synthesize milk

00:46:34.879 --> 00:46:38.163
in different ways than mothers
who are more constrained.

00:46:38.163 --> 00:46:40.786
We see this in the volume of
milk that they're producing,

00:46:40.786 --> 00:46:43.904
the fat concentration
and hormonal signals.

00:46:43.904 --> 00:46:45.670
Similarly across the same species

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.763
we find that the infants characteristics

00:46:47.763 --> 00:46:50.443
are also implicated in
the variation of milk

00:46:50.443 --> 00:46:52.086
that mothers are synthesizing.

00:46:52.086 --> 00:46:54.469
So the age of the infant at birth

00:46:54.469 --> 00:46:56.565
in terms of gestational age,

00:46:56.565 --> 00:46:59.036
the infant's sex whether
it's male of female.

00:46:59.036 --> 00:47:00.948
And whether or not the infant is sick

00:47:00.948 --> 00:47:02.912
are all implicated in different aspects

00:47:02.912 --> 00:47:06.007
of milk composition and production.

00:47:06.007 --> 00:47:08.478
These differentiated
biological recipe in milk

00:47:08.478 --> 00:47:10.361
has been found broadly across a number

00:47:10.361 --> 00:47:12.667
of different mammal species.

00:47:12.667 --> 00:47:14.077
And it's important to understand

00:47:14.077 --> 00:47:16.345
that these does not necessarily mean

00:47:16.345 --> 00:47:18.471
that mothers are making
better or worse milk

00:47:18.471 --> 00:47:20.606
for either sons or daughters.

00:47:20.606 --> 00:47:21.759
But where sons and daughters

00:47:21.759 --> 00:47:23.823
have different developmental priorities,

00:47:23.823 --> 00:47:25.804
different developmental trajectories,

00:47:25.804 --> 00:47:27.363
we can expect that the milk

00:47:27.363 --> 00:47:29.245
that mothers used to nourish them

00:47:29.245 --> 00:47:30.840
is going to influenced aspects

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.840
of those developmental trajectories.

00:47:35.011 --> 00:47:39.195
When we go to the grocery
store or the pharmacy

00:47:39.195 --> 00:47:42.537
there's different deodorant
for men and women.

00:47:42.537 --> 00:47:43.815
Right?

00:47:43.815 --> 00:47:46.127
But when we go into the
infant formula section

00:47:46.127 --> 00:47:48.068
in the grocery store,

00:47:48.068 --> 00:47:50.542
it's one size fits all.

00:47:50.542 --> 00:47:54.108
And we do not yet have enough
information scientifically

00:47:54.108 --> 00:47:57.028
to say that that's not best practices.

00:47:57.028 --> 00:47:59.775
We haven't allocated the
research effort to understanding,

00:47:59.775 --> 00:48:02.632
could we get better infant
developmental outcomes

00:48:02.632 --> 00:48:06.144
if we had more tailored milk for them?

00:48:06.144 --> 00:48:07.663
For infants who don't have access

00:48:07.663 --> 00:48:09.943
to breast milk for whatever reason.

00:48:09.943 --> 00:48:11.956
Across time, we see that mothers

00:48:11.956 --> 00:48:14.302
early in their reproductive career,

00:48:14.302 --> 00:48:17.259
dairy cows, seals and
monkeys I worked with

00:48:17.259 --> 00:48:19.974
that adolescent mothers
make different milk

00:48:19.974 --> 00:48:21.334
than mature mothers,

00:48:21.334 --> 00:48:25.250
that across parties, mothers
make different milks.

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:27.721
This can be the nutritional components

00:48:27.721 --> 00:48:29.524
as well as a hormonal
components of their milk.

00:48:29.524 --> 00:48:32.550
And the signatures that this
may leave in infant development

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:34.648
are still poorly understood.

00:48:34.648 --> 00:48:37.812
So lactation is an
adaptive contingency system

00:48:37.812 --> 00:48:40.812
in which mothers have
access to more resources

00:48:40.812 --> 00:48:44.096
are able to up-regulate
aspects of milk synthesis.

00:48:44.096 --> 00:48:47.999
Or mothers that are constrained
down-regulate milk synthesis

00:48:47.999 --> 00:48:50.446
to protect their condition
for future reproduction.

00:48:50.446 --> 00:48:52.336
And this is shown both through the milk

00:48:52.336 --> 00:48:53.868
that their synthesizing and their

00:48:53.868 --> 00:48:55.987
behavioral dynamic with their infants.

00:48:55.987 --> 00:48:58.371
And this is a function
of maternal resources

00:48:58.371 --> 00:49:02.211
and their allocations among
different tradeoff priorities.

00:49:02.211 --> 00:49:05.378
An adolescent 13 year old human mother

00:49:06.546 --> 00:49:08.267
is going to be constrained

00:49:08.267 --> 00:49:11.096
in her capacity to synthesize milk.

00:49:11.096 --> 00:49:14.141
So that means that clinical
support for that mother infant

00:49:14.141 --> 00:49:17.022
that is going to have to
take into consideration

00:49:17.022 --> 00:49:19.644
that the cascading trade-off allocations

00:49:19.644 --> 00:49:23.829
between her condition and
the condition of her infant.

00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:25.140
And this important because

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.504
where milk production is constrained,

00:49:27.504 --> 00:49:30.145
where milk production is insufficient

00:49:30.145 --> 00:49:33.073
we see impacts on infant developments.

00:49:33.073 --> 00:49:35.827
So milk composition and
milk volume is implicated

00:49:35.827 --> 00:49:38.365
in infant growth, their immune function,

00:49:38.365 --> 00:49:41.813
how microbes colonized
their intestinal tract,

00:49:41.813 --> 00:49:44.109
their cognition and their behavior.

00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:46.082
You see this in animal model systems

00:49:46.082 --> 00:49:48.507
in a variety of different human settings.

00:49:48.507 --> 00:49:51.340
And this is quite important
because in the media

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.399
we're seeing a lot of push back

00:49:53.399 --> 00:49:55.986
on the specialness of breast milk

00:49:55.986 --> 00:49:58.337
or the importance of breast milk

00:49:58.337 --> 00:50:01.129
because it's really centered
around the narrative

00:50:01.129 --> 00:50:02.888
of best case scenario.

00:50:02.888 --> 00:50:04.981
For full term infants

00:50:04.981 --> 00:50:08.288
that are born healthy and raised
in an incredibly protected

00:50:08.288 --> 00:50:10.703
and buffered environments,

00:50:10.703 --> 00:50:13.735
the effect size that's
transferred by being breast fed

00:50:13.735 --> 00:50:16.977
or formula fed is going
to be fairly moderate.

00:50:16.977 --> 00:50:18.214
But when we anchor the narrative

00:50:18.214 --> 00:50:20.074
to those best case scenarios

00:50:20.074 --> 00:50:23.316
we lose sight of many situations

00:50:23.316 --> 00:50:26.347
in which the consequences
can be quite a bit dire.

00:50:26.347 --> 00:50:28.671
So if we think about the
premature infant born

00:50:28.671 --> 00:50:30.504
in less than 39 weeks,

00:50:32.577 --> 00:50:34.739
that ends up in, a very,
very young infants,

00:50:34.739 --> 00:50:36.656
25, 27, 29 weeks of age

00:50:37.644 --> 00:50:39.360
that spend a substantial amount of time

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.617
in neonatal intensive care unit.

00:50:41.617 --> 00:50:43.491
Breast milk or bioactive
features of breast milk

00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:46.202
can be absolutely
critical for their health.

00:50:46.202 --> 00:50:48.301
If we think of children
growing up in spaces

00:50:48.301 --> 00:50:51.638
with substantial infectious disease risk,

00:50:51.638 --> 00:50:53.885
then the immunofactors that
are present in breast milk

00:50:53.885 --> 00:50:57.154
and not found in other alternatives

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:59.441
are going to be very important.

00:50:59.441 --> 00:51:02.699
In settings in which there's
this substantial risk

00:51:02.699 --> 00:51:05.000
of development of allergies or other kinds

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.388
of autoimmune kinds of challenges,

00:51:07.388 --> 00:51:10.257
then breast milk maybe a buffer to that.

00:51:10.257 --> 00:51:14.527
And even when we think about
that best case scenario

00:51:14.527 --> 00:51:16.417
where individuals are most buffered

00:51:16.417 --> 00:51:19.094
and the affect sizes are most moderate.

00:51:19.094 --> 00:51:22.336
When we scale those up across a population

00:51:22.336 --> 00:51:25.098
the health consequences add up,

00:51:25.098 --> 00:51:29.717
and the healthcare dollar
cost add up substantially.

00:51:29.717 --> 00:51:33.834
So we need to think about
not just best case scenarios,

00:51:33.834 --> 00:51:35.470
not just one child interactions,

00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:39.543
but at public health
population levels as well.

00:51:39.543 --> 00:51:42.211
So this is a complex adaptive system.

00:51:42.211 --> 00:51:44.974
And we can use that
understanding of these systems

00:51:44.974 --> 00:51:47.033
and how they've been
shaped by natural selection

00:51:47.033 --> 00:51:48.992
to identify particular strategies

00:51:48.992 --> 00:51:51.136
and targets for interventions.

00:51:51.136 --> 00:51:52.941
So some aspects of milk synthesize

00:51:52.941 --> 00:51:54.369
are going to be quite flexible,

00:51:54.369 --> 00:51:56.669
some are going to represent constraints,

00:51:56.669 --> 00:51:59.424
and some are going to be fixed
as a function of genotype

00:51:59.424 --> 00:52:01.014
or other kinds of variables.

00:52:01.014 --> 00:52:04.012
In this situations where this represent

00:52:04.012 --> 00:52:05.819
trade-offs of the mother,

00:52:05.819 --> 00:52:10.130
we can use public interventions,
access to resources,

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:12.106
social justice and public
health interventions

00:52:12.106 --> 00:52:13.745
like the WIC program,

00:52:13.745 --> 00:52:15.587
to help improve the resources

00:52:15.587 --> 00:52:18.535
so mothers are not trading
off to the same extent

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:20.891
as they are when they
have fewer resources.

00:52:20.891 --> 00:52:23.303
When the constraints become more fixed,

00:52:23.303 --> 00:52:25.452
when there isn't a capacity
to influence mothers

00:52:25.452 --> 00:52:27.521
to up-regulate their milk synthesis

00:52:27.521 --> 00:52:29.579
or shift their milk composition,

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:33.029
then we have opportunities in
which evolutionary insights

00:52:33.029 --> 00:52:35.653
can yield important advantages

00:52:35.653 --> 00:52:38.789
to how we approach milk management.

00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:41.695
So right now we see
that 20 million infants

00:52:41.695 --> 00:52:44.785
are born premature across
the globe each year.

00:52:44.785 --> 00:52:45.898
The vast majority of these

00:52:45.898 --> 00:52:47.907
are happening in the global south.

00:52:47.907 --> 00:52:51.154
And these infants are administered milk

00:52:51.154 --> 00:52:53.135
as a clinical intervention.

00:52:53.135 --> 00:52:55.885
So this is either donor milk, formula,

00:52:55.885 --> 00:52:58.545
or other kinds of
commodified milk products,

00:52:58.545 --> 00:53:01.375
which have their own
bioethical considerations.

00:53:01.375 --> 00:53:05.739
Right now these milks
represent mean values

00:53:05.739 --> 00:53:08.123
as though we know the gold standard.

00:53:08.123 --> 00:53:11.956
And this is erasing of
a lot of the individual

00:53:13.444 --> 00:53:16.928
or more specialized tailored
features of the milk.

00:53:16.928 --> 00:53:19.481
And these products and interventions

00:53:19.481 --> 00:53:23.747
are based off of mean values
among what we would call

00:53:23.747 --> 00:53:27.487
or what Joe Henrich would
call weird populations.

00:53:27.487 --> 00:53:30.039
Westernized, educated, industrialized,

00:53:30.039 --> 00:53:32.946
rich, democratic populations.

00:53:32.946 --> 00:53:34.329
Okay, weird.

00:53:34.329 --> 00:53:35.899
They're weird.

00:53:35.899 --> 00:53:40.066
And they do not necessarily
reflect ancestral conditions

00:53:41.196 --> 00:53:45.890
or the diversity of milks
that mothers are making.

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:48.620
But if we make this our gold standard

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.624
and it's not actually the best target

00:53:51.624 --> 00:53:54.127
for us to replicate or match,

00:53:54.127 --> 00:53:58.135
then when we're going
down suboptimal pathway.

00:53:58.135 --> 00:53:59.371
So we can think about,

00:53:59.371 --> 00:54:00.833
what do we know about milk?

00:54:00.833 --> 00:54:02.772
What has already been found out?

00:54:02.772 --> 00:54:06.568
And can we from there
design clinical trials

00:54:06.568 --> 00:54:08.173
and other kinds of studies

00:54:08.173 --> 00:54:11.812
to see if there's added value
space within clinical care?

00:54:11.812 --> 00:54:13.815
So right now in the NICU,

00:54:13.815 --> 00:54:16.538
some form of milk is being provided.

00:54:16.538 --> 00:54:18.394
Can we do better if we start thinking

00:54:18.394 --> 00:54:20.245
in terms of precision milk

00:54:20.245 --> 00:54:23.942
along with other aspects
of precision medicine?

00:54:23.942 --> 00:54:27.438
So can we do better if
we match milk for the,

00:54:27.438 --> 00:54:30.813
whether the child or the
baby is a son or a daughter?

00:54:30.813 --> 00:54:33.495
Can we do better if we give
morning milk in the morning

00:54:33.495 --> 00:54:35.709
and night milk at night?

00:54:35.709 --> 00:54:38.473
Adults and children
have a circadian rhythm,

00:54:38.473 --> 00:54:41.508
in which are glucocorticoids
are higher in the morning

00:54:41.508 --> 00:54:45.778
and lower in the afternoon and
evening and while we sleep.

00:54:45.778 --> 00:54:48.324
Babies don't have a circadian rhythm,

00:54:48.324 --> 00:54:51.158
they get information
about a circadian rhythm

00:54:51.158 --> 00:54:53.404
through their mother's milk.

00:54:53.404 --> 00:54:56.943
So what happens when we
provide day milk at night?

00:54:56.943 --> 00:54:58.991
Does that excite the baby's systems?

00:54:58.991 --> 00:55:01.994
This is a empirical question
for which we do not have

00:55:01.994 --> 00:55:04.726
published information at this time.

00:55:04.726 --> 00:55:06.809
For babies that get milk.

00:55:08.563 --> 00:55:12.730
Could we do better if we match
donors in a selective way?

00:55:13.595 --> 00:55:15.596
That we add value by picking milk

00:55:15.596 --> 00:55:18.251
from particular life history stages,

00:55:18.251 --> 00:55:22.418
or mothers of particular
genotype in the donor options.

00:55:23.886 --> 00:55:26.349
It's an empirical question,
we don't yet know.

00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:29.386
The FUT2 genotype influences what sugars

00:55:29.386 --> 00:55:32.142
and whether or not they're
fucosylated are present in milk,

00:55:32.142 --> 00:55:33.868
and these are important for influencing

00:55:33.868 --> 00:55:37.006
the microbial colonization's
of the infants guide.

00:55:37.006 --> 00:55:40.869
Can we target pooling milk across mothers

00:55:40.869 --> 00:55:44.189
to create a super milk that's
going to be quite important

00:55:44.189 --> 00:55:47.036
for particularly
vulnerable or sick infants?

00:55:47.036 --> 00:55:50.351
Can we mix glycans to maximize the health

00:55:50.351 --> 00:55:53.303
of the microbial systems
colonizing the infants gut?

00:55:53.303 --> 00:55:58.015
Can we provide particular
microbes to those infants?

00:55:58.015 --> 00:56:01.772
Right now, all of the
milk processing techniques

00:56:01.772 --> 00:56:03.532
in the neonatal intensive care unit

00:56:03.532 --> 00:56:06.532
involved neutralizing
these components of milk

00:56:06.532 --> 00:56:10.712
that we know are
potentially quite important.

00:56:10.712 --> 00:56:12.195
And lastly,

00:56:12.195 --> 00:56:16.614
can we co-opt and
bioengineer milk bioactives

00:56:16.614 --> 00:56:20.781
from other species that are
solving evolutionary problems

00:56:22.369 --> 00:56:25.471
that have importance for
infants in the NICU today?

00:56:25.471 --> 00:56:26.939
So when you look the marsupials,

00:56:26.939 --> 00:56:30.029
kangaroos, wallabies,
they're born at very,

00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:33.235
very early stages of development.

00:56:33.235 --> 00:56:35.723
They have very undeveloped lungs.

00:56:35.723 --> 00:56:38.565
And there's milk
bioactives within the milk

00:56:38.565 --> 00:56:40.241
that their mother synthesized,

00:56:40.241 --> 00:56:44.520
that accelerate the development
of their lungs specifically.

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:49.495
Could it be possible to
replicate or bioengineer that

00:56:49.495 --> 00:56:51.657
in ways that we can provide it to these

00:56:51.657 --> 00:56:55.475
25, 27, 29 week old
infants who had huge risk

00:56:55.475 --> 00:56:59.665
for pneumonial disease because
their lungs are undeveloped.

00:56:59.665 --> 00:57:00.736
And there are people in Australia

00:57:00.736 --> 00:57:02.703
working on answering
that question right now.

00:57:02.703 --> 00:57:04.967
They're using an evolutionary perspective

00:57:04.967 --> 00:57:06.723
of how natural selection has shaped

00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:09.097
adaptations to solve problems,

00:57:09.097 --> 00:57:11.804
that had implications
for the unique challenges

00:57:11.804 --> 00:57:16.742
that humans faced in our
particular cultural context.

00:57:16.742 --> 00:57:17.659
And lastly,

00:57:18.713 --> 00:57:20.618
when most of these have been talking about

00:57:20.618 --> 00:57:23.153
donor milks and bioengineering,

00:57:23.153 --> 00:57:26.315
but there are many infants
who do not have access to milk

00:57:26.315 --> 00:57:28.188
for a variety of reasons.

00:57:28.188 --> 00:57:30.129
Their metabolic disorders,

00:57:30.129 --> 00:57:31.720
other kinds of illnesses in which mothers

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.707
are not able to synthesize milk.

00:57:33.707 --> 00:57:36.050
There's historical traumas
and cultural context

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:38.360
that make it very difficult.

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.000
There are infants who are raised

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.855
by wonderful families
that don't include a mom.

00:57:43.855 --> 00:57:48.022
And these families rely in
very important ways on formula.

00:57:49.486 --> 00:57:51.980
Artificial breast milk.

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.816
How do we make a better
artificial breast milk

00:57:54.816 --> 00:57:59.209
that delivers more of the
important bioactives in milk

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:02.874
to help enhance those infants development?

00:58:02.874 --> 00:58:04.279
These are the kinds of things

00:58:04.279 --> 00:58:06.887
where we can take an
evolutionary perspective,

00:58:06.887 --> 00:58:11.546
apply it to a variety of
clinical and cultural settings

00:58:11.546 --> 00:58:13.546
to improve human health.

00:58:15.104 --> 00:58:18.998
And this is what it means to
be thinking evolutionarily

00:58:18.998 --> 00:58:22.988
to approach medical condition
challenges of human infants.

00:58:22.988 --> 00:58:24.192
Thank you.

00:58:24.192 --> 00:58:27.275
