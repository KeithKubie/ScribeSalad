00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.020
- In a polarized world, the next installment of the franchise all about balance and non-attachment

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.580
will be worshiped, hated, and obsessed over until it's not even fun to talk about anymore.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.720
- This is not going to go the way you think.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.720
- Meh, we know Star Wars fans by now

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.700
Star Wars: The Last Jedi

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.060
Forget the love letter to the originals that was The Force Awakens,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.400
because Episode 8 subverts everything you've come to expect

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.400
Making it the-

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.820
- WORST one ever

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.260
- Aw, who invited the original Honest Trailer voice back?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.180
Are you really gonna do the old ones are better / new ones are better thing we did with The Force Awakens?

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.620
- The only way to talk about Star Wars now is in absolutes, so yes.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.660
- Kinda Sithy of ya, but fine

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.500
Making Last Jedi a refreshing update to a predictable formula

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.580
- that spits in the face of everything you once loved.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.160
- Whiner!

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.980
- Traitor!

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.940
- Meet the new class of heroes coming into their own

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.240
Like Rey, who after being called by Luke's lightsaber

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.960
is called by the Jedi texts, called by a big wet hole, and called by her greatest fr-enemy

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.000
*both breathing*

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
- Yet still gets zero answers to any of her questions.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.480
- I thought I'd find answers here, I was wrong.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.800
- Po, who grows from a hotshot sexy pilot

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.380
- to a treasonous failure with more blood on his hands than the Empire.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.280
- First Order!

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.400
- Same difference.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.980
- And Finn, who went from a deserter running away from the war

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.740
- to a deserter running away from the war.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.160
- With the help of newcomer Rose, he'll learn to put the greater good above himself

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.220
- Thanks to a pointless side quest to Casino Royale

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.760
- Because how dare they spend 15 minutes connecting the action to a larger theme.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.220
- The larger theme being:

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.860
Is it possible to miss pod racing?

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.500
I didn't think so, but here we are

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.980
- But forget about the butthurt fanboys who were just mad the movie isn't closer to the one they wrote in their heads

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.660
- Hey!

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.280
- Because there's still all the old favorites like Leia, a battle-hardened general trying to keep the spark of hope al-

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.200
- aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand...

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.360
she's in a coma.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.340
- Chewbacca,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.080
- who gets nothing to do.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.680
- And Luke Skywalker

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.560
- Who after sad old Han and sad old Leia really drives home how your heroes are all sad and old now.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.620
- He's turned his back on the franchise after watching the prequels

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.440
- The legacy of the Jedi is failure!

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.780
- And not even reruns of A New Hope can change his mind

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.500
- That was a cheap move.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.200
- Because what Star Wars fans really needed was to see their idol throw his lightsaber away like it was some kind of joke.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.840
And Star Wars is not a joke to me!

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.120
- Yeah I've been meaning to talk to you about-

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.840
- Rian Johnson ruined my childhood like he ruined the laws of space battle.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.540
- There are no laws to space battle!

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.420
- There should be.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.680
- Luke isn't the only Skywalker who has issues with the franchise

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.260
Kylo Ren is back, and he's demanding a full reboot.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.500
- Let the past die.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.600
Kill it if you have to.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.300
- When he doesn't look like he's about to cry, which is always

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.760
- Watch as he ditches The Vader fanboy act, the Mighty Duck Mask, and his shirt

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.460
BEEEEWBS

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.540
- Oooh...

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.160
Hey, you distracted me on purpose!

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.200
- Too late, moving on!

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.400
Get ready for truly unexpected answers to the puzzles of Episode 7

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.620
- that can only be answered by asking

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.840
What are the most disappointing answers to the puzzles of episode 7?

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.260
- Like who are Rey's parents?

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.320
- Nobody.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.980
- Who is Snoke?

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.020
- Some dead guy.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.500
- and how did Maz Kanata get Luke's lightsaber?

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.060
- It doesn't matter and you're stupid for asking.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.160
- That after all the hours of speculation and analysis was genuinely...

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.280
- exhilarating.
- insulting.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.320
- Whoa, how do we keep from a certain point of viewing each other?

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.900
- Yeah, we're both pretty big Star Wars nerds, huh?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.880
- So gear up for the most divisive Star Wars film ever made

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.620
- Where Rian Johnson either doesn't understand the lore,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.100
- or he made the first Star Wars movie that lives up to the values it preaches.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.860
Instead of endorsing royal bloodlines and reckless aggression.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.000
- Okay enough division. Let's say our favorite things about it on the count of three.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.460
- 1, 2, 3

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.460
Rey and Kylo team up to fight the Praetorian Guard

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.100
Puppet Yoda hitting Luke with a stick!

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.120
Porgs!

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.800
- Wait, really?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.020
- Yeah, I'll own it.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.320
- Okay now least favorite

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.860
Holdo not telling anyone her plan!

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.500
- I get knocking Po down a peg but, come on!

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.560
They're taking shuttles to a fort!

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.580
Why make everyone think they're gonna die?

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.840
- I can't argue with that.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.960
Though I'm sure people will.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.660
- Should we do this again for Solo?

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.440
Nah.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.740
- I'm not gonna see that crap

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.740
- Salt.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.160
- Maybe.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.400
It is time for my fandom to end.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.840
- Did you hear JJ finished the script for Episode 9?

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.880
- My fandom is back.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.220
Temporarily.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.380
