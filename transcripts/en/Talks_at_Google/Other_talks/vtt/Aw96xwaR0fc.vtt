BENNY LEWIS: Thank
you very much.

00:00:07.704 --> 00:00:11.496
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.496 --> 00:00:12.750
Hey, everyone.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.110
I want to talk to you
today about a little bit

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.990
of a life of adventure.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.480
I have the same background
many of you have.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.560
I studied electronic
engineering,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.500
right here in UC-D.
And I didn't really

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.000
know what that was
going to lead to.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.550
I just found the one
thing that I was good at.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.920
I was good at maths,
I was good at science,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.810
and I rolled with it.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.040
And I didn't know where
that would take me.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.370
And what happened was I did
just OK in my final exams.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.780
And I kind of felt a
little disappointed.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.740
I didn't want to be
just an OK engineer.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.330
And in the end, my engineering
did come back to help me a lot.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.230
And I want to talk
about how that ties in

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.160
with this whole
Jason Bourne idea.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.660
So after I finished
my engineering degree,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.690
I started world travels.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.200
And I had been
homeless for 13 years.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.470
Everything I owned had to
weigh less than 23 kilograms,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.150
because that's the weight limit.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.450
And I would go to places
for three months at a time,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.270
because that's the
tourist visa limit.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.700
And I would just
keep hopping around.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.260
And as I did-- come on in.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.200
As I was hopping around, I tried
to learn the local language.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.050
I know a lot of people
here have the ability

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.610
to speak multiple languages.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.160
You might have done English
as you were growing up,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.660
if you're from another country.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.110
You might have had an experience
living abroad as an intern,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.560
or done an Erasmus here.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.600
I didn't have that myself.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.130
I barely passed German
for the leaving cert.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.350
I just got like
a low C. And then

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.520
I moved to Spain after
I graduated, lived there

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.430
for six months, and I just
spoke English the whole time.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.479
But something changed
along the way.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.235
I figured out what
I was doing wrong,

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:16.150
and I figured out how I
could hack language learning.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.910
So I'll get to that
in a little bit.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.050
But first I want to get
to the kind of stuff

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.330
that I tried to
do with my career

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.260
to see how I could find
this job that could really

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.510
make a difference, how I could
feel like I am, like, having

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.780
an adventure while I'm working.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.930
So I've had a lot of
different positions

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.690
over the 13 years traveling.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.110
I'm a blogger.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.120
My blog gets a million
unique visitors

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.490
per month, very big blog.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.380
I don't have any background
in English-- writing English,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.350
I should say.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.170
And I manage to do that.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.870
Professional speaker, like now.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.580
If I hold it in the
same hand, like this.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.770
Yeah.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.870
Of course, written a few books.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.480
I wrote these four books over
the last year, had another book

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.980
before that.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.620
I was a professional translator.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.010
This is the first time that I
managed to have a lot of fun

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.970
with engineering,
because for many years,

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.580
I didn't really know what to
do with my engineering degree.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.750
I thought maybe, you know,
it was fun, I studied it,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.910
but it's not going to
tie in with something

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.114
else I might want to do.

00:03:26.114 --> 00:03:27.530
But after I learned
the languages,

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.410
and I did some certificates
in the languages,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.170
it turned out I was in a
unique position, because there

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.600
are very few English-speaking
engineers who

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.040
speak other languages.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.630
It's one reason why they're
so sought after in Google.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.130
You know?

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.330
Obviously, you're going
to bump into a lot

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.310
of multilingual engineers
in this building.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.300
It's not going to happen, as
likely, in other buildings.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.400
So I took that,
and I translated.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.560
I translated technical
documents from French, Spanish,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.620
and Italian to English.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.270
And that was the
first job that let

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.560
me travel the world as a
location-independent worker.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.350
I've also been a consultant.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.650
Those are all recent jobs.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.000
But like I said, I've had
many, many, many jobs.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.790
I was a youth
hostel receptionist.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.060
I was an English teacher,
because you end up

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.640
doing that a lot
while you travel.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.160
I was a maths teacher,
ended up using that.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.950
Worked for Johns
Hopkins University.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.190
This was for what we
lovingly call "nerd camp."

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.570
Happiest place on earth.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.410
You know?

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.660
I loved it.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.470
I got to put some energy into
teaching them about Pythagoras.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.400
I was, like, you know,
saying, "In a world where

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.026
this cult of people who
worshipped triangles,"

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:53.650
and it's great.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.560
It's the kind of
place you can do that.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.910
So I used a lot of
that in my travels.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.260
I got to teach maths.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.250
I got to use
engineering principles.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.360
And of course, I actually
worked as an engineer.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.690
I worked in Paris at a--
this is my gorgeous desk

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.130
with the chaotic
mess all over it,

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.480
where I was translating
software and working

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.830
as a pre-sales engineer.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.612
OK.

00:05:23.612 --> 00:05:24.570
But I'm still not done.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.770
There's so many
other jobs I've had.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.520
My first job, when I was
12, was a FTSE 100 investor,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.490
because I was the
only guy in my town

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.440
who knew how to use a computer.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.739
And someone just wanted to,
like, invest in the FTSE 100,

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:39.530
and he didn't know how
to use the software.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.020
So I stepped up to it.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.650
And I was tech support at
the local computer store.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.170
I had a lot of office jobs.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.580
This thing here?

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.770
That is a laryngeal mask array,
that you put on your larynx

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.930
after surgery.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.260
And the only reason I know
that is because I arranged

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.150
the world's literature
on laryngeal mask

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.240
arrays alphabetically
and chronologically

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.840
over two months.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.360
Yes.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.310
Very, very not fun, that job.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.510
I was a race car controller.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.470
Not in the Mario world.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.330
I wasn't in that universe
of Super Nintendo.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.280
But I was someone
controlling the race cars,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.770
because I used my
engineering background

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.650
to kind of explain that I
could use the equipment better.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.900
And then, nothing to do with
engineering, I ran a yoga shop.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.570
The only reason
I got that job is

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.250
because it was in
California, and they

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.020
found my Irish accent charming.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.570
They found it soothing.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.030
So I didn't even know-- it was
like, a pregnant lady might

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.499
come in and say, which
yoga mat is better for me,

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:42.290
as a pregnant lady?

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.980
And I'd be, like, uh,
well, ah, you know,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.377
as an Irish lad, I would
say, this mat has good zen.

00:06:49.377 --> 00:06:51.210
Not really knowing what
I was talking about.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.810
And it worked.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.600
I was a first aid assistant.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.510
Do a quick first
aid course and you

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.574
can work in, like, these camps,
like the one I was working at.

00:07:00.574 --> 00:07:01.990
And I could actually
help the kids

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.100
when they ran into
medical problems.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.920
OK, so that's kind of just an
overview of the kind of work

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.520
that I've had.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.690
I've met people
who have used a lot

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.370
of their technical abilities
to really get-- like, get out

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.720
there and travel
the world with it.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.060
You could do, like, web
development and coding.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.650
And you could be
an online coach.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.000
You can write, like I've done.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.320
Met people who earn a
living playing poker,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.150
you know, just on these
online forums and stuff.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.440
And there's loads of other
location-independent jobs.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.120
But the big question I always
get is, when you're traveling,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.820
is how you can afford it.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.910
So all those jobs I
mentioned, I didn't

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.130
have those lined up for me
when I arrived somewhere.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.690
I had to actually figure
out how to spend less money.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.060
So, in the whole kind of Jason
Bourne theme, this behind me

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.430
is Palolem Beach.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.185
That's the beach that
Jason Bourne was living in,

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.570
in the second movie.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.209
It was shot there the same
summer that I was living there.

00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:09.250
I didn't even realize it.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.360
This is back when
it was being shot.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.070
And I was-- like,
I was kind of, see,

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.510
I kind of have this
Jason Bourne lifestyle.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.960
And I have three passports.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.980
I managed to hack that one, too.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.140
And this beach?

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.260
Never ran into him.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.230
Wish I did.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:34.590
But this hut here, on
this beach in India,

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:39.679
I got it for about
four euro a night.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:44.020
And the thing that got it
for me was learning how

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.830
to integrate with the culture.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.240
This, for me, is like the
feeling of being a spy,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.450
is I got to try to see
how well I can blend in.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.390
So I traveled India with
an Indian friend of mine.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.430
And he owed me a lot
of favors, because I

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.090
was very active in couchsurfing,
if you guys have ever

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.240
heard of that website.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.370
I've hosted over
2,000 couchsurfers.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.010
I used couchsurfing as a means
to practice languages for free,

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.560
because as I would be living
somewhere for three months,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.270
since I had all
of those jobs, I'd

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:27.610
be able to afford to get
an OK apartment to myself.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.420
But I found that when I
did that, I wasn't actually

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.290
interacting with
a lot of people,

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:37.330
whereas before, when I would
be-- I would have flatmates,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.830
I would be using them
as my circle of friends.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.621
Well, with couchsurfing, I would
just welcome people to my home.

00:09:44.621 --> 00:09:46.620
And I would try to practice
languages with them,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.270
or get to know their culture.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:53.820
And one time in Brazil, I hosted
55 people at the same time,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.280
during the Carnival,
for a whole week.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.090
Very, very long queues for
the bathroom that week.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.100
And that-- those 55
people, one of them

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.940
included Rahul,
my Indian friend.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.550
So years later, when
I met him in India,

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.716
I said, I really want to
get to know the country.

00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:14.340
And he said, I'm not just going
to show you the country, Benny.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.030
I'm going to show you how
to think like an Indian.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.140
So a place like this, if
you were to walk up to it

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.570
and have a white face, they
would say 20 euro a night,

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.760
which actually seems like
a pretty good price, when

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.710
you compare it to what we
would be used to paying.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.590
But my friend, he
said, no, no, no, no.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.850
That's not how it
works in India.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.030
You've got to haggle.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.050
And I say, oh, haggle.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.550
OK.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.000
So if they say 20, I say 10,
and we meet in the middle.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.200
And he's like, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.650
That's not how it works.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.401
The way it works, if
you're ever in India,

00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:52.650
and you want to haggle a
price-- and this has actually

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.180
worked for me around the world.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.560
It's a very good
psychological technique.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.720
You never mention
the price yourself.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.420
You just mention the
reasons it should go down.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.730
So I walked up to this place.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.760
The lady was ready
to share it with us.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.360
And I said, oh,
how much is this?

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.470
And she said, the equivalent
in rupees of about 20 euro.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.614
And I was like, 20 euro?

00:11:15.614 --> 00:11:16.280
No, no, it's OK.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.960
And I started walking away,
like, just disappointed.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.650
And then she said,
OK, OK, OK, OK.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.210
15 euro.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:28.430
And I looked over my shoulder,
and I was like, I don't know.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.132
It's, like, right on the beach.

00:11:30.132 --> 00:11:31.590
How am I supposed
to sleep at night

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.070
with all the waves crashing?

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:34.690
You know?

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.552
I don't think so.

00:11:36.552 --> 00:11:37.260
I don't think so.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.360
And I started
walking away again.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.200
And she said, OK, OK.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:39.720
10 euro.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.700
10 euro.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.500
And still I wasn't
looking at her and, like,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.340
warmly showing, yeah, yeah, I'm
definitely going to get this.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.260
You've got to be
obnoxiously uninterested.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.300
So it's, like, looking
over my shoulder

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.490
like the place was, like,
smelling bad-- looking at it,

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:02.100
thinking, but isn't
it facing the sun?

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.230
How am I supposed to read
a book on this balcony

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.430
with the sun in my eyes?

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.700
And she's like, ugh, OK, fine.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.710
And keep in mind,
this is the sun

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.610
setting over a beautiful
landscape, you know,

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.670
with a gorgeous, like, view
of an island and everything.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.290
But I reframed it.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.980
And I kept giving
more and more reasons.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.340
I was like, yeah, how's the AC?

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.940
Does it have, like,
various settings?

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.934
And she was like,
there's just a fun.

00:12:26.934 --> 00:12:27.850
It's like, just a fan?

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.980
OK, no way.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.390
And then eventually I got
it down to the three or four

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.860
euro that it was.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.670
So a lot of what
I've tried to do

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.950
to get the price
of everything lower

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.590
is to try to understand
the local culture,

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.650
try to integrate better.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.260
And this has given me
that Jason Bourne sense

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.850
of being a spy, that
I'm almost going

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.100
to be mistaken for a local.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.840
It's not going to
happen in India,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.690
but what my goal has been in
countries like India and China,

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.330
is be mistaken for
somebody who's lived there

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.170
for a very long time.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.590
And then they're less likely
to take advantage of you.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:11.160
So in Egypt, for instance, I
wanted to get better prices.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.210
So the first thing I did was
try to learn a little bit

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.500
of Egyptian Arabic in advance.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.210
And whenever people think
about learning a language,

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:24.500
they think the best thing to
do is to go to the location.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.730
Fly to the country.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.015
And I didn't find this
worked for me, because

00:13:29.015 --> 00:13:32.160
in-- when I got to Spain
first, I got off the plane,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.800
and I just imagined, in my
head, I'm in the country.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.590
So I'm just going to
automatically learn

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:38.710
the language.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:45.380
I'm going to inhale Spanish
air and exhale espanol.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.862
But that didn't happen,
because I gravitated

00:13:47.862 --> 00:13:49.070
towards the English speakers.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:53.660
So I've skipped all of that,
and what I do now, that I feel

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:59.140
is a lot more useful, is
I learn via the internet.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.410
I find someone and Google
Hangout, or I Skype them,

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.810
or I text them, WhatsApp,
or whatever I can do.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.320
And I get in touch, and
we practice that way.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.540
I have a certain
virtual immersion.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.890
This, for me, has
been a game changer,

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.850
because it means I put the time
into learning the language.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.387
But then when I get to the
country, I'm not in language

00:14:20.387 --> 00:14:20.970
learning mode.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.510
I'm in culture learning mode.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.520
So in Egypt, for instance,
when I first arrived,

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.010
I had some basic
Egyptian Arabic, enough

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.860
to get some conversations.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.320
And they still spoke
back to me in English.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.904
And I was like,
ugh, I don't get it.

00:14:35.904 --> 00:14:36.570
What's going on?

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.020
I put all this work in.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.570
But then I tried
something different.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.640
I sat down in a
cafe, pen and paper,

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.800
and I started making notes of
how Egyptian men around my age

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.220
were different to me.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.410
And maybe I wasn't
showing the culture enough

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.930
of a-- enough respect.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.770
I wasn't trying to integrate.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.630
And I actually noticed
a lot of things.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.030
I noticed that they groom
themselves differently.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.097
I needed to grow
out, like, a beard.

00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:04.180
Didn't do a very good job.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.270
My Facebook friends
called it a porn 'tache.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:06.820
You know?

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.190
But I got somewhere.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.870
I was trying.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.984
And I would wear, like,
t-shirts, shorts, cap.

00:15:12.984 --> 00:15:14.650
And they don't dress
like that in Egypt.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.640
So I tried to
integrate everything,

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.250
and I even learned how
to walk like an Egyptian.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.830
And it's not this.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.219
If you've ever played
the old game "Frogger,"

00:15:25.219 --> 00:15:27.510
where you got to, like, hop
across the road, like this,

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.440
and go between the cars, that's
kind of what life in Egypt--

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.150
in Cairo, especially-- is like.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.775
You have eight lanes of traffic,
never a pedestrian crossing.

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:39.650
So if you ever want to
walk like an Egyptian,

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.120
just, like, grab your phone,
and just kind of stroll

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.800
across like this.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.830
And the cars will
swerve around you.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.220
And everyone will think
that Egyptian guy,

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.340
he knows what he's doing.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.790
You know?

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.820
And after I did that,
whenever I tried

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:03.190
to find accommodation or
haggle the price of something,

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.170
it changed a lot.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.060
Wasn't just speaking
the language,

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.840
it was speaking the culture.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.457
And that gets prices
down dramatically.

00:16:11.457 --> 00:16:13.290
So that's kind of
something to keep in mind.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.380
If you wanted to travel,
you don't actually

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.810
have to have wads
of cash for it.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:22.920
You just have to try to get to
know how people do it locally.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.480
But the way you use the wads
of cash does make a difference.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.540
It's all about mentality.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.470
So I do have to
admit, it's true.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.370
I'm a millionaire.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.650
Let's get that out there.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.150
This is proof.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:42.610
This is me holding one
million Indonesian rupiah,

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.550
which is about 80 euro.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:49.400
So the lifestyle you lead makes
you feel like a millionaire

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:55.820
sometimes, even if you're just
an Indonesian millionaire.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.390
So I try to see, how
can I hack those things?

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.770
How can I try to get things
that would not necessarily

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.470
be that expensive, but
still feel expensive?

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.599
And for that, I would try to
get the right connections.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:15.270
So I tried to learn to
be more outgoing, which

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.089
was hard for me.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:18.790
I was a very shy person.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.270
Growing up, in
university, I just--

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:27.069
I became the best player of
Snake for the Nokia phone,

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:29.580
because every time I
go out to socialize,

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.740
I'd, like, pretend like
I'm texting, you know,

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.830
my thousands of
friends that I'm, like,

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.910
so busy texting all the
time, when I was just playing

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.280
that game on the phone,
because I just-- I

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.640
couldn't approach people.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.140
I was so scared of
what they would think.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.120
But I found that just letting
go of that a little bit,

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.950
and trying to get to
know a lot of people,

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.070
has given me a
lot of connections

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.300
to get to do a lot of
things that I always thought

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.170
only millionaires could do.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.840
So whenever people
would ask me, you know,

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.710
how can I do that,
if I'm shy, you know?

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.110
And the best example
I can think of that I

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.170
was able to change
this for somebody

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.130
was while I was learning
German in Berlin,

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.580
one of my methods of
learning the language is

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.960
to speak only in that language.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.810
Sticking to that-- of never
switching to English while I'm

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.630
in the several hours time
I'm using the language.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.790
So I met a German lady, and
she wanted to practice English.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.702
And she was introduced to
me by some friends of hers.

00:18:34.702 --> 00:18:36.410
And she never would
have walked up to me,

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.420
because she told me,
the first thing she said

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.842
is that she's very shy.

00:18:39.842 --> 00:18:41.300
And she wanted to
practice English,

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.750
but I was in German mode.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.000
So I still wanted to help her.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.320
I wanted to give
her some advice,

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.950
and there were some
Americans in the same event,

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.579
so I wanted to make sure
she could talk to them.

00:18:51.579 --> 00:18:53.120
And I said, yeah,
those guys there, I

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.244
was talking to them before.

00:18:54.244 --> 00:18:55.250
They're very friendly.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.680
You should go say hi.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.810
And she said, I can't do that.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.776
I'm too shy.

00:19:00.776 --> 00:19:03.890
And I didn't want to just,
like, do the work for her.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.844
I wanted to help her
get over this shyness.

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:07.260
So I tried to think
to myself, how

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.880
can I show this lady how she can
do it, so that when I'm gone,

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.740
she'll be able to
approach people and expand

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.510
her social circle to
learn English better?

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.180
And then I had an idea.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.850
So she was holding a glass
of something, some drink.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:27.120
And I said, do you know how
blood flow to your brain

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.760
makes you smarter?

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.790
And she was like, but
that doesn't sound right.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.350
I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.850
Trust me.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:34.600
Trust me.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.290
And like, if you were
to raise your arm,

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:40.190
for instance, then more blood
goes down, up into your brain,

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.050
and you will be smarter.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.595
And this whole time, like,
she was very, very confused,

00:19:46.595 --> 00:19:48.720
and wondering, you know,
this guy is kind of weird.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.510
What's he talking about?

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.430
But what she didn't
know is we were

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.060
kind of moving in a
particular direction.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.450
So I was moving her towards
those two American guys,

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.680
and completely distracting her
with this nonsense about blood

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.400
and hands and stuff.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.070
And then, at the right moment,
when we were close enough,

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.550
and I was moving
her arm up and down,

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:17.720
I clinked her glass against
theirs, and I ran away.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.500
Then, one hour later,
she came up to me

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.710
and she said she had
the best night ever.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.940
She got to talk to these guys.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.310
She found out they live
in the same neighborhood.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.580
They're going to be hanging
out all weekend long.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.670
And she made all of
these connections.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:39.190
And what she realized was that
the shyness she was feeling

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.160
was mostly a lot of
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.880
She was telling herself,
if I go up to them,

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.650
they're going to laugh
at me for trying.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.060
They're going to think
my English is bad.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.050
They're going to think
my pronunciation is off.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.910
They're going to think I'm
not an interesting person.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.580
But what I did is I took
all of that away from her.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:02.050
I took the ability to
talk herself out of it.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.380
I took it away.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.920
And by just presenting the
moment, she just said hello.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.930
And it went from there.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.590
And that's the kind
of thing that I

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:16.760
do when I want to expand
my network, to expand

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.170
my opportunities to have
that different lifestyle.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.030
I see somebody that I
would like to talk to,

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.270
and I don't start an
inner dialogue of, OK,

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.935
what's a clever way to start a
conversation with that person?

00:21:28.935 --> 00:21:31.370
No, if I say that, they're
going to think I'm an idiot.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.210
And I wouldn't think that.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.180
I'd just see someone, hello.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.180
So try to think of that.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.780
If you want to, like,
get out of your shell,

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.870
and you want to, you know,
experience different things,

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.640
and you see an opportunity,
grab it immediately.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.950
Do not even think for a second.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:53.030
That is going to lead
to so many more things.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.870
It might lead to
some embarrassment.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:56.560
You might make a
couple of mistakes.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.600
But my whole lifestyle,
especially thanks to language

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.100
learning, is I
have a goal to make

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.002
at least 200 mistakes a day.

00:22:05.002 --> 00:22:06.460
And when you go up
to somebody, you

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.480
try to talk to them, most
of the time, it's fine.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.750
Everything works out great.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.060
And sometimes they
kind of are confused,

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.330
why do you talk to them?

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.610
Then you just be
like, OK, great.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.210
That's one of my mistakes
ticked off the list.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.990
And it helps a lot
when you do that

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.690
with so many aspects of life.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.770
OK, and then of
course, it helps you

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.510
to feel like you get
to live a lot richer.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.350
I've-- the kind of
people I've met,

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.640
they've given me these kind
of different opportunities.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.350
When I went to
Japan, for instance,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:43.500
I tried to build a relationship
with my Airbnb host.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.960
You know, I was
emailing him in advance.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.590
But then we arrived, and the
keys were not left out for me.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.935
And I was tired,
exhausted from jet lag.

00:22:51.935 --> 00:22:54.990
And kind of sitting outside, I
couldn't get in touch with him.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.766
And I was starting
to get frustrated.

00:22:56.766 --> 00:22:59.140
And I kind of knocked on the
neighbor's door, and I said,

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.556
is there any chance
you guys would

00:23:00.556 --> 00:23:02.680
have a key to this apartment?

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:08.220
And it turned out that it's kind
of illegal to do Airbnb hosting

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.730
in the building he was at.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.110
So the police were called.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:15.280
They came in, and they wanted
to take a statement from me.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.970
And they weren't--
I wasn't in trouble.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.020
They were trying to
protect-- because they

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.500
were very protective of
the tourism industry.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.610
They didn't want foreigners
to be taken advantage of.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:29.550
But they were like, did you
pay him money to stay here?

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.750
And I kind of--
that was the moment

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.490
when suddenly I forgot
all the Japanese

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:34.531
that I had been learning.

00:23:34.531 --> 00:23:35.650
And I was like, what?

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:36.770
Sorry, no.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.910
I just, like, forgot it all.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.610
I had spoken Japanese
up to that moment,

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.370
and somehow it just
disappeared from my head.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.950
And so I wasn't able to take a
very solid statement with them.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.010
And I called this guy the
next day, thinking, you know,

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.992
I put myself out there for you.

00:23:54.992 --> 00:23:57.750
You did not give me
this accommodation

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.260
for this tiny little
room that I wanted.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.990
And he was so appreciative
that I tried to help him,

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.340
he put me up in a
penthouse apartment

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:12.900
with a 270-degree
panoramic view of Kyoto.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.000
And I was there for
a week and a half.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.550
And that was from paying
the same amount for, like,

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:22.080
a tiny little shoe box, like,
hidden away in a small street.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.860
So a lot of the time,
I make my travels

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.080
about building these
relationships-- trying

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.450
to do people favors,
if I can, and then

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.850
to see how that
comes back to me.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.020
Another way that
you can make sure

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:40.710
that it doesn't cost you as much
is to not make it about stuff,

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.860
owning things.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.620
This, for instance, is
something I used to own.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.010
This is my bat'leth you
know, for my project speaking

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.980
Klingon.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.190
I actually did attend
the Star Trek convention.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:57.740
I got to meet Leonard
Nimoy, the late and great.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:01.780
And I use this picture because I
actually had to buy a bat'leth.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.900
This is very sharp.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.332
You can't travel with it.

00:25:05.332 --> 00:25:07.540
And it was interesting for
me, because it was so big,

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.498
and I was just looking
at it, thinking, there's

00:25:09.498 --> 00:25:10.900
no way this will fit in my bag.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.950
And I don't tend to
get a lot of stuff.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.320
And that helps me
feel more free.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.430
I've found that when
people tie themselves

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:24.000
down with the furniture
and the plants they have

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.540
to water and the pets
they have to feed,

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.490
you do a lot of
these things, you'll

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.700
find you don't have the
same kind of freedom

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.620
to maybe move to a different
place in the same city,

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.920
or to go off on an
adventure for a week,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.491
because you'll be thinking, ooh,
well, who's going to feed Fido?

00:25:40.491 --> 00:25:41.570
You know?

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.710
So apart from a bat'leth,
which I sold a week later--

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:50.110
so I only kind of rented it, in
a way-- I try to not own stuff.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.550
OK.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.690
And then, of course,
there's the whole,

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.320
how can you travel practically?

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.560
So I wanted to just
give you some websites

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.780
very quickly here.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.760
You want to get cheaper flights?

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.230
Use these meta search engines.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.771
I'm sure you would have heard
of them, like Skyscanner and so

00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:06.680
on.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.650
Here's two other ones,
Adioso-- I like this one,

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.780
because it kind of uses
natural English, you know?

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.350
And Google Flights,
obviously, is

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:20.529
taking a lot of, like, better
traffic away from these sites.

00:26:20.529 --> 00:26:22.820
I've found a lot of better
flights come up on that now.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.000
And even Flightfox-- I
don't know if you guys have

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.750
heard of that one.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:30.460
That's, like, a service
that you can pay somebody

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.410
to try to research all of
the flight options for you.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.720
And, like, I have gotten
the most amazing, like,

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.180
business class around the
world from some weird offer

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.090
that only some experts
know, and I got

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.590
that for, like, the extra $49.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.655
So there's a lot of
tricks like that,

00:26:47.655 --> 00:26:52.060
that you can try to feel like
you're always flying business

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.150
class, or whatever.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.830
OK, so last thing to
talk about very quickly--

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.860
and then I want to hear
any of your questions

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:03.437
about travel and working and
language learning and so on--

00:27:03.437 --> 00:27:04.770
is the language learning aspect.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.880
So when I try to learn a
language, I try to see,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.670
how can I learn this
like an engineer?

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:16.780
And I feel like that has been
the biggest advantage that I've

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.970
had, my engineering background,
in language learning.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.634
Because a lot of
people I've met,

00:27:22.634 --> 00:27:24.050
when they try to
get into learning

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.420
a language as an
adult, have too much

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.360
of a perfectionist
attitude to it.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.760
They feel like they
can't speak unless they

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.520
don't make any mistakes.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.330
Now, the problem with
that is a language

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.060
is a means of communication
between people.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.949
It's not about being perfect.

00:27:40.949 --> 00:27:42.490
It's about getting
your point across.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.500
And I always tell people
that the first moment

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.220
I realized I could speak
another language was in Spain.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.920
When I was just two
weeks into my project

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.090
of trying to speak just Spanish,
my electric toothbrush broke.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:57.590
And I was furious.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.490
I couldn't afford the
10 euro I spent on this.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:05.550
So I stormed down to the
supermarket to demand a refund.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.650
I found the manager,
and I said--

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.710
I don't know how to say
"toothbrush" in Spanish.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.920
Or "broken."

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.650
Or "refund."

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.420
So I didn't actually-- I
wasn't actually able to express

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.330
all those things.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.590
But something happened
in that moment.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:28.350
Just the fact that, like I said
before, I wasn't overanalyzing.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.230
I wasn't thinking
about it too much.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:33.360
In that moment, I realized,
I should just do what I can.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.510
I wanted to achieve this thing.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.030
So I said [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.000
Tooth machine bad!

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.970
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Money return trip!

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:53.260
And you know what?

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.260
It worked.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.550
I got my money back.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.680
And, like, even with that
abysmal Tarzan Spanish,

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.210
I was able to achieve something.

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:07.140
And this is what I've learned
in terms of language hacking,

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.340
is that I try to just achieve
the goal of communication.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.430
And as a beginner,
that's what I try to do.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.100
Not perfectionism.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.330
And the reason that this
ties into the engineering

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.790
is because from the
first jobs I've had,

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.590
we as engineers have
a ship-it mentality.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.812
If you're making software,
you have a deadline.

00:29:26.812 --> 00:29:28.520
And by the time that
deadline is reached,

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.880
and you wrap up the
code, and it's ready.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.490
And the same with
if you're building

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.350
a device, building
the next Nexus,

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.690
you have to finish it by a date.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.370
But on that date, you
know there might be still

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:43.750
things you can improve.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.400
Maybe the latest
chip just came out,

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.810
and you could technically
kind of try to put it in.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:52.767
Or maybe you didn't realize if
there was a part of the code

00:29:52.767 --> 00:29:55.100
that you could try to analyze
to make sure you could get

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.170
the lines down by just
a couple, you know,

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.390
because it always helps just
the speed ever so slightly.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.360
But we don't do that.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.330
In engineering,
we try to ship it.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.610
You just get
something done so it's

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:11.360
very good, but not perfect.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.275
We have thermodynamics
and mechanical engineering

00:30:14.275 --> 00:30:15.400
and structural engineering.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.720
You lose things that way.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.830
Perfectionism can't be the goal.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.340
Mistakes are inevitable.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.910
So just let them happen.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.410
And that's what I
do with languages.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:30.060
I try to have a deadline, get
what I can done before then,

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.420
and reach a
particular milestone,

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:36.180
and be happy with that, rather
than aiming for perfectionism,

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.000
because that's impossible.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.890
There's nobody in this room who
speaks any language perfectly,

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.120
including me and English,
as a native speaker.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.360
There are always things I'm
learning, always new words.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.480
Like, I made the dumbest
mistake a few months ago,

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.020
when my partner and
I were hanging out,

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.700
and I said something
like, I love you, hubby.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.020
And she said, do you know
what that word means?

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.690
And I was like, yeah, yeah,
it's a term of endearment.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:08.000
And she said, yeah, for husband.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.610
You just called me your husband.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.940
And I was like, oh, OK.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.080
So I'm still learning English.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.820
So if you keep that in
mind, you will never

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.400
reach a stage of
perfectionism, but maybe you

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.030
can reach those milestones.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.540
And this, for me, is what I've
taken away from my engineering,

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.620
especially, as I
apply it to languages.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.780
I try to have a
systematic approach,

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.120
try to get the best
shortcuts, reach a goal,

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:38.420
and then start a new project,
for the language 2.0.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.170
So that's a little bit of
what I wanted to talk about.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:44.090
And I want to make sure I
get to any of your questions.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.650
So let me know if there's
anything on your mind.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:54.661
One here.

00:31:59.275 --> 00:32:00.649
AUDIENCE: For me,
personally, one

00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:05.266
of the concerns when I'm
about to [INAUDIBLE] somebody

00:32:05.266 --> 00:32:09.154
somewhere is that they
will be afraid of me,

00:32:09.154 --> 00:32:12.080
because I'm kind
of tall [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.938
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:13.938 --> 00:32:16.270
I don't mean to be threatening,
but I just sometimes

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:20.198
just notice this kind of look,
when, you know, I say hi.

00:32:20.198 --> 00:32:22.182
And they're like, ooh.

00:32:22.182 --> 00:32:24.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:28.554
Did you ever get that, and
how would you deal with this?

00:32:28.554 --> 00:32:29.470
BENNY LEWIS: Yeah, no.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.830
I have-- believe it
or not, I've found

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:34.610
that even when
I'm not trying to,

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.760
I have come across as
threatening in some cultures.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.280
And when I was living
in Taiwan, for instance,

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.310
I found that I was
kind of-- people

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.720
were kind of keeping
their distance from me.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.330
But then I realized a lot
of it was my body language.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.650
So it might not be
that you're tall.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.880
It might be that you're
walking confidently, you know?

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.630
And maybe in these
countries, you actually

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.250
walk a little bit meekly.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:02.100
And you kind of say, excuse me.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.040
You know?

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.117
It depends on where you are.

00:33:05.117 --> 00:33:06.450
But then it could be your voice.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.470
Maybe you have a
very deep voice.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:12.240
And you might try to
soften it a little bit.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.440
Maybe it's your
facial expression.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.300
I've found in some
places that I actually--

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.920
if I raised my eyebrows--
and this is things

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.030
that I've actually sat down and
tried to statistically analyze.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.830
I've been like,
OK, how many guys

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.880
have their eyebrows up here?

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.520
OK.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.650
Yeah, Tuesday was a good 73%.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:33.790
OK, interesting.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.870
You try to see that information.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:36.830
You might be surprised.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.500
Another thing,
before you travel,

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:45.080
is try to watch some online
streamed television, you know?

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.070
Maybe watch some telenovelas
from South America,

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:53.090
or see if you can watch some,
like, news shows from Italy.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:54.510
Whatever country
you're in, you'll

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.530
find maybe you have to
actually be more outgoing,

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.510
be more confident.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.480
And to this day,
I remember those--

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.990
while I was studying for
a C2 exam in Spanish,

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:09.500
one of the guys I was
studying with was Swedish,

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.949
and his Spanish was
way better than mine.

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:14.850
He knew the most obscure words.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.989
His accent, he sounded
like a radio announcer.

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.730
If you closed your eyes, you
would think he's Spanish.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:24.580
And yet, all the Spanish people
I hung out with, they said they

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.760
kind of feel weird around him.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.699
And it's because he kind of
walked around with-- like this.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.300
His eyes were open very widely.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:37.150
And he had a very, like, stiff
way of talking to people,

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.239
whereas me, with a
more noticeable accent,

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:44.520
I was kind of like,
hey, [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.980
And people actually--
they liked that.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.719
They liked the
more relaxed style.

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:50.820
So it depends.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.330
It depends on
where you're going.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:53.705
But try to think
of those things.

00:34:53.705 --> 00:34:57.550
Don't think of-- because maybe
if it is in part the fact

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.770
that you're tall, well,
you can't change that.

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:00.500
So who cares?

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.130
Just-- that's out
of the picture.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:03.330
What can you change?

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:05.420
Let's try to look into that.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.340
OK?

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.435
Yeah.

00:35:07.435 --> 00:35:09.520
And I think you were next.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.201
Yeah, sorry.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.057
Oh.

00:35:14.057 --> 00:35:14.556
Sorry.

00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:19.860
AUDIENCE: I don't
even need the mic.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.620
I have a smattering of, like,
Spanish, French, German,

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.120
you know, little
bits of everything.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.790
I'll always say I can never go
hungry or thirsty in a country.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.600
But every time I'm in
Germany, I can speak Spanish.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.610
When I'm in Spain,
I can speak German.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:37.070
So how do you prepare
your mind for the country

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.910
that you're actually going to?

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.069
Is there a trick?

00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.860
Is there a little--

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.050
BENNY LEWIS: Yeah, like,
for me, the projects

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.020
I've tried to just
go to the country

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.220
and, like, jump
into the language,

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:53.440
it's been very difficult. I've
found that, yeah, my brain is,

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.920
like, in the wrong language.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.090
So you have to hit
the ground running.

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.830
So before going, I
would get online.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:01.240
I would try to talk to people.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.190
So one of my favorite
resources is a website iTalki--

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.170
I-T-A-L-K-I-- dot com.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.530
We actually integrated them into
the language hacking courses

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:11.840
that we've been working on.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.760
And this is an online community
of people that you can Skype.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.660
And you can, like, talk to
and whatever until you want.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.960
And you can have
a free exchange,

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.280
doesn't cost you a penny.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.630
If you do 20 minutes
in their language,

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.330
20 minutes in English.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.050
Or you can get teachers
who are actually

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.730
very affordable because they
live in cheaper countries.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.940
So what I would do
before going to a country

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:37.531
is get consistent practice
for weeks ahead of it.

00:36:37.531 --> 00:36:38.030
You know?

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.310
I would not leave it
to the last minute,

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:43.120
and then on the plane
over, I'd be like, oh, how

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.700
do I say "I'm hungry" again?

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.260
And, like, try to cram it.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.900
Because it's too much pressure.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.780
And the whole thing
for me, especially,

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.167
is you need momentum.

00:36:53.167 --> 00:36:55.000
So I would try to get
them up to that level.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.420
And then another thing is if
you have multiple languages,

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.334
the best thing
I've found to have

00:37:00.334 --> 00:37:02.000
a solid enough level
that you don't even

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.220
need to worry about that.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.230
Like, you can still take
a break of a few months

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.790
and be able to switch
back into speaking it,

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.200
is to focus on
learning one language

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.690
till you get it to
a very good level.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.790
Because I've never
had success in trying

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:19.280
to learn multiple languages at
the same time at low levels.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.740
So my whole process has been,
like, a three-month project

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.480
where I am intensively
studying this language

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.160
to see how high I can get it.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.490
If I'm lucky, I'll get it to,
like, a lower intermediate,

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:33.370
or B1 as they call them on
the European common framework,

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:36.260
or sometimes even a B2.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.640
I wouldn't aim for the higher
ones in a shorter time,

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.300
but I'd get to that stage
where I'm effectively

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:45.250
fluent in social situations.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.850
But when I get to
that stage, I feel

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:50.840
like I've built a very strong
wall around the language

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.780
in my mind, so it's less
likely to kind of leak

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.610
into the other languages.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.110
So my whole process is
learn each language up

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:03.050
to that B2, like,
solid level, and then

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:04.300
maybe start the next language.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.330
And it's OK if I take a break.

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:09.330
Because having a bunch of
languages at a lower level,

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.370
it's very, very hard
to distinguish them.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.240
They're going to
influence each other.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.970
But if you can build that
wall, that's a lot better.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:16.490
Yeah.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:19.199
And if you want to jump
in with your question.

00:38:19.199 --> 00:38:20.032
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:20.032 --> 00:38:23.294
I just wanted to
know whether you

00:38:23.294 --> 00:38:25.630
think that this "fluent
in three months"

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:29.205
process would work in
the same way [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:29.205 --> 00:38:30.205
BENNY LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:38:30.205 --> 00:38:31.540
Whoops.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:35.520
So firstly, my whole
philosophy, like, the blog,

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:40.080
"Fluent In Three Months,"
that's based off specificity,

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.580
because I found
when I first started

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.960
to try to learn Spanish,
didn't have any end goals.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.140
I just wanted to learn Spanish.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.660
And my blog, as you can
imagine, gets a big spike

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.914
in traffic on January
1, from everyone saying,

00:38:52.914 --> 00:38:53.830
New Year's resolution!

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.410
I want to learn Italian.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.400
And I don't think
that's a very good idea.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.900
I think the specifics
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.960
So maybe people get
to know those levels,

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.330
and maybe they want
to aim for a B1 or B2,

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.530
in three months or six
months or whatever.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.040
So that's, like, what
my strategy would be.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.900
Before, the whole
process for me,

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.590
to get to at least basic
conversation level,

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:17.430
is speak from day one.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:19.260
And only speak.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.310
The whole reading and
writing and, like,

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:26.420
tidying up your grammar, that I
think is-- for a lot of people,

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.610
it's not useful as a beginner.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:31.720
It is useful later.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.505
So you can reach the stage
where your conversation

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:38.480
in the language without having
to worry about reading it.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.940
And in fact, some methods
that I've found online

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.020
intentionally get
people to not read,

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.810
because you have a
big advantage there

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:50.020
of not getting influenced
by English spelling.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.200
So if anything, you
should take that

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.084
as seeing what kind of
strengths would that give you,

00:39:55.084 --> 00:39:56.500
because you can
avoid all of that.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:00.979
There are loads of listening
to's, and if you just focus

00:40:00.979 --> 00:40:02.520
on the sounds of
the language, rather

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.040
than trying to associate
spelling and so on,

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.887
you don't have to learn how
to read and write initially.

00:40:07.887 --> 00:40:09.220
You might want to do that later.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.261
And then maybe later you'll
decide you don't even

00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:13.480
want to, if the only
thing you care about

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.440
is speaking the language.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.280
So I always try to see that.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.620
And I would only try to,
like, improve my reading

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.740
and writing much later on.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.160
So you might want to
decide, you don't even

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.370
want to do that in a language.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.520
OK?

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.590
And back here?

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.795
OK.

00:40:33.795 --> 00:40:36.282
AUDIENCE: How do you
handle comprehension?

00:40:36.282 --> 00:40:36.990
BENNY LEWIS: Yes.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:39.060
Very good question,
because when you're

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.660
speaking to somebody
in a language,

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.110
then they might
speak back to you.

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:47.195
And you will hear
blah blah blah.

00:40:47.195 --> 00:40:49.930
So I think, again,
the perfectionist way

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:55.286
of looking at that is, that
was a large bunch of noise

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:56.970
that I don't understand.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:59.070
So I give up.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.350
But what I try to do
is a couple of things.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.850
Like, once, for
instance, the TEDx

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:05.950
picture I showed up,
that was in Warsaw.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:10.010
And I gave myself, like,
just a couple of hours,

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.820
like literally an hour and
a half, to learn Polish.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.675
And after that, I got on Skype.

00:41:15.675 --> 00:41:17.550
And I was like, I'm
going to Skype in Polish.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:20.470
I'm going to not
speak any English.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:24.050
And of course, pretty
much everything

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:28.290
that was said back to
me was gobbledygook.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:31.330
So I still managed to
have a conversation.

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:35.260
I hacked that conversation,
because if you're doing it on,

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.350
like, an online voice call,
then you just text them.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:41.280
Or, like, text-type them.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.210
So what I would do is, I would
look up what I wanted to say,

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:48.230
and, like, Tarzan
connect it all up.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.760
I'm sure it was, like,
a horrible sentence.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.090
But I would say something
like the equivalent of,

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:55.560
me Benny, me Ireland.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.146
And they'd say, blah blah blah.

00:41:57.146 --> 00:41:57.770
And I'd be, OK.

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:58.270
OK.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.190
And I type, I'm sorry,
could you type that?

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.190
And then they'd type it.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.860
And I would copy and paste
it into Google Translate,

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.560
see what the-- effectively
what they're saying,

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.480
and then be like, OK.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:08.890
All right.

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:11.306
And then I would, like, try
to come up with my reply using

00:42:11.306 --> 00:42:12.400
some dictionaries.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.330
And so I kind of
cheated that way.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:16.370
And that got me the
initial momentum.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:17.970
So that's one way
to do it online.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:23.140
But then in person, you have
to let go of the perfectionism.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:29.430
So instead, I would think of
it as a guesstimation process.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:32.220
So I wrote my
undergraduate thesis

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.160
in Trellis code modulation.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:41.200
This is a style of encoding we
have in telephone calls that

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.020
decides that some information
is going to be lost,

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.230
because no system is perfect.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.784
So I imagine language learning
to be a little bit like that.

00:42:49.784 --> 00:42:50.450
So imagine this.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:52.730
Imagine you are having
a telephone call

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:55.350
with somebody in
English, and it was

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:57.610
very-- it was a very bad line.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.730
And all you heard was
[WHOOSHING NOISE] dinner

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:03.720
[WHOOSH] Friday [WHOOSH].

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:08.410
So you could decide, didn't
understand that at all.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:09.766
Like, pointless.

00:43:09.766 --> 00:43:12.140
You'll just have to tell them
to start over, or say look,

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.430
we'll just text each other.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:14.971
But there's another
thing you can do.

00:43:14.971 --> 00:43:16.020
You can guess.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:20.410
You know, it's probable that
they're saying something like,

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.500
would you like to go out
for dinner on Friday?

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.890
It's likely.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.000
It's less likely that
they're going to say,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.960
the alien invasion
begins on Friday,

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.065
and you are going
to be their dinner.

00:43:33.065 --> 00:43:33.720
You know?

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.257
So you think to yourself,
in terms of probability,

00:43:36.257 --> 00:43:37.590
it's likely they're saying that.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:39.440
So when I'm learning
another language,

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.760
I'll hear this stream of noise,
that there's no possible way I

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.440
can give a good translation of.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:50.730
But maybe there's one
word that I try to catch.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.120
So I never think to
myself-- as they're

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.120
speaking, I'm not thinking,
how can I understand

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.240
this entire sentence?

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:01.790
I'm thinking, can I catch
a single word out of that?

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:04.450
And maybe they will
say the single word

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.350
that I happen to understand.

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:08.830
And if I don't, then
I'll try to say,

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:12.360
could you say that again,
using different words, please?

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.780
And they may in fact
actually say the word

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.170
that I need to guess.

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.670
And sometimes, when you
guess, you'll guess wrong.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:22.770
And the earth has never opened
up and swallowed me whole

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:24.340
when that happens.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.650
I just-- they see
I'm misunderstanding

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:28.390
and we work around it.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:31.030
So in terms of comprehension,
you could do that.

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:32.690
And then final
little trick I'd say

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:39.161
is I would listen to
slowly spoken-out language.

00:44:39.161 --> 00:44:42.110
And there's, like, a
lot of online podcast

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:43.690
series that do this very well.

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:47.720
So what they do is they start
by giving a 15-second exchange,

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.160
like maybe just buying
something and saying, that costs

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.700
that much, thank you.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.160
And they spend 15
minutes explaining that,

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.190
explaining each word.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.650
And you start with that, and
then you push yourself up.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.910
And they're like-- they actually
follow the European framework.

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:03.990
And you get to the A2
level, and maybe they

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:06.020
have a 30-second
exchange, and they only

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.060
explain the hardest parts.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:12.950
So pushing yourself up
in notches helps a lot.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:17.140
When I first moved to Spain,
and they spoke this machine gun

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:21.300
Spanish at me, it was
impossible for me to understand.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:26.260
But I found that if I had these
kind of slower conversations,

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.150
I started to speak with
other learners, not just

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:30.160
native speakers.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.050
I learned most of my Spanish
from Erasmus students,

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:36.030
from French and German and
Italian students, because they

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:37.840
would speak slowly to me.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.540
And that didn't mean I
was going to speak slowly

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:41.720
for the rest of my life.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.580
It meant I got that initial
momentum to work my way up,

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:48.070
to eventually be able
to have more confident,

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:49.760
fast conversations.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.021
So a few different
suggestions for you there.

00:45:53.021 --> 00:45:53.521
OK?

00:45:57.818 --> 00:45:58.526
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:45:58.526 --> 00:46:02.650
You probably have been to
many interesting situations

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:04.130
during your world travel.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.210
If you can share, how
have your Jason Bourne

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.130
and your culture
or language skills

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:12.804
helped you to get out of
some of the tricky ones?

00:46:12.804 --> 00:46:13.470
BENNY LEWIS: OK.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.990
All right.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:16.680
I'd say the trickiest
situation I had was

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:21.410
in Brazil, where
I-- essentially, I

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:25.340
got detained by
the federal police.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:27.700
What happened was I had been
in Brazil for three months,

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.110
and I was having
the best time ever.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:31.590
And I wanted to stay longer.

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:34.260
And you don't have
to do a visa run.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.780
If you're a tourist, you could
just go to the federal police

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.990
and ask them if you
can stay longer.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:41.220
And they stamp your
passport and that's it.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.760
And I decided I
wanted to do that.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.800
I went in, and of course, I
had to queue for five hours.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.640
Very slow bureaucratic process.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.650
I finally got to my turn,
and she said, where's

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:56.190
your 20 [INAUDIBLE] payment?

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:57.440
And I was like, here.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:57.940
Here you go.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.023
And she's like no, no, no.

00:46:59.023 --> 00:47:01.550
You've got to go to the bank,
pay them, and then give us

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:02.060
the receipt.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.120
So I did that.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.070
I came back, and I had
to start over again.

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:09.600
So by the time it was my
turn, I was so frustrated

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.180
that I was in a very bad mood.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.710
I was angry.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.489
And I was like, I'm back.

00:47:14.489 --> 00:47:15.280
Here's the payment.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.210
Stamp my passport, please.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:19.477
And she was like, in
Portuguese, she's saying,

00:47:19.477 --> 00:47:20.810
you can't speak to me like that.

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:22.740
I'm a federal police officer.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.660
And I was like,
ugh, I'm so sorry.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:26.290
Here.

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:27.660
Please, pretty please.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.670
She said, OK, if you're
going to be like that--

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:34.652
and she stamped my passport
for one day, which meant

00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:35.860
there was nothing I could do.

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.240
I couldn't go to another
place to get it extended.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.430
I was furious.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:41.920
I had so many
things outlined, you

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.890
know, things I had
paid for in advance,

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:45.910
and, like, flights
and everything.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:49.100
So mad that I went
out into the queue,

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:53.420
and I was, like, cursing
all of my worst Portuguese,

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:57.430
saying this you-know-what has
a stick up her you-know-what

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:58.740
and she's blah blah blah.

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.070
And so, like, I said
horrible, horrible things.

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:03.390
And I didn't realize
that the window was open

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:04.720
and she heard everything.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.610
So she came out, grabbed
me, threw me in a room,

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:08.980
and locked me there.

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:14.550
And she said, we're going
to officially arrest you.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:18.330
Now, being arrested was
not on my itinerary.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:21.920
That was going to mess up
my travel plans very much.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.370
So I had to think quickly.

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:26.760
I had to think, OK, what
would Jason Bourne do?

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.360
Or what would MacGyver do
in this situation to escape?

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.735
You know, is there,
like, a paper

00:48:30.735 --> 00:48:32.450
clip I can use to get
out of this place?

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:34.283
And then I was thinking,
thinking, thinking.

00:48:34.283 --> 00:48:36.110
And then I realized
what I had to do.

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:39.900
I had a plan, through what
I had learned those three

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:43.720
months in trying to
understand Brazilian culture.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.670
And instead of herself, I
knew that another police

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:51.460
officer, a guy, he was going
to come in, and he looked mad.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:55.650
He looked like he was
probably her brother,

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:57.440
and he had heard what I said.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.350
So he was ready to give me hell.

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:02.760
But while he was kind of,
like, leaving the papers

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.990
and coming back, I
thought to myself, OK.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:07.170
I concentrated
really, really hard

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:12.120
on Torlinus, the pet turtle I
had when I was six years old,

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.710
who died.

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:16.552
And I thought really hard, and
I was, like, poor Torlinus,

00:49:16.552 --> 00:49:17.600
I remember burying him.

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.820
And, like, the tears
started coming down.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:26.169
So he came back in, and he was
like, you arrogant foreigners,

00:49:26.169 --> 00:49:27.460
you don't know what's going on.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.900
And I was, I'm so sorry.

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.290
And I bawled in tears.

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:36.520
And the reason I did that is
because I realized this macho

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:41.460
culture didn't really know
how to handle men crying.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.110
And he started
getting very awkward.

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:45.615
And he was like, uh,
stop crying this instant.

00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:46.740
We need to talk about this.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:49.390
And I'm like, [CRYING].

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:51.890
I want my mommy.

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:55.007
And I kept replying that
way, and eventually,

00:49:55.007 --> 00:49:56.590
since he didn't know
how to handle it,

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:58.440
he grabbed my passport,
threw it at me,

00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.689
and said, get out of my sight!

00:49:59.689 --> 00:50:01.200
You're pathetic!

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.420
And I escaped from
prison, as it were,

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:08.400
using a little bit of that
kind of cultural understanding.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.260
So sometimes, you know, I got
myself into bad situations.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.628
But sometimes I can
get myself out of them.

00:50:14.628 --> 00:50:15.128
Yeah.

00:50:21.932 --> 00:50:26.074
AUDIENCE: So I was studying
Chinese for around two years,

00:50:26.074 --> 00:50:28.544
studying on my own,
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:28.544 --> 00:50:31.014
I had my first
conversation with somebody,

00:50:31.014 --> 00:50:34.966
I realized I didn't know
the word-- the sentence for

00:50:34.966 --> 00:50:38.424
"Can you repeat again?" or
"Please [INAUDIBLE] slower."

00:50:38.424 --> 00:50:41.882
Do you have a list of basic
sentences that help you, like,

00:50:41.882 --> 00:50:44.846
[INAUDIBLE] a language,
as in, you know,

00:50:44.846 --> 00:50:46.360
these kinds of words that--

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.287
BENNY LEWIS: Yeah.

00:50:47.287 --> 00:50:48.082
AUDIENCE: --that
you find that you

00:50:48.082 --> 00:50:50.150
need to use more often than not
when you start a new language?

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.760
BENNY LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.140
No, no, no.

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.306
I always try to learn those.

00:50:52.306 --> 00:50:54.250
But instead of
saying, I'm sorry,

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:55.840
can you repeat that again?

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.750
I just learn the word "again."

00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:58.500
It's a lot easier.

00:50:58.500 --> 00:50:59.890
It's a lot less complicated.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:01.730
It's a lot less intimidating.

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:05.440
So I would say,
[SPEAKING CHINESE], again.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.200
And then they know.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.930
And then maybe
after a month or so,

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:12.970
I'll actually give a more
proper way of saying that.

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:14.570
But I would learn single words.

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:17.960
What single word can get you
the best bang for your buck?

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.530
I always think Pareto
principle-wise,

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:24.990
what 20% can give me
80% of the results?

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:26.600
And I'm not trying
to get it perfect.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.357
I just want to
achieve something.

00:51:29.357 --> 00:51:31.440
And then another thing,
with Mandarin especially--

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.335
people always forget this-- with
any language that you learn,

00:51:34.335 --> 00:51:36.870
and something that I
tried to really dive

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:39.640
into in these
courses, was to get

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.180
people to see all the
words they already know.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.630
And this is very prominent
in European languages.

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:47.980
We have a lot of loan
words people use.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.100
But in Mandarin, I
tried to see, what

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.035
are the words I already know?

00:51:52.035 --> 00:51:55.100
And there are words
you know already.

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.010
There are loan words.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:57.426
There are some
words that are kind

00:51:57.426 --> 00:52:01.560
of building up and getting used
in kind of slang situations.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:05.498
So like on phone calls,
you could say, bye-bye.

00:52:05.498 --> 00:52:05.998
You know?

00:52:05.998 --> 00:52:08.220
When people would ask
me where I'm from,

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:10.790
I would say "Ireland."

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:15.360
And you have, like, not just
country names, but brand names.

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.315
And you have people's
names, like, if you

00:52:18.315 --> 00:52:20.460
don't know how to say
the word for "president,"

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.690
then use the word for
Obama, because that's

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:24.070
going to be the same.

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:26.910
So I would try to think along
those lines, because then

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:29.130
that is the thing
I would do before I

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:31.380
need to memorize things.

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.300
And then with
memorizing them, I would

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.650
try to come up with
quirky mnemonics.

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:38.670
I try to see, is
there some way I

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:43.050
could tie in the vocabulary
with something else that I know?

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:45.650
And that helps to just,
like, have something

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.780
ready to spit out, because the
last thing you want to be doing

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:53.460
is to overthink it when
the situation comes up.

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.100
But yeah, for
generally, what I do

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.960
when I'm starting
to learn a language,

00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:01.020
is come up with things
I'm likely to say often.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.760
So I do not try
to learn the word

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:06.020
for "curtain," because that's
very unlikely to come up

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:06.950
in conversation.

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.730
But on a call,
like a video call,

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:13.460
I'm going to very likely need
to say, "Repeat, please,"

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:14.950
and "Can you write?"

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:17.430
"Can you write?" is a very
good one, or "Can you type?"

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:20.250
because then they're going to
have something you can actually

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.020
go off and use very quickly.

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.210
And I don't feel bad
about having them wait.

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.160
If I'm, like, paying
for the lesson,

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.910
then they're just
going to have to wait.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:28.410
You know?

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.034
And I go off and look
it up, and then I

00:53:30.034 --> 00:53:31.797
continue the conversation.

00:53:31.797 --> 00:53:33.630
So yeah, I would try
to come up with things.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:35.320
I do have a baseline list.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.300
But a lot of the stuff
I come up with initially

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.610
isn't necessarily something
I say, OK, everyone.

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:41.470
Here are the magic words I use.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:43.930
Here they go for you,
because in every language,

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:46.670
I've never ever come across
a course that teaches me

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:51.180
how to say, "I'm Benny,
a blogger from Ireland."

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.330
So I-- when I'm, like, making--
when I made this course,

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:56.620
I tried to make it a
more me-specific thing,

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:59.330
to give people the
tools they needed

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:01.280
to figure out how to
fill in those gaps

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.260
with something relevant to them.

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:04.760
OK?

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.510
MODERATOR: OK, I
think we've got time

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:09.727
for one more quick question.

00:54:09.727 --> 00:54:11.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you very
much for the information.

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:13.340
It's really useful.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.994
So I'm Austrian, and
as foreign languages,

00:54:15.994 --> 00:54:19.380
I have some, like, for example,
Italian, French, and Spanish.

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.775
And to me it was always really
difficult to mix those up,

00:54:21.775 --> 00:54:24.191
because you have all those
words which are really similar.

00:54:24.191 --> 00:54:27.750
So my question is, would
you say it's easier

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:30.795
if I learn a language
really well, to start off

00:54:30.795 --> 00:54:32.804
with another language
that's really similar,

00:54:32.804 --> 00:54:34.220
like going from
French to Spanish,

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.386
or would you say, like, do
something completely else

00:54:36.386 --> 00:54:39.874
afterwards, so the brain can
not do something similar?

00:54:39.874 --> 00:54:41.540
BENNY LEWIS: I would
say, like, whenever

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:43.810
people say, which language
should I learn next?

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:45.830
And they say, should
it be based on similar?

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:49.430
Or should it be based on
what's harder, what's easier?

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:53.130
I always think of this
guy I met in Spain while I

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:57.630
was learning Spanish, and he had
to learn French and Japanese.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:01.615
And he was doing a lot
better with Japanese,

00:55:01.615 --> 00:55:02.990
and I was confused.

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:06.120
I was, like, well, wouldn't
French be easier for you?

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:09.280
And he said, no,
because I love anime,

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.850
and I, like, can't wait for
the next manga to come out,

00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:15.470
and I find Japanese girls hot.

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:17.450
And, like, that
was his motivation.

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:20.080
And I find, whenever you
start a new language,

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.164
if you start thinking
of, you know,

00:55:22.164 --> 00:55:23.580
will I learn this
language better,

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:27.090
because, you know, it
has vowel agreements,

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.810
and because some of
the words are formed

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:33.270
in an agglutinative
way, or because of this,

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:35.060
or it's in the same
language family,

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:37.690
that's a very impersonal
way of looking at it.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:40.710
That might make
sense, you'd think,

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:42.000
from a logical perspective.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.260
But I've found the next
language you should learn

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.310
should be the language
you're most passionate about.

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.430
And that should be
what's driving you,

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:52.880
regardless of if it's similar,
because if it's similar,

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.440
you'll find a way.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.560
Maybe technically,
it will be, like,

00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:59.270
5% harder because it's similar.

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:05.142
But maybe it'll be 20% easier
because you care about it more.

00:56:05.142 --> 00:56:06.100
So all of those things.

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:08.220
The same when people ask
me, what's the hardest

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.600
language you've ever learned?

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.650
I always tell them it
was kind of Spanish.

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:17.050
It wasn't Chinese or
Hungarian or Quechua.

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:19.830
It was Spanish,
because I didn't really

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:21.590
care about it for
the first six months

00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:23.040
that I was trying to learn.

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.490
I was just kind of
putting in the work.

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:29.750
And I put in a lot of hours
to get nothing out of it.

00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:32.740
So, but since then, I've
cared about the culture.

00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:34.310
I've seen a language--
like, people

00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:35.810
are surprised when
I tell them this.

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:39.250
I actually don't care
about language learning.

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:41.690
I care about talking to people.

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:44.660
For me, a language
is a means to an end.

00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:48.520
It's my tool that
lets me open doors.

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.280
That lets me get
through it quicker.

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.970
So I don't care if it's
similar to this language,

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:56.260
or if it's in a different
language family,

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.860
or anything like that,
or does it have tones,

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:01.420
or does it have seven cases?

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:03.900
I don't care, because
regardless, I'll

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.740
find a way to figure out
those issues if they come up.

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:11.450
What matters is, do I want
to learn that language?

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:12.850
So I would try to see that.

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:14.150
I would try to see,
is there some part

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:15.524
of the culture,
is there somebody

00:57:15.524 --> 00:57:17.030
you know you really
want to talk to,

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:18.900
would you like to
visit the country soon?

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:21.530
Whatever it is, focus
on that, if you're

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:22.660
comparing two languages.

00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.310
And say, which one comes
out on top as the one

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:27.240
you want to learn more?

00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:28.650
OK?

00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:29.610
So that's it.

00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:31.360
Thank you very much
for coming, everybody.

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.910
[APPLAUSE]
