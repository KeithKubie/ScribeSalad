Speaker 1:          00:01          Listening to radio lab radio from W. N Y. S. E. N. D. O. N. P. R. Okay. Let's see. Hello? Hello. Hi, is this Errol Morris? I think it's me. Hello. This is Chad from, uh, from radio lab. Hi. Thank you for your very, very nice, somewhat disturbing email. What disturbed you in the email? The term truth fascist?

Speaker 2:          00:33          No,

Speaker 1:          00:36          you called Aaron. Laura. The Truth Fascist, right? Were we thinking I was, I was trying to, I wrote them an email to try and get him to come talk to us and I don't know why I use that is a truth fascist that was meant lovingly, I should say. Aww. Wasn't exactly the right choice of words. Fundamentalists. Oh, I like it. But really what I meant is it like, this is a guy who's always trying to get to the bottom of things. It's made all these documentaries a thin blue line while you got a guy off death row, actually in a thin blue line, he made the fog of war in Vernon, Florida. But I contacted him because you know, I'd recently seen him give this talk about this one investigation of his. The for me is like the purest example of the thing that drives him, think it's in all of his films,

Speaker 3:          01:18          desire, relentless desire to figure things out, to get to truth. And it all starts with a photograph.

Speaker 4:          01:28          One of the very, very first photographs of war, 1855 which war? This is the Crimean war that involved Great Britain, France, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and believe it or not, Sardinia,

Speaker 1:          01:46          the fighting took place in what is now basically the Ukraine. The Russians were on one side. Everybody else on the other half a million people died. It was incredibly brutal.

Speaker 4:          01:54          And there's this photograph titled The Valley of the shadow of death. It's black and white. It shows a dirt road cutting through this landscape. Just one

Speaker 3:          02:10          Derek road

Speaker 4:          02:12          between two hills. There's nobody in the photograph, no birds, no trees, no people. There's really nothing living in the photograph, not even grass, nothing.

Speaker 1:          02:23          But as you stare at this road a little more closely, you realize why nothing is living in this photograph. Because this road is littered with Canon cannonballs everywhere. As soon as you notice them photographs springs to life,

Speaker 4:          02:39          you imagine this fuselage, artillery fire raining down on this landscape. This is one really fascinating thing about photography. It's a time machine. There's a physical connection between that photograph and that world

Speaker 1:          03:01          cause you're holding this piece of film that was literally ripped right out of that world. But the context is God. And more importantly in this case, you don't even know if that picture is true.

Speaker 4:          03:13          What do you mean? It turns out that this photograph is one of a pair. There is a second photograph exactly the same as the first photograph, exact same camera position, but in this other photograph, the cannon balls that were on the road are gone.

Speaker 1:          03:34          So one has cannonballs on the road and one has cannon balls not on the road, but otherwise they're completely identical. Yes. He thought that's weird. Let me look into that. And there was a passage in any ends up reading this essay by a Susan Sontag

Speaker 4:          03:49          where she talks about these photographs as though it's just obvious

Speaker 1:          03:54          what was going on. And he was like, oh, that word. Well, I don't like the word obvious. Susan Sontag was basically arguing that the guy who took the picture, Roger Fenton, came to an empty road, put the cannonballs on the road. He staged it. Yes, it's obvious, but that works.

Speaker 4:          04:12          Nothing's so obvious that it's obvious. And so I started investigating

Speaker 5:          04:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:20          and so began a ludicrous obsessive it, but kind of sublime pursuit of this slippery little fact that actually inspired this whole hour. So today on radio lab, we are going to wrestle with a series of seemingly simple facts that turn out to raise complicated questions like what is truth? Is it just a pile of facts and how much does the factor that matter matter? I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, back to Errol Morris.

Speaker 4:          04:49          I tracked down Fenton's letters from the Crimea journals, written records of soldiers who were in that area at that given time, didn't find much. I interviewed five historians who ordered the photograph in one way

Speaker 1:          05:06          saying yes, it's obvious he posted the pictures. This is a bit of a surprise.

Speaker 4:          05:11          Order the photographs in the opposite way. Really,

Speaker 1:          05:14          they told them it is actually very possible that Fenton saw the cannonballs, took the picture, and then soldiers came along, took the cannibals off the road to recycle them so they could fire them back at the rushes. Exactly. Was that kind of recycling common practice? Yes, indeed. It was actually. So you had a tie to historian saying you faked it to saying he didn't.

Speaker 4:          05:36          And the fifth tie breaker jump back and forth. I like that you call it, tried to call them the tie breaker. They didn't break the tie. Well, of course, none of none of these things is subject of a vote. Truth isn't something that you vote on

Speaker 1:          05:51          at this point. He says he was feeling a very familiar irritation. Start. You know what? Forget historical interpretations.

Speaker 4:          05:58          What if I could, from the photograph itself, the very photograph itself determine which photograph came first from just the photo. So I started a being the photograph,

Speaker 1:          06:11          just sort of superimposing them on each other and flipping back and forth.

Speaker 6:          06:14          A, B, B, a, B, B, a,

Speaker 4:          06:18          etc. Etc. Nothing in anything. I know what I can do. I can start studying the shadows, which meant, yeah, let's go to the Crimea. Are you serious? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:32          His reasoning was I can't study the shadows unless I knew the exact direction the camera was pointing on that day in 1855 which means I need to find the exact spot where Fenton stood

Speaker 4:          06:43          and I had terrible trouble finding this place. Is it marked? No. All the guides kept taking me to the charge of the light brigade. That site where Tennyson wrote about the valley of death. No, no, no, no, no. Not The valley of death. The Valley of the shadow, but finally a guide named Olga. She was fabulous. Helps them locate this spot. It's completely desolate, undeveloped,

Speaker 1:          07:11          still after 150 years with some trial and error, he's able to figure out that Fenton was facing north when he took those photos and then he goes off to the Crimean war museum and asks them,

Speaker 4:          07:23          could I borrow some cannon balls? Oh Man. I take the cannon ball, take it out to the valley of the shadow of death, and I photograph it

Speaker 1:          07:32          at different times of the day, hoping that he'd be able to see subtle differences in the shadows cast by those cannonballs that could help them order the photos,

Speaker 4:          07:38          but nothing, nothing. There was endless questions about cloud cover, whether you could even measure the shadows on these photographs.

Speaker 1:          07:51          In fact, he now suspects that the shadows in those old pictures may not have been shadows at all,

Speaker 4:          07:56          but just artifacts of how the prints were made and on and on. So was the trip useful at all? Not so much bad. How many, how many days did you spend photographing and examining the photographs of cannonballs on the road? I was there for about a week

Speaker 1:          08:19          and then he went home with no answer to his question, only that continuing

Speaker 4:          08:23          irritation, but he was like, no, no, not done yet. Look, when you investigate anything, I don't care what it is, whether it's a fen photograph or Abu Ghraib or the murder of a Dallas police officer. Yes. Complications, result thinking causes complications. I'm sorry, but it's part of that process that we go through of trying to figure out what's out there in the world. What really happened.

Speaker 3:          08:57          Uh,

Speaker 1:          08:57          this is about truth, absolute truth,

Speaker 3:          09:02          and

Speaker 1:          09:04          the pursuit of truth properly considered shouldn't stop short of [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          09:08          sanity. So yes, the Fenton photographs worried me that I might not be able to resolve it to my satisfaction,

Speaker 1:          09:20          but then he said a party and he bumps into a friend of his, a guy by the name of Dennis Purcell, who is very, very good with Photoshop. We called them up. Hello? Turns out, well, I'm an optical engineer, so he's not just good at Photoshop. He acts, he builds high tech cameras in any case, okay. They were talking at this party and the Fenton picture came up. Ariel told him he had this problem of wondering which came first and said, could you take a look at these? Dennis takes the pictures home, puts them in his computer and I immediately started to compare them right away. He starts noticing differences between the two. The light changed. The weather was different shadows, but he comes to pretty much the same conclusion as Arrow that those things ultimately don't help. So he just starts flipping between the photos, flipping live back and forth, back and forth between the two photograph on the road, flip off the road, flip on the road, flip off the road, flips doing this for hours off the road, flip on the road, and then he sees it.

Speaker 1:          10:22          The rocks on the left hand side, this little group of pebbles up on the left bank. Every time you flip back and forth, flip, flip, those little rocks popped out. They moved just a little bit and when he zoomed in, he could see that there were five of them. Fred, George Oswald, Lionel and Marmaduke, we named them. Yes, these five guys shifted from one photo to the next. And here's the key in the picture where the road was empty, they were a little bit higher on the hill when the road was full of cannibals. This little rock shift down maybe eight inches or nine inches, and from the direction of that movement, you can order the photographs. It's basically like this. You could say some rocks fell down the hill. They went from up on the hill to down, up goes before down. And if the up photo is the empty road and the down photo is the road full of cannonballs. Well then the one with the cannon balls on the road was the second picture. Imagine the scene, Fenton comes upon an empty road. He sees cannon balls on the hill, so he [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          11:27          whoever was helping him would have walked along the sides of the road and lifted up cannonballs move them on to the road. In that process, they would have invariably knocked into rocks

Speaker 1:          11:43          and rocks don't fall up hill. They only fall downhill. It's gravity. So case closed. This is, this has been,

Speaker 4:          11:54          yeah.

Speaker 7:          11:59          Susan Sontag was right for the wrong reasons, but she was right. Fenton stage the photograph. So in addition to being one of the first photographs of war, this is one of the first photographic lies. I guess he just figured it was a better photo. Yeah. Or You could say Fitton was a coward.

Speaker 3:          12:18          No,

Speaker 7:          12:18          maybe he didn't want to get too close to the actual fighting, so he put the cannon balls on the road to make it look a lot more dangerous than it would have otherwise, or maybe he was after some kind of emotional truth. That's what Dennis Purcell thinks. It's obvious why he did it. There's that word again to make it look the way it felt to put those cannonballs on the road is how you felt when you were there. Which case he would argue that the second photo, the one he posed is more authentic than the first.

Speaker 4:          12:48          Forget all of that. Who in hell knows what Fenton was thinking? I really don't know what his motivation was, but isn't that kind of the question at the end of the day, do I really care whether he put the cannonballs on the road or not? Well, I hope you do. If you do, don't you?

Speaker 3:          13:10          Okay.

Speaker 4:          13:12          I do and I don't really, we didn't. W why would you go through all this then? I guess this is what I take from it.

Speaker 3:          13:22          Mm.

Speaker 7:          13:23          In flipping back and forth between those two photographs. Flip, he says, you see the rocks move, flip, and when you see the rocks move flip, you imagine feet kicking those rocks and when you imagine feet kicking those rocks flip, you feel flip the soldiers walking

Speaker 4:          13:46          like really feel it. You feel them hitting into the rocks. You feel on some deep sense for me, the reality of that scene in a way that I would not have felt otherwise.

Speaker 3:          14:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          14:02          it's almost as if you've walked through a pinhole camera into the past. That world in which the photograph, that strange temporal evanescent world in which we live is gone. But if you could step between these photographs, you're permitted, a brief trespass into something that you thought was lost. Yes. My father died when I was two years old and perhaps the deepest one of the deepest mysteries of my life. Who Waze air, all these photographs around the house. I was very, very young. I have no memories of him. There's a mystery about this man who is central to my life in so many ways, but who I don't know and who I never will know.

Speaker 3:          15:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          15:34          Aaron Morris, his latest book is called wilderness of error. This story was taken from his book believing is seeing, and I also want to thank IRA glass for helping us to connect with them. Radio lab will continue in a moment.
