00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.129
Let’s say you’re at the airport. You’re
waiting in line to get through security.

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.129
You’re in your socks, in public, and you’re
wrestling with those plastic bins, and people

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.820
are yelling at you about dumping liquids and
taking your laptop out your bag.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.969
But even with a certain amount of chaos, the
line moves pretty quickly.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.490
I mean, it should. Theoretically.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.789
Because really, everyone has the same goal:
to get to where they need to be.

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.980
Now, you probably think that I’m setting you
up to talk about stress or anxiety or something.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.300
But I am not!

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.939
Instead, I want you to imagine that security
line as being like your blood, moving through

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.240
your high-pressured circulatory system.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.989
And you, my friend, are not just some impatient
traveler in a hurry to catch the next plane

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.600
to Seattle. You are a bit of blood plasma.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.860
And the biggest concern of everyone in your
queue is just to get delivered to their destination.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.309
But the problem with rushing stuff through
a blood vessel -- or a security line -- is

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.430
that if it moves too fast, you run the risk
that something bad might get through.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.500
So, in the case of the line at the airport,
every now and then, the security people funnel

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.530
some random people into a slower line for
a full pat down and bag check.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.399
And, that is kinda what your lymphatic system
does. It takes up some extra fluid and, while

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.200
it’s ultimately helping it get to its destination
-- it runs a background check to make sure it’s legit.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.760
It may not be as well-known as some of your
more popular organ systems, but your lymphatic

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.700
system quietly plays a vital supporting role
to both your cardiovascular and immune systems.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.750
For one thing, it maintains your homeostasis
by eventually returning most of the fluid

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.860
that has been diverted back into your blood.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.430
Which is good, because if it didn’t, your
ankles would swell up like balloons, your

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.920
lungs would fill with fluid, and your blood
volume and pressure would drop to the point

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.350
where your body would just give up and you
die.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.430
But the lymphatic system isn’t just another
security line. It also has a series of checkpoints

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.380
that are staffed by special security officers that have
the ability to take care of small infections on the spot.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.340
Or if they really don’t like the looks of
what they’ve found, they can alert the whole

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.939
immune system to take it down.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.090
So, for keeping your blood-volume levels where
they need to be, for keeping you from collapsing

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.020
from low blood pressure, and for preventing
you from dying from a staph infection every

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.070
time you scrape your elbow, you have to thank
the unsung hero of your anatomy:

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.750
your lymphatic system.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.700
Structurally speaking, your lymphatic system
consists of three main parts:

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.980
The first is just ...your lymph.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.220
It’s a watery fluid that flows through your
lymphatic system.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.230
Much of your lymph starts out as blood plasma
that gets forced out of your capillaries,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.110
way down in the capillary beds, where the
leakage helps the exchange of nutrients and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.720
gases between the blood in the capillaries
and the hungry cells in your tissues.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.970
The blood capillaries reabsorb some of the
fluid, but a lot gets left behind. So, much

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.450
of the rest of your lymphatic system works
to soak it up and get it back to where it

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.900
needs to go, inspecting it along the way.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.959
For example, you have a network of lymphatic
vessels that help reabsorb the fluid, and

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.579
about 600 or 700 lymph nodes, which are basically 
checkpoints that monitor and cleanse the lymph

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.680
as it filters through.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.060
Then there are special lymphoid organs, like
the spleen, thymus, adenoids, and tonsils,

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.830
as well as other lymphoid tissues throughout
the body.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.640
Some of these organs and tissues house special
defensive cells of the immune system to fight

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.690
infection by gobbling up bacteria and other
harmful antigens -- all of which we’ll get

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.260
into a lot more in upcoming lessons. Others,
like the thymus and spleen, provide a nursery

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.530
for maturing immune cells called lymphocytes.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.069
But to understand the special supporting role
that your lymphatic system plays in your body,

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.440
let’s start with its origins -- in the capillary
beds of your circulatory system.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.470
You’ll recall that these beds are where
the capillaries carry blood from your arterioles

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.880
-- and your arteries before that -- and feed blood
into your venules -- and eventually your veins.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.280
This is where the transfer of nutrients and
waste takes place, as blood pressures force

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.120
plasma out of the arteriole end of the capillaries
and into the interstitial fluid between the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.110
cells of whatever tissue you happen to be
in.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.670
And most of that fluid gets drawn right
back into the capillaries on the venous end,

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.200
thanks to osmotic pressure.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.840
But some is left behind. Of the 20 liters
a day that’s forced through the arteriolar

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.400
end of all the capillaries all over your body,
only 17 liters is taken back up by the venous end.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.239
Those other 3 liters? That becomes your lymph.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.700
It’s almost immediately picked up by nearby
lymphatic capillaries that wind their way

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.360
in and among the blood capillaries, and they’re
really well-suited for the job.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.299
Lymphatic capillaries are made of loosely
overlapping, endothelial cells that look kind

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.980
of like roofing shingles, forming little flap-like
valves that only open in one direction.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.370
So when the pressure in the interstitial space
becomes greater than the pressure inside the

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.850
lymphatic capillary, the flaps push open and
take in fluid to relieve the pressure.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.050
Once the fluid is inside a lymphatic capillary,
we can officially call it lymph. Then it flows

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.800
through successively larger lymphatic vessels
to collecting vessels and then to larger trunks

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.770
and finally, into one of two big ducts that
feed back into the lowest pressure area of

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.930
the circulatory system.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.490
The right lymphatic duct drains all the lymph
collected from the upper right area of the

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.389
torso, as well as the right arm, and the right
sides of the head and thorax, and feeds them

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.310
all into the internal jugular vein.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.990
The larger thoracic duct takes lymph from
the rest of the body, and dumps it into the

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.130
subclavian vein.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.280
Overall, these vessels work a lot like your
veins do. They operate under very low pressure,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.850
have a series of valves that prevent backflow,
and are helped along a bit by smooth muscle

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.850
in the vessel walls that keep the fluid moving.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.020
OK, so the lymphatic system takes extra fluid
that’s squeezed out of the blood capillaries

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.289
and basically mops it up. That sounds handy.
But, as a living thing that wants to stay

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.580
alive, what’s in it for you, exactly?

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.280
Well, remember: We’re talking about recovering
3 liters of blood fluid per day -- that’s

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.449
more than half of your total blood volume.

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.669
If that weren’t returned to your circulatory
system, you’d be looking at a serious drop

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.470
in blood pressure, and little to no oxygen
delivery, or waste pick up.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.330
Plus, any blockage in the lymph system -- like
from a tumor that obstructs one of your vessels

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.030
-- can be really dangerous, resulting in edema,
or swelling, that can constrain blood flow

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.630
and lead to serious complications.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.520
And finally: Don’t forget that your lymph also plays
a key role in the function of your immune system.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.500
Say you scrape your elbow, and some bad stuff
-- like the staphylococcus bacteria that’s

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.600
covering your entire body right now -- infiltrates
some of the loose areolar connective tissue

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.500
under your skin.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.090
Since that tissue is full of interstitial
fluid that drains into your lymphatics, which

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.289
ultimately drain to your heart, you’re going
to want to vanquish those bad guys before

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.530
they have a chance to wreak any havoc.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.940
What ever will you do?

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.460
Well, this is where your lymph nodes come
in.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.660
Your body’s main lymphoid organs, the lymph
nodes are where your lymph gets close and

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.910
regular inspection by its resident immune
cells, lymphocytes.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.110
Depending on what kind of troublemaker they
find in the fluid, the lymphocytes might trigger

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.759
the release of resident macrophages to attack
unwanted microorganisms. Or they might activate

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.400
the general immune system outside of the node,
if they need extra support.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.930
The details of how that happens we will get
to next time, but for now just understand

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.370
that lymphocytes are found in, and mature
in, the loose reticular connective tissue

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.380
that makes up a large part of the nodes and
most of your other lymphoid organs.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.330
Now, if a node is overwhelmed by whatever
invader it’s trying to quell, it may become

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.780
inflamed.
You can actually feel some of your nodes if

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.419
you poke around the sides of your neck.

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:50.690
They feel like little bumps...yeah, there
they are.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.139
And noticeably enlarged lymph nodes are often
an early diagnostic sign of disease or infection,

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.759
which is why doctors are always feeling around
under your jawline during check-ups.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.130
But your lymph nodes aren’t the system’s
only checkpoints. You’ve also got a few

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.900
special outposts placed at strategic entry
points to particularly sensitive tissues,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.150
like the those in the respiratory and digestive
tracts.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.849
These are called mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissues, or MALTs, because they can be found

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:17.220
in mucous membranes around the body, outside
of the lymphatic vessels.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.460
Your tonsils are some of the largest collections
of these tissues, which together form a ring

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.930
around the entrance of the pharynx. There
they can inspect everything you eat and breathe

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.660
and try to remove any pathogens before they
enter the GI tract or lungs.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.650
It’s a pretty big job, actually, which is
why sore throats and swollen tonsils are a

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.740
common sign of a cold or other infection.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.490
Another collection of MALTs, called Peyer’s
patches, are in the distal portion of the

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.819
small intestine, providing another check point
along the GI tract.

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:47.550
And contrary to popular myth, your appendix
is not useless, because it too contains a

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.849
bunch of lymphoid tissue and is conveniently
located where it can destroy any remaining

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:55.370
bacteria before it can breach the intestinal
wall during absorption.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.830
Exactly how your lymph and immune cells detect
and destroy the unwanted visitors that might

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.440
otherwise kill you is what we’re gonna be
talking about for the remainder of this course.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.169
But for now you learned how your unsung lymphatic
system supports cardiovascular function by

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:13.720
collecting, filtering, and returning interstitial
fluid back into the bloodstream via a system

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.810
of lymphatic vessels. We also talked about
the system’s major role in fighting off

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:23.440
infection, and how lymph nodes, and other
lymphoid organs, and MALT areas house antigen-attacking

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.629
lymphocytes that provide crucial support to
the immune system.
