00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.100
 The last rule says 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.140
 He catches a cat when you meet her around the road 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.180
 This section is the most personal and intimate door in the book 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.020
 It has a lot about my daughter 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.860
 My daughter was very sick when she was ... 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.620
 When she was small 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.600
 Especially when she was in her teenage years 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.380
 She suffered a very difficult time 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.140
 She had rheumatoid arthritis 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.760
 When she was between 14 and 16 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.580
 At first she destroyed her hip 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.040
 It has to be replaced 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.300
 She then destroyed her ankle in the other man 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.740
 It had to be replaced 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.300
 So she walked for about two years with two broken men 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.579
 She had to take huge doses of narcotics 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.780
 Making it barely conscious 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.920
 She also had autoimmune disease at an advanced stage 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.960
 Causing all other symptoms 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.340
 Which was as bad as the deterioration of her joints 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.260
 But more difficult than I can describe 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 This was very cruel and terrible, it was a test of our faith 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.260
 There is almost no more explicit test 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.920
 From a powerful illness affecting an innocent child 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.240
 So this door was contemplating all this 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.360
 What should we do in such a circumstance? 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.360
 Because everyone will live in a similar situation 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.120
 Somewhat, you know 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.880
 You will face a sick person one day and you will face crises 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.760
 So this is a practical guide to overcoming this kind of time 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.880
 So, one of the things I would recommend doing when you are in trouble 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.000
 Is to narrow your time frame 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.220
 You know, when you can not think about next month 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.720
 Or maybe you're in a position you can not even think about next week 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.180
 Or perhaps tomorrow 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.060
 Because you are at that moment in a situation where you can not see salvation 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.860
 If this is the solution, it is to narrow your time frame 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.740
 To be able to skip 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.900
 If you do not know how you can survive until next week 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.530
 If only think tomorrow 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.800
 If you can not guarantee tomorrow, think about the next hour 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.240
 If not the next hour if the next minute 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.260
 You know, humans are very, very 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.620
 Very very powerful 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.280
 This shows when you face things ... 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.460
 This appears when you face things 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.120
 You can fight it and tolerate it more than I thought 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.800
 You can pass without losing you 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.740
 My daughter fully recovered 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.440
 Almost as a result of her research 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.600
 They have concluded the imbalance and have begun to take the necessary steps to fix it 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.580
 Her recovery for me was a miracle I had never seen before 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.880
 Overall, part of my talk about the cat 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.840
 I began by talking about our dog who actually died 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.640
 A year ago he is still alive in the book 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.700
 You know, I tell you this because dog lovers love their dogs 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.260
 If you like a cat they think you do not like dogs 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.980
 And then they do not love you. That's why I pointed to it at the beginning of the door [laughing] 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.260
 If you want to have a dog in the street, that's okay 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.800
 You do not have to be angry and all that 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.260
 If the idea is that you should notice 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.160
 When you are in the midst of suffering 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.800
 You should pay attention to the aesthetics of life 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.000
 Unusual beauty 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.340
 That's what made me enter the story of the cat 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.100
 Where there was a cat living in the street opposite us 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.760
 Ginger is called a Siamese cat 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.100
 Cats are not really domesticated animals 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.100
 Technically she is still said to be a predator, but she loves humans 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.500
 No one but God knows why, but she loves them 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.260
 And if Ginger was coming and hovering 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.460
 Our dog sees her, but they were friends 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.160
 She used to come and play on his back and Siegel (the dog) used to take care of her 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.980
 It is the kind that lurches around you to make you feel like it 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.940
 If she wanted to 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.740
 If so, you should notice these few 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.300
 Of small shiny jewels in the midst of darkness 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.100
 When things are bad see and notice 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.300
 To where you can see beauty 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.900
 And where something is still going on 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.980
 If you narrow your boundaries and begin to feel grateful for what you have 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.840
 This helps you go on at some very difficult times 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.920
 Which may end happily if you are lucky 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.200
 But it may end in sorrow 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.100
 And then, perhaps it may be tragic, but it is not hell at all 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.880
 You know, you can do it. At worst, you can only keep it tragic instead of turning it into a hell 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.620
 There is a huge difference between tragedy and hell 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.580
 There is nothing worse in attending a funeral 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.040
 Of seeing people quarreling 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.300
 Death is bad enough, but you can make it worse and make it unbearable 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.080
 Perhaps, this is what I concluded by my book, 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.360
 The idea that we were not trying to make things bad 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.220
 Worse than it originally was 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.540
 Perhaps we have to reconcile these terrible things with us so we can live 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.400
 Perhaps we can make the world a better place 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.140
 This is what we are supposed to do, and what we can do 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.220
 Because we have nothing better to do! 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.720
 This is what the book is about 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.280
 This was the end of the twelve rules of life 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:05:01.080
 [clap]
