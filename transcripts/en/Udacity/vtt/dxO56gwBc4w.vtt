00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:04.311
Now recall, we have looked at Image
Warping, which basically is an attempt

00:00:04.311 --> 00:00:07.795
of trying to figure out how to
transform one image to the other,

00:00:07.795 --> 00:00:11.476
which actually says that maybe now
we should be looking at as a way of

00:00:11.476 --> 00:00:15.923
actually doing a warping from Projection
Plane 1 to Projection Plane 2.

00:00:15.923 --> 00:00:19.417
Of course, we had looked at things
like translating an image, scaling, or

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:22.694
Euclidean things like rotation,
which includes full translation and

00:00:22.694 --> 00:00:24.080
rotating the image.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.360
But, we also looked at
things like rotation and

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.129
affine projective types of things.

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:32.494
If you recall, translation basically
required us to model two unknowns.

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:37.001
Euclidean, which basically had
the true translations when one

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:42.014
rotation had three unknowns,
affine, which I counted from.

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:45.060
I had six unknowns and
projective had eight unknowns.
