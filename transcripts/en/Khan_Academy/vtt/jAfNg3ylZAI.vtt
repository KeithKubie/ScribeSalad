00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.750
What I want to do in this
video is familiarize ourselves

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.540
with the notion
of a set and also

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.380
perform some operations on sets.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.320
So a set is really just a
collection of distinct objects.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.420
So for example, I could have
a set-- let's call this set X.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.205
And I'll deal with
numbers right now.

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:21.580
But a set could
contain anything.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.990
It could contain colors.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.150
It could contain people.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.410
It could contain other sets.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.370
It could contain cars.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.374
It could contain farm animals.

00:00:28.374 --> 00:00:30.290
But the numbers will be
easy to deal with just

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.710
because-- well, they're numbers.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.720
So let's say I have
a set X, and it

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.830
has the distinct objects in it,
the number 3, the number 12,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.810
the number 5, and the number 13.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.780
That right there is a set.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.450
I could have another set.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.850
Let's call that set Y.
I didn't have to call it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.230
Y. I could have called it A.
I could have called it Sal.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.354
I could have called it a
bunch of different things.

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:56.490
But I'll just call it Y.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.130
And let's say that set
Y-- it's a collection

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.810
of the distinct objects, the
number 14, the number 15,

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.700
the number 6, and the number 3.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.680
So fair enough, those are
just two set definitions.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.540
The way that we typically
do it in mathematics

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.360
is we put these
little curly brackets

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.870
around the objects that
are separated by commas.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.040
Now let's do some basic
operations on sets.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.160
And the first operation that I
will do is called intersection.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.840
And so we would
say X intersect--

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.330
the intersection of X
and Y-- X intersect Y.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.860
And the way that I
think about this,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.280
this is going to
yield another set that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.040
contains the elements
that are in both X and Y.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.630
So I often view this
intersection symbol

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.180
right here as "and."

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.460
So all of the things that
are in X and in Y. So what

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.680
are those things going to be?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.730
Well, let's look at
both sets X and Y.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.870
So the number 3 is in set
X. Is it in set Y as well?

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.550
Well, sure.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.210
It's in both.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.050
So it will be in the
intersection of X and Y.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.490
Now, the number 12, that's
in set X but it isn't at Y.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.130
So we're not going
to include that.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.440
The number 5, it's
in X, but it's not

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.400
in Y. And then we have
the number 13 is in X,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.140
but it's not in Y. And so over
here, the intersection of X

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.470
and Y, is the set that
only has one object in it.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.660
It only has the number
3 So we are done.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.530
The intersection
of X and Y is 3.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.390
Now, another common
operation on sets is union.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.840
So you could have
the union of X and Y.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.320
And the union I often view--
or people often view-- as "or."

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.550
So we're thinking about
all of the elements that

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.729
are in X or Y. So
in some ways you

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:12.770
can kind of imagine that
we're bringing these two

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.170
sets together.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.530
So this is going to
be-- and the key here

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.740
is that we care-- a set is a
collection of distinct objects.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.240
And the way we're
conceptualizing things

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.920
right here, this
is the number 3.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.020
This isn't like
somebody's score on a test

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.480
or the number of
apples they have.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.890
So there you could
have multiple people

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.230
with the same number of apples.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.860
Here we're talking about
the object, the number 3,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.730
so we can only have a 3 once.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.160
But a 3 is in X or Y,
so I'll put a 3 there.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.187
A 12 is in X or Y. A 5 is in
X or Y. The 13 is in X or Y.

00:03:50.187 --> 00:03:51.770
And just to simplify
things, we really

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.530
don't care about order if
we're just talking about a set.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.040
I've just put all of the
things that are in set X here.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.500
And now let's see what we
have to add from set Y.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.140
So we haven't put a 14 yet.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.090
So let's put a 14.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.880
We haven't put a 15 yet.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.870
We haven't put the 6 yet.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.800
And we already have
a 3 in our set.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.660
So there you go.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.370
You have the union of X and Y.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.959
And one way to visualize sets
and visualize intersections

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.100
and unions and more
complicated things,

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.150
is using a Venn diagram.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.310
So let's say this whole box
is-- you could view that

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.650
as the set of all numbers.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.840
So that's all the
numbers right over there.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.320
We have set X-- I'll just draw
as circle right over here.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.190
And I could even draw
the elements of set X.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:46.190
So you have 3 and
5 and 12 and 13.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.000
And then we can draw
set Y. And notice,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.055
I drew a little overlapping
here because they overlap at 3.

00:04:54.055 --> 00:04:58.160
3 is an element in
both set X and set Y.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.470
But set Y also has the
numbers 14, 15, and 6.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.040
And so when we're talking
about X intersect Y,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.480
we're talking about where
the two sets overlap.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.134
So we're talking about this
region right over here.

00:05:13.134 --> 00:05:15.550
And the only place that they
overlap the way I've drawn it

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.100
is at the number 3.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.300
So this is X
intersect Y. And then

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.700
X union Y is the combination
of these two sets.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.370
So X union Y is
literally everything

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.140
right here that
we are combining.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.580
Let's do one more
example, just so

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.710
that we make sure we understand
intersection and union.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.660
So let's say that I have set
A. And set A has the numbers

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.380
11, 4, 12, and 7 in it.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:06:01.570
And I have set B, and it has
the numbers 13, 4, 12, 10, and 3

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.680
in it.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.160
So first of all,
let's think about what

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.240
A-- let me do that in A's color.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.120
Let's think about
what A intersect

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.830
B is going to be equal to.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.700
Well, it's the things
that are in both sets.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.590
So I have 11 here.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.160
I don't have an 11 there.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.460
So that doesn't make
the intersection.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.990
I have a 4 here.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.210
I also have a 4 here.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.300
So 4 is in A and B. It's in A
and B. So I'll put a 4 here.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.040
The number 12, it's in A and
B. So I'll put a 12 here.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.780
The number 7 is only in A.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.850
And the number, I
guess, 13, 10 and 3

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.690
is only in B, so we're done.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.706
The set of 4 and 12 is the
intersection of sets A and B.

00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:54.080
And we could even,
if we want to,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.663
we could even label
this as a new set.

00:06:55.663 --> 00:06:58.640
We could say set C is the
intersection of A and B,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.290
and it's this set
right over here.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.810
Now let's think about union.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:08.210
Let's think about A-- I
want to do that in orange.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:14.200
Let's think about
A union B. What

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.810
are all the elements
that are in A or B?

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.580
Well, we can just literally put
all the elements in A, 11, 4,

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.740
12, 7.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.290
And then put the things in
B that aren't already in A.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.850
So let's see, 13.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.820
We already put the 4 and
the 12, a 10 and a 3.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.840
And I could write this
in any order I want.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.440
We don't care about order if
we're thinking about a set.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.992
So this right here is the union.
