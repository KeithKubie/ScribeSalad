Speaker 1:          00:00:00       More personal. Hey I'm Jad Abumrad This is more perfect today two stories from reporter Catherine wells. The first has some adult content in it so be warned if you listening with kids you might wanna skip this one. Here's Catherine.

Speaker 2:          00:00:13       So maybe we can start with the the night that it started. Yeah. So we didn't start with a start.

Speaker 1:          00:00:19       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:00:19       So give me the who what when where the best way to describe being on patrol officer on the street is you have a front row seat to the Greatest Show on Earth.

Speaker 4:          00:00:29       September 17th 1998 on the outskirts of Houston there's a deputy sheriff named Joseph Quinn had been on duty very long at all.

Speaker 5:          00:00:38       He's driving around and he hears this call go out the radio priority call somebody is called in and said There's a man gone crazy with a gun in an apartment. He happens to be driving right by the apartment complex.

Speaker 3:          00:00:54       Pretty familiar with the complex. I knew where the building was.

Speaker 5:          00:00:57       So he's like Hey I got this I'm right here I'm going home. So I parked and I tried to be as tactical as I could listen and see if I hear any kind of sound to distinguish.

Speaker 6:          00:01:09       Walked into the breezeway on high alert senses heightened adrenaline pumping and out in the middle courtyard.

Speaker 7:          00:01:19       There was a gentleman standing out there as soon as he saw me.

Speaker 8:          00:01:23       He started yelling Over here over here I can telling you I was upset he was crying. He said he's up there he's up there I said Up where.

Speaker 5:          00:01:31       And he points up to this apartment on the second floor.

Speaker 3:          00:01:33       I said the man with a gun is up there. Is that where you're saying that apartment right there. He said Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:01:38       So a couple other officers arrive and they get information.

Speaker 7:          00:01:41       We took our time control your breathing to get that you know the adrenaline rush and the blood pressure down to where you don't get tunnel vision.

Speaker 8:          00:01:52       Went up the stairs for us.

Speaker 9:          00:01:54       When they get up to the top of the stairs got to the apartment door and their door was ajar it was open. I listened for a second game to get in and find that I could detect anything in the apartment. So we got ready and I pushed the door open all the way open.

Speaker 10:         00:02:16       I announced our presence the sheriff's department anyone in the apartment come out where we could see you.

Speaker 11:         00:02:21       Keep your hands in plain sight. I did this two or three times very loudly. Still no response.

Speaker 12:         00:02:29       There is a bedroom in the back of the apartment.

Speaker 13:         00:02:31       It was a door to a back bedroom that was closed.

Speaker 4:          00:02:35       And these two officers start walking towards it.

Speaker 14:         00:02:39       The deputy that was in front of me. He opened the door pushed it open and as soon as he did he lurched back like he would startle.

Speaker 15:         00:02:51       So he goes into the bedroom finger's on the trigger pressure fold if I see a gun and it's pointed at me. I'm gonna take him out. But then. It's like.

Speaker 16:         00:03:01       You got to be kidding me. Really. What was it. What was it. It was. Two guys having sex. Oh something I'll never forget. I mean it's like I just I was just flabbergasted.

Speaker 5:          00:03:18       Okay so here's the story. The two guys that were in the apartment where John Lawrence and Tyrone Garner John was an older white guy. He was in his 50s. And Tyrone was a younger black guy in his thirties.

Speaker 3:          00:03:29       Come to find out. Basically the gentleman downstairs. This is the guy who called nine one one was former lover or on again off again lover one and he was upset that the other that they were engaged in some kind of activity was OK.

Speaker 5:          00:03:43       So the guy in the parking lot was the boyfriend of Tehran. And we don't really know why he called 9 1 1 but the thought is that maybe he was jealous of whatever was going on in the apartment and he decided he wanted to get them in trouble.

Speaker 10:         00:03:57       You know it was a lover's triangle kind of thing.

Speaker 5:          00:03:59       So you know the cops come in and John and Tyrone have no idea what's going on. They didn't know that the boyfriend had gone and called 9 1 1 so they're shocked. And Quinn says they start yelling at him.

Speaker 10:         00:04:10       Just I mean combative belligerent refusing to comply with anything we hated gays we were homophobes we were jackbooted Nazi thugs. So at a certain point Quinn just decides you know if we leave him here and the way they're acting and they're intoxicated we're going to have further calls here. Know it's not and if we leave them here we decide to arrest them.

Speaker 5:          00:04:31       Really what's on what charge. I mean they're just in their house. Right. So that's the question.

Speaker 3:          00:04:36       Well I've been a Coleman for 15 years and you know I'm blessed with the ability to have somewhat of what you would call a photographic memory.

Speaker 5:          00:04:43       Meaning he knew the penal code really well. So he starts thinking he starts going through all the possible laws that could apply to this and he lands on this one.

Speaker 13:         00:04:53       I know it pretty well twenty one o say statute 21 06.

Speaker 10:         00:04:57       It says Members of the same sex can engage in sexual conduct.

Speaker 5:          00:05:01       It's a law banning sodomy deviant sexual intercourse.

Speaker 17:         00:05:06       We were not even treated like civilized citizens.

Speaker 5:          00:05:10       This is John Lawrence from an interview he did with Lambda Legal in 2008. It's one of the few bits of tape that we have of him.

Speaker 18:         00:05:17       This is all of a sudden we're taking you downtown. I wasn't allowed to put clothes on. I was handcuffed and dragged downstairs.

Speaker 10:         00:05:25       Officer Joe Quinn has a different version of that story to the main custody afforded him the opportunity to get dressed. They refused so we forced him to put some underwear on. You know we actually l Elam down to put underwear on them and escort in the Mallee apartment like that because we I mean it was it was a struggle just to get them to put underwear on.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       You just jumped for saying whatever happened in that room which Catherine will go into more in a second. This moment of two guys supposedly having sex and I mean charged with sodomy. It was like a strike of lightning.

Speaker 19:         00:05:59       It would begin a process that would profoundly reshape America. And what's interesting and this is one of the first things that you bump into if you were an idiot about the law which I am. And then you try and make a podcast about the law. I'm trying to do is that there's often this disconnect. Like laws are these things that sort of float above us all these beautiful abstractions. And yet if you want to challenge law you've got to find a person down here in the mud whose experience perfectly somehow captures what you feel is wrong with the law. You've got to find a perfect plaintiff.

Speaker 20:         00:06:31       But how do you find that person. What happens if they're not so perfect. These two stories you're gonna hear are about a particular tactic that sometimes called test case litigation that I wasn't too aware of before Kathleen's reporting. The second story actually touches on a very current case that was just decided a few days ago. The case on affirmative action will meet the guy who brought that case who critics say is basically destroying some of the most iconic civil rights law from the 60s.

Speaker 1:          00:06:58       But first we'll get back to Catherine wells with the story of a case called Lawrence v. Texas. OK so come on in.

Speaker 21:         00:07:07       I brought out my Lawrence versus Texas box of stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:07:12       So I went to Houston and I visited a guy named Mitchell KTM. He's a lawyer there. And he showed me the arrest papers.

Speaker 21:         00:07:20       He had the arrest papers for these two guys C.J. Lawrence criminal officers observed the defendant engaged in deviant sexual conduct charged with homosexual conduct. It's right there in writing.

Speaker 5:          00:07:33       Yeah. I mean it's it really is strange to see those words on a piece of paper. It seems like such an anachronism. But it was not.

Speaker 21:         00:07:40       That's. And this is dated timber 17th 1998.

Speaker 5:          00:07:45       Now in 1998 a few other things. Texas wasn't the only state that had this kind of law on the books at least 13 other states also had an anti sodomy law.

Speaker 22:         00:07:54       And it's important to note that you know this law wasn't used very much. People were not arrested for this law because when would police be present in your home to observe you having sex. This is Dale Carpenter I teach constitutional law at SMU Law School. I mean sodomy laws weren't really about stopping any body from having sex. They were really about ensuring that we could label people criminal. It was a label that people could point to so that people who disapproved of homosexuality could say look that defining act.

Speaker 23:         00:08:29       Of homosexuality a crime.

Speaker 21:         00:08:33       So if it's a crime and you commit the crime well you're a criminal it's a criminal statute.

Speaker 5:          00:08:37       People can say you're a criminal which then gives the state a legal basis to justify all sorts of housing discrimination employment discrimination military in every context it had an effect and many people argued that these laws they also sent a strong cultural message what's being called gay bashing.

Speaker 24:         00:08:57       But the most recent example here in Houston is better described as a vicious killing.

Speaker 5:          00:09:02       And this was at a time when the hate crimes in Houston were surprisingly common.

Speaker 24:         00:09:06       Paul Batista 27 years old died after being beaten with a nail studded to buy for the second senseless killing in the Montrose area in less than three months.

Speaker 25:         00:09:15       It was a lot of blood and was real apparent that he'd been shot. So.

Speaker 26:         00:09:21       To make a long story short the gay rights movement is very eager to repeal that sodomy law.

Speaker 12:         00:09:26       OK so John and Tyrone were arrested on a Thursday night the next day. It so happened that.

Speaker 27:         00:09:32       Because of the location of John Lawrence's apartment the case landed in a justice of the peace court meaning after Quinn made the arrest the report was sent to that court for processing.

Speaker 5:          00:09:42       Now this court is mostly deals with traffic it's mostly a traffic court but there happens to be this clerk in the court who was gay and he couldn't believe that there that somebody had actually been arrested for homosexual conduct in their home. So that night this clerk and his partner go to a bar and they start talking to the bartender.

Speaker 26:         00:10:02       I believe it was a Friday night. This is Leanne Lewis. He was the bartender. When I was doing I was a bartender in 1998.

Speaker 5:          00:10:09       So these two guys come in and they tell Lane you're not going to believe what happened.

Speaker 28:         00:10:13       They said a couple of guys were arrested and charged with sodomy.

Speaker 26:         00:10:17       And Lane was like yeah yeah yeah yeah. You just can't believe that such a thing happened it's such an unusual occurrence. But they were like No no it really happened.

Speaker 29:         00:10:25       And Lane said Send me the report Monday morning bright and early.

Speaker 30:         00:10:30       I can hear my fax machine go off and then I pull it off.

Speaker 28:         00:10:34       Officers observed the defendant engaged in deviant sexual conduct and oral sex. And then that's when it hit me. Oh I mean it was so clear night and day to me I immediately knew what I had in my hand.

Speaker 5:          00:10:47       Why why does he care so much about this man. Well so when he wasn't being a bartender Lane was a community organizer particularly around LGBT issues.

Speaker 31:         00:10:55       I was president of the Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus.

Speaker 5:          00:10:58       That's one of the oldest LGBT civil rights groups in the south. He'd been waiting for this moment. How long had you been looking for a case. Seven eight years. Seven or eight years. Cause just to lay it out explicitly what why did you need it.

Speaker 28:         00:11:12       I needed a test case. You can't change a law like that if you don't have a case.

Speaker 5:          00:11:18       People in the Texas legislature had been trying to remove this law from the books for years.

Speaker 32:         00:11:23       According to Dale Carpenter but every time someone would introduce a proposal to repeal the law it would get Snickers and catcalls in the state legislature.

Speaker 2:          00:11:31       It just wasn't really going anywhere. So activists had decided the only way to get this done is to bypass the legislature and go straight to the courts.

Speaker 28:         00:11:39       So I needed a case I had to have someone guilty.

Speaker 5:          00:11:43       So Lane starts trying to track them down at this point the two guys had been released from jail and he eventually gets drawn on the phone conversation basically went like this.

Speaker 28:         00:11:51       Hi my name is Lane Lewis. I'm a gay activist here in town. You don't know me. That's not important but I understand you've been arrested. I'm begging you not to plead out meaning don't just say you did it and pay the fine.

Speaker 5:          00:12:03       I knew I couldn't have em plead out because then there'd be nothing Lane could do.

Speaker 28:         00:12:06       I said I will find you lawyers. I will raise the money. I will pay for everything. Just don't do anything until you and I have an opportunity to meet.

Speaker 5:          00:12:15       A few weeks later they all meet at Mitchell Cortines office and it immediately becomes clear that these guys are sort of an odd couple.

Speaker 33:         00:12:23       JOHN LAWRENCE At that time was about I think it was 55 years old tall white kind of a big guy.

Speaker 22:         00:12:30       He worked as a lab technician for a hospital.

Speaker 5:          00:12:33       Tyrone Gardner was a young skinny black guy 24 years younger than John. No steady job. He bounced around between friends apartments just kind of went from place to place and job to job.

Speaker 34:         00:12:43       No idea what their connection was. They weren't lovers both heavy drinkers very heavy.

Speaker 5:          00:12:50       Both had criminal records. Yes Tyrone had been convicted of assault and drug possession. And John had been convicted in the 60s of murder by automobile.

Speaker 31:         00:12:59       They were not the perfect plane but they were not the poster boys these were not pretty tweaks and they weren't political. No not at all not at all.

Speaker 12:         00:13:07       In fact when Lane told John Lawrence I'm a gay activist here in town.

Speaker 27:         00:13:10       John Lawrence didn't even know what that was. I don't know what a gay activist is.

Speaker 35:         00:13:15       Basically neither of them had any interests like no interest in being a public figure. So I gave him the whole Ask not.

Speaker 28:         00:13:24       What your country can do for you ask not what you can do for your country speech.

Speaker 30:         00:13:29       I mean literally I reminded them of who Harry Hay was.

Speaker 36:         00:13:33       I just simply thought well now it's time for me to organize my people.

Speaker 34:         00:13:36       Well Harry Hay was arguably the founder of the original LGBT movement. You listeners may not remember but at one time it was illegal for certain number of gay males and the LGBT community to get together and one location was illegal can do it.

Speaker 36:         00:13:51       I dreamt even then of the idea that there would be networks of sanctuaries or places where we could come and out of which we would be able to move and organize and change things across the country. So I told him a little bit about that history and.

Speaker 37:         00:14:04       How far we'd come and how far we had to go. And that they had an opportunity to change their. So I told him I said. I'll be able to protect you. For maybe the first year or two but there's going to come a time where I will no longer be about you. It'll be about something much much bigger. So. They agreed Tyrone's attitude was OK. You know what do you need me to do. John was much more indignant.

Speaker 17:         00:14:40       I was pissed. They picked the wrong person to pull this loan. There was a ridiculous law but Texas loves to keep some antiquated things around.

Speaker 28:         00:14:52       He was mad. He was angry.

Speaker 12:         00:14:55       And here's where the story gets complicated because at one point according to Lane Lewis they were having this conversation and John was ranting you know about how he'd been treated and he said you know what the worst part is we won't even in fact you know we want to get up.

Speaker 21:         00:15:11       He said that they were not having sex. Wait what. That they were not having sex that they were sitting in their underwear on the couch watching the late night news.

Speaker 12:         00:15:21       They say they were sitting there doing nothing. And the cops just burst in and started pushing them around and that they were never even having sex.

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       But isn't this whole case about them having sex. Yeah. So you're saying the thing that this case is supposed to be about may not be true right.

Speaker 5:          00:15:36       Well so I interviewed three of the four police officers Dale Carpenter says when he talked to the police officers he did find that their stories were sort of all over the place. One guy said it was anal sex he saw one guy later said he thought it might have been oral.

Speaker 27:         00:15:50       The other two officers said they never saw anything. So Dale says he believes John's story there probably was actually no sex.

Speaker 5:          00:15:57       He thinks what might have happened is that the cops walked in and saw some gay art on the wall and some gay magazines lying around.

Speaker 27:         00:16:02       I have a feeling that really set off the officers and they said well we know they're homosexuals they probably engaged in homosexual conduct at some point and that's illegal in Texas.

Speaker 16:         00:16:11       No no I. There was no no no doubt about it. I mean I have no no reason to lie.

Speaker 28:         00:16:17       QUINN To this day still insists that he walked in on them and copulate.

Speaker 5:          00:16:22       He says he saw what he saw and he just did his job.

Speaker 16:         00:16:24       If you want to be homosexual and that's where you want leave your lifestyle that's fine. I don't agree with your lifestyle but that's my opinion. That's what it is. It's an opinion.

Speaker 12:         00:16:33       So there's no way to know what actually happened obviously but in a way it doesn't matter because when John said that to Lane that they weren't even having sex as a John Don't ever say that again. Don't ever say that to anybody. Again.

Speaker 31:         00:16:51       Because we couldn't have people know that we couldn't have people find that out. We can go forward to this. Yep.

Speaker 28:         00:16:56       We were scared that the case would get screwed up at that point and potentially the D.A. dropping the charges.

Speaker 5:          00:17:04       So basically you had to preserve if if Joe Quinn was lying on that police report you had to preserve the lie correct.

Speaker 1:          00:17:11       Correct. Dumb question. You can just do that you can just preserve a lie to keep a case going. You do that.

Speaker 31:         00:17:17       Well keep in mind and it wasn't our job to prove or disprove the lie.

Speaker 38:         00:17:22       You know Elaine the thing that mattered was not what did or didn't happen that night. The thing that mattered was what the arrest report said.

Speaker 1:          00:17:30       But if what the arrest report said potentially didn't happen should that matter.

Speaker 32:         00:17:35       Well no. No one.

Speaker 26:         00:17:37       Our legal system is not designed to bring out the truth. This is a misconception. It does not bring out the truth.

Speaker 27:         00:17:43       That's Dale Carpenter again it is people who play their roles in pursuing whatever they think their best interests are. And that's exactly what happened.

Speaker 30:         00:17:55       So for the first few years my job was to keep the boys out of the out of the news. And why was that. Well they had a tendency to drink and get rowdy and fight and they like to go to seedy hotels and rent rooms and get really really high drunk whatever. And inevitably they would start fighting with each other. And so what I did what I would do is I would. I knew the different places they stayed. He says he would go to these seedy hotels and talk to the clerks give him a business card tell him if these boys come and check in they cause problems. Call me first ban on more than one occasion that happened I'd get a call at 2 o'clock in the morning. Your guys are here they're causing trouble I'm gonna have to call the cops. I would jump out of bed put on my clothes because we couldn't have them. You know they're already on the front page of The Houston Chronicle. We could not have our defendants doing a perp walk for drugs and alcohol. So I would drive down there and I would figure out which one was causing the most problems. Put them in my car and I would drive them somewhere else. I would separate them out.

Speaker 39:         00:18:59       That happened more than once more than once.

Speaker 5:          00:19:02       Celine said he had this fear that John and Tyrone Woods would start talking to the media and let something slip about their version of the story.

Speaker 28:         00:19:11       So he gave them these little cards kept it in their wallet and small little sentences basically said thank you for contacting me. Please refer to Lane Lewis and had my phone number and my email and I said so anytime the media contacts you don't think about what you say right. That's where you get screwed up. When you start thinking about what you want to say to the media pull this out of your wallet read it.

Speaker 5:          00:19:32       And hang up. Even so there were these close calls as the case wound its way through the court system.

Speaker 21:         00:19:38       Mitchell KTM told me about this one time there was this press conference and we came outside to the normal media group that was out there wanting quotes and talk to us and they didn't want to hear from the lawyers they wanted to hear from the clients. So it was like All right just this once Tyrone got up to the mike and I think a reporter asked him you know how do you feel about this. And he said we didn't do anything wrong. He just kind of yelled that out in a angry way we didn't do anything wrong. Mitchell pulled him back and was like Oh that's enough that's enough. Next day we didn't do anything wrong. That was the quote on the headlines of the morning's paper the next day. And certainly I knew what he meant. That they weren't having sex but you know. Could also be interpreted as homosexual conduct is nothing wrong.

Speaker 40:         00:20:26       He says luckily that's how people took it.

Speaker 41:         00:20:31       It's very nerve wracking because this went on for years this was years. Yeah couple of years. Here's kind of how it went down.

Speaker 5:          00:20:37       They started at this justice of the peace court. They were sentenced to a fine of one hundred and twenty five bucks. They appealed and the case gets kicked up one level to the Harris County criminal court. They're fined again. They appeal it again.

Speaker 26:         00:20:48       Then it went to another level to the 14th Court of Appeals. And one more level ultimately the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals which is the highest court in Texas for Criminal Appeals refused even to hear the case.

Speaker 42:         00:21:01       So the only next step is the Supreme Court will hear argument next to no.

Speaker 43:         00:21:07       0 2 1 0 2.

Speaker 5:          00:21:08       John get as Lawrence and Tyron Garner versus Texas March 26 2003 almost five years after the arrest the case lands at the Supreme Court. And by the time it gets up there Mr. Smith.

Speaker 44:         00:21:21       Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.

Speaker 4:          00:21:23       The story is not dwelled upon at all. They didn't say these guys weren't in a relationship. They didn't say if these guys were having sex. One of them was cheating on his partner. Seems like they might have not been having sex anyway.

Speaker 45:         00:21:38       They didn't say any of those things they said there are gay families that family relationships are established that there are hundreds of thousands of people that this is about families and relationships.

Speaker 5:          00:21:49       How people in loving relationships have the right to express themselves in whatever they want it's none of the state's business.

Speaker 45:         00:21:54       The opportunity to engage in sexual expression as they will in the privacy of their home homes performs much the same function that it does in the marital context.

Speaker 5:          00:22:03       You know basically people in relationships have the right to have sex with each other regardless of their gender.

Speaker 45:         00:22:08       You should protect it for everyone that this isn't a fundamental matter of American values.

Speaker 1:          00:22:12       So now it's like watching something float up from the sort of mucky like realm of human real life real life and then it just gets kind of prettier as it floats upwards.

Speaker 5:          00:22:22       Yeah it was such a pretty story that people were suspicious of it like people were asking how did this arrest even happen.

Speaker 21:         00:22:30       This was a setup. You all set this up. That was their big battle cry.

Speaker 5:          00:22:34       So Mitchell Curtin says he heard this over and over again.

Speaker 21:         00:22:37       It wasn't a setup but I always wanted to say so so what if it was. Does that make it any less of a case.

Speaker 44:         00:22:43       Who cares unless the court has further questions. Thank you very much. Thank you Mr. Smith. The case is submitted to. The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next 10:00.

Speaker 46:         00:22:56       Three months later the opinion of the court. No. 0 2 1 0 2 Lawrence against Texas will be announced by Justice Kennedy.

Speaker 32:         00:23:03       Justice Kennedy begins reading a summary of his opinion.

Speaker 47:         00:23:06       The question before the court is the validity of a Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct. And everybody's waiting for the outcome. In Houston Texas police officers. So for context it wasn't totally clear how this case was gonna come out because 17 years earlier there'd been a case called Bowers against Hardwick Bowers vs. Hardwick and then they had ruled that sodomy laws were fine and I would suggest to the court that there is no constitutional right to conclude.

Speaker 43:         00:23:40       That there should be a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy.

Speaker 5:          00:23:44       And the Supreme Court almost never overrules things that are that recent Bowers vs. Hardwick had some factual similarities to this case. So Justice Kennedy starts talking about all the similarities between the cases these officers were dispatched to a private residence. The tension starts building officers observed Lawrence and another man Tyron Garner engaging in a sexual way and then finally he got to the moment where he said Morris was not correct when it was decided.

Speaker 48:         00:24:10       And is not correct today.

Speaker 49:         00:24:16       And at the point Justice Kennedy said that there were people sobbing in the Supreme Court Barrios vs. Hardwick should be and now is overruled.

Speaker 50:         00:24:30       At rallies across the nation gay rights advocates celebrated their legal victory. A ruling so broad it surprised even many of them. The court ruled in favor of two Texas men who challenged the state law that made homosexual sex a crime.

Speaker 51:         00:24:43       The ruling overturns a Texas law that allowed police to arrest gays for having sex.

Speaker 52:         00:24:48       Twelve other states have similar laws including that morning John Lawrence was at home in his apartment in Houston watching them. I am laying in bed trying to go back get my 40 works and all of a sudden as this has ruled the law unconstitutional.

Speaker 53:         00:25:14       I came out of bed quite happy obviously not everybody was happy about it.

Speaker 54:         00:25:23       Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals or any other group promoting their agenda through law school through normal democratic means Justice Scalia said.

Speaker 5:          00:25:33       Basically if you want this to happen that's fine but you're going about it the wrong way. The court is not the place where this decision should be made. You need to go talk to your fellow citizens and convince them that this law needs to change. Coming to us and asking us to bypass what your fellow citizens seem to want.

Speaker 54:         00:25:51       That is not how democracy should work persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing and imposing one's views in absence of Democratic majority will is something else.

Speaker 2:          00:26:02       He sees this as a small minority imposing their views on everybody else and then he said he was worried about something else.

Speaker 54:         00:26:13       Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual.

Speaker 5:          00:26:25       That this decision would open the floodgates and that it would only be a matter of time before the court was being asked to decide on gay marriage like the relevant principal. And he was right.

Speaker 55:         00:26:36       When Kennedy read the marriage decision in 2015 in Lawrence vs. Texas he talked about Lawrence. The court held that private intimacy of same sex couples cannot be declared a crime. Yet it does not follow that freedom stops there. Outlaw. To outcast may be a step forward. But it does not achieve the full promise of liberty.

Speaker 12:         00:26:57       So what happened to Garner in Lawrence. Well John Lawrence and Tyron Garner didn't live to see this. Tyrone died in 2006 from meningitis.

Speaker 32:         00:27:08       No job had no money. He was 39 and his family was very poor and they didn't have the money to bury him. They didn't even have the money to reclaim his body from the county morgue.

Speaker 5:          00:27:20       As for John Lawrence he died in 2011 at 68 from heart problems.

Speaker 32:         00:27:25       We didn't even find out about it until a month after he was dead. This hero of the gay rights movement was unknown and UN warned that his passing what does that say about sort of the. Practice of bringing things to the Supreme Court.

Speaker 56:         00:27:44       That the two people whose story this case revolves around could sort of fade into the background afterwards.

Speaker 33:         00:27:53       Well one is tempted I think to be very cynical in some ways because it means that these people were useful as long as they were useful.

Speaker 56:         00:28:02       And after that they could be forgotten. I have to say I actually had their reaction a little bit. I mean this is a story of social progress but there's something a little funny at the center of it for me.

Speaker 57:         00:28:13       And as we were playing this for our legal editor Elena Stahl And I think that we talked about spin in a lot of ways. Our legal system devolves into an end justifies the means kind of justice.

Speaker 58:         00:28:26       We say we care we care about the process so much and look at the processes it is extremely important.

Speaker 1:          00:28:34       Ellie isn't this just weird to you like this is a dumb law like a dumb dumb dumb dumb law. Why not just shouldn't there be an avenue to say this is a dumb law was taken away why did you have to find some people who didn't have sex they say pretend that they have sex then march them up all the way through the court system and then forget about them. I mean it just seems weird to me it seems like a empty theater. Why do we have to do it that way.

Speaker 58:         00:28:58       Because if you want to put a ballot initiative up in 2003 in Texas saying is gay sex OK it would fail it would fail in 2003 in Texas it would probably fail in 2016 in Texas. It will probably fail in 2032. In Texas that's why that's why the majority isn't always right. So you you. Take you basically take the Democratic vote and this is this is a again this goes back right to the founding of our country like When are you gonna let popular will run wild and when are you going to constrain it not just restrain and constrain it. When are you going to stop it. And Lawrence v. Texas is as an example of a we're just going to stop it. And it was the right call.

Speaker 59:         00:29:53       So after this Supreme Court decision did Texas immediately go and repeal the law.

Speaker 60:         00:29:58       No actually the law is still on the books in Texas. No the Texas legislature like other legislatures around the country refuses to repeal the law. It stays there a a remnant of a kind of a dark almost forgotten past.

Speaker 19:         00:30:19       Keep in mind they can't enforce the law now that it's unconstitutional but they refused to take it off.

Speaker 20:         00:30:32       Coming up a very deep dive into the guy behind one of the most controversial cases this term. A case that just got decided late last week.

Speaker 61:         00:30:42       This is more perfect Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.

Speaker 62:         00:30:52       Oh yay yay yay persons having business before the honorable the supreme court of the United States are admonished to draw near their own God save the United States in this horrible cartoon.

Speaker 63:         00:31:11       Hi my name's Peter Fink and I'm calling for it so no refugee camp in the area. Greece Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information about sloan. W w w dot Sloan dot org.

Speaker 64:         00:31:30       Hi I'm Bassem Youssef. I have a new show Remade in America presented by café. I'm exploring what it's like to be an outsider in this country. I'm talking to people from all walks of life people like me who came here from other countries and people who were born here but never felt like they totally fit in like our recent guest. Cameron Esposito when I realized I was gay I was at a college where you could be kicked out of school for being gay. Join us as we talk about America from a totally different perspective.

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       This is more perfect. I'm Jad Abumrad if Supreme Court cases can sometimes feel like plays where the activist and lawyers are sort of like the directors pulling the strings and the people in the center of the case the plaintiffs are just like these imperfect actors who have been cast in the script sort of been written for them. Well that dynamic was definitely in effect this term.

Speaker 51:         00:32:28       In fact just last week. We have had a decision just handed down in what was billed as the landmark affirmative action case of this term.

Speaker 65:         00:32:37       Josh this is a decision that will impact college admissions nationwide.

Speaker 66:         00:32:41       The case Fisher versus University of Texas centered around the following question should universities be able to use racial preferences in college admissions.

Speaker 67:         00:32:50       Now the University of Texas has this policy where the top 10 percent of every high school class automatically get in. But for everybody else they will consider factors like race. The question was Is that OK. A couple days ago the court decided barely yes it is OK.

Speaker 51:         00:33:08       The Supreme Court has upheld the affirmative action program at the University of Texas affirmative action and higher education is constitutional.

Speaker 68:         00:33:16       Now the case was brought by a young white woman named Abigail Fisher.

Speaker 41:         00:33:20       Abigail Fisher Abigail Fisher believed her race may have hurt her chances to attend the University of Texas.

Speaker 69:         00:33:25       There were people in my class with lower grades who weren't in all the activities I was in who were being accepted into the team. And the only other difference between us is the color of our skin.

Speaker 68:         00:33:35       She was arguing that affirmative action discriminates against her as a white person. Now what you saw in the wake of that decision and even before especially online was just a torrent of hate.

Speaker 70:         00:33:47       Directed squarely at her. So I'm trying to hold my tongue but I'm about to tell Abby to have a seat.

Speaker 71:         00:33:53       OK I can't get into a good college. Black people have a better pitch if you don't take your class somewhere.

Speaker 72:         00:33:59       Maybe if her grades didn't suck you dumb ass maybe you would have gotten into a good college with the bad grades.

Speaker 73:         00:34:06       Really happy you and your racist lawyer guy sat down.

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       It's all been pointed right at Abby Fisher which you could argue honestly isn't fair because this case may have very little to do with Abby Fisher.

Speaker 74:         00:34:16       I mean if you look at the press conference I don't believe that student should be treated differently based on their race.

Speaker 1:          00:34:22       Abby Fisher is the one at the podium but behind her far in the background and you'll see the sky he's there in every single press conference sort of back in the air at the edge of the frame. Not too many people know about him His name is Edward Bloom and he's the one who actually brought the case when it comes to this case and so many others. He is the architect. He's brought dozens of lawsuits not just this one. And he seems to be a maestro of getting cases to the Supreme Court that challenged civil rights law critics sort of paint him as this like one man wrecking crew for civil rights like he's almost single handedly rolling back decades of civil rights law. And when it comes to affirmative action he says he's not done just to make a long story short we wanted to meet him figure out how he does.

Speaker 5:          00:35:13       Yeah. So I went to Tallahassee. Reporter Katherine Wells takes from here. That's where he lives or he winters in Tallahassee. Golden retriever.

Speaker 75:         00:35:24       You walk in. What initially struck you his golden retriever is what initially struck me literally physically. Nice meeting here.

Speaker 76:         00:35:35       Of course. And I don't know what I was expecting but when you hear about these cases you know they're I mean critics are really people are mad about these cases is deeply disturbed.

Speaker 74:         00:35:46       Truly outrageous so betrayal of the American people.

Speaker 77:         00:35:50       So I go to meet him and your flight from Austin to Dallas to Tallahassee uneventful and on time and good. Do you think. Good. He's like a totally nice guy.

Speaker 12:         00:36:02       He's a regular guy. Was he look like like a dad.

Speaker 77:         00:36:05       There is something in me that just loves tradition and custom. He loves listening to the Great American Songbook.

Speaker 78:         00:36:11       Life is a beautiful thing. Frank Sinatra as long as I. And. Ella Fitzgerald. I love art and museums.

Speaker 79:         00:36:24       Independent films golf. What's his what's his story.

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       What's his backstory. Well he's 64.

Speaker 77:         00:36:31       I was born in a small town in Michigan. My dad owned a shoe store there. My mom worked with him in the shoe store.

Speaker 5:          00:36:40       What had been your kind of political leanings up to this point.

Speaker 79:         00:36:44       Well I'm the first Republican my mother ever met him to use the word typical but it really was a typical liberal Jewish household. My mother and father were Franklin Roosevelt Harry Truman Democrats.

Speaker 74:         00:37:01       Always voted Democrat. Then he said he was that way too all the way through college the University of Texas grad school State University of New York where I spent a year studying of all things.

Speaker 5:          00:37:16       African literature but he says somewhere along the way his political leanings sort of started to shift. I spent a summer in Israel living on a kibbutz and he says he came out of that experience a little less liberal than he was before. And you got married and then in the early 80s he is living in Houston working as a stockbroker. And we met.

Speaker 65:         00:37:45       Aren't our neighbors. This particular couple they were New Yorkers who had moved to Houston both grew up as liberals and the guy he sort of opened my eyes to the world of the neo cons.

Speaker 77:         00:38:03       The guy introduced him to these magazines Weekly Standard National Review Commentary magazines like conservative magazines.

Speaker 5:          00:38:10       And this was around the time that the neocon movement was really hitting its stride. You had all these New York liberals defecting is what he says. Thousands of individuals who grew up in the 1960s that started to question.

Speaker 77:         00:38:24       The wisdom of these liberal policies. And he says slowly slowly over time very gradually he became one of those people.

Speaker 5:          00:38:35       In any case Fast forward a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:38:37       He's living in Houston kind of a garden variety existence and something happens that sends him on this entirely new path. Basically he and his wife moved to a new neighborhood. They moved from the suburbs into the downtown area more urban.

Speaker 77:         00:38:51       And in 1990 when we went to vote for the first time in our new neighborhood I realized that the Republican Party had not fielded a candidate to oppose the Democrat incumbent running for Congress. This is a district that has almost 600000 people and you don't have a choice. You've only got one person running. Blum decided to run himself. I lost I don't. That was no great surprise to anyone. He actually lost by 32 points. But along the way it's something really unusual happened during that campaign.

Speaker 5:          00:39:33       He and his wife lark you know they decided they were going to go meet voters in their district. They got a giant printout of all of the addresses in the 18th congressional district.

Speaker 65:         00:39:43       What was then called a walking list and they just started going door to door meeting people handing out literature and they'd walk down say Oak Street. I would take the even side of Oak Street and my wife would take the odd numbered side of Oak Street and we would start to walk. And he says very quickly they realized that the district's shape.

Speaker 5:          00:40:10       Was funny. Some houses on one side of the street would be in the district and then the houses on the other side wouldn't. And sometimes the district would snake down a highway catch an apartment complex come back.

Speaker 80:         00:40:20       It just didn't make sense. This is like Bloom wife of Edward Bloom. It was peculiar because we had maps that we had to follow and it was very odd the way some streets were in the districts and some weren't. Took a while for it all to really sink in as to how this could happen.

Speaker 81:         00:40:39       After I guess about a week of this we realized that neighbors had been separated almost house by house because of their race.

Speaker 2:          00:40:55       He comes to believe that the reason this was done was for the explicit purpose to create a majority African-American district.

Speaker 82:         00:41:04       This isn't untrue. This is from a clear and simple wrong part of the reason this was done was the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Speaker 83:         00:41:14       Millions of Americans are denied the right to vote because of their color.

Speaker 59:         00:41:21       This act was a giant step forward in civil rights. You know one of the primary things that did is eliminate barriers to voting like poll taxes and literacy tests all these strategies that had been used to keep minorities from voting.

Speaker 52:         00:41:35       And then this other thing it did sort of in a roundabout way through a series of interpretations is it encouraged the creation of districts where the majority of voters were minorities. And that's because you know one of the strategies that had been used previously to sort of dilute the minority vote was to take minority communities. And they called it cracking. They sort of split them apart into many different districts so that they were never in the majority enough to elect a representative. Right. So the Voting Rights Act tried to correct that the 18th Congressional District was one of these majority minority districts.

Speaker 77:         00:42:14       The district was drawn by the Texas legislature to have a slight African-American majority. I think about 51 percent African-American.

Speaker 5:          00:42:24       But this was the problem. According to Bloomberg the way they got to that African-American majority was by creating this district that zigzagged all over the city and cut through neighborhoods.

Speaker 81:         00:42:33       I could not understand people lived close together. They send their kids to the neighborhood schools. They shopped in the neighborhood shopping centers. They were worried about neighborhood issues. To break these neighborhoods apart by race seemed so wrong to me.

Speaker 76:         00:42:51       In his mind this law was actually not limiting discrimination but actually perpetuating. Well yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:43:00       And I don't know what the average person upon realizing this would have done.

Speaker 77:         00:43:05       But I decided to file a lawsuit.

Speaker 84:         00:43:11       He decided to sue the state of Texas called a few friends who lived in the 18th district and a few other districts in Texas. An African-American Hispanic Indonesia kept looking and looking and looking until I found a lawyer that I could afford seven thousand dollars a month. We filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Texas is redistricting plan. The basic charge was yes the Voting Rights Act was good in its day but now it was being used as this excuse to segregate people into racially polarized districts.

Speaker 77:         00:43:42       It worked its way through the lower courts and to my shock and surprise in 1995 We'll hear argument now on number 94 identify George W. Bush vs. Al Jazeera.

Speaker 65:         00:43:56       The Supreme Court took it up and you went to oral argument. Yeah we all did.

Speaker 85:         00:44:00       Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.

Speaker 77:         00:44:02       So there we all are.

Speaker 85:         00:44:04       Our opponents stepped to the lectern and that issue this direct appeal is the constitutionality of three congressional districts. They make their arguments at the court below erroneously ruled a racially gerrymandered Texas basically said y'all we have to put people together by race.

Speaker 86:         00:44:21       The Texas Legislature has the obligation to satisfy federal requirements and the Voting Rights Act is a federal requirement like remember the Voting Rights Act.

Speaker 5:          00:44:30       We're trying to make sure that there are enough minorities in this district so that they have a chance to elect a representative then or advocate Mr. Tribe we'll hear from you made his arguments you get to the point that that was just being made. Bloom's lawyer basically said but look at the map. The map is bizarre. And the only reason it could have gotten this way is because you're only thinking about race. Only race. Think about it. That seems messed up isn't that messed up.

Speaker 87:         00:44:59       It doesn't matter what your ultimate goal is. You cannot use certain forbidden to race is forbidden by the 14th Amendment to be used as a tool. In his example the people St. Mary's and you know it's a very tense situation.

Speaker 88:         00:45:12       If I'm not asking about in some way do you know any other situation in the law in which we allow race to be used as a surrogate for him to be unconstitutional but to use it as a more not racism. How is this done.

Speaker 87:         00:45:22       I thought that's how you should know about me as you can see by I don't really think so. That would require me. You did say that didn't. Let me just say that I didn't let me find say that I say that I'm not. So in the end when the Supreme Court.

Speaker 38:         00:45:38       Gives out this very hair splitting decision that I think gets at this deeper question that in our society and in our discourse we just haven't figured out how to talk about anyway. And it basically said this you know look if you're defining race just as the color of someone's skin. The government cannot use that in any way and that's against the constitution. On the other hand if you take this wider view and you look at race in the context of history social context then how can the government address discrimination without taking race into account. They have to so it's this difficult balance.

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       You can't look at race but you have to look at race and gender. The Supreme Court says to Texas look all you're doing in this case is sorting people based on how they're labeled on a census. You're not looking at that wider context you're not looking at. If these communities live next to each other if they share common interests you're just sorting them based on race alone. And that's not good enough.

Speaker 77:         00:46:38       You can't do that when the opinion came down. The Supreme Court ruled in our favor 5 to 4. That was quite a day. The day that we won that lawsuit I was.

Speaker 89:         00:46:54       Got the world on a string. Looked for ever. After that. Edward Blum decided that this would be a thing. It became a passion. He would use the courts to try to strike down every race based policy he could.

Speaker 79:         00:47:09       The legal team was taken on the road. I recruited plaintiffs in New York Virginia South Carolina to challenge congressional district plans and we won in each of those states. He helped sue school districts in Florida and Texas to end the use of racial quotas in K through 12 magnet schools.

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       He went after affirmative action in Houston city contracting.

Speaker 65:         00:47:33       Today Houston could become the first city to kill affirmative action. That one was actually a ballot initiative and it failed. But I've been the architect of over two dozen lawsuits six of which six made it to the Supreme Court including.

Speaker 5:          00:47:49       In 2013 in a 5 to 4 vote 5 to 4 very divided court.

Speaker 41:         00:47:53       The Supreme Court today struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Supreme Court today struck down a very important part of the Voting Rights Act.

Speaker 72:         00:48:02       That key 1965 landmark law is considered one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation ever passed.

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       Shelby County vs. Holder. This decision gutted the Voting Rights Act. Specifically there was this part of it that said states and counties with a history of discrimination have to check with the federal government first before they go about changing their voting laws. Basically the federal government was saying look you've been up to all this stuff where now we're watching you. The Supreme Court said you know times have changed. That list was made a long time ago and it's outdated.

Speaker 65:         00:48:37       This decision restores an important constitutional order to our system of government.

Speaker 5:          00:48:44       This was Blum's biggest victory.

Speaker 90:         00:48:46       When Shelby County came down I burst into tears. I think a lot of people burst into tears when that came down. You know it. Yeah I know I understand it.

Speaker 74:         00:48:55       It is deeply disturbing. I am deeply disappointed deeply disappointed with the court's decision in this matter. This decision is a betrayal of the American people. This is a game.

Speaker 91:         00:49:07       Changer during the civil rights movement. People died for the precious right to vote.

Speaker 5:          00:49:11       This is Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston Texas.

Speaker 91:         00:49:14       I would like to have the Supreme Court justices go back in time. Go back in time and march with those who marched.

Speaker 92:         00:49:24       After Bloody Sunday from Selma to Montgomery.

Speaker 91:         00:49:28       Ed Blum has a right to his opinion. It doesn't mean that it has to be the opinion of the United States.

Speaker 90:         00:49:33       I understand that people were you know gravely upset. I also know that there were people who were gravely relieved and gravely gratified.

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       Yeah but I think what gets a lot of people is that you look at these civil rights videos you see tens of thousands 40000 people in the streets marching and you hold that and if you make a split screen in your mind you hold that. Thousands tens of thousands people on one side on the other side you. One guy. It does make you ask basic questions about democracy. That's a false paradigm.

Speaker 90:         00:50:08       It's that maybe your split screen. But that's really not the reality of all of this. Look in 1964 1965 America was held hostage by the legacies of slavery and the chokehold of Jim Crow. Fast forward to 2006 the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act the chokehold had gone away. African-Americans in the Deep South registered to vote in numbers that often exceeded whites participated in elections in numbers that exceeded whites in terms of electoral opportunities. We have come 180 degrees from 1968.

Speaker 1:          00:51:08       We turned those degrees because of the law which you've helped overturn and we don't know to what degree that is the psychology of America changing or the fact that we had a law that kept people in line and now that law is gone and now we see voter I.D. laws coming back into play which I think any sane person would admit is it is it is it is an attempt a blatant attempt to disenfranchise people. So it feels a little bit strange to I mean I completely agree with you. Things have gotten better. The same time I think well that was because of the law that's now gone.

Speaker 90:         00:51:39       Look laws change laws evolve and and at some point they need to come to an end. OK.

Speaker 93:         00:51:58       So just to jump back in play something we haven't actually talked about yet is our original question how how does this actually happen. How does it work.

Speaker 84:         00:52:07       How is one person able to be so effective to do this work. You need a computer a printer a cell phone.

Speaker 94:         00:52:17       That's really about it.

Speaker 77:         00:52:20       Where. Who pays for the lawyer fees and who do you go to. Well there are individuals that know of my work and there are foundations okay.

Speaker 5:          00:52:28       So he's a five a one see three. Like the NAACP and Lambda Legal that funded the Lawrence versus Texas case. And if you're a five a one see three public charity as he is you don't have to reveal your donors to the public. We do know a couple of his donors though and they're wealthy very conservative foundations.

Speaker 2:          00:52:46       So in the end what he does is just sort of a more maybe a more strategic or sophisticated version of what Lane Lewis did in the first story. Like in this case that he just lost last week he knew he wanted to challenge affirmative action. So the first thing he did was sort of do a casting call.

Speaker 21:         00:53:05       He set out to find the perfect white student. He set up a web called you teen not fair dawg.

Speaker 95:         00:53:10       He made a recruiting video. It's time for you to stop using race as a factor in the admissions policy pretty budget.

Speaker 5:          00:53:17       It's just him looking at the camera in front of a poster that says you teen out fair.

Speaker 95:         00:53:21       I encourage all high school students who have been rejected from duty to visit at your teen not fair dot org.

Speaker 5:          00:53:29       Tell us your story and then he started talking to the people who responded.

Speaker 90:         00:53:33       I think I ended up with about one hundred seventy five responses of those about a hundred were viable with a seventy five you threw out just like oh funky just outrageous. Well I just didn't think they would be sympathetic.

Speaker 2:          00:53:50       So we whittled the hundred down to seven that he thought would be sympathetic of those seven.

Speaker 90:         00:53:55       There were one or two that you know did not really want to go forward like I don't want the attention.

Speaker 35:         00:54:01       They were fearful of you know the backlash anyway to make a long story short. He ended up finding Abby Fisher because a friend of his called and said Hey my daughter just got rejected from UTI. I heard you were looking.

Speaker 96:         00:54:14       I think I'm a very like very like introverted person so I feel like sometimes there's a lot of pressure but I think in the end it's totally worth it. And to be able to have a voice in this and to know that my voice is making a difference is really rewarding.

Speaker 5:          00:54:34       She seemed like the perfect plaintiff strawberry blonde hair She's petite she's kind of shy in front of the camera in a good way.

Speaker 97:         00:54:41       But last week they lost.

Speaker 5:          00:54:44       So we talked to him before all this happened. So we weren't able to get a reaction from him but he did tell an Austin newspaper that the night after the decision came down. He had three glasses of wine. He took an Ambien and he thought about these particular lyrics in a Billy Joel song. A lot of folks. Told me how.

Speaker 90:         00:55:07       The songs called keeping the faith. I'm a long distance runner. If there's something just emblematic about my personality I run long distances.

Speaker 5:          00:55:18       He says he's definitely not done. He's actually already has two more cases against affirmative action in the works.

Speaker 90:         00:55:24       I have retained counsel to litigate Harvard's admissions policies and University of North Carolina's admissions policies.

Speaker 1:          00:55:32       I am sorry it just doesn't strike anyone. I mean forget the politics whether you're on on Bloom's side or not this just the tactic doesn't strike anyone as like fishy.

Speaker 58:         00:55:40       I resist giving Ed Bloom that much credit. That's Ellie Mr. elegant legal editor I would say that fundamentally he's just implementing a strategy that was perfected by the people he now ironically seeks to disenfranchise. This is a civil rights movement one to one. He's got laws that he doesn't like that he knows he can't overturn through an election. Remember this Blum's a failed congressional candidate. He had that lust for for political power. He couldn't get it through the electoral system but he found this other way to do it. This is exactly what the civil rights movement did OK.

Speaker 2:          00:56:15       So to me this is one of the most fascinating things about this story. If we go back to you remember this case there's a famous case called Plessy versus Ferguson. Sort of no not really Plessy v. Ferguson I think is a good example.

Speaker 98:         00:56:31       This is Susan Carl law professor at American University Washington College of Law. OK. Plessy versus Ferguson 1892. So that was a case where the state of Louisiana had adopted a new separate cars law which said that people of color and white people could not ride in the same train cars. And if you've heard the story this is how it goes. Somebody named Homer Plessy a black man sits down in a white car. He is rested and he decides to sue. And his case goes all the way to the Supreme Court. Now.

Speaker 97:         00:57:02       The thing about that case is that it was a total setup. You mean so if we go back.

Speaker 99:         00:57:09       When Louisiana passed that law requiring separate cars early civil rights groups were obviously horrified by this. But.

Speaker 100:        00:57:16       The railroad companies were actually mad about this too because they thought it would be much more expensive to run the trains if they had to have add additional trains so they'd have white cards and cars of color. And so civil rights activists and the railroad companies they recruited somebody named Homer Plessy who was seven eighths white one eighth African-American.

Speaker 5:          00:57:38       And they sent him to go sit in a white car on a train. He got into a first class white people's car.

Speaker 101:        00:57:46       And they sent somebody to go arrest him like they got a off duty police officer or something. Well they actually hired a detective. You could do that at the time that you could hire a private detective to make an arrest. And so they they hired that person too. So.

Speaker 102:        00:58:02       Plessy gets under the train the conductor comes by and Plessy is like just thought I should let you know I'm actually in a black. And the conductor says Well in that case you're going to need to be on the other car in this train. Homer Plessy says I'm good actually. I'm gonna be staying right here. And the conductor says No really. You have to move. And Homer Plessy says no really not gonna and things get heated and eventually this detective that they've hired comes in and arrest them.

Speaker 103:        00:58:33       And they brought a lawsuit. That's amazing the whole thing is cooked starting with the arrest to challenge the separate cars law and they were able to get it up to the U.S. Supreme Court and they were hoping that they would be able to establish that the idea of separating the races was unconstitutional.

Speaker 104:        00:58:51       But unfortunately they miss calculated and the court ruled that the law was constitutional. And what they got instead was separate but equal totally backfired. But.

Speaker 105:        00:59:04       It was this early example of this other way. You know if you can find a plaintiff or create a plaintiff you might be able to bypass the legislature and go to the Supreme Court instead.

Speaker 106:        00:59:15       The NAACP later picked up on this but they were the true geniuses they perfected it and they perfected it under circumstances where victories were highly unlikely.

Speaker 105:        00:59:27       For example in the early nineteen hundreds. They do things like send a black guy and a white guy all over New York City to segregated theaters.

Speaker 106:        00:59:36       And see if one of them was prevented from being seated.

Speaker 105:        00:59:40       And if they were they would sue those theaters and when victory is that way then there was this other law in Louisville Kentucky that said nobody could buy a house or live on a block in which white people lived if they were African-American. So they recruited a white guy to sell a house to a black guy and then they had the black guy refused to take the house so the white guy could say you said you would buy the house but now you're reneging on it.

Speaker 103:        01:00:07       They African-Americans said I'm not buying the house because I can't live there. White guy sues the black guy. Again it was a manufactured case.

Speaker 104:        01:00:14       That was one of the MWC piece first victories and that's the case where Justice Holmes said in a dissent that he ended up not publishing. Hey wait a minute. This isn't even a real case.

Speaker 103:        01:00:28       At the time. Anything that involved manufacturing a case or fomenting litigation. All of those things were legal. So not just unethical but actually illegal. Yes criminally illegal.

Speaker 52:         01:00:40       It was seen as something like how we see ambulance chasing today. The lawyers for the end WTOP were very aware of these statutes and this came to a head in the 1950s the MWC P wanted to get the court to end segregated schools. Basically they wanted to overturn Plessy vs. Ferguson and the way they were doing this. They you know they needed the plaintiffs. So the way they were looking for plaintiffs is going to meetings with parents and sort of quietly you know suddenly trying to ask parents if they wanted to be the face of these cases.

Speaker 2:          01:01:15       Now Virginia knew that they were doing this and they tightened up these regulations that said you know you can't drum up litigation to try to stop them from doing this. So the NAACP sued and they took this issue all the way to the Supreme Court.

Speaker 107:        01:01:30       That litigation is essential because no matter how illegal it is public officials are free and interfering in that case the Supreme Court said actually manufacturing litigation is is a form of political expression really.

Speaker 2:          01:01:48       And it is totally ok like free speech basically. Yeah like it's a way of expressing your political viewpoint and test case litigation exploded after this and in the 60s and 70s.

Speaker 104:        01:01:59       A lot of other movements the women's movement poor people's movement saw the success the civil rights movement was having with these strategies that they adopted them as well.

Speaker 77:         01:02:10       And now I guess that includes Ed Blum Yeah the founding principles of the civil rights movement have been embraced by the vast majority of Americans in this country and those founding principles those founding principles guide these lawsuits that basic fundamental guiding principle of the civil rights movement and how it needs to be applied today.

Speaker 58:         01:02:36       I am that's I can't say what I think of that on family on Family Radio that that is that is not. That is not accurate. Absolutely is not carrying the standard forward for civil rights in America. That is not what he's doing.

Speaker 1:          01:02:50       But Ali says he is actually doing something that's deeply important to our political system.

Speaker 58:         01:02:55       When you look at the current election cycle I see a lot of people who who agree with Ed Blum they agreed with him in a way that shouldn't be expressed in the polls. They're out there. This is one way for that. I mean I mean and that happens I think again that's another callback to the civil rights movement when you have a minority population who believes in something they just get trampled in popular elections. OK. But do they still have a voice. Should they still have a voice. Should they still have a way to enact change on their behalf over the will of the majority. Again that seems to me textbook what courts are supposed to be able to do to look out for the rights of the minorities political minorities more than kind of ethnic or racial religious and see that they are not being trampled by majority driven attorney. Ed Blum is helping a minority of people who believe what he believes.

Speaker 108:        01:03:48       I'm so not prepared for you saying any of this is really surprising to me.
