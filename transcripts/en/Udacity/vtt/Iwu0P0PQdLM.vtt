00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So check it out, here's your friend and somehow your friend got to go on a spaceship ride,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and they're moving at 60% the speed of light, and here you are down at earth

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
bored watching your friend, jealousing.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, since you guys know some special relativity, you guys agreed on an experiment.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So what your friend said he's going to do, he's going to hold a little stop watch

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and every 8 seconds, he's going to wave at you--hello.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So you know that in his frame of reference every 8 seconds he's waving.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So I want to know in your frame of reference using your clock measuring t',

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
how long is the time interval between waves.

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Remember, he's waving every 8 seconds.
