CHRIS DIBONA: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.170
My name's Chris DiBona.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.450
I normally look after open
sourcey stuff for the company.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.830
But I also help out on the
NASA relationship side.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.130
And one of the things that we
were talking about with the

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.510
folks at Ames and at NASA was
having more sort of the right

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.990
exchange of people back and
forth between Ames and between

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.980
here in Mountain View
and Google.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.410
And so this is sort of the
beginning of that.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.950
What we want to do is basically
have a monthly, or

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.790
even more than that, series of
speakers coming over to speak

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.500
about interesting topics from
our friends at NASA about all

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.090
of the things they
work on there.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.780
And so this is the first taste
of that with Mike Micire.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.520
MIKE MICIRE: Close enough.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.440
CHRIS DIBONA: We were
working on the

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.880
pronunciation of his last name.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.380
Apparently, anything with M and
an E at the end is enough.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.950
So the added distance in so
many words is just very

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.940
appealing to me.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.350
Yeah, so he's going to talk
about the Android thing.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.680
One thing I want to point out.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.980
If you want to help with this
particular project, we have a

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.640
form that you can fill out.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.810
I'd say email me, but give
me about a week or so.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.100
I'm still recovering
from Perth.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.650
But it's sort of a free time
thing where you can help out

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.040
with the SPHERES project.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.640
As well as with other NASA
projects I think

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.890
that would cover too.

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:30.180
MIKE MICIRE: So first
of all, thank you.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.600
First of all, the turnout,
this is awesome.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.520
I'm really excited to not only
show you a lot of the stuff

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.960
that we've been working on, but
there are lots of smiling

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.070
faces I see in the crowd that
actually helped us do the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.060
things that I'm going
to present here.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.910
And so I'm really kind of stoked
to tell you about the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.160
cool experiments and stuff that
we've been doing on the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.120
International Space Station.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.980
So I have basically two
versions of this talk.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.390
One version is very managery
and talks about level one

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.050
milestones and reach goals and
Gantt charts and other stuff.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.350
And I decided, because I kind
of feel like I'm amongst my

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.289
people here as far as the good
geekery goes, that this would

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.440
be kind of just a geek-to-geek
conversation.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.380
And so rather than dive into a
lot of the kind of managerial

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.700
details, I wanted to just talk
about the stuff, frankly, that

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.860
makes me get up and want to
go to work every morning.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.260
We've been privileged to do a
lot of really cool stuff.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.700
And so I'm just going to kind
of tell you the story that

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.160
brings us to current date
in terms of the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.830
stuff we've been doing.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.280
I'll also add, this actually
works better if it's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.030
interactive.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.740
And so if I hit a slide, and
you have a question or

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.290
something like that, just throw
up a hand and we can

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.330
dive into it.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.785
There's a lot of really, really
cool details that we

00:02:47.785 --> 00:02:48.440
can get into.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.790
And so I'll skim the surface,
and you guys let me figure out

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.790
when I need to dive.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.670
OK?

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.540
So right after we did one of our
first tests, actually some

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.910
folks here in your production
group frankly did a better job

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.500
of describing this than most.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.137
And so what I'm going to do is
we will start with a video.

00:03:11.137 --> 00:03:12.586
MALE SPEAKER: Five.

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:15.001
All three engines
up and burning.

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.263
Two, one, zero.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:18.580
And liftoff.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.850
The final liftoff of Atlantis.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.189
On the shoulders of the space
shuttle, America will

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:25.143
continue the dream.

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:28.960
MALE SPEAKER: The space shuttle
spreads its wings.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.880
DW WHEELER: What we're working
towards is a future in which

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.210
we can have robots that will
take over a lot of menial

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.700
tasks that astronauts do.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.030
Our first goal for our project
is to have ground controllers

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.650
driving the SPHERE around
on the space station.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.980
The SPHERE will take data and
pictures and sensor readings

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.760
and send that back
to the user.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.480
MIKE MICIRE: She hooks it to the
front, and at that point,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.960
the phone will be able
to tell the SPHERE

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.942
where it needs to go.

00:03:56.942 --> 00:04:00.340
The processor, the camera, and
all of the sensors that are in

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.750
the Nexus S become the brains
of the robot and tell the

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.670
SPHERE where it wants to fly.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.970
The wi-fi on the phone connects
to the station wi-fi.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.070
That gets linked down
to the ground.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.784
And then hopefully we're going
to be able to control it from

00:04:15.784 --> 00:04:16.419
the ground.

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.320
DW WHEELER: We chose the Nexus
S because the phone is very

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.370
easy to take apart.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.810
Android is easy to program.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.080
We're familiar with it.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.070
And we needed to make a lot of
customizations that are easier

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.930
to make with Android.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.330
MIKE MICIRE: Google was
also working on an

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.420
open source data logger.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.700
And it met our use case
requirements.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.790
CHARLES CHEN: You can download
this application for your

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.610
Android device.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.740
And that's the exact
same application as

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.760
what NASA is using.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.110
DW WHEELER: The more time that
the astronauts can spend doing

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.030
science, the more value we're
getting out of that

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.890
investment.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.225
MIKE MICIRE: Our goal is to
provide enough value to crew

00:04:49.225 --> 00:04:52.646
and enough value to operations
that they'll be able to keep

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:53.886
it up there for a long time.

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:55.870
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE],
Houston.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.854
MALE SPEAKER: Roger [INAUDIBLE],
Atlantis.

00:04:57.854 --> 00:04:59.342
MALE SPEAKER: Houston
now controlling

00:04:59.342 --> 00:05:00.830
the flight of Atlantis.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.770
MIKE MICIRE: OK, so hopefully
that sets the stage.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.030
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to back up in time

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.520
and kind of set up how we got
to where we are today.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.920
So geek test.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.222
Who knows what this is?

00:05:21.222 --> 00:05:22.930
MALE SPEAKER: It's
a training droid.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.680
MIKE MICIRE: Exactly.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.060
So it turns out if you back up
to, like, '98, '99-ish, there

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.550
was a couple different
groups that were--

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.690
strangely enough, all of them
kind of used this as

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.850
inspiration.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.210
And it's the idea that if you're
in a micro gravity

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.590
environment, can you have
something that would be able

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.850
to float around?

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.530
And of course, the fact that it
made little thruster sounds

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.050
and stuff like that made it a
perfect metaphor, because

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.510
everybody effectively
knows what this is.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.080
So if you step back,
this is PSA.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.620
And this was actually developed
out of Ames.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.330
And the whole idea with
this one is it was--

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.750
PSA stands for Personal
Satellite Assistant.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.730
And it truly is.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.360
If you remember from the Flubber
movie with Robin

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.210
Williams, the idea that it's his
little floating assistant

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.930
that will go around and do
things for him and bring him

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.700
stuff or be able to provide
instructions

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.520
or things for him.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.820
And so that was one of the many,
many goals that this

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.320
project had.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.810
Unfortunately, that program
was canceled.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.450
At around the same time, this is
AirCam, which was a project

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.340
out of JSC.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.670
And so this actually flew--

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.780
I think was one of the
STS-73, I think.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.100
Where they actually had-- this
is about the size of a

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.140
basketball.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.780
And it was able to fly around
in the back of shuttle.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.130
Basically what they did was they
took the safer pack that

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.400
you see lot of the famous shots
of the astronauts doing

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.420
space walks in.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.640
And they took the human part
out, compacted it down.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.630
And when it flew, it essentially
looks like this.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.330
And so they were able to very
successfully fly that around

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.250
and provide that as a
demonstration of how you might

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.700
have a free flyer working
in space.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.150
Now, this is EVA.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.330
So this is outside as opposed
to PSA, which was for inside

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.640
of station.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.130
Now, at almost exactly the same
time, MIT had a-- and it

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.530
was like an undergraduate
capstone class where they were

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.910
trying to figure out, OK.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.990
Can you use these small
satellites for doing testing?

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.820
They basically wanted to
create a test bed.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.950
Because it turns out if you're
writing an algorithm for a

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.260
satellite or something and you
put it in space and it messes

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.000
up and manages to de-orbit
itself, that's both

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.020
frustrating and expensive.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.760
But if we can do some of those
tests inside of station where

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.820
you have an astronaut there that
can grab it if it starts

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.450
flying off and doing the wrong
thing and be able to reset and

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.460
kind of iterate, that
there would be a

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.830
lot of value in that.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.730
This is a bit of a
Cinderella story.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.610
Because it truly did go from
being a project that students

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.470
were working on to, fast forward
to 10 years, and this

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.290
is basically what we have now.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.770
There are three of
these on station.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.780
We have, I believe, four
of them on the ground.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.260
And one of them lives
over at Ames.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.670
And we have a whole lab where
we use this day in, day out

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.860
for a bunch of different
projects and a bunch of

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.060
different science that
we're trying to do.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.370
Just briefly diving into some
of the semantics here.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.410
So the way the SPHERES work,
basically, is there's a CO2

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.860
tank that plugs into
the bottom of it.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.710
This is a CO2 tank exactly like
what you would use on

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.030
paintball guns.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:40.900
In fact, whenever our CO2
bottles end up getting low,

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.559
we've had situations where
we didn't have resupply.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.040
And we actually will go to
Sports Authority and them

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.130
refill our-- and of course, they
say, is this for a paint

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.480
gun And we're like, no,
it's for a satellite.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.900
And they're like, oh, OK.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.390
So basically, the CO2 tank, it's
liquid CO2 that's passed

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.550
through a regulator.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.930
The regulator then puts it
through tubing, basically,

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.670
inside that goes out to
these little yellow

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.050
thrusters that you see.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.870
And there's a little solenoid
on each of those thrusters.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.520
And so what the computer inside
is able to do is it

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.190
will just activate each
of those solenoids.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.740
And that's how it releases
the thrust.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.630
There's also ultrasonic
receivers on the outside that

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.180
I'll talk about in a second.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.075
Because it's one thing to be
able to move yourself through

00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:23.840
the environment.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.250
But to do that meaningfully,
you have to

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.500
know where you are.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.630
So that ends up being one
of the difficult tasks.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.920
If you pop the hood on it, it
turns out that it's basically

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.100
an aluminum frame in which we
pack an insane amount of

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.720
electronics and sensors
and other things into.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.790
Basically, one of the things
here that's kind of

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.050
interesting is for these
it actually uses

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.660
alkaline battery packs.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.470
And so part of our job as far as
maintaining these is we end

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.540
up resupplying double A
batteries, basically, for

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.690
these satellites.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.160
So I mentioned--

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.200
and I'm not going to go too
much of the details here.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.750
But basically, the way the
SPHERE figures out where it

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:09.060
is, is it's floating in the
middle of a six by six by six

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.240
foot volume.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.750
OK?

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.990
The first thing the SPHERE
does-- it has these little IR

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.790
transmitters on it.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.330
And so it sends out
an IR pulse.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.450
And you can think of that
as starting clock.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.930
So it starts clock.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.950
And then there's five beacons.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.230
And on 20 millisecond
intervals, they have

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.980
ultrasonic transmitters that
begin counting off.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.620
So start the pulse and then one,
two, three, four, five.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.320
Each of those will do a click.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.770
Now, the SPHERE, I mentioned
before, has these little

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.280
ultrasonic receivers all the way
around the outside of it.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.030
It turns out that if you
consider the first pulse to be

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.090
the speed of light, which is
really fast, the speed of

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.430
sound is relatively slow
compared to that.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.910
If you do the timing from the
beacon to the satellite, you

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.310
can actually do some math--

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.080
basically do some
triangulation--

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.460
and figure out where it is.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.010
That plus a Coleman filter
gets us within a couple

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.390
centimeters of where the actual
position of the SPHERE

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.110
is within the six by six
by six foot volume.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.840
So it's great in the fact that
it has a really good and

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.360
accurate idea of where it is.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.910
The kind of downside is that
in a given module, this is

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.770
basically the only place
where we can fly.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.210
Because if it gets outside of
that right now, it just

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.780
doesn't have the sensing
capability to figure out where

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.020
it is, to know where it
needs to go next.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.100
What's cool is when they're
working, this is

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.070
what it looks like.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.705
Now, I will admit, this is sped
up by about eight times.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.520
So although they are awesome,
is a bit like

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.120
watching grass grow.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.330
The cool part, though, is that
the astronauts love these.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.050
And actually we never
have any problem.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.880
Once we can get crew time,
they're usually very excited

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.530
to play with these.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.830
And you can see, I
actually love--

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.840
Don Pettit's little toes
are just wiggling.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.630
And if this doesn't get you a
little geek heart going, you

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.740
may want to go ahead
and leave now.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.690
Because at least for me, this
is as very, very cool and by

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.280
the way, if you haven't, look up
"Saturday Morning Science"

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.000
with Don Pettit.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.650
He's a pretty amazing geek, and
he will change, frankly,

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.810
the way you look at the world.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.590
So let's then step into human
exploration and telerobotics.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.070
And I'm not going to
go through these

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:24.860
in any great detail.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.430
But just say that right now, we
live in a world where, at

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.070
least when I leave in the
morning, I reach down and kick

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.110
the little on button
on my Roomba.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.310
And by the time I get home,
my house is vacuumed.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.130
Google is doing amazing work
with the autonomous driving

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:39.990
cars and other things.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.060
We live in a world today where
we're beginning to expect

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.060
robots to help improve our lives
and the things that we

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.180
have to do.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.090
Our motivations are exactly the
same, but in the context

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.390
of the ISS and space travel.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:58.110
So right now, for the crew that
we have on station, crew

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:03.200
time is not only extremely
valuable, but there's so much

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.770
upkeep and other maintenance
type things that they have to

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:09.480
do that sometimes the science
has to take the backseat.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.860
So anything that we can do that
helps them get rid of

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.630
some of those menial tasks, or
helps ground controllers not

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.080
have to directly involve crew,
or improves the communication

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.000
between ground and crew is all
just huge value that we're

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.120
bringing to the resource of ISS
and any future exploration

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.370
that we do.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.620
In this picture, one important
thing to see here is that we

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.430
have the SPHERES.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.650
And we're using those as kind of
our platform, our test bed.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.460
And there's really two ways
that we're feeding this.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:50.120
It's not only crew being able to
control a robot on station,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.200
but it's also ground controllers
being able

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.200
to work with this.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.980
And these end up being two
dramatically different

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.630
situations.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.250
Because when you're
on the ground, you

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.180
have huge time delays.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.510
So it's not just going to be
like a radio controlled car

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.900
where you flip the switch and
suddenly you're piloting it

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.650
around on station.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:11.200
There's a lot of really smart
software that has to go into

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.470
those SPHERES to make
that workable.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.970
The other thing is if any of you
ever want to come over and

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.800
try to fly a sphere,
even in 2D--

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.810
we have a granite table where
you can fly it around.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.500
The fact that, like with a radio
controlled car, if you

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.350
take your hand off the stick,
friction and other things will

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.800
eventually cause that little
car to come to a stop.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.310
As someone who grew up with
radio controlled cars and

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.580
airplanes and other kinds of
stuff, it was humbling to try

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.530
to control a free flyer in a
frictionless environment, even

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.840
in two dimensions.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.420
And so even if you wanted to,
you're not just going to have

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.170
somebody joy-sticking
this thing around.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.830
So we said, OK.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.530
The SPHERES is an amazing
platform.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.060
We have lots of capability
here.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.380
But one problem that we have
is the CPU that is in that

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.520
thing is already pretty
busy doing the math of

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.040
triangulation.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.980
And it's about a decade old
processor at this point.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:10.860
So it's an old TI-DSP running
at about 170 megahertz.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.700
So amazing in its day, but by
today's standards, a little

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.790
difficult to work with.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:18.520
So we were like, all right.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.820
Well, we're good geeks.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.010
We'll just upgrade it.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:21.960
Upgrades are the way to go.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.460
And so, believe it or not, we
didn't start this project by

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.060
saying, we are going to put
an Android phone or a

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.920
smartphone in space.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.730
We laid the trade space
up on the white board.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:34.230
And we said, OK.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.200
Well, it's going to
need to be small.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.390
It needs to be power-efficient.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.900
It needs to have integrated
sensors, low power.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.870
Of course, it would be cool if
it had like a Unix operating

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.490
system on it.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.450
And we laid all this up
on the whiteboard.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.890
And of course, we're
all sitting there

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:53.500
checking our emails.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.840
I don't know where we're ever
going to find a device that

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.680
satisfies all of these
requirements.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.930
This is impossible.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.730
And what we realized very
quickly was that a smartphone

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.980
would be a very, very good way
to attack this problem, as

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.350
opposed to trying
to roll our own.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.520
Now, that's humbling to say.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.340
That even NASA cannot outrun the
technological advancements

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.210
that are happening in the mobile
phone market today.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.260
That's pretty crazy.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.600
Yeah, question.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.590
His question was, how fast
are the control loops?

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.970
And I'm assuming you're talking
about for the actual

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.590
spheres themselves in terms
of their flight.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.810
And the answer is,
you have multiple

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.220
threads that are running.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.210
And so I don't know them off
the top of my head either.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.650
So we can geek out after the--
we'll take that offline.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.680
So we basically said,
all right.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.710
Well, a smartphone would be a
really great way to do this.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.290
And like I said, NASA is even
having a hard time outrunning

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.200
the advancements that are
happening in the mobile phone

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:01.870
market world.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:06.250
And now the question was,
well, what could we do

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.349
to make this work?

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:10.660
And your trade off between
building your own versus

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:15.450
buying COTS is that if you buy
COTS, whereas on the one side,

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.460
you have a lot of engineering
the needs to happen, on the

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.220
COTS side you have a lot
of reverse engineering

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.750
that needs to happen.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.180
And it's a little tricky when
you go to Samsung, for

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.950
instance, and say, hey, what
does your accelerometer do in

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.700
micro-gravity environments?

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.350
And they're going to smile and
go, well, you're NASA.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.180
You tell us.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.230
And so there was a bit
of a risk that we

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.270
had going into this.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:43.100
And frankly, we had no idea of
the many risks that we were

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.520
accepting by going
down this route.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.190
I throw this up.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.910
I'm actually going to come
back to this slide.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.950
But what I'm going to do is
talk through some of the

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.370
flight barriers, basically,
that we had.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.030
When you put something on a
spacecraft in orbit, you have

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.130
lots of gatekeepers and flaming
hoops you have to jump

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.640
through to prove to NASA and
the safety guys that you're

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.020
not going to cause problems
on the spacecraft.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.900
And so what I'm going to do,
I'm going to dive through

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.180
actually a subset of these and
show you some of the hacking.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.960
It's not only hardware hacking
but software hacking, and in a

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.280
final case even social hacking
to kind of make the whole

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.350
thing happen.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.720
Let me first begin by saying,
God bless the internet.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.970
Because what happened was we had
talked with a couple other

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.810
groups that were using one
of the Nexus 1 phones.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.700
And there were just some
barriers they were having to

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.510
climb through that we were like,
well, the Nexus S really

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:42.450
seems like the phone that we
probably want to fight with.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:49.180
And iFixit somehow, about a day
or so prior to the release

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.760
of the Nexus S, managed
to do a tear down.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.240
So we immediately
said, all right.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.950
Well, let's start looking at
what this thing's got.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.970
And the one thing that we were
told very early on was that we

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:05.770
had to hardware disable the
cellular phone functionality

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.080
of the phone.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.290
For the same reason that when
you get on an airplane, you

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.330
have to either put it in
airplane mode or physically

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.150
turn it off.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.370
It turns out the ISS has similar
rules, and it's pretty

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.190
much all the time.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.770
It needs to be in an
airplane mode.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.940
And we told them-- we said,
well, in the kernel, we can

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.830
completely disable the phone's
ability to talk to the radio.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.810
We'll guarantee that
there's no way this

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.260
radio can be activated.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.590
And unfortunately, the comeback
was, well, no.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.360
Actually, it needs to be
a hardware disable.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.520
You have to have a hardware
switch or some way of

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.525
physically making sure that
transmitter can never fire up.

00:19:38.525 --> 00:19:40.050
And we were like, OK.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.000
Well, I guess then one way of
doing that would be to pull

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.990
the-- basically your
TX front end.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.150
This is the cellular phone
part of the phone.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.480
And we were pretty sure that if
we could disable that chip

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.210
that we would be able
to pull that off.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:59.090
So myself and one of my other
engineers actually camped out

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.950
at the Best Buy up
at [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.320
And I think there were 13 phones
that were delivered to

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.130
that Best Buy.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.620
We got numbers 11 and 12.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.440
Immediately took it back to the
lab, completely pulled it

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.330
apart, and laid up
on a heat bath.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.750
Basically what this does is--

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.840
you can think of it
like a crazy hair

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.680
dryer blowing upward.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.990
And the whole idea is what
you want to do is you

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.840
want to heat the board.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.060
And then this is an air pen.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.820
Basically, we knew that this
chip was a BGA, which means

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.400
it's soldered on the bottom.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.210
And unfortunately, with it being
a BGA, you're not just

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.490
going to take an exacto knife
and cut the enable pen and

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.660
have it work.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.360
So we said, all right,
we've got this.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.060
We're going to own it.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.530
And we failed epically.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.830
I laid this up under the
microscope, and it looked like

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.530
a tiny little Civil
War battlefield.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.680
There were capacitors
and resistors just

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.200
strewn all over this.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.670
But I'm a big fan of fail
fast and fail often.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:05.580
And so we were like,
all right.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.400
We've got two phones.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.890
Let's screw up a second one.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:12.680
And the important subtlety to
this presentation is you can

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.570
see, actually, this is
now glowing red.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.055
So we were like, well,
let's burn it up.

00:21:17.055 --> 00:21:19.440
Worst thing we can do is
ruin another phone.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.640
And so the cool part was we
actually managed to figure out

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.570
a way to lift that chip.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.790
And we got pretty good at it,
to the point where you could

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.840
pull it, you could clean it
up under the microscope.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.900
And the phone is none
the wiser, luckily.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.920
It just thinks it's sitting out
in the middle of Nevada

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.910
somewhere with no
signal strength.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.540
And it just kind of quietly
sits there not getting

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.670
cellphone access.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.990
The next thing we needed to
figure out is, we were told

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:48.660
lithium ion batteries were very,
very hard to certify to

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.180
get on station.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.060
It has to do with the way that
lithium can sometimes go super

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.390
critical, depending on
what you do with it.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.670
But we were told, if you go
alkaline batteries-- if you go

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.580
double A batteries,
that works.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.970
There's so many things on the
station that run off of double

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.270
A batteries.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.460
You hear the metric of how
many dollars per pound it

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.270
costs to lift something
into space.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.200
I don't ever want to do the
math on how many double A

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.440
batteries we resupply to
the space station.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.890
So it was like OK, so let's find
something that will hold

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.820
double A batteries.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.590
Luckily, I think Adafruit
was where we got this

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.420
space-certified battery
holder.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.180
We basically sourced
a battery holder.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.750
We had already done some other
projects with this little guy,

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.350
which is a basically a DC to
DC switching regulator.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.530
And the important part is it's
got this little adjustment

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.650
knob on the front of it.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.510
And we figured, all right.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.460
Well, we'll feed it with
double A batteries.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.580
And then we'll let this little
switching regulator trick the

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:53.330
phone into thinking it's
got a lithium battery.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.940
It's important to make sure that
you don't charge the DC

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.770
to DC, though.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:01.630
So we threw just a simple
little diode in there.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.370
We basically ruined the back of
another Nexus S phone and

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.780
figured out how to cut all of
this out so it would fit, and

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.820
then started doing
some testing.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.155
And this is another just kind of
get it done moment where it

00:23:12.155 --> 00:23:13.740
was like, well, we could
instrument this whole thing

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.490
where we were logging the
voltages and stuff like that.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:19.400
So what we ended up doing was
just taking a phone, putting

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.350
it on time lapse, taking
pictures of two volt meters

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.530
until the phone went dead.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.470
And then took all of those
pictures and hand entered them

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:29.640
into a spreadsheet.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.170
Now, there's and important
subtlety here.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.250
You'll see why it's important
in a second.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.930
In this case, I'm actually
taping the phone to my laptop

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.290
because I didn't have anything
else to stand it up against.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.750
And there was a moment where I
was like, well actually, I

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.020
just taped it to my laptop.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.090
How am I going to push
the buttons?

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.280
And it turns out you can push
buttons through tape.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.200
And so the whole thing
ended up working.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.930
And the good news is we were
able to fake a phone into

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.830
basically running off of
double A batteries.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.900
We can get about seven
hours out of it.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.540
And the important part here.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.840
Lithium ions cruise along and
then drop hard in the end.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.070
And that's, frankly, why
everybody that does digital

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.010
electronics loves them.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.940
Because it'll hold a reasonably
constant voltage

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:08.850
for a long time.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:10.300
That's what an alkaline does.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.200
And so the DC to DC ends
up being a great

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.140
little tool for us.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.020
So the other thing that we
were told was, you've got

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.950
glass on the front
of this phone.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:26.510
What happens if an astronaut
decides to fast pitch it, and

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:30.580
it goes into the corner of some
handrail or something,

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.370
and he breaks that glass?

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.950
And now you've got little
shards of glass.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.330
We break glass here on earth,
and the glass falls to the

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.750
ground, and everybody goes,
ooh, don't stand near the

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.580
glass, because you might
get it in your feet.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.060
In micro gravity, though, those
are little shards of

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.420
things that you may breathe.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.305
That ends up being a much, much
more significant hazard.

00:24:48.305 --> 00:24:50.230
And so we were told,
all right.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.460
You need some way to
contain the glass.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.080
Now luckily, I had already
accidentally figured out that

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.540
clear acrylic packing tape,
that you can touch the

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.350
capacitive touch screen
through that.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:04.430
It kind of makes those $20
screen protectors at Best Buy

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.910
seem a little expensive,
doesn't it?

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.960
Now pretty much for all my
screen protectors, I just lay

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.720
packing tape over it, and
then take an exacto

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.050
knife around the edges.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:13.850
And that's basically
what we did here.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:19.750
It turns out that acrylic tape
is considered flammable by ISS

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.700
safety considerations.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.500
So we actually ended up
using Teflon tape.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.305
Because we had actually done it
all up in acrylic, and they

00:25:25.305 --> 00:25:28.180
were like, no, no, no, no.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.380
So of course, once you do
it, you have to test it.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.650
And so we destroyed another
perfectly good Nexus S. But it

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.900
was for science.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.520
And the good news here
was we were able to

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.070
basically contain the glass.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.330
So both of the phones that
we actually flew are

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.390
covered in this tape.

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:51.400
And you can pretty obnoxiously
damage the screen, and of

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.030
course it keeps all
the glass intact.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.410
And when you get it all put
together, this is what it

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:00.690
looks like on a SPHERE.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:04.670
Basically, we Velcro it
right to the front.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:10.045
As Han Solo said, it doesn't
look like much, but it's got

00:26:10.045 --> 00:26:11.690
it where it counts.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:17.340
And what this did was we
flew these on the last

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.280
shuttle that went up.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.320
Now, there's an important
point here.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.510
And that's that with all of this
amazing hardware hacking

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.730
and other fun stuff that we were
doing, we knew we were

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.130
going to come right
up to the wire.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.220
And we had no software
written.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.670
No software written.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.150
Which would kind of be the
whole point, right?

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.280
Well, it turns out that,
luckily, we were really kind

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.200
of talking to actually
some folks that are

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.750
even in this room.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.930
And you had a group here, the
cellbots, motley crew, as I'll

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.310
call them, that were already
working on some really, really

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.790
cool apps that were enabling
robotic-like interaction, but

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:53.860
using Android.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.340
And so we ended up having this
wonderful collaboration in

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.770
figuring out how to take this
open source logger and allow

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.600
it to then run on station.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.210
This gets back to the whole
question of going to a sensor

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.790
manufacturer and say, what
does your sensor do in

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:11.580
micro-gravity?

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.440
They are going to almost drop
the phone laughing at you.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.390
And you also have to remember
that a lot of these sensors

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:17.690
are born out of other places.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.970
So like the accelerometers
that we use.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.660
A lot of that technology
actually came out of the

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.430
automotive industry where it was
for deploying airbags in

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.100
very high g environments.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.240
So we had all kinds of questions
of, will these

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.350
sensors have the sensitivity
that we need to provide the

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.120
information that we want?

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.190
So this ended up being a kind of
a great addition and ended

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.090
up being one of the first tests
that we ended up doing

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.310
with the phone.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.420
So let me circle back and talk
about some of the barriers.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.590
So the first one-- procurement
and certificate of

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:52.430
conformance.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:56.090
Real quick, a certificate of
conformance is basically--

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.100
let's say you're some
aero, astro company.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.720
And I say, I need a flux
capacitor, and I needed it to

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.410
conform to the following
things.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:05.190
And I give you a set
of requirements.

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.420
And then you run off, and you
build me a flux capacitor.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.960
And then you come
back with it.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.050
And you say, here's your
flux capacitor.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.750
And here's a certificate of
conformance that says that

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:17.710
this conforms to the following
requirements that you gave me.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:22.318
That's required for virtually
everything that flies.

00:28:22.318 --> 00:28:24.575
Do you know how to get a
certificate of conformance for

00:28:24.575 --> 00:28:29.790
a Nexus S that you bought
at Best Buy?

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.210
The answer is you show up
five minutes to closing.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.690
You go to find the manager, and
you basically hand him a

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.570
piece of paper that says, Hi.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.180
I'd like you to sign a piece
of paper that says that a

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:43.350
Nexus S is a Nexus S. And he
will look at you cross-eyed.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.910
And the good news is you can
actually get him to sign it.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.330
And we ended up doing this,
like, for instance, for the

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:49.240
battery holder.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.565
I don't think that Adafruit had
ever worked with anybody

00:28:52.565 --> 00:28:55.000
who needed a certificate of
conformance for a double a

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.020
battery holder before.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.850
And so that was the one thing
that we found is that the

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.310
process that we use wasn't quite
tuned for the kind of

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.860
cool hackery and other things
that we were doing here.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.150
I talked about disabling
the cellphone

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.040
part and the batteries.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.120
The glass breakage
was a problem.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.130
Mechanical drawings.

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.340
It turns out if you go to
Samsung and say, hi, I would

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.270
like the full CADs and
schematics for your phone.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.750
Can I have that?

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.645
And so we basically ended up
having to kind of generate our

00:29:26.645 --> 00:29:30.240
own mechanicals for
all of this.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.580
The second-to-last one.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.280
So here's a cool, fun fact.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.600
All of the laptops that are up
on the International Space

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:42.040
Station are right now running
Windows XP Service Pack 3.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.140
Do you know what happens when
you plug in a Nexus S into a

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.030
Service Pack 3.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.280
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.110
MIKE MICIRE: Luckily no.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.980
Unfortunately, it starts
asking you for drivers.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.540
Of course.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.370
And unfortunately, to get a
driver certified for use on

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:59.470
one of these laptops
on station is a

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.640
multi-year Gantt chart.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.740
Basically, we looked at
certifying a driver, and it

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.960
was longer than our
whole program.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.320
And we were like, OK.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.880
So what we basically did was we
ended up building our own

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:17.380
firmware for the Nexus S where
we were able to allow the

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.210
phone to kick into mass storage
mode before it was

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.020
ever plugged in.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.970
I'm sure all of you know you
have to plug it in before it

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.950
asks you if you want to put
it into mass storage mode.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:29.160
Because basically the UUID for
the mass storage device,

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.670
Windows XP Service
Pack 3 liked.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:35.930
Whereas the USB multiplexer
that was on it would

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.620
immediately kick it into, I am
Windows, and I don't know what

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.740
you're plugging into me.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.070
Please hit OK or tell
me where to go.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.310
And so we were able to go
through and basically modify

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.910
the OS to our needs, which
was really important.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.220
Because that would've
been a non starter.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.340
And we didn't figure this
out until the 11th

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.610
hour, almost literally.

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.670
It was at the end, and we
plugged it into one of the

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:55.780
test laptops, and it's
like, driver disk.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.150
And we all had a heart attacks
simultaneously.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.270
And then also, like I said, we
had no time for software

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:01.700
development.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.550
And this is where a lot of the
folks in this audience and

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.210
with the cellbots group were
able to help us out

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:08.690
and back fill that.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:13.850
So they took-- we actually
had the phones built.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.470
I love this picture, because I
think the packing instructions

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:20.545
were more complicated than
anything we did prior to that.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:22.772
MALE SPEAKER: I have a question
about the phone issue

00:31:22.772 --> 00:31:23.520
and the USB.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.555
MIKE MICIRE: Yes.

00:31:24.555 --> 00:31:26.640
MALE SPEAKER: Why did you need
to plug it in the USB at all

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.330
if you-- can you
use the wi-fi?

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.840
MIKE MICIRE: So actually, very
early on, we were not cleared

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.770
for using wi-fi.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.860
The network on ISS,
of course, can't

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.750
call out to the internet.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.860
And so we had debated the idea
of, well, could we load the

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.500
APK through and 80B
over wi-fi.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.870
And basically, what it came down
to is the shortest path

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.260
was for us to--

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:55.360
we uplink the APK to station.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.910
They put the phone into
mass storage mode.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.780
We copy the APK over to the
SD card on the phone.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.370
And then we have basically an
app on there that'll do a

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:06.260
local APK install.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:11.240
And that was the shortest path
to get us through to flight.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.230
So we're actually now going back
and-- frankly, now that

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.920
we know a lot more about
Android than we did

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.680
originally, we're
going back and

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.160
revisiting that whole process.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.490
And it would be very cool
to be able to just

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:24.830
load it over the wi-fi.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:29.110
So it went up on 135, which
was really cool.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.150
For myself, not only being able
to know that my team had

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.680
cool little stuff sitting in the
back of that pickup truck.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.560
But we also got to go down there
with a lot of the folks

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.560
that helped us to build
this thing out.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.385
Yes.

00:32:40.385 --> 00:32:42.660
MALE SPEAKER: Does the phone
connect to [INAUDIBLE] the

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.030
SPHERE, or no?

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.030
MIKE MICIRE: We'll get to
that in just a second.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.460
So the question was, does the
phone connect to the SPHERE.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.220
And it would be very
anti-climatic if it didn't.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.880
So Atlantis passed
it into ISS.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.550
And actually, I was just
reminded that the anniversary

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.290
of this is pretty much
a year ago today.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:05.240
This is the SPHERE with a phone
stuck to the front of it

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.780
flying around on ISS.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.640
And this is what
it looks like.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.860
This is, again, sped up for
your viewing pleasure.

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.300
But you can see that
the phone's kind of

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.460
stuck to the front.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:21.100
And what this is doing is the
SPHERE is running through a

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:25.140
series of maneuvers that are
allowing us to log basically

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.640
what all the sensors
are seeing.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.720
So we didn't know if the
accelerometer was going to

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.620
have enough sensitivity.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.670
We didn't know if the gyro was
going to be able to detect the

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.160
change in movement and such.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.890
And so this was kind
of our acid test.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:39.800
You'll also notice--

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.390
I apologize for the
video quality.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.630
Hopefully this will load.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.030
There we go.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.940
We were having a bit of a
problem with the SPHERE that

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.600
day with it resetting.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.920
And it had to do with the IR
mechanism I was talking about

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.880
being jammed by the lights that
are on station there.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.690
It turns out when a fluorescent
light begins

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:05.490
malfunctioning, it emits a
lot in the IR spectrum.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:10.010
And so we basically to turn
the lights way down.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:11.889
So what you're seeing
here is this is the

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:13.610
view out of the camera.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:17.810
And this is me doing some
guerrilla image processing to

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.469
bring the light levels up.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:23.320
And so the good news is that,
at least in terms of camera

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:27.300
performance, even in low light
conditions, that we're able to

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.170
see artifacts and figure
out what's going on

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.370
and where it's flying.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:35.300
The gyro.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.679
We smile because--

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.560
what we've got here.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.830
So this is the test on
the ground, and this

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.190
is the test on orbit.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:44.650
And each of the little kind of
edges that you see here,

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.370
that's a thruster firing.

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:49.780
So you're actually seeing
the change there.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.420
And the good news is, based on
what we see on the ground

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.320
where we can only really move
in a 2D plane, we do have

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.540
enough sensitivity in the
gyroscope to be a useful

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.911
sensor to us.

00:35:00.911 --> 00:35:03.170
MALE SPEAKER: How well
did the compass work?

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.380
MIKE MICIRE: This is the
one that surprised us.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:09.090
We did not expect the compass
to be useful.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:09.720
We were like, I don't know.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.160
What does the magnetic field
look like in orbit?

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.180
I'm sure it's there, but what
does north mean when you're

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:19.560
going 17,000 miles an hour in
an orbit that is like this.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.510
North becomes very relative.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:26.110
But to our surprise, this
actually is working a lot

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.260
better than we thought.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.280
And we're actually investigating
using this.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.120
Because there are ways, a
course, for us to know where

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.160
ISS is in orbit.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.520
And so if you can
come up with--

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.660
granted, north moves for you.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.010
But then they tell you, even in
the base case, may tell you

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.160
interesting information like,
where is the floor?

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.930
Sometimes for a robot,
that's an important

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:47.870
question to begin with.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.180
I don't need to know my
absolute pointing.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.080
But if you can just tell me
where the floor and the

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.700
ceiling is, that allows me to
bootstrap some of the higher

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.250
level algorithms that
I might use to

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.070
begin localizing myself.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:03.340
So this is one that frankly, we
have very important people

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.637
working on this right now.

00:36:04.637 --> 00:36:07.102
MALE SPEAKER: Are there other
scientific instruments with

00:36:07.102 --> 00:36:11.130
magnetometers doing any sort
of magnetic science?

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.080
MIKE MICIRE: Yes.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.160
And so we are actually working
with actually a couple

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.050
different groups.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:21.310
And what's kind of fascinating
too is we have talked with

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:24.650
other research groups within
NASA that were

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:25.620
surprised about this too.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.710
And now we're talking about
possibly rolling smartphones

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.360
into other products that are
not even robotics related.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.510
They're like, wait, you can
get pointing out of that?

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:35.150
That's very cool.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:41.420
The gravity sensor, it turns
out, couldn't detect gravity.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.330
Which is good.

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:44.070
That means you know we
didn't fake this in a

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.320
sound stage in LA.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.570
And so that was kind of fun.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.230
The bad news is, unfortunately,
the

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:54.930
accelerometer just doesn't
have enough sensitivity.

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.160
It ends up being
a lot of noise.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.110
And we're actually looking with
a couple different folks

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.990
at seeing if we can pull
signal out of this.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:05.910
Now, that's kind of
the bad news.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:09.110
The good news is the SPHERES
actually have really, really,

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:12.200
really good accelerometers
already inside of them.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.210
So this would have been kind
of a freebie if we could've

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.270
used the phone's
accelerometer.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.510
But sadly, at least it looks
like right now, that that

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:21.760
won't be a sensor
we'll be using.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:27.350
So we then said, OK.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:31.020
Well, that gives us a baseline
as far as what the sensors can

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:31.840
and can't do.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.030
So we said, let's look at what
the network's going to be able

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.020
to do to us.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:42.840
This is a very, very simplified
drawing of ISS down

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.910
to Building-- this is Building
30, which is the mission

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.750
control center in Houston.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:52.750
And we have a workstation
that's down there

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:53.800
that we can sit at.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.690
And the question was, how do you
get through all of these

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.290
pipes and up to the top?

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.820
And so what we first did was,
because the code that we were

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:05.080
running was written in Java,
we were able to take and

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:11.130
basically port it over to a
normal Linux Java install.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:15.040
And we remote controlled a
PC and emulated a phone.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.020
And made sure that we could talk
from station all the way

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.470
down to the workstation
that we had there.

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:23.690
This is actually
us sitting in--

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:27.380
its basically an engineering
back room in mission control.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.770
And those images, believe it
or not, even though it's a

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:34.280
video on the ground, those
images are actually coming

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.860
from the space station.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.710
And I apologize for
the shaky video.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:40.450
It turns out it's really hard to
record things and take them

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:41.870
out of mission control.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:45.080
And so the way that we capture
most of this is me standing

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.920
there with my smartphone trying
to be as still as

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.920
possible videotaping
the screen.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.860
And this was able to show-- we
had echo tests and other

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.670
things that we were running.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.130
And that gave us a really good
benchmark of what was working

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.240
and not working.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.880
The other important part here
is this isn't just us.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.790
There's actually a whole team
that is out at Johnson Space

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.950
Center that helps us.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:10.600
And so what was really fun is
that after we got out of the

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.010
kind of geekery and engineering
that we were

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:14.230
doing, we found out that there's
this whole other kind

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.990
of extended family that we have
out there that's helping

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.180
us get a lot of this
work done.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:23.490
The thing that was really cool
after this experiment was we

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.670
got an opportunity to walk out
on the floor of mission

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:30.950
control and talk to the flight
director, who immediately was

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:35.020
like, what you guys are
doing is amazing work.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:42.360
I want Google Video chat on a
robot as soon as you can.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.080
And it was pretty validating.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.290
Because frankly, up to this
point, we knew we were doing

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.110
good science.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:52.550
But it's just nice when folks
that are doing the hard work,

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:54.790
that are there at the consoles
come up to you and

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.390
say, this is cool.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:57.340
This is value.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.630
Can you please continue doing
what you're doing?

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:02.940
And so to have the flight
director for that orbit say, I

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:03.990
want video chat.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.440
I want to be able to chase
astronauts around.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.830
And the big thing--

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:14.120
if you watch NASA TV a little
bit, and you see the way like

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.030
the cameras are set up.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.035
And you'll see astronauts flying
around and doing stuff

00:40:17.035 --> 00:40:18.850
or whatever.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:19.850
That's great.

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.880
But what's really tough is when
that astronauts working

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.180
on your experiment.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.260
And you need that kind of over
the shoulder view, right?

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.280
And what they'll do is you'll
spend the first 15 minutes of

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.480
any crew interaction setting
up the camera and

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.750
getting it in place.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.500
And then the astronaut will go
down and immediately get in

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.160
front of the camera
and begin working.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.140
And so especially for the ground
controllers, that's

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:46.540
huge to be able to nudge that
camera slightly and get a

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.640
view, or to go look at that
panel that's got the red light

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.880
and kind of figure out what's
happening there is just

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.020
bringing huge value
to these guys.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:58.500
So then it was on.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.740
It was like, OK, let's
use the phone.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.570
And the big thing that we were
testing here that was

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.710
different before was we had
the actual smartphone.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.190
And it was connecting over the
wireless access point.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:11.560
The tricky part here was, like
with any wireless network, the

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.610
wireless access point isn't
in the module that

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.930
we're working in.

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:19.790
And we were told repeatedly,
it's like, oh, well, it's in

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:21.130
the next module.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:21.750
You'll be fine.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.640
The laptops use it
all the time.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.630
And I kept having to remind the
engineers, it's like, OK,

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:29.850
your Lenovo T61 laptops have
this huge antenna that wraps

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:30.740
the screen.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.670
Our antenna's about this big.

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:37.320
And we put a giant six pack
alkaline battery thing on the

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.780
back of this thing.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.880
Depending on which way this
thing's turned, we're

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.260
attenuating that signal
pretty significantly.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:47.380
The good news is we were
able to fire this up.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:53.500
And that is an astronaut
cruising around with the phone

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:58.510
just unceremoniously
stuck to the wall.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:03.480
And we ran this test and were
able to show that we're not

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.150
only able to get through all of
the tubes that we have to

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:11.480
get through, but that in terms
of wi-fi, actually, this was a

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.890
more difficult wi-fi connection
then what we expect

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:15.270
to see when we're in
the module that we

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:16.290
normally work in.

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:17.940
So we're good on wi-fi.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.930
And that was the
important part.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:24.860
Then, to your question, now that
we've tested comms and

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.430
we've tested sensors it would
be nice if we could actually

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:29.030
tell the SPHERE where to fly.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:31.990
And so we ended up building
out this this--

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:37.430
it's basically a USB cable
that's going to a level

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:38.455
converter inside.

00:42:38.455 --> 00:42:40.610
And that's connecting
to an expansion port

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:42.120
that's on the SPHERE.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.280
There's an important distinction
here in that we

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.280
are not using this
as a USB port.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:50.090
The Nexus S, as you may know,
has the ability to kick--

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.530
you can kick the USB
multiplexer into

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.070
a serial port mode.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:59.430
And so because the SPHERE only
supports serial and not USB,

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:02.190
we actually use this as a serial
port and then use a

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:06.110
custom protocol to talk
to the SPHERE inside.

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:10.730
That went up on one of the
Soyuz resupply missions.

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:12.320
And this is what
it looks like.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.880
So basically it just extends it
a little bit, and then with

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.840
the level converter kind of
tucks in between those two

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.720
plates there.

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.750
And this is an expansion port
that sits on the front of it

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.170
that crew can--

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:26.050
we are one of many experiments
that use this expansion port

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:27.650
for hooking things up.

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.650
The problem with being a
roboticist is that the

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.130
customer never wants
what you build.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:34.920
And so what this does is it
allows customers to come to

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.340
the table and strap their
sensors to the front.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.310
I show this not to explain it
but just to say, when you're

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:45.060
in orbit, and you have a lot
of time delay, and we have

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.970
this problem called
loss of signal.

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:53.220
And that's where for sometimes
30 and 45 minute windows, we

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:57.520
have no communication with the
ISS over the network that I

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.510
showed you.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.390
It's just disconnected.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.430
And so what we have to do in
software then is make sure

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:06.000
that we are compensating for
all of these different

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.490
situations that can arise.

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:11.220
So this is the user interface
that we're going to be using.

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.320
We're hoping to actually get
crew time in like late

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.730
November, early December.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.450
And what we're able to do.

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:19.880
This is an interface that allows
us to set up plans that

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.970
the SPHERES will execute.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.005
You say, Mark, why
is there a cat?

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.010
So imagine that every time you
see a cat, that's going to be

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:30.000
a view from the phone.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.790
What we figured out-- and this
was a social hacking--

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:36.230
one of our colleagues that works
down at JPL has figured

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:39.110
out that if you can sneak cats
into your presentation to the

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.260
safety guys, it calms them.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.500
And you don't get really,
really hard questions,

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.730
hopefully, afterwards.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:52.230
So it's actually become a
challenge at this point.

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.130
We try to sneak cats into our

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:57.120
interfaces as much as possible.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.610
So basically running very
quickly through this interface

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:01.860
that we developed.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.500
First, we verify that we've
got a connection.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.900
The neat part here is we're able
to come-- we basically

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.310
create these plans.

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:11.610
And what the plans do is they
tell you, I want you to orient

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:12.180
a certain way.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.800
I want you to fly to
a certain position.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.800
I want you to turn on
the flashlight.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.710
I want you to take a picture
or start recording video.

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:22.000
And so we've come up with a
recipe or a plan that the

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.320
SPHERES is going to execute.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.160
And we have these 3D views,
which allows us to preview

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.860
what we think the SPHERE
is going to do.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:34.730
Once we've previewed that, then
this would be the image

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.630
that's actually coming
from the SPHERE.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:41.800
And you see the progress
of where it is.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.820
And again, the 3D views.

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.650
Whereas before it was kind of
giving you a simulation of

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:49.310
where the SPHERE was going
to be, this is

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:50.460
actually live telemetry.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.830
So this is pulling the
positioning information back

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:54.400
out and then rolling it
into the display.

00:45:58.024 --> 00:46:03.350
Then no good plan survives
first contact, and that's

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:05.550
especially true for robots.

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.390
About the time you think
you've got all the

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:09.630
combinations figured out, the
universe will throw you

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.840
something that you didn't think
about, and you've got to

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.910
go in and do some manual
adjustments.

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.410
And so what we've done
is provided a way

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:18.100
to do manual control.

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.720
Now this isn't like
rate control.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.530
This is--

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:22.100
we call it nudging.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.250
So if you tell it to go, and you
want to look at a panel,

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.910
or you want to position it in a
certain way, what you can do

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.420
is then you can nudge it
slightly and just kind of move

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.900
it in very small increments
left or right.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.710
Left, right, up, and down are
all of its different degrees

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:38.460
of freedom.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.790
And you have to remember that
you've got significant time

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:43.430
delay between you and
the spacecraft.

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:46.530
And so what this allows you to
do is go through and do some

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.480
nudging and reset things.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.760
And like I said, all of that's
displayed up in the 3D image.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.070
And that kind of brings
us to current.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.690
So that's where we sit today.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.120
Like I said, we're hoping that
in late November, early

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.320
December that we'll get
some crew time.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:07.040
And what'll end up happening
is myself and some of my

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.790
engineers will be sitting
at consoles.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.530
This will be running
on a laptop.

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:16.290
And we have a whole series
of plans where we will be

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:18.180
uploading these scripts
to the phone.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.860
The phone then ends up
enumerating all of the plans

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.600
and figuring out how to turn
that into SPHERE speak.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.700
And then there's a program that
runs on the SPHERE then

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.870
that starts executing
all of these things

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:30.540
that are thrown there.

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:38.030
So let me end by first saying
think you to the cellbot group

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:41.830
and all of the folks here at
Google that have helped us.

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:45.270
None of this that I've shown you
or in the future would be

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:47.290
happening without you.

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:52.100
And to lay a little bit of a
teaser, a kind of, we want you

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:56.140
kind of thing in here is
this is continuing.

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:01.210
And I don't expect this project
and similar projects

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:02.490
to go away any time soon.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.970
We are definitely generating
interest within NASA.

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:07.080
Folks seem to be seeing value.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.820
And the thing that we have now
is we're getting a lot of work

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.600
and, most importantly, a lot
of really interesting geeky

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.090
problems that we would
love to share.

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:19.000
So if you like kind of cracking
hard nuts and

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.560
figuring out how to make phones
and sensors do things

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.240
that they were never designed to
do in environments that are

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:30.350
very, very cool, either that's
my email address.

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:33.640
Or basically contact me,
and we'll find a way to

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.990
get you rolled in.

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:37.226
So thank you very much.

00:48:37.226 --> 00:48:38.684
Were there any questions?

00:48:43.544 --> 00:48:45.010
Go for it.

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:48.030
So the question was, how does
the SPHERE outside of station

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:49.140
figure out where it is.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.650
That one was actually
rate controlled.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:55.450
So that was a joystick that
was inside of shuttle, and

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.970
they were watching the video
on it and actually rate

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:00.490
controlling it from inside.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.440
Now, because that was being
controlled from station, it's

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:05.370
a very low latency radio link.

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:10.380
And so it did not require the
kind of positioning that we

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.192
were looking at.

00:49:11.192 --> 00:49:12.100
It does.

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.930
So the question was, does the
CO2 that we release end up

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:17.540
affecting the CO2 levels
on station?

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.210
And yes, it does.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:20.220
It's not--

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.090
well, let's put it this way.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:25.960
The engineers, when they first,
back in 2006, when they

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.010
flew this, basically they
figured out that the scrubbers

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:32.260
are more than capable of
handling the CO2 that this

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.060
ends up releasing.

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:36.210
But there are some flight rules
that we have that make

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:38.450
sure that we're not releasing
too much CO2 into that

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:39.295
environment.

00:49:39.295 --> 00:49:39.670
Yeah.

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:40.170
So OK.

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:43.120
So the question was with respect
to the zero g flights

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.180
or the vomit comets.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:45.830
Yes.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:49.180
So actually, the photo that
you saw there with the MIT

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:55.450
students, that was actually
on NASA's vomit comet.

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.255
There are follow on projects
that have done the commercial

00:49:58.255 --> 00:49:59.505
zero g flights.

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:07.335
Not only that has been done, we
also have both at MIT and

00:50:07.335 --> 00:50:11.100
at our lab over at Ames, we have
a large, polished granite

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:15.170
table that allows us to float
the SPHERE in 2D.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:17.850
You can kind of think of it as
an inverse air hockey table

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:21.700
where the puck is able to
levitate itself using CO2

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.920
being forced down and creates a
frictionless 2D environment

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.740
to do that.

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:28.550
We also software simulators that
are able to do a pretty

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:31.395
good job of demonstrating the
physics that we expect to see

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:32.800
in micro gravity.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.700
We go through a pretty
exhaustive process of making

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.925
sure that the software is going
to do what we expect it

00:50:37.925 --> 00:50:40.320
to do before we start
burning crew time.

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.750
Because that's the most
expensive part

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:43.240
of this whole equation.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.850
What we don't want to do is have
crew set it up, and then

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:48.190
we haven't done our homework to
make sure that it's going

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:50.090
to do what we expected.

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:54.230
So the question is, how much
of the navigation is

00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:58.120
handcrafted versus being
algorithmic?

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.440
Right now, at least with respect
to the control that

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.700
we're doing with the smartphone
itself, it's

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:04.925
basically way point
navigation.

00:51:04.925 --> 00:51:07.380
Where we're able to tell it,
go to this coordinate,

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.790
turn to this pose.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:13.090
And then it's actually figuring
out the thruster

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:17.010
mixing that it needs to do to
get from point A to point B.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:20.060
So for any given orientation,
it's got to do the math of

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.860
figuring out what combination
of thrusters and timings it

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.670
needs to fire to get there.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:28.300
There are ways of actually
having it go to more of a, I'm

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:32.110
following a path or a vector
through that space too.

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:33.790
There's been experiments
that frankly, we're

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.280
not using just yet.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.120
But there have been
investigators that are

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.590
actually looking at, OK, if I
have this configuration of

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:43.610
obstacles, how with the thruster
configuration I have

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:45.660
can I optimize this path?

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.150
And autonomously make sure--

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:51.860
one of the big things for
free flyers is fuel.

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:54.290
How do you get from point A to
point B and make sure that

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.700
you're going to be able to
minimize your fuel usage so

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.140
you can get the point B. Because
unfortunately, again,

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.480
unlike on Earth, when you run
out of fuel, and you're

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.820
moving, you're going
to keep moving.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.410
You don't eventually
come to a stop.

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:07.980
And so there's actually been
some really great research

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.720
that, frankly, we get to just
stand on the shoulders of

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.650
those smart people that have
figured out how to do those

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:13.615
kind of things.

00:52:13.615 --> 00:52:13.970
Sure.

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:15.763
So the question is--

00:52:15.763 --> 00:52:18.600
and I'm going to summarize
here-- is basically, we've

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:23.190
changed the center of mass
for this satellite.

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:26.610
And really the important
subtlety to that is the mass

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.850
that we've added to
it is outside of

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:30.970
the thruster volume.

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:35.760
And so right now, I don't know
if you noticed, but in the

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:39.360
video that I showed where it
was the low light video, if

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.730
you watch that video, it
actually lobs a little bit.

00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:44.740
So when it takes off, you
actually see the phone angle

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:45.520
down a little bit.

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:49.670
And that's because for that
test, the SPHERE was almost

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:50.700
literally imagining--

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.450
in terms of its modeling,
it thought that it was a

00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:53.710
perfectly spherical cow.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:57.090
Like it really did think that
mass was equal on all sides.

00:52:57.090 --> 00:53:03.330
The good news is that between
our group and MIT, we've been

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:06.560
able to tune the algorithm
that it's using

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.730
to adjust for that.

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:10.920
There's actually a project
that is separate from the

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.650
smartphone one that has a much
more massive sensor that it's

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:14.750
putting on the front of it.

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:16.260
And they've been doing
the hard math of,

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:17.810
OK, how do I model--

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.000
how do you not only model the
change in center of gravity,

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.220
but then the fact that that
center of gravity, in that

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:24.620
case, is probably almost pushing
itself outside of the

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.220
thruster envelope.

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.430
And that's hard math that I
won't even pretend that I know

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:29.990
how to go through myself.

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:32.530
So the question is, what do we
do on the phone versus the

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:33.930
controller?

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:38.860
So as roboticists we like to
look at things like motor

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:42.080
controllers and think of that
as like a black box.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.010
I've got this high-level
algorithm, and it's just

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:44.830
providing a vector.

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:48.140
And then somewhere down below
in the layers below, it's

00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.440
figuring out how much to
actually apply that H bridge

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.540
or that whatever.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.080
The SPHERE, to our project,
effectively ends up being like

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.140
a motor controller.

00:53:56.140 --> 00:54:00.200
We feel very fortunate that we
can tell it things like, go to

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.590
XYZ and turn to the following
pose, and it will figure out

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:06.230
the thruster firings and other
things to do for us.

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:08.730
So that's really kind of the
divide is that you can think

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:12.510
of the SPHERE as doing all of
the hard avionics side and the

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:17.120
smartphone side of it as working
the higher level, a

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.490
lot of the camera sensors,
the wi-fi [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:20.970
communication path.

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:23.490
And the really interesting part
for us-- and this changes

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:26.730
the way, frankly, a lot of
NASA's projects has gone, is

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:30.630
it allows the software
to be the science.

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:33.270
In that we can work on those
higher level algorithms and

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.690
know that there's this solid
base that's down below us

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:40.980
that's doing the avionics and
the flight part very reliably.

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:43.000
So the question is, what
kind of sensing

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:43.850
is done on the SPHERE?

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:47.400
And the SPHERE has
accelerometers and gyros on

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:51.150
each of its axes and the
ultrasonic positioning system

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:52.360
that I described.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:56.120
So it knows where it is, and
it can sense motion.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:56.720
And that's it.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.540
There are no cameras.

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.080
At least in the base
configuration,

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.360
that's all it's got.

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.290
And so that was one of the big
values, frankly, that the

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:05.900
phone was bringing for us was
doing the camera and the wi-fi

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.900
and everything else that
we wanted to add on.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.610
There's just a lot packaged
in that little box.

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:13.300
The question was, does the
SPHERE give information back

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:14.770
to the phone?

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:15.310
And yes.

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:18.150
We have a telemetry stream
that we monitor.

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:21.790
And that is what's communicating
to the phone.

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:25.560
In the plan that I described
there, that's how we know, OK,

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.880
it's reached this point in the
plan, and now we're moving on

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.650
to the next point.

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:31.360
So it's out of that telemetry
stream that we're able to

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.020
figure out that we've succeeded
in whatever that

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:35.360
sub-goal was.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.955
So the question is, can we use
this, I'm assuming, as kind of

00:55:38.955 --> 00:55:44.190
a litmus test or a test point
for future satellites?

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.600
And the short answer is, yes.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:52.840
This is, frankly, a technology
demonstration for NASA and all

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.750
of the folks that are working in
these kind of environments.

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:59.970
And so our hope is to not only
be able to demonstrate but be

00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:02.630
able to walk away with this
for, OK, here's your best

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.030
practices that you want
to try to tackle.

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:06.310
Here are the capabilities.

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:08.950
If you're going to, let's say,
choose a smartphone or some

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:12.240
type of COTS device, here's the
level of capabilities that

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:17.570
you're going to have to hit to
know what you're battling in

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:19.230
terms of what the sensors
are going to do

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:20.160
and stuff like that.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.850
So it's a good data
point for us.

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:24.930
It'll be interesting to see how
many other projects end up

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:27.970
kind of globbing
onto this idea.

00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:32.320
Like I said, I have other
projects literally calling me

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:36.240
probably weekly, just after
hearing about this, wanting to

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.125
know how we were able to use
these smartphones and what it

00:56:39.125 --> 00:56:40.510
took to make them work.

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:41.950
So there's definitely
interest.

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:43.950
It's left to be seen, though,
whether we have other products

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:45.420
kind of getting on board.

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.390
Of course.

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:48.450
The question is, are we
going to upgrade?

00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:51.550
And right now, frankly,
the Nexus S is a

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:52.980
great phone for us.

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:56.280
And we know it cold.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.290
And that we're fully up under
the hood of that phone and

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:02.070
know it very, very well.

00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:05.590
We have other projects that
are hopefully coming along

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:06.610
down the road here.

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:09.010
And of course, we're going to
go into that with the same

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:13.130
kind of open trade space that
we did before and say, OK.

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:14.490
We've had a couple
years go past.

00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:16.220
Does it make sense now
to throw a panda

00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:17.490
board up there, or--

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:21.010
and then lay up the leading
smartphones and try to see

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:23.780
who's got the best in class for
the kinds of things that

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:24.770
we need to do.

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:28.220
We're kind of mercenaries in
that we'll just lay up the

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:28.880
requirements.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.880
And whatever can fill that
gap, we'll go with it.

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.210
So that's left to be seen
as to what phone we

00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:37.070
actually end up using.

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:38.690
The question is, do
we use the screen?

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:42.160
And initially, when we first
started doing this, actually

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:46.640
the screen really wasn't even
on our list of requirements.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:50.830
But as you probably suspect, the
ability for the astronaut

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:54.180
to be able to go up and interact
with the screen or to

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:57.950
start recording or to enable the
phone's functionality in

00:57:57.950 --> 00:58:00.890
some way, or do something
simple like

00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:02.360
configure an IP address.

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.400
MALE SPEAKER: Or dismiss
a force close error.

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:08.890
MIKE MICIRE: Or dismiss
a force close error.

00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:11.160
Lovingly.

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.352
Which actually, we've done that
with our own code also.

00:58:14.352 --> 00:58:16.479
MALE SPEAKER: Now that you have
front-facing cameras, you

00:58:16.479 --> 00:58:19.350
can use it as a flashlight for
your low light [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:19.730
MIKE MICIRE: Yeah.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:22.150
So the comment was, now that we
have front-facing cameras.

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:25.200
And actually, in this case, what
was kind of the downer

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.050
was because the big battery
pack is stuck to the back,

00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:31.100
really, the high resolution
camera and the cool flashlight

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:32.350
are hidden behind there.

00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:34.818
And before we flew, we actually
thought, you know

00:58:34.818 --> 00:58:35.250
what would be really cool?

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:36.410
If we could periscope that.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:39.380
Like two front reflecting
mirrors, and we can do the

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:41.500
double bank shot and get
that out the front.

00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:45.110
And unfortunately, we just
didn't have time to do it.

00:58:45.110 --> 00:58:48.440
But definitely, that is in our
requirements list for any

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:51.650
improvements that we do moving
forward is not only getting

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:52.860
the real flashlight.

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:57.000
Right now, we do the old G1
trick of, we just make the

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.250
screen really bright
and white.

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:02.930
And so we'd like for the future
projects to actually

00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:05.480
have a proper flashlight that
allows us to illuminate.

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:07.370
Because as you can see,
we have instances--

00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:08.580
and we didn't expect this.

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:09.710
And this would have hit
our requirements list.

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:11.590
But sometimes we have
to run in low light.

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:13.750
And that wasn't something that
we had really expected, at

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:17.120
least for these preliminary
experiments.

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:17.460
All right.

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.900
Any other questions?

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:21.370
Well, thank you very,
very much.

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:22.620
I really enjoyed this.
