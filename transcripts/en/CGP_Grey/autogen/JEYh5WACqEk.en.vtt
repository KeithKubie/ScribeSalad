00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.629
 From the first arrival of Europeans in 1492 to the Victorian era, the New World 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.980
 The population of the indigenous people has dropped by 90%. 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.840
 what is the reason? 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.540
 Not conquerors -- they killed a lot of people, but the deaths and injuries caused by them are far less than 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.689
 What they bring: smallpox, typhus, tuberculosis, flu, plague, 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.820
 From pirates to cholera, mumps, measles, etc. on coastal tribes 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.010
 Then these tiny invaders spread throughout the hemisphere, infecting people without resistance. 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.660
 Tens of thousands of people have died. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.670
 These bacteria decided the outcome of these wars long before the battle began. 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.149
 However, why are Europeans not getting sick? 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.539
 If people in the New World are infected with diseases in the Old World, people from the Old World 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.829
 Presumably, it will also infect the disease of the New World. 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.080
 But at that time, there was no spread of the American plague to the east and spread to Europe. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.409
 Cut from 90 million to 9 million. If the American plague exists, it will seriously hinder Europeans. 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.920
 The ability to expand to the other side of the Atlantic. 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.250
 To answer this question, we must first distinguish between general diseases - like 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.990
 The general cold -- and what we call the "plague" below. 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.229
 1. The plague spreads quickly. 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.540
 The speed of sneezing is higher than the handshake, and the handshake is higher than the intimate behavior. 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.840
 The epidemic is more than this, and it is used more than this. 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.509
 2. If it will kill you quickly, it will make you immune. 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.540
 If you get a plague, you will die within seven to thirty days; if you are not dead, you will never again 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.899
 Will not get the same disease. Your body learns to resist it. You may still carry it -- it 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.850
 Live in your body, you will still spread it -- but it can't hurt you. 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.119
 The answer on the surface is not that Europeans have a higher immunity. 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.020
 Resist the plague of the New World - but the New World has no plague for them. 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.800
 They have general illnesses, but no American plague can win the bid. 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.510
 These are the deadliest killers in history, and they are all from the Old World. 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.560
 But why? 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.180
 Let's take a closer look at cholera: a plague, if drinking water and manure are not properly separated 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.420
 It can spread in your civilization. London’s drinking water is incredibly poor. 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.360
 Make it the world's cholera capital. Cholera can wreak havoc in densely populated communities. 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.910
 Kill countless people and move on. But this is the key: it must move on. 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.430
 In a small, isolated group, the plague like cholera can't survive -- it kills all that fits 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.300
 People, leaving immunized people, then there is no place to go -- just like a big fire 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.640
 Burn yourself to the end of the oil. 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.790
 But a city -- a beautiful city on the hillside -- where the countrymen gather, hundreds of days a day 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:13.239
 Where the baby was born: This is the sanctuary for the plague; fresh fire 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.430
 Keep coming to the door. The plague broke out, then the latent disappeared, and then broke out again - never possible 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.690
 Extinct. 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.790
 Historically, the plague in the city has caused death faster than human reproduction. The city will grow up 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.340
 Because more people are moving in than those who are dead inside. City growth 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.700
 It was only after the 1900s that it was multiplied from its own population, relying on medicine finally from leeches and bloodletting. 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.080
 Advancement to hygiene and soups has given people a means to reduce mortality. 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.819
 But before that, the city inadvertently became an amusement park for the plague, 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.569
 Immune people are separated from the public. 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.709
 So the deeper answer is that there is no plague in the New World because of the New World. 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.989
 It is not large and dense, and the sanitation environment is extremely poor. The cities that are closely connected to each other make the plague 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:06.769
 survive. 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:14.000
 OK, but the New World is not completely without a city, and the tribes are not completely out of touch. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.269
 Otherwise, the newly arrived smallpox in the 1400s will not spread. 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.060
 The city is just part of the puzzle: they are needed for the plague, but the city does not produce 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.190
 The bacteria that cause the plague -- these bacteria are the missing piece of the puzzle. 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.400
 Most bacteria don't want to kill you, just like you don't want to burn your house; 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.570
 The bacteria live in your body. Chronic diseases such as leprosy are bad because they 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.290
 Be good at living in your body but not killing you. 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:52.940
 The fatality rate of the plague is actually an accident, a misunderstanding, because the bacteria do not know 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.470
 They are in the human body; they think they are here. 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.199
 The plague comes from animals. 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.400
 Whooping cough comes from pigs, and the flu is also. The flu is also from birds. Light is our cattle partner 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.130
 Bring measles, tuberculosis and smallpox 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.250
 For cows, these diseases don't matter -- just like a cold is like us. But when the cattle's bacteria ran to 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.070
 In a person, something that makes a cow slightly sick can make you sick. 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.250
 I am sick. 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.970
 But bacteria are extremely rare from animal infections to humans. This is why humans of several generations can 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.440
 Get along with the animals with peace of mind. To be the first person to be infected by animals is like 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.960
 In the middle of a terrible lottery 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:43.930
 But the colonial cities have increased their chances: there were animals everywhere; horses, 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.630
 Livestock on the road, open slaughterhouses, unrefrigerated meat stalls, 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.590
 A river filled with human and animal waste. 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.330
 There is no better environment than this to spread the disease to different species. 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.060
 So the deeper answer is that although the plague comes from animals, the chances are low enough that you must 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:13.340
 Increase the likelihood by increasing the chance of infection, and the new plague needs a fertile environment 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.500
 To grow. The Old World has a wealth of essential elements. 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:25.819
 But why is the city like London full of cattle and sheep, and Tenochtitlan (the capital of the Aztec Empire of Mexico)? 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:30.250
 This is the last element of the film. 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.330
 Some animals can be used by humans - this is the meaning of domestication: animals that can be raised 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.800
 Not just prey. 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.900
 Forget the modern society first, imagine 10,000 years before the BC, when the human tribe arrived 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.330
 all around the world. If you are one of the tribes, what are the local animals? 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.870
 Can you catch and domesticate? 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.599
 Maybe you are in North Dakota, intending to catch a buffalo: an elusive, 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:04.139
 A violent tank with a long hoof, running faster than you, can jump over your head. 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.759
 And in groups of thousands of strong. 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:13.190
 By the way, you don’t have a horse to help you -- because there is no horse on this * continent* 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.870
 The horse lives here - and won't come to you until you are finished. 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.930
 Only you, some partners, and some stone tools. Native Americans are not tamed 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.880
 Bison is not because they didn't figure out a way, but because the buffalo is a bison. No one is going to 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.560
 - In the era of BC, the buffalo might be a very useful working animal. 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.810
 But that is impossible - humans can barely domesticate with all modern tools 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.210
 Bison. 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:48.840
 There are no good animals in the New World that can be domesticated. Almost all big enough animals 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.020
 If it is not too dangerous, it is too flexible. 

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.379
 But from fertile moon bay to Central Europe, there are cattle and sheep. 

00:07:56.379 --> 00:08:01.830
 Goats: A small animal, in contrast to the human domestication. 

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:07.629
 If there are only stone tools, wild boars can compete with them, but they can be 

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:13.910
 Capture, raise, breed, and raise to eat -- because pigs don’t jump into the air, they won’t crush 

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.210
 All obstacles under the hoof. 

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:22.669
 The only animals that can be domesticated in the New World are: llamas. They are more than 

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:27.030
 Nothing is good -- this is perhaps why the largest cities in the Americas are in South America - but they 

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:33.300
 Far less than a cow. Have you tried to graze a group of alpacas in the mountains of Peru? It can be done, 

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.099
 But it is not a bad thing. These alpacas are some of the grasses. 

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:41.159
 These may seem to be featured examples. Animal species are not 

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:46.269
 How many thousands? That's right, but when you are still known to use fire, almost 

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:53.019
 All animals cannot be tamed. From the origin of mankind until the meeting of destiny, 

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:59.570
 Humans have domesticated about a dozen animals. And want to get 

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:05.290
 With such a high number, you have to include bees and silkworms; they are good, 

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:10.190
 But light can't build a civilization with honey. 

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:16.950
 These early tribes were not smart, and domesticated animals were not as powerful. The Old World has more useful 

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:22.700
 And easy to tame animals. With dogs, shepherds and cattle are easier, now people have partners to help 

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.610
 The machines that manage garment factories, produce milk and cheese burgers, and 

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.940
 Plowing the beast. This makes farming easier, and it means that settlement is more beneficial to people. 

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.830
 Causing more animals to be domesticated, producing more food, causing population growth and 

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:41.529
 Increase the density and see what happens. Small town village: Population: a lot; bring your animals; plague 

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:42.230
 Great welcome. 

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.850
 This is the complete answer: the lack of domesticated animals in the New World is not limited only. 

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.720
 Bacterial aboriginal sources also limit food production and thus inhibit population growth. 

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:59.240
 It has also restricted the emergence of cities, making the plague almost impossible in the New World. Complete in the old continent 

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.329
 in contrast. So one is full of plagues, one is not. 

00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:10.470
 So when the fleet landed on the New World, no American plague could take home. 

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:16.209
 The civilized game has nothing to do with the player, but it depends entirely on 

00:10:16.209 --> 00:10:21.579
 map. Access to large numbers of domesticated animals and their diversity are key resources 

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:28.720
 Can lead a complex society from scratch - and this complexity unexpectedly brings 

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.589
 A passive biochemical weapon is extremely deadly to the outside world. 

00:10:33.589 --> 00:10:40.089
 If the game comes back, but if we exchange domesticated animals, history 

00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:49.510
 The flow of disease and death will be reversed. 

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:55.899
 There is still a problem that remains unanswered. Why some animals can be domesticated, some 

00:10:55.899 --> 00:11:01.779
 Can't? Why are American Indians unable to domesticate deer? Why can't zebras be domesticated? they 

00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:08.079
 It is similar to a horse. What does it mean to "tamen" animals? To answer this question, please click here to see
