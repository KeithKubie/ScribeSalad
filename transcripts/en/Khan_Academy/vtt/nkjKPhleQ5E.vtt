00:00:00.572 --> 00:00:01.570
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.135
We're going to start talking
about pronouns today,

00:00:05.135 --> 00:00:06.922
and of course that
begins with the question,

00:00:06.922 --> 00:00:09.350
What are pronouns?

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.096
Allow me to answer that question
by way of a demonstration.

00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:19.575
Emma laughed so hard, milk
came out of Emma's nose.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.859
Zach lifted the log.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.283
Zach found a worm under the log.

00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:31.663
So, these sentences don't have pronouns,

00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:34.960
but what they do have is repeated nouns.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.318
Here we have Emma and
then we say Emma's again,

00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:38.955
and then we say Zach and the log,

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:42.519
and then we say Zach and the log.

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.179
But, people are smart, right?

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.478
We have relatively long attention spans,

00:00:46.478 --> 00:00:49.523
and so if we start off a
sentence talking about Emma,

00:00:49.523 --> 00:00:51.212
and we're pretty sure that
we're still talking about Emma,

00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:53.453
we don't need to say that name twice.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.996
We don't need to say
Emma and then Emma again.

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:58.097
So, what a pronoun does is it allows you

00:00:58.097 --> 00:01:02.160
to take out the unnecessary noun

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.994
when we're very certain we
know what we're talking about.

00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:07.339
So you don't have to say
Emma a million times,

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:11.042
you can replace Emma with her.

00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:13.318
Same thing applies to
the second two sentences.

00:01:13.318 --> 00:01:15.941
We don't have to keep on
mentioning Zach and the log

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:17.614
when we know what we're talking about.

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:19.122
So the first sentence would still read

00:01:19.122 --> 00:01:20.795
Zach lifted the log,

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:22.420
but then in the second sentence

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.057
we can replace the name Zach,

00:01:24.057 --> 00:01:25.880
since we already know
who we're talking about,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.956
with the word he, and we can
replace this little phrase,

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:33.519
the log, with it, since we know
we're talking about the log.

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:38.519
Now, words like her and he
and it are all pronouns.

00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:41.472
So, what are pronouns?

00:01:41.472 --> 00:01:45.221
They are words that
stand in for other words.

00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:47.462
Now, obviously, her, he, and it

00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:49.680
are not the only pronouns in English,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.339
but for now I just want
you to think about the idea

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:56.774
that a pronoun is a word that
stands in for another word.

00:01:56.774 --> 00:01:58.516
You can learn anything.

00:01:58.516 --> 00:01:59.630
David out.
