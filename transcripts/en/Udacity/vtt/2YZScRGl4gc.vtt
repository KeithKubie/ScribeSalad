00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to problem set 6.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's take a look at the shortest tour problem.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now let's say we wanted to use a randomized algorithm

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to solve the shortest tour problem,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and how about we run it on an N-vertex graph.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Say we decided to run our randomized algorithm

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a thousand times and we got the following results.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We got a tour length between a 1056 and 1537.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Along with that, we got the number of times

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
each of those results were found.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now we also have a known factor to approximation algorithm,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and we found an approximation of 1236 with this.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now what I'd like to know is given the above information,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we will copy that information in the instructor comments below

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
so that you can look at it during the quiz,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which of these statements are true?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Does the shortest tour for the input graph have to have a length of 1056?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Is the random algorithm likely a factor 3 approximation algorithm?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Have we found a tour that is at most 1.71 times as long as the optimal one?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Or similarly, have we found one that is at most 1.43 times as long as the optimal one?

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check whichever of these you think are true.
