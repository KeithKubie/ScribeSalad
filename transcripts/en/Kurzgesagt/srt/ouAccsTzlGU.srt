00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,130
When Al Vegetarian ancestors started
eating meat around 2 million years ago,

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,150
it wasn't just because animals
taste great. It was pure necessity.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,890
Climate change made many of the plants
that our ancestors relied on less

4
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:15,930
available and meet bridge.

5
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:20,931
That gap from the discovery of fire at
the latest meet became a staple of the

6
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,200
human diet. But over the last few years,

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,160
eating meat has increasingly been
associated with health risks like heart

8
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:32,520
disease, certain cancers,
and an early death.

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,090
So how unhealthy is meat really?

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,690
In this video, we'll only talk about meat.

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,130
Dairy products deserve a video
of their own. Biologically,

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,810
we need to eat for three reasons,

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,700
for energy to acquire materials to
fabricate ourselves and to get special

14
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:02,010
molecules that our bodies
can't make themselves.

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,470
The energy and most of the materials come
from the three macro nutrients, fats,

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,600
carbohydrates, and proteins.

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,310
Proteins are the most important
resource for repairing and replenishing

18
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:15,570
ourselves. Structures.

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,730
The special molecules are a large variety
of vitamins and minerals we need to

20
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:25,710
drive metabolic processes. Meet
provides us with most of these things.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,370
It contains all the essential
amino acids, our body needs,

22
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,600
and a lot of minerals like iron,
zinc and essential vitamins,

23
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,810
some of which are barely found in plants
like vitamin B 12 only one essential

24
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:44,190
nutrient is missing and most of
the meat we consume. Vitamin C is,

25
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:48,570
appears in almost all plants and
supports our immune system as what is the

26
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:52,430
development of connective tissues.
After a few months without hit,

27
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,940
you'd get scurvy, but meat
has another big advantage.

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,860
It's high bioavailability,

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,780
some of the nutrients in me to broken
down faster and available quicker than

30
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:08,040
those from plants. Spinach, for
example, contains more iron than meat,

31
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,240
but it's absorbed much slower and the
body needs more energy to digest it.

32
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,520
Several health benefits have also been
observed in communities that rely solely

33
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:20,190
on meat. The Nus, for example,

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,950
are able to survive in
extreme climate conditions,

35
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,450
thanks to eat purely meat based diet.
Since they consume the whole animal,

36
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:31,020
including the organs they get
every single nutrient they need,

37
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,460
including vitamin C.

38
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,780
So meat itself is definitely
not dangerous for us,

39
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,880
but its health effects vary depending
on how it's prepared and what animal it

40
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:45,990
comes from. When talking about
meat in the Western world,

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,580
we generally mean muscle tissues that
have a high nutrient density but also

42
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,270
lacks some of the vitamins that make
it possible to survive on meat alone.

43
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,200
The most healthy animals
to eat are probably fish.

44
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,730
Fish contains polyunsaturated fatty
acids like Amiga three which may low the

45
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:08,290
risk of cardiovascular diseases and
support anti inflammatory immune functions

46
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,720
as part of a balanced diet. Fish can
be eaten regularly without worries.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Eating fish comes with its own bag of
complications though like over fishing and

48
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:23,680
the destruction of the oceans. We'll
talk about that in another video.

49
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,430
A close second is the
most popular meat chicken.

50
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,730
It's regarded as the meat
with the fewest health risks.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,710
The only negative health effect of
poultry is a bit controversial fat.

52
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,660
It's high content of saturated fats is
associated with a higher cholesterol

53
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,880
level and cardiovascular disease,

54
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,450
but this idea has also been criticized
by a large number of scientists arguing

55
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,300
high cholesterol levels might be
inherited and not caused by nutrition.

56
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,670
So in general, if you want meat and
are concerned about your health,

57
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,743
go for chicken.

58
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,900
Things start to get problematic with
high intakes of red meat like beef, veal,

59
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,780
pork, lamb, horse and goat.

60
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,260
A recently published study
recommends, for example,

61
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,350
a maximum of 23 grams of red meat per day,

62
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,280
which is a very small
steak per week. However,

63
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,930
large scale Meta analysis studies have
shown that eating 100 grams of red meat

64
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,960
every day increases the risk of
diabetes by 19% of strokes by 11% and of

65
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:34,771
colorectal cancer by 17%
this sounds alarming,

66
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,610
but before we panic,

67
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,530
let's have a look at how these studies
were conducted because this brings us to

68
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,070
the second big problem when trying to
answer the question of whether meat is

69
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:45,970
unhealthy or not.

70
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,100
Most studies that linked health risks
to eating red meat look case control

71
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:51,934
studies,

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,350
which means taking a group of people with
the disease and classify them by their

73
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:59,230
eating habits. The more
red meat they consume,

74
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,230
the more likely they were to
contract certain diseases.

75
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,920
The problem is that it's very
hard to eliminate other factors.

76
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,660
People who eat less meat tend to live
a healthier lifestyle. In general,

77
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,250
they tend to eat more vegetables and
fruit and are less likely to smoke and

78
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:19,600
drink alcohol. Most studies
try to eliminate these factors,

79
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,480
but it's extremely hard to
make definitive statements.

80
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,910
The things get worse.

81
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,800
When we look at processed meat though
processing meat means adding certain

82
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:34,360
chemicals by curing, smoking, salting
or fermenting or in other words,

83
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,630
making a delicious Bacon, Ham, Salami,

84
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:42,631
sausages and hotdogs contain chemicals
that are harmful for us like nitrates and

85
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:47,560
nitrites that can damage the DNA in our
digestive system and lead to cancer.

86
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,580
The WHO reviewed 800 studies over 20 years
and concluded that processed wheat is

87
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:56,740
strongly linked to an increased
risk of colorectal cancer.

88
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,720
Each extra 50 grams of processed meat
per day increases your risk of cancer by

89
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:05,840
18% when it comes to cancer risk.

90
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,260
Processed meat is now in the
same category as plutonium,

91
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,240
asbestos and smoking.

92
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,580
The who highlights that its research is
only about the question of whether or

93
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:21,581
not something causes cancer and not to
what extent that processed me to may also

94
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:26,150
significantly increased the chance
of suffering from diabetes, strokes,

95
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,830
and coronary heart diseases.

96
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,480
It also makes a difference what sort of
life army lived when it was still part

97
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:33,350
of a living being.

98
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,180
It's common to feed large amounts of
antibiotics to livestock in order to

99
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:41,510
prevent diseases which can
spread antibiotic resistance.

100
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,450
Combined a high consumption of both red
and processed meat could increase your

101
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:52,451
chance of premature death by up to 29%
this means if your chance of dying is at

102
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:58,520
3% this year, it's now 4% this
might not sound like a lot,

103
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,510
but tiny percentages have a huge
impact on societies of millions.

104
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,290
They also seem harmless
until they affects you.

105
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,010
To blame me to lone for bad
health would be wrong though.

106
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,270
There is no evidence that the very
essence of needs has any negative effects

107
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:18,620
beyond bids, high fat content, and
even this point is highly contentious.

108
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,890
Just like with many
other pleasures in life,

109
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,070
sometimes too much of a
good thing is harmful.

110
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,350
Most public health agencies suggest
cutting meat consumption to 500 grams a

111
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:34,580
week. While studies suggest cutting
down processed meat as much as possible,

112
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,040
so if you feast on meat no more than
once or twice a week, you should be good.

113
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,510
For most people, this already means
a drastic change in their diets,

114
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:49,511
though the average American consumes
around almost 1,600 grams of meat a week.

115
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,810
The average German 1,100 grams a week,

116
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,880
and many of us eat much, much
more. If you're not really sure,

117
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,970
make a small note. Whenever
you eat meat for a week or two,

118
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,760
you'll be surprised how much it really is.

119
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,620
So most people watching this video
would benefit from cutting down on meat.

120
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,320
Aside from health concerns,

121
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,770
they're still the fact that
the meat industry is one
of the largest contributors

122
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:19,700
to climate change and has reached a
scale where it's impossible to deliver

123
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:23,240
millions of tons of meat and
still treat animals with dignity.

124
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,400
We've already discussed that in
detail in another video. All in all,

125
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,360
in moderation.

126
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,220
Meat is not unhealthy and you don't need
to become vegetarian overnight to have

127
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:36,500
a real impact on your
health and the planet,

128
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,400
but your lifestyle choices do
matter for yourself and for others.

129
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,400
The key is being open to trying
something new. Once in awhile,

130
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,090
maybe you'll discover your new
favorite dish until you try.

131
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,150
You'll never know what you'll
enjoy or what you're capable of.

132
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,350
Maybe after watching hours of coats,

133
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,160
cars aren't videos you've decided you'd
like to learn how to animate. Now,

134
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:00,180
you might not know this,

135
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,540
but most of our team actually
has a graphic design background.

136
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,160
Learning about design principles first
before we got into animation was really

137
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,720
key to where we are today.

138
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,220
There's a really great new skill share
class on using Adobe illustrator.

139
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,370
The software we use to create
art work by graphic designer.

140
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,890
Aaron Draplin and we can
personally recommend it.

141
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,510
It's full of great tips to help
understand and simplify a very complicated

142
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:27,450
program if you want to do more afterwards.

143
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,600
We have three animation courses of our
own on skillshare to skillshare offers

144
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:37,080
over 25,000 classes on topics like
film and video editing, writing,

145
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:40,710
design and technology from
an array of skilled experts.

146
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,090
With the premium membership, you can
access all of them for only $10 a month.

147
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,710
And as a bonus,

148
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,310
the first 1000 coats cause aren't viewers
