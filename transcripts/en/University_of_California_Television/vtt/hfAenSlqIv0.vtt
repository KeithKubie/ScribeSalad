00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:02.914
(logo whooshes)

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.170
- Dr. LeeAnn Christian
is the deputy director

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.740
of the Community Services Division for DDS

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.510
with over 30 years of
experience in providing

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.340
person-centered direct
and clinical services,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.250
and before joining DDS in 2017,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.280
she was the chief clinical officer

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.593
at the Regional Center of Orange County.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.890
And Dr. Lauren Libero was previously

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.210
a UC President's postdoctoral fellow

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.090
at the UC Davis MIND Institute

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.730
and is now the autism expert specialist

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.550
at the California DDS where
she provides expertise

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.550
and conducts research on autism
and associated conditions.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.160
She also coordinates
efforts with the department,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.880
regional centers,
stakeholders, and universities

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.470
as well as other state agencies.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.150
So let's welcome

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.150
Lauren and LeeAnn to the podium.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.817
Are you going to talk
at the same time, or?

00:01:20.817 --> 00:01:23.083
- [LeeAnn] Not at the
same time, but together.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.197
- (laughing) Good.
(audience applauding)

00:01:24.197 --> 00:01:25.750
- Really be good.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.368
I get to talk, then she's gonna talk,

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:28.201
then I'm gonna talk.

00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:30.484
- Thank you.

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:32.250
- Hi, good afternoon, everyone.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.800
We will do our best to follow

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.600
the green, yellow, and red
lights to keep on time.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.580
First I really just wanna thank everyone.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.030
We're happy to be here on behalf

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.560
of Director Nancy Bargmann who
isn't able to be here today,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.570
and thank you for the introduction.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.530
In the next 30 minutes, what we wanna do

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.340
is give you just a high-level overview

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.770
of the Developmental
Disability Services System

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.480
in California, I know many
of you are familiar with it,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.460
working inside the system,
and some of the changing

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.720
information about the population of folks

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.780
that we're serving and
some of the priorities

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.603
and initiatives that we're working on.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.670
Okay, perfect, we have no
conflicts of interest to disclose.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.670
In our talk today, we're just gonna give

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.530
an overview of the Department
of Developmental Services,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.700
DDS, regional centers, the
population served and trends,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.793
and priorities and initiatives.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.870
And our learning
objectives are identifying

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.040
some major trends in the characteristics

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.640
of the individuals that we serve,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.373
and again, the priorities and
initiatives for our system.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.990
So although many of you know,
we'll just to through this

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.310
quickly and get to the
meat of the presentation.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.270
DDS is the state agency that's responsible

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.870
for overseeing the coordination
and provision of services

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.870
and supports for now
over 333,000 individuals,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.930
Californians with
developmental disabilities.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.660
And we contract with 21 regional centers,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.480
nonprofit private organizations

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.960
who are geographically
located across the state

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.150
to provide those local services
and supports to individuals.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.550
And all the services and
supports are provided

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.660
in accordance with the Lanterman Act.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.170
Just for some general information,

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.650
in this current fiscal year,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.370
the budget for the
Developmental Services System

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.650
is $7.4 billion, and the governor's budget

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.590
for next fiscal year '19-20

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.120
includes $7.8 billion for the system.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.200
And the 21 regional centers employ

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.490
about 7,300 personnel and operate

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.770
in over 70 different offices
throughout the state,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.850
which is really kind of the
heart of the Lanterman Act

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.850
in that local presence and
support of communities.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.970
And there are over
423,000 service providers

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.420
including families,
and excluding families,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.373
about 43,000 service providers
throughout the state.

00:04:16.452 --> 00:04:18.917
I think this is a good
visual of the system

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.513
that just shows kind
of how we are operated,

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.140
and to just bring your attention

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.020
to the state-operated services,
which I think historically

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.030
folks have kind of
talked about DDS oversees

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.540
the developmental centers.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.870
We've changed our language
as the system is moving

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.470
much more towards being an almost entirely

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.400
community-based service system

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.140
to saying state-operated versus
vendor-operated services.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.220
And through the department,
the state-operated services

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.240
include services to
individuals who are residing

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.593
in developmental centers,
and as of December 2018,

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.797
Sonoma Developmental Center closed,

00:05:02.797 --> 00:05:04.580
and the last individual moved

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.433
into their new home in
the community, and--

00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:10.600
(audience applauding)

00:05:11.452 --> 00:05:16.197
Over the next several, over at
least the next year or more,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.410
about 118 additional individuals

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.170
from Fairview Developmental Center

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.920
and Porterville Developmental Center's

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.160
general treatment area will
be moving into the community.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.980
So similar to national trends, our system,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.820
again, is really moving
to be an almost entirely

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.423
community-based service system.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.980
And I'm not sure how much people

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.730
have kind of thought about
that as a historic event

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.500
in our state, but in
1968, about 13,000 people

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.160
were living in developmental
centers, and as of January,

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.510
there were less than 400

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.220
people living in development centers.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.840
So that has been a push of the system

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.970
since the Lanterman Act came into effect

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.640
and really was focused on developing

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.420
a robust community service system.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.490
And then of course, we
contract as a department

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.600
with the 21 regional centers who in turn

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.350
provide local case
management and who vendor

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.210
the providers who provide the services

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.063
and supports to individuals.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.158
Kind of as key responsibilities for DDS

00:06:34.158 --> 00:06:37.830
is that broad policy and
statewide leadership,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.840
setting priorities, setting
standards and procedures

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.130
that kind of guide the operation

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.860
of the service system across the state,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.790
monitoring service delivery, and providing

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.560
technical support when issues come up,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.160
providing support to regional centers,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.253
the provider community, and
the individuals we serve.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.883
Many of you work at regional centers,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.030
and here I think what's
really critical to say

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.000
is that the face of our service system

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.970
is really the service coordinator.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.960
That is the person who families meet,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.497
that's the face of our
entire service system,

00:07:17.497 --> 00:07:20.840
and that relationship that's built

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.000
to ensure that individuals
and their families

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.850
get the service sand supports they need

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.470
and again, kind of that foundation

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.940
of the Lanterman Act,
that 21 regional centers

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.790
are geographically located to understand

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.190
and support the unique
needs of their community.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.160
So the services include
intake and assessment,

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.300
helping individuals
advocate for themselves

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.910
and also helping advocate for them,

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.320
assisting with access to resources

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.750
that are available in the community,

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.883
and of course for funding
services that individuals need.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.410
And then just briefly
touching on eligibility

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.410
for regional center services,

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.030
it's all up here on the slide.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:13.030
You're eligible if prior to age of 18

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.920
you have a qualifying disability

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.120
that's expected to be
lifelong and in addition

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.670
that is substantially disabling for you

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.270
and provides significant
functional limitations

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.233
in several areas of major life activity.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.893
So now onto the more
exciting (chuckles) data.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.830
Whoa.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.560
- Okay, so we have 21 regional
centers across the state.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.410
Each regional center represents
its own catchment area.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.500
So the regional centers
are geographically diverse

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.640
as well as in terms of their population.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.290
Our smallest regional
center is Redwood Coast.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.720
They serve 3,900 individuals,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.460
and our largest regional center

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.680
is Inland Regional Center who serves

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.550
35,500 individuals as
of January of this year.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.930
And you can see, there's a wide range

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.363
across all 21 in terms of how
many individuals they serve.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.690
Okay, in terms of our
total state population,

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:21.890
over the last 10 years,
we've seen a 42% increase

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.270
on the number of
individuals that we serve.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.950
So in 2008, our total was 232,000.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.570
As of this year, we're at
333,000 individuals total.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.730
And our individuals are broken down

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.270
into two groups on the graph here.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.190
In gray, you'll see
our Early Start kiddos.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.810
These are children under the age of three.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.530
And then in blue, these
are our Lanterman-eligible

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.290
individuals, so these are
individuals age three and up

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.163
who meet the criteria that
LeeAnn just described.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.340
And in addition to that,
we have individuals

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.490
who are currently under
assessment at the regional centers

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.890
to receive eligibility
for either Early Start

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.160
or Lanterman regional center services.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.950
And in January, we had 12,500 individuals

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.430
who are currently in the assessment phase.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.090
So the regional centers are really busy

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.320
in terms of bringing
individuals in to assess them

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.310
for eligibility and then
making them eligible

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.323
and coordinating all of their services.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.210
Okay, so let's look deeper

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.610
at what our population looks like.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.900
So in terms of their living arrangements,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.920
over the last 10 years,
we've seen an increase

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.070
in the number of
individuals who are residing

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.630
in the home of their
family, parent, or guardian,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.800
and we've seen a decrease in almost

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.230
every other residence type.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.480
So you can see at the very top there

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.680
the percentage of individuals

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.730
in developmental centers is going down.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.890
Obviously we're moving them
out into the community,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.590
so that was expected,
but we've seen actually

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.330
a 60% growth in the number of consumers

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.390
who are living in the home

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.700
due to our increasing
caseload of children.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.250
So we're seeing a large growth

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.210
in the number of individuals
under 22 who we serve,

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.030
and obviously most of
them are gonna be living

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.050
in the home of their parent or guardian.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.970
However, across the
lifespan, we're also seeing

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.410
an increase in the number
of adults who we serve

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.960
who are choosing to live at home.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.270
We're seeing that more often
than we did 10 years ago,

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.160
and you can see that in the
bars on the bottom there.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.120
So 10 years ago, 74%
were living in the home

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.850
of a parent, family, or guardian.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:34.133
And in 2018, it was 80% of who
the regional centers serve.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.950
Okay, we're also seeing
a change in the landscape

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.940
of the racial and ethnic makeup

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.330
of the individuals in our system,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.230
and this is similar to what we see

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.110
across the state of California in general,

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.820
but the largest shift has been in Hispanic

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.030
or Latino individuals that we serve.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.430
So we've seen an increase in individuals

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.830
who identify as Hispanic or Latino.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.050
10 years ago, they were
34% of our population,

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.390
and now they are 39%,
whereas we've seen a decrease

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.550
in the share of individuals who identify

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:13.550
as white or Caucasian, 39% in 2008,

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.833
now they represent 31%, so
their share has gone down.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.270
I should also note, half
of the Hispanic population

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.810
is in the three-to-21-year group,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:29.560
so we see a large increase,
particularly in childhood

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.670
for that ethnic group,
whereas only a third

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.903
of the white or Caucasian group
is in that same age range.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.740
So we see more of the share of individuals

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.940
who are white are
actually adults right now.

00:12:44.303 --> 00:12:47.090
And then overall, there
are at least 23 ethnicities

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.520
and 45 different languages identified

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.070
by our consumers across the state.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.670
So we're seeing a big shift in terms

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.520
of the racial and ethnic makeup

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.340
of the individuals that we serve,

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.390
and I think that that's
an important indicator

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:05.070
of making sure that our
services and supports

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.550
are all going to be
linguistically accessible

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.060
to individuals and culturally
sensitive and appropriate

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.550
for the children and adults that we serve.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.010
So we will probably see some shift

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.670
in the way that our system is gonna need

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:23.670
to be supporting individuals
of all ethnicities.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.690
Okay, we're seeing some changes in terms

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.600
of the ages of the individuals
that we're serving,

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.380
and we're seeing that individuals

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.320
with disabilities are living longer.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.990
So 10 years ago, 8% of our
population was 52 or older.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.763
Today it's 10%, so that group
is increasing, which is great.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.870
Okay, all right, in terms of
the five diagnostic groups

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.590
that are eligible for services,

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.660
those include Autism, Cerebral Palsy,

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.960
Epilepsy, Intellectual
Disability, and then Other,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.770
which is our fifth
category, and this would be

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.430
disabilities that are similar in nature

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.970
to an intellectual disability.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.300
We're seeing changes
in the share of these,

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.010
and I do wanna note that these aren't

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.710
mutually exclusive categorizations,

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.340
so an individual could have
more than one diagnosis,

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.560
and they're gonna be
counted more than once here.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.460
So if you're trying to add up the bars,

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.283
they may add up to more
than 100%, and that's why.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.900
But the key takeaway here
is over the last 10 years,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.180
we've seen an increase in
the share of individuals

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.430
who have a diagnosis of autism.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.520
So they've risen from 19% to 38%,

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.210
whereas the share of all
other diagnostic groups

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.173
have been declining
over the last 10 years.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.660
Okay, and so looking
deeper at the population

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.200
of individuals with autism, these would be

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.030
the individuals with autism 10 years ago,

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.320
in 2008, in blue, and then in orange,

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.790
this is 2018, so you can see a big rise

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.583
in the number of individuals
with autism in our system.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.637
We actually saw an increase of
175% over the last 10 years,

00:15:08.637 --> 00:15:11.810
and you can contrast
that to our total growth

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:16.030
that I told you about was 42%
for our entire population.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.420
So we're really seeing a
disproportionate growth

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.570
in the number of
individuals who have autism.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.970
And the totals have
changed from 38,558 in 2008

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.970
to now we just hit 106,000
individuals who have autism.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.100
And if you look closely at the graph here,

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.620
they're binned by age group,
three to five on the left

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.960
going up to 62-plus,
and you probably noticed

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.960
the bulk of the bars here
are on the left side,

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.710
so at the younger ages, so
you see the tallest bars

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.060
are at the youngest age groups there.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.483
And we see, well, that came out funny,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.700
80% of the total population
of individuals with autism

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.830
are under 22, so most of those folks

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.603
who have autism that we're
serving are children.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.760
So that's gonna have some
important implications

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.160
for how we serve these
individuals as they age.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.010
We're gonna see a sharp increase

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.810
in the number of individuals with autism

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.240
who are gonna be transitioning

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.853
from the school system
into young adulthood.

00:16:18.996 --> 00:16:20.860
And looking at the
graph on the right here,

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.070
this is all of the
individuals that we serve

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:28.030
who are under 22, and autism makes up 60%,

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.440
so they're making up more
than half of the children

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.913
that we serve in our service system.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.920
Okay, so our increase in autism

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.700
has pretty strong implication

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.510
for our service delivery
system and being prepared

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.910
to support individuals
who are on the spectrum.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.840
This has become a focus of our department

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.720
and probably the primary reason

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.330
for my position in the department,

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.500
but this isn't precluding our work

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.970
for all of the other diagnostic types.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.110
Our department is still
dedicated to serving

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.750
individuals of all
development disabilities,

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.820
and the services and
supports that we develop

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.240
and prioritize are gonna
be with the thought in mind

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.680
that we wanna serve everyone that we can

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.163
in the best way possible.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.383
Okay, you ready?

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.230
- So as Lauren went through, you can see

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.210
a lot of the changing demographics

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.820
of the individuals we serve,
and so as we're identifying

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.070
those changing, the
trends that are changing

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:47.030
in our population, we're
also trying to learn

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.750
what their changing needs
and expectations are

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.330
of the service system, and
I think one of the things

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.530
that the department has
really spent a lotta time on

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.260
and continues to be committed
to is community engagement

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.700
so that we can have ongoing discussions

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.120
with stakeholders to learn
about what their needs

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.790
and expectations are
from the service system.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:12.300
So in addition to just kind
of the national trends,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.300
particularly in their focus
on community-based services

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:22.180
and decreasing or closing
developmental centers,

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.240
we are also relying on that information

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.930
that we're gathering from stakeholders

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.600
to determine what the
department's priorities

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.710
and initiatives are in these coming years,

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:38.377
because as we see and as
Director Bargmann would say,

00:18:38.377 --> 00:18:41.660
"We have new architects
of our service system,"

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.360
and so we're listening to them to see

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.167
what that service system
needs to look like

00:18:45.167 --> 00:18:47.410
and the expectations of what life is like

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.720
in the community where you live,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.330
what you do during the
day, the relationships

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.740
that you develop all
have to be acknowledged.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.420
And so as far as the
priorities and initiatives,

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.410
the first thing I just wanna touch on

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.062
is that developmental center closure.

00:19:02.062 --> 00:19:04.420
I talked about it a
little bit, but in 2012,

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.840
there was a moratorium on anyone

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.000
moving into the developmental center,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
and then in 2015, there
was the closure plan

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.000
for three of the developmental centers,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.630
Sonoma, which closed in December,

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.990
Fairview Developmental Center

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.990
and Porterville Developmental Center's

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.180
general treatment area which are scheduled

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:29.063
in that closure plan to close in 2021.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.800
By the end of 2021, then,
and much likely very,

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.840
and likely more, pluh, likely
sooner (laughs) than 2021,

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.490
given that 118 people are
actively transitioning

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:53.090
into the community, we are really focused

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.660
on community development
and what we need to be doing

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.440
to not only develop
resources for the individuals

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.950
transitioning from development centers

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.570
into the community,
which of course has been

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.120
the major focus over the
past couple of years,

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.260
but also to be developing resources

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.130
for individuals who never have lived in

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.880
or never would have lived
in a developmental center,

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.240
particularly those individuals
who have very complex

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.613
medical, behavioral,
and psychiatric needs.

00:20:26.757 --> 00:20:31.660
And so through the Developmental
Service Task Force,

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.630
which is a statewide task force,

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.880
through other community engagement,

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.540
we have developed new service models.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.800
Residential has been the primary focus

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.010
to assist in having people
have good-quality lives

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:50.210
in the community and homes
that address their challenging

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.920
medical and behavioral
and psychiatric needs.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.920
But also importantly looking
at what those resource,

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.160
what that resource development
or community development

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.310
needs to look like given how many people

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.630
are living at home and want
to stay living at home.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.520
So I think the most important note here

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.780
is that our community
development has to meet

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.300
the changing needs of
the people that we serve,

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.390
and it has to keep pace with those needs,

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:23.333
which I think is something
that we continue to work on.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.220
In addition to that, I
think one of the things

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.340
that has come up as a system issue

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.940
is how do we do that in
not only a timely way

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.590
but in a sustainable way,
and we don't have time

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.590
in our short time here,
but one of the barriers

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.220
potentially to developing needed resources

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.350
is making sure that providers
have sustainable rates.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.960
And so I just wanna quickly mention

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.960
the department's requirement
to engage in a rate study

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.850
and that you can get a lot of information

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.630
about the results of the rate study

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:03.343
and some of the proposed new
rate models on the DDS website.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.210
As far as the Safety
Net, as a result of input

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.120
from that Developmental
Services Task Force

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.130
and other stakeholder engagement,

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.040
in 2017, the department
released a Safety Net

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.030
or crisis plan, and the focus of that

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.330
Safety Net was really
ensuring that crisis services

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.440
and services that would prevent a crisis

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.630
were developed or
expanded in the community

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.270
to support people moving out
of the developmental center

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:34.810
and also, again, to
ensure that individuals

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.200
who are living at home can stay at home

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.240
and not be placed in more
restrictive settings.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.120
So the Safety Net Plan itself,

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.120
which is not a one-time
document but an ongoing

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.590
planning process has been looking at how

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.370
to develop crisis services,
mobile crisis services,

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.800
acute crisis services
throughout the community

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.270
as well as some of those
intensive support models

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.320
in residential settings to help people

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.383
so that they can avoid going
the more restrictive settings.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.990
It is really hard to
do these priority area

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:17.250
that could take up their own
time in more than 30 minutes.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.880
The next one is home and
community-based services rules.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.590
In January 2014, the federal

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.930
Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid issued new rules

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.530
to enhance home and
community-based services,

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:33.160
and those homes and programs have to meet

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.120
those new criteria by March 2022

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.540
to qualify for federal programming.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.980
And so in the past budget acts,

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.910
there's been money
allocated to the department

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:49.690
to assist providers in
changing their practices,

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:51.960
changing whatever they need
to to come into compliance

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.650
with those rules, and the final rule

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.190
really focuses on what is very consistent

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:59.650
and aligned with the Lanterman Act

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.940
with regards to making
sure that individuals

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.510
are integrated in their communities,

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:08.420
have opportunities to
participate in their community,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.813
and have full access to the benefits

00:24:11.813 --> 00:24:13.963
of living in their community.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.170
The Self-Determination Program,

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:26.640
Governor Brown signed that
into law in October 2013,

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.050
and the department, and
the goal was establishing

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.410
a statewide Self-Determination Project

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:33.940
so that individuals and families

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.300
could have more freedom and control

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.090
and responsibility over
the services and supports

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.850
that they receive in order to meet

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.870
the objectives that they set forth

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.310
in their Individual Program Plan,

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.240
and so DDS has been working
the stakeholder advisory group

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.150
over the past several years to develop

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.080
the framework of that
Self-Determination Project.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.980
It did get approval from
CMS in June of last year,

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.420
and so in the phase-in of the program,

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:06.270
2,500 participants were
selected in October 2018,

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.590
and now the process currently
is that regional centers

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.130
and local advisory committees
are receiving training

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.250
on how to conduct their own orientations

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.510
in their local communities
with participants

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.163
as the program is moving forward.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.830
For Competitive Integrated Employment,

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:27.660
this effort really began in 2014,

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.310
and it is an interdepartmental project

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.020
with Department of Developmental Services,

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.570
Department of Rehabilitation,

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.880
and the Department of Education,

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.830
and a variety of other stakeholders

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.540
developing a blueprint for
community and integrated

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.140
employment which was
released in May of 2016,

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.010
and the purpose of that blueprint

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.570
is to improve collaboration
between departments

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.820
so that we can all help prepare

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.420
and support individuals
who have intellectual

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.550
and developmental disabilities

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:05.550
to have opportunities and
to join the workforce.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.210
And it's really focused on
increasing those opportunities

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.690
to prepare for and participate

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.840
in competitive integrated employment,

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.770
and just to make sure
that people are informed

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.810
about the decisions, the
options that they really have

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.880
to join the workforce
and what kind of supports

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.840
they can get to prepare
for that transition to it

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.660
after school and engage in it
throughout their adulthood.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.850
Since 2016, DDS has
implemented two programs

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.720
that have had an impact on
a couple a thousand people

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.010
to date, and those Paid Internship Program

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.270
and competitive employment
incentive payment programs

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:49.270
to help get people experience
with and into situations

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.840
that lead towards integrated employment.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.260
And then the last priority
that we're gonna talk

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.940
about today is the
Disparity Funds Project.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.440
Annually, the department
and regional centers

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.710
collaborate to gather information

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.570
through the purchase of service,

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.000
and what over the years has been indicated

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.490
is that there are significant disparities

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:19.650
that exist among some
regional center populations,

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.540
particularly along the
lines of race and ethnicity.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.270
And in 2016, a section was added

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.140
to the Welfare and Institutions Code

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.890
allocating $11 million annually

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:34.690
to the department to
assist regional centers

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.920
in implementing strategies
that reduce those disparities.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.440
In budget acts since 2106,
that $11 million was expanded

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.450
to fund projects through
the regional centers

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.390
and also through
community-based organizations.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:54.390
And in the past fiscal year,
actually in this current

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:58.680
fiscal year, '18-19, we
approved 70 projects,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.680
and 32 have just come to an end
at the end of December 2018,

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.280
and so we're in the process of working

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.990
with the regional centers on gathering

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.150
outcome information and
being able to present

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.160
that information to the community.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.620
But the projects have really focused

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.730
on helping increase access to information

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.290
about services through the
regional center system,

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:24.790
providing assistance to families

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.970
and individuals during the intake process,

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:30.025
and just empowering people to understand

00:28:30.025 --> 00:28:33.853
the system and advocate
for their needed services.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.130
And then finally, again,
just kind of, I know,

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.848
a very high-level overview
with lots of details

00:28:42.848 --> 00:28:46.060
that hopefully would be
available on our website

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.163
if you're interested in a
particular priority area.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.360
I think that one of the key things, again,

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.530
in looking at the trends in our population

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.300
is that we really are committed

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.580
and want to hear from
our stakeholder groups

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.700
and work collaboratively
with the regional centers

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.440
to meet the changing needs, to keep pace

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.740
with those changing needs so that people

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.170
can have quality lives,
healthy and safe lives

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.470
where they wanna live and be doing

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.730
what they wanna do with their days,

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.690
and we really hope that
just this high level

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.220
has been useful to you.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.593
And again, on behalf of Director Bargmann,

00:29:24.593 --> 00:29:27.684
I wanna think for your
time and invitation.

00:29:27.684 --> 00:29:30.851
(audience applauding)

00:29:31.857 --> 00:29:32.690
Thank you.
