Adriene: Hi, I'm Adriene Hill.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.029
Mr. Clifford: And I'm Jacob Clifford. And
welcome to Crash Course Economics.

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.070
Adriene: So far we talked about GDP and how
the overall economy, but we haven't really

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.680
talked about why some countries have a high
GDP and others have low GDP. So, why are some

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.360
countries rich, and others poor?

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.070
Let's investigate.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.920
Mr. Clifford: Look, a clue! Productivity!

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.160
Adriene: Hmm...

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:39.040
[Theme Music]

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.539
Mr. Clifford: So, if we're gonna figure out
why some countries are rich and some are poor,

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.670
we have to first define what it means to be
rich.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.870
Economists measure economic output by looking
at Gross Domestic Product or GDP. As you remember

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.420
from the last video, GDP is the market value of all goods
and services newly produced in a country in one year.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.600
India's GDP is over six times larger than
the GDP of Singapore, but that doesn't mean

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.540
the average Indian is richer than the average
Singaporean. That's because India has 240

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.860
times more people than Singapore.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.040
So, economists look at something called GDP
per capita, to determine how wealthy a country

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.800
is. GDP per capita is the GDP of the country
divided by its population. It represents output

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.220
per person, and a country with a high GDP
per capita is considered rich.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.800
Of course, some of you may say being rich
has nothing to do with GDP or money. It has

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.070
to do with whether or not you're happy. Fine,
money may not buy happiness, but it can prevent

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.640
a lot of misery. The United Nations' Human
Development Index, or HDI, measures life expectancy,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.020
literacy, education, quality of life, and
it ranks countries according to their findings.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.680
The data shows the country that have a high
GDP per capita have far less infant mortality,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.240
poverty and preventable diseases.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.730
So, economists often used GDP per capita to
measure a country's standard of living. Countries

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.770
with the lowest standard of living are the
ones that are conventionally considered poor.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.360
So, why are some countries poor?

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.240
Adriene: If you ask someone on the street,
they might say the difference is due to lack

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.500
of natural resources or inept governments,
that is if the person doesn't subscribe to some

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.740
antiquated racial or social Darwinist stereotypes --
but we should talk about those ideas. Well,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.780
let's skip the racial and social Darwinists stereotypes,
but resources and leadership are interesting.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.730
First, resources. Look at Singapore: third in GDP
per capita and ninth on the Human Development

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.950
Index. Or Switzerland, ninth in GDP per capita
and third on the HDI. Singapore is a teeny

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.950
tiny island, and Switzerland's main natural
resources is cows. And cows are great! I love

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.490
cows, love love, but they aren't really natural
resources.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.560
Zimbabwe, on the other hand, has tons of natural
resources, like fertile soil, coal and rare

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.569
minerals, but their economy? It's a wreck.
It's a hundred and sixty first (161st) in

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.209
GPD per capita and a hundred and fifty sixth
(156th) on the HDI. Their incompetent

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.249
and corrupt government keeps them poor.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.430
For comparison sake, the GDP per capita in
the US is 18 times higher than in Bangladesh,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.880
and we're not just trouncing Bangladesh. GDP
per capita wise, we're also crushing the GDP

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.180
numbers of our great-grandparents. Take that,
Aloysius!

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.640
GDP per capita in the US today is about
8 times higher than a hundred years ago. That's

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.140
pretty impressive. Maybe the Thought Bubble
can produce an explanation.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.680
Mr. Clifford: Let's say John runs a bakery.
Each worker to produce a dozen donuts per

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.080
hour, and each donut sells for $1. If John
wants to stay in business, he can't pay his

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.720
workers more than $12 an hour.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.510
Obviously, he needs to pay for the ingredients
and the oven, but even if you wanted to be

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.140
generous, he couldn't pay them $20 an hour.
They just don't produce enough for us to cover

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.800
the cost. But if John can find a way for each
worker to produce four dozen donuts per hour,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.600
he can pay them $20 per hour. Simply put,
the more that each worker can produce,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.220
the more money each can earn.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.440
Economists argue that the main reason some
countries are rich is because of their productivity.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.440
Their ability to produce more output, per
worker, per hour. US workers, altogether,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.310
earn 18 times more per hour than Bangladeshi
workers, because they're able to produce 18

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.709
times more output per hour. US workers today
earn 8 times more per hour than US workers

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.700
a hundred years ago, because they produce
8 times more output per hour. But not only

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.260
is US producing more stuff, it's also producing higher
value products, like Avengers movies and jet engines.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.090
So going back to our bakery example, it's
like a worker from a hundred years ago be

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.710
able to produce six plain donuts per hour,
while workers today is able to produce 60

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.500
salted caramel designer cupcakes per hour.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.020
Adriene: Thanks, Thought Bubble. Before we
go further, we need to point out the limitations

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.200
of this bakery example. It's true, productivity
is key. A country that is more productive

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.260
can create more stuff and can generate higher
incomes, but in real life, it doesn't always look like that.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.520
For example, in the US, the GDP per capita
has been steadily increasing for decades,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.560
but median family incomes haven't changed
much at all. This gets to issues of income

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.500
inequality, and we're gonna devote an entire
episode to it.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.080
Limitations aside, low productivity remains
a fundamental reason why some countries are

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.949
poor. Higher productivity not only helps explain
why we have more money to buy stuff, but also

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:52.000
why we have more stuff to buy. And speaking
of stuff to buy, because it is socially unacceptable

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.220
somehow for me to appear in the same clothes
over and over, I need 40 blouses to make this

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.220
series. That is a lot of blouses. That strains
resources, pollutes the planet, and at high

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.020
levels like 40 is completely unsustainable. Don't worry
though, some of these are from thrift stores.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.940
So what about people in poor countries? What
do they need? Well, they need food, clothing

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.320
and housing, they need clean water and plumbing
and sewers, they need hospitals and medicine,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.040
but all those things have to be produced,
so a country that produces more of these things

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.830
with fewer resources is gonna be wealthier
and healthier, and perhaps even happier than

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.870
a country that can't. But making a million
cell phones isn't very impressive if your

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.850
country has a hundred million people, so we
need to look at how much stuff we produce

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.380
per person. That's GDP Per Capita.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.820
Mr. Clifford: So if everything all boils down
to productivity, what makes some countries

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.100
more productive than others? Well, let's go
back and look at the main ingredients that

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.150
we need to produce things, what economists
call the factors of production.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.150
First, you need land, which includes all natural
resources, and then you need workers which

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.310
is labor, and then you need capital which
includes machines and factories and infrastructure,

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.699
things you need to produce other things. One
special type of capital is the workers' education,

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.090
knowledge and skills required to produce things.
Economists call this human capital. So school's

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.740
not just about torturing you, except for PE,
it's about helping your human capital.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.380
The quantity and quality of these resources
is the first step to being more productive,

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.680
but perhaps even more important is how you
use them. Increasing the amount of capital

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.530
has a cost, but finding new ways to organize
production is virtually free. Economists call

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.580
the organizational effectiveness "technology."
Think of it as the good ideas about how to

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.840
combine labor and capital that you already
have.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.700
US workers produce so much more than Bangladeshi
workers because the US has more factories,

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.460
robots, and computers. But more capital only
gets you so far; it increases your production

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.350
capacity but it also eats up some of that
production capacity. You have to develop more

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.160
factories and workers and machines to make
more capital, and then replace them when they

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.740
wear out. Technology on the other hand takes
the same amount of resources and organizes

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.380
them in a way to produce more output.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.860
Adriene: Here's an example. Twenty-five years
ago, you could find computers in just about

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.729
every workplace in the US, but productivity
growth in the US was flat. Then, starting

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:03.149
in about 1995, US productivity boomed, led
by computer technology. SO what changed?

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:08.360
In the late 80's and early 90's, most workplace
computers were individual units, plugged into

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.710
nothing but an electric outlet. They were
useful for writing and printing documents,

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.229
or acting as overgrown calculators, and playing
Oregon Trail, but that was about it. When

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.860
the World Wide Web came along everything changed.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.699
It turns out that computers are far more useful
when they can talk to each other. The computer

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.970
at the store could talk to the computer at
the warehouse which could talk to the computer

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.410
at the factory. That means I can get a new
blouse from the other side of the world pretty

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:36.830
much immediately. Connectivity equals productivity.
Productivity in the US boomed for the next

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.889
10 years, and wages jumped as a result.

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:44.070
200 years ago, productivity in the US wasn't
that great, but it grew a little bit every

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.060
year. Compounding that over decades and centuries
gives us the huge gap between the US standard

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.500
of living and that of many developing countries.
The good news is that in recent decades, many

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.169
developing countries, like China, South Korea,
Mexico and Ghana have dramatically improved

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:01.069
their capital in technology and have seen
their living standards rise.

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:04.819
So if you want a single, one-word answer as
to why some countries are more successful

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:08.419
than others, here it is: Productivity. So
if you look at the big picture--

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:11.460
Mr. Clifford: And by "big picture," we mean
both globally and historically--

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.930
Adriene: increasing productivity has resulted
in increased standards of living for much

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:20.330
of humanity over the last hundred years, and
it's hard to argue that this is a bad thing.
