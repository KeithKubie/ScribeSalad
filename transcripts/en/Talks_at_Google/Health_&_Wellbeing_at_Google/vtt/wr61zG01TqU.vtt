00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.760
HENRY WEI: Christina was
trained by Kim West, the sleep

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.167
lady in her Gentle
Sleep Coach program.

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:12.750
This is a program
that involves dozens

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.120
of hours of training and
exam and participation

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.860
in case supervision.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.470
Christina Gantcher also
complete advanced training

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.170
for younger babies about
four or five months of age.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.670
Her educational
backgrounds includes

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.010
a BA in comparative
literature from UMass

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.860
and a masters of science in
psychoanalytic developmental

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.590
psychology from
University College London.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.410
She is a mother of two boys
and lives in New York City

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.034
with her husband Mike Gantcher.

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:37.950
She had the good fortune
to work with Kim West

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.190
personally when her older
son had sleep difficulties.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.290

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.430
Without further ado, Christina.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.930
Thanks.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.180
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Thank you.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.090
Thank you, everyone.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.190
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.130
And as you can see on the
title of my presentation,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.900
my goal here is to help
everybody become sleep smart

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.990
and to really help
you understand

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.870
why certain things happen
or don't happen in terms

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.480
of your child and sleep.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.210
And I used this
subtitle for a while,

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.680
but I thought it was fitting
that it is still in play

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.860
because ultimately,
becoming sleep smart

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.880
is really what you really need
to know about your child's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.740
sleep because you've actually
exhausted the Google search

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.045
engine as well as yourself.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.510
So there are really three
parts to this presentation.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.260
We're going to talk about
some basic sleep science.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.470
Then I'm going to get into
the most common challenges

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.480
and problems parents
find with their child

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.080
and sleep and then
talk about solutions.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.570
So in terms of common myths,
the most popular common myths

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.660
I confront in my
work are that babies

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.000
will sleep when they are
12 pounds and 12 weeks.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.840
Wrong.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.130
There is no medical
research to back that up.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.199
Number two, babies will
sleep through the night

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.360
when they start solids.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.280
Wrong again.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.200
Food does not have anything to
do with sleep or sleeping well.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.490
And third, if you put
your baby to sleep late,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.730
they will sleep long and
longer in the morning,

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.740
which is the key there.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.590
That is also false,
unfortunately.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.490
And we'll talk about
why that is the case.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.140
If there's only
one thing that you

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.830
will remember from
this talk, I want you

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.020
to remember this at all times.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.930
That sleep is actually
a learned skill.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.270
Some babies will
simply find it easier,

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.690
and others will find
it more challenging.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.210
And there's a number
of reasons that is.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.950
But it's always
important to remember

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.880
that it's a learned
skill just like crawling,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.262
walking, talking.

00:03:04.262 --> 00:03:05.595
All of those are learned skills.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.230
Secondly, sleep is a
neurological development.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.730
And most babies are ready to
sleep through the night, as we

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.230
say, around six months.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.040
And we'll get into the
details of that in a minute.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.380
And lastly on the slide,
I want to highlight

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.810
that there's great
variability about when

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.690
babies are ready to
sleep through the night.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.110
And I say that because there's
so much information out

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.770
there and so many books that
promise parents things that

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.250
are simply the case for maybe
20% or 30% of the population.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.150
But if you're in 70% to
80% of the population,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.370
it doesn't really
matter, does it?

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.830
So I always highlight
that variability

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.904
because some babies
may be ready to do

00:03:54.904 --> 00:03:57.070
that sleeping through the
night earlier than others,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.060
and some later.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.910
And that's OK.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.560
So in terms of talking
about sleep science,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.020
technically, there is no
sleeping through the night.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.091
Now if you're a parent
who has a sleep challenge,

00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:11.590
you're probably
going, you're right.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.214
There is no sleeping
through the night.

00:04:13.214 --> 00:04:16.220
I haven't gotten
to that point yet.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.490
But I say this
because it's actually

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.840
normal for every person to
have several night wakings.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.130
That's a brain function.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.260
Everybody wakes up
several times a night.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.520
The issue is if you know how
to put yourself to sleep,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.260
you can do it all
night long, as it were.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.830
On a completely
neurological level--

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.290
and I'm simplifying this
for today's purpose--

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.540
we have two kinds of sleep.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.830
We have deep sleep
and active sleep.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.840
We begin our night sleep going
into non-REM sleep, which is

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.120
our deepest stretch of sleep.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.990
And then in the
middle of the night--

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.870
and when I say
middle of the night,

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.740
that means sometime between,
let's say, 12:00 and 3:00 AM--

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.440
we shift gears very
much like a car

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.450
and go into active
and light sleep.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.860
And lastly, in terms of
the science piece of this,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.880
I want to highlight, again,
there is no scientific proof

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.690
that food will help your
baby sleep better or well.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.650
And that doesn't mean we're
talking about milk or solids.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.400
Again, thinking about sleep
as a neurological development,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.660
a brain development
that goes on a fairly

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.670
consistent and structured path
is important to keep in mind.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.680
Common issues.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.130
You are not alone.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.090
So I would say the
things that I tend

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.950
to help parents with the
most are the following.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.360
My baby goes to sleep very
easily, but wakes several times

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.050
a night.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.550
Right?

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.920
So dealing with night
wakings, very common.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.980
My baby needs to be
nursed or rocked or fed

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.490
to sleep all night long.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.680
Again, several times a night.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.040
I hear very often from
parents, particularly babies

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.590
under six months,
my baby will only

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.330
sleep being held or co-sleeping.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.630
And then lastly,
my baby won't nap.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.610
Naps can be very challenging
for many children,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.830
particularly after a certain
age because of development

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.320
for a variety of reasons.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.290
So what's normal, right?

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.810
Because that's really important
to understand, particularly

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.800
when you've got your next
door neighbor saying,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.980
well, my kid's been
sleeping through the night

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.460
for the past several months.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.680
I don't know what's
going on with you.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.230
But it's very important to
understand what is normal.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.780
The age of the baby is really
important to keep in mind.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.000
So developmental age is very
important in respect to sleep.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.670
And whether the baby was
born pre-term, right?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:06.330
So before 40 weeks or
early, because sleep

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.860
definitely goes on a
development after 40 weeks.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.170
So if your baby
was born pre-term,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.006
even if it's only
a few weeks, it's

00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:16.130
not that there's a problem.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.710
It's that they simply may not
get to certain development

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:25.470
sleep wise until they
hit different milestones.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.740
Are there any medical
conditions, right?

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.810
So the most common
medical conditions

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.630
that tend to stand in the way
of sleep are things like reflux,

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:41.600
or GERD, any ENT difficulties,
such as enlarged adenoids

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.100
or tonsils, any type of
breathing difficulty.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.400
Is there a family
history of any of this?

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.440
And then lastly, also
anemia, low iron stores

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.110
can disturb sleep.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.600
So all of those things are
very important to keep in mind

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.380
if you are confronting a sleep
challenge with your child.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:08.090
And in terms of young babies,
I want to highlight that babies

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.700
under five months--

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.700
OK?

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.370
Feeding is more
important than sleeping.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.130
And the reason I say that
is because, again, there's

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.900
a lot of information
out there that says,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:23.540
well, by 12 pounds in
12 weeks, your baby

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.580
doesn't need to eat at night.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.750
Some may not.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.910
I would say the vast majority
still may need to eat at night.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.260
And so feeding
really comes first

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.419
for those first four to five
months in my estimation.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.710
We need to make sure that
that's going perfectly.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.799
And if it's not for some
reason, we definitely

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:47.210
want to have parents talk
to their pediatrician

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.480
and/or a lactation consultant
to rule out any type of feeding

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.570
difficulty for the child.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.800
Again, think about
what's normal.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.720
The American Academy
of Pediatrics

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.610
states that babies
under six months

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.860
may not have regular
sleep patterns.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.890
Now, many will present
regular sleep patterns,

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.750
but this gives you the idea that
there's a big range of normal.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.920
And that's OK.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.710
And in terms of
the AAP guidelines

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:20.270
in terms of how much your
child needs on a daily basis,

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.400
they recently reviewed
them about two years ago

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.810
and put out new guidelines
in terms of averages,

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.730
about 17 to 14 hours a day
for babies under 12 months.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.590
Now, it's important
to keep in mind

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.930
that in these first
few months, babies

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.510
are going to sleep
short stretches

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.640
and be awake short stretches.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.055
So those first few months, we're
talking about short windows.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.990
So again, to go over
sleeping through the night,

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.960
because that tends to be
what most of us as parents

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.820
are looking for.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.520
To say again, there is no
sleeping through the night,

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.330
but children need to
understand and remember

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.750
how they fall asleep because
that is the skill we're

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.650
looking for all night long.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.630
And then of course
later for naps as well.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.740
And so the way a baby knows
how to fall asleep at bedtime

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.960
becomes the foundation
of what they're going

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.690
to look for all night long.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:31.460
So to highlight one problem that
many parents face, and I just

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:36.000
like to tease out a little
bit, I talked to many parents,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.080
particularly at this time
of year or in May who say,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.660
my child wakes up every
single day at 5 AM.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.900
Now, of course, with sunrise
so early this time of year,

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.710
that can be due to too much
light in the child's room

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:49.721
too early.

00:10:49.721 --> 00:10:51.970
But I'd like to highlight
the difference between night

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.570
wakings and early rising because
many children tend to get up

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.430
very early in the morning.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.510
And so night wakings happen
any time after bedtime

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:08.090
and are usually due to too late
of a bed time, the baby being

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:16.320
put to bed asleep already,
and also nap deprivation.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.200
So either naps that are too
short or just poorly timed

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.450
can cause night wakings.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.520
Now, in terms of early rising--

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.600
which I define as waking
consistently at 5:00

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.170
AM or really any time
in that, let's say, 4:30

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.110
to before 6:00 AM time--

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.020
that also usually
happens because bedtime

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:44.720
is too late, because
of nap deprivation,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.590
and/or a medical condition.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.450
So there are certain
medical conditions,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.960
particularly the
breathing difficulties,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.330
that can cause early rising.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.510
So I just like to highlight
the differences there

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:01.280
because they can be
different although similarly

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.990
related problems.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.990
Naps.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:10.930
So naps are really important
for children basically three

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.000
years and under.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.400
And it's really chicken
and egg in the sense

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:21.970
that nighttime sleep affects
daytime sleep, and vise versa.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.110
So many times, naps
will not be great

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.870
until nighttime
sleep gets better.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.710
But conversely, naps
may not be great

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.810
because nighttime
sleep is a problem.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.570
So in many ways, bedtime
is the foundation

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.480
of how your child
understands to sleep.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.170
We then build on it with
proper nighttime sleep,

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:50.550
and then naps will usually
fall into place last.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.600
And so I like to highlight that
as well because many people

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.720
have questions with their
children in terms of naps

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.880
because they change
so much from,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:06.250
let's say, 6 months to 12
months to 18 months to beyond.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.930
And in terms of when
children will stop napping,

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.290
it tends to be sometime between
the third and fourth year

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:13.800
of life.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.940
So now, talking about solutions.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.020
One of the most important
things I talk to parents about

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.390
is crib acclimatization.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.020
And what that means
is your child really

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.400
needs to understand where
you expect them to sleep.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.180
So imagine last night,
you went to bed.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.760
And you distinctly remember
the washing up process,

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.550
or taking a shower, or getting
into bed thinking, oh God.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.810
Thank goodness.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.390
And then you find
yourself waking up

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.800
in the middle of
your kitchen floor.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.160
And you think, wait, no, it was
not a crazy, wonderful night

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:54.681
last night.

00:13:54.681 --> 00:13:55.930
This should not have happened.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.490
How did I end up here?

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.510
And that sort of
out-of-body experience

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:06.010
I don't know who moved me is
what your child will experience

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.600
when they are transferred.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.670
And at some age, that transfer
tends to stop working.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.110
Now what does that mean?

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.900
I put my baby to
sleep here in my arms.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.670
It's all wonderful and cozy.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.860
I transfer him into the crib.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.720
But then he wakes
up two hours later

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.350
and is screaming bloody murder,
and I'm not really sure why.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.900
Well, one of the reasons
is because he doesn't

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.360
remember getting into the crib.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.280
So that's really important.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.670
So making sure that your
child spend some time

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.610
during the day--

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.750
I usually suggest few
minutes in the morning,

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.350
a few minutes in the
afternoon while they're awake.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.700
Chilling out, relaxing, hanging
out in their sleep space

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.670
so that it is not
a surprise to them

00:14:54.670 --> 00:15:00.800
when they are asked to go to
sleep in that place later on.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.810
And if you heard me say go to
sleep in that place later on,

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.850
ultimately, we want our children
to go to sleep in their crib.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.120
Not in our arms, not
bouncing on a ball,

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.220
not being held,
because we want them

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.810
to experience falling asleep
where they should stay asleep.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.970
So getting them used
to their sleep space,

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.020
acclimating them a little bit
each day is really important.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.330
I usually suggest
this as a first step

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.520
in getting out of any
kind of sleep challenge

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.180
with your child.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.340
Next.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.090
Again, in terms of
when a young baby is

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.130
ready to sleep
through the night,

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.930
that baby is eating
every three or four

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.640
hours throughout a night.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.696
Well, that's not
going to happen if--

00:15:49.696 --> 00:15:51.070
sleeping through
the night is not

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.820
going to happen obviously
if they're still

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.140
eating very frequently.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.180
So most babies will
be ready to go a night

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.280
stretch without
sleeping sometime

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.290
between six and nine months.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.500
But that's something to speak
to the pediatrician about.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.760
And ask the doctor, is my
baby ready to sleep 10, 11, 12

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.472
hours without a feed?

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.680
That's something they should
be coordinating with you

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.550
and really relating to in
terms of their growth chart

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.800
and how they're gaining weight.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.720
And of course, there
are different methods

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.140
of night weaning that
the doctor should

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.100
be able to guide you about,
or your lactation consultant

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:36.500
if [INAUDIBLE] And
then also figure out

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.400
if my baby is feeding to
sleep, then obviously,

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.610
we change that association
first at bedtime

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.190
so that then throughout the
night, we can be consistent.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.740
So that word consistency.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.640
Being consistent about any type
of sleep association behavior

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.670
is ultimately the most important
piece of changing things

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.510
if you're in a
challenger problem.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:06.220
Because when a child
experiences inconsistency,

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.900
it's going to create crying.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.710
It's just that simple.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.200
They don't understand our words.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.240
They understand our
behavior, right?

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.119
So having consistent
behavior is what

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.910
is going to get you
to the finish line.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.540
So ultimately,
what's inconsistent?

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.890
Perfect example is
well, at bedtime, we

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.550
have our last bottle, and
the nursery is really dark,

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:35.710
and he usually just drifts
off, and then I transfer him.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.810
But he's 10 months
old, and I really

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.310
don't think he needs
any food at night.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.490
So when he wakes up
around 12:00 or 1:00,

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.040
I just go in and sort of
pat his back to sleep,

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.740
and he goes back to
sleep pretty quickly.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.330
But then, of course, he wakes
up at 3 o'clock in the morning,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.360
and I just can't take it,
so I bring him into my bed.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.970
That's a perfect example
of inconsistent behavior

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:02.190
because that child never knows
am I going to get fed to sleep?

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.990
Is somebody just
going to pat my back?

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.630
Or am I just going to
come into bed with them?

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.610
So in some ways, having
one thing to undo is easier

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.550
and ultimately, of course,
being consistent about having

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:20.940
the baby fall asleep in their
crib is what we're looking for.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.010
Now in terms of methods, right?

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.770
Because there are lots of
different books out there

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.800
and lots of information
about how to change things.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.370
There's basically
three behavioral ways

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.640
of changing a sleep challenge.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:41.280
There's extinction, which
is well known as cry it out.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.260
And that essentially
is the method

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:48.420
of putting my child in
her crib at bedtime,

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.600
I say good night, I
leave, and that's it

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.590
until whatever time in
the morning you decide.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:59.550
That means no
checking, no nothing.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.140
And that's why we
call it cry it out.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.060
It does tend to be very popular.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.900
And if it works, it
works pretty quickly.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.750
It should work fairly quickly.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.150
The person who sort of
coined the methodology,

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.210
Dr. Marc Weissbluth, has said it
doesn't work for all children.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.180
So if you find
yourself in a situation

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.050
where it doesn't seem to be
getting better pretty quickly,

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:30.420
you definitely want to
change tack and course.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.870
Next, time checks.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.700
Time checks are basically
graduated extinction

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.570
and were really made popular
by Dr. Richard Ferber.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:45.720
So ferberizing, as many people
know it as, basically goes

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.210
under the premise
of well, I'm going

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:53.561
to give my child the space and
time to calm themselves down.

00:19:53.561 --> 00:19:54.060
Right?

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.730
So I'm going to put
the child in the crib,

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.630
leave, and then in
graduated time intervals,

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.840
quickly check on the
child, but ultimately

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.630
allow them to put
themselves to sleep.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:10.900
So that means going in graduated
intervals, let's say 5 minutes,

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.090
10 minutes, 15 minutes
from the last check,

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.680
not from the beginning.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.720
So you're not going
in every five minutes.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.780
You're extending
those intervals.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.220
And then lastly, feeding.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.830
And feeding really means--

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.520
in some ways, I like to think
of it as a behavioral weaning.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.930
So we're doing less and less
to assist the child as he

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:38.880
or she falls asleep and
then work our way away

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.930
in physical space.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:47.130
So those are sort of the
most popular methodologies

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:51.180
out there to have your
child get to sleep

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.370
and sleep well
through the night.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.380
And again, as I said
before, I always

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.650
want to encourage parents
to start at bedtime,

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.130
work on night time, and
then work on naps last.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:06.840
It just tends to be the most
effective way for things

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.780
to change efficiently
and most easily.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.900
And of course, if
all else fails,

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.000
please feel free to contact me.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.270
I work with families
across the country

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.730
and world at this point.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:28.580
And if not, we have a network
of gentle sleep coaches

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.439
which are out there ready
to help tired parents.

00:21:32.439 --> 00:21:33.314
HENRY WEI: All right.

00:21:33.314 --> 00:21:34.246
Thanks so much.

00:21:34.246 --> 00:21:34.911
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:35.411 --> 00:21:37.532
Thank you so much, Christina.

00:21:37.532 --> 00:21:39.490
We're going to take some
questions and answers.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.100
So go ahead and join those
microphones or [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.380
baby sleep Dory.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.010
And we've already got some
great questions up here,

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.340
and I suspect we're going
to hear echoes of what

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.530
you've recommended already.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:58.790
First one is "My son
is 15 months old,

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.660
and we can't get him to sleep at
night without a falling asleep

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.490
while drinking his
bottle, and then

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.647
putting him in his crib asleep.

00:22:06.647 --> 00:22:09.230
Do you have any tips for how we
can put him down awake for him

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.550
to fall asleep on his own?

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.081
Thank you."

00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:12.330
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: OK, great.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:18.830
So I would want to know
what time bedtime is.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.540
Let's say-- I'm
just going to say

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.220
it's between 7:00
and 8:00 PM, which

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:27.680
tends to be a pretty popular
and good time for most young

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.190
children to be going to sleep.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:35.120
We want to back that
last feeding up,

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.690
meaning let's do
it earlier in time,

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.750
let's make sure it's
in a well-lit room.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.960
Again, not a sleepy, dark room
that's going to make the child

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.790
want to fall asleep.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:52.850
And also think about it,
15 months, is that bottle

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:53.960
necessary?

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.830
Is it something that has been a
problem for the child in terms

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.720
of gaining weight?

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.360
Is it the pediatrician
should be guiding

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.070
about having maybe a cup
or a straw cup with dinner

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.350
or slightly after dinner not in
that sleepy dark state, which

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.065
is going to make the
baby want to fall asleep?

00:23:12.065 --> 00:23:13.190
HENRY WEI: All right, cool.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.030
Let's takes some
audience questions.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.820
We'll go to right over here.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.090
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Yes.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.510
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.740
Thank you so much for your talk.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.560
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: My pleasure.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.268
AUDIENCE: It is actually
somewhat related

00:23:21.268 --> 00:23:23.030
to the question from the Dory.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.060
I have an 11-month-old
right now who

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.830
for from six to eight months, we
had a very, very solid bedtime

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.340
routine.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.540
Always put him down awake.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:40.790
But then teething came, and
he was sick for two months.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.470
And so there was a lot
of exceptions made.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:49.070
And now we're at a point where
basically every night, we

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:54.530
do dinner, bath
time, bottle, bed,

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.890
and he falls asleep
on the bottle.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.160
And he actually does wake
up a little bit right

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.907
as we're putting
him into the crib,

00:24:02.907 --> 00:24:03.990
and then he goes to sleep.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:08.480
But he's sleeping 11 and
1/2 to 12 hours a night.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:14.810
And so we're like, it's
all working, so don't--

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.350
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.880
But we're a little concerned
that that association

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.570
has crept back in.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.790
And so any thoughts?

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.500
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
Well, what time

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.240
does he wake up in the morning?

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.729
AUDIENCE: Between 6:30 and 7:00.

00:24:30.729 --> 00:24:32.270
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
And how are naps?

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.290
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.705
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:35.705 --> 00:24:36.705
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: So--

00:24:36.705 --> 00:24:37.670
[LAUGHS] right.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.450
So if it's not
broke, don't fix it.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.282
What I will say is it
is working right now,

00:24:42.282 --> 00:24:43.490
so I wouldn't worry about it.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:48.560
If you find that something
starts going wrong--

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.930
night wakings or
protesting nap time--

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:58.021
again, have that last
bottle in a well-lit sort

00:24:58.021 --> 00:24:59.436
of public space, right?

00:24:59.436 --> 00:25:01.060
The kitchen, the
living room, someplace

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.930
that's not going to make
him want to fall asleep.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:10.900
Because on a scale of 1 to
10, 1 is awake, 10 is asleep.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.750
You want to put your child
in the crib at a 5 or a 6,

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:22.450
not an 8 or 9 because
that's really remembering.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:27.040
If you're at 8 or 9,
maybe kind of not really.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.830
And then all of a
sudden, 2:00 AM comes.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.840
Well, I don't really
remember how I got here.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.160
So we really want to make sure
that they have that experience

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.727
and that memory.

00:25:37.727 --> 00:25:38.560
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.130
Thank you.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.690
HENRY WEI: Thanks
for your question.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.390
Another question in this dark,
quiet, and comfortable room.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:43.660
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Yes.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.200
HENRY WEI: Over here.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.937
AUDIENCE: I want the
other guy's problem.

00:25:45.937 --> 00:25:48.620
[LAUGHS]

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.550
AUDIENCE: So my son's
actually almost five,

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:56.280
and he started sleeping really
quite well around eight months.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.880
But around a year or
so ago, he started

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.070
waking up in the night around--

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:06.180
I don't know--
between two and four.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:10.860
And then we have a baby monitor
in the room, so he cries,

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:11.940
and I come up.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:16.950
And usually he goes back
to sleep pretty quickly.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.350
And I've started trying,
you know, what's the matter?

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.580
Are you having a nightmare?

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:25.320
[MUMBLES] And it's always,
I don't know, and you know.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.320
It's OK, you don't have to be--

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.605
and I can't-- he just keeps
waking up in the night,

00:26:31.605 --> 00:26:34.781
and I can't kind of connect with
him to figure out what's going

00:26:34.781 --> 00:26:35.280
on.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.307
And I don't know whether
it's he can't express it or--

00:26:38.307 --> 00:26:39.390
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Right.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.604
AUDIENCE: --what.

00:26:40.604 --> 00:26:43.020
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Does he
have any history of ear, nose,

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.950
and throat difficulties
like tubes in the ears,

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.050
lots of ear infections,
sinus stuff?

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.600
Or is there any
family history of it?

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.680
AUDIENCE: He had reactive airway
disorder when he was young,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.359
but it's not nearly as bad,
and it doesn't really seem--

00:26:59.359 --> 00:27:00.650
tends to only be in the winter.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.117
And this problem doesn't
correlate with the season.

00:27:03.117 --> 00:27:04.200
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Right.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.230
AUDIENCE: I'm a
horrible sleeper.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:07.305
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: OK.

00:27:07.305 --> 00:27:14.550
And is that because of any ear,
nose, or throat stuff yourself?

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.693
AUDIENCE: No, I think I'm
psychologically damaged

00:27:16.693 --> 00:27:17.234
or something.

00:27:17.234 --> 00:27:18.692
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:18.692 --> 00:27:19.650
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: OK.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.390
So you know-- and, oh.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.950
And lastly, so four years old.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.505
Is he dry at night?

00:27:24.505 --> 00:27:25.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.338
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: OK.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.684
And what time is bedtime?

00:27:31.684 --> 00:27:35.525
AUDIENCE: 8:30 to 9:00
usually, sometimes 9:30.

00:27:35.525 --> 00:27:36.900
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
And what time

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.300
does he get up in the morning?

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.984
AUDIENCE: 7:00.

00:27:40.984 --> 00:27:42.900
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: The
first thing I would do

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.690
is move bedtime.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.510
Lights out 8:00, 8:30
latest because we still

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:52.680
have to anticipate for enough
time for him to fall asleep.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.860
That extra sort of half an hour,
45 minutes that he's taking

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.390
may just be a little
too late for him.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.020
Kids at that age have
really busy lives.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.720
Their imaginations
are running rampant.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.160
They've got a lot on their mind.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.460
So I would definitely
give more time

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.070
to get him to fall
asleep earlier.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:22.470
The other thing is I would just
keep an eye on any breathing

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.970
difficulty.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.500
Does he breathe
with his mouth open?

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.750
Does he ever have
any trouble that way?

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:34.250
Because night wakings tend to
be at that hour consistently

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:39.080
inconsistent can be some
type of medical issue, which

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.610
he may outgrow.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.340
Tonsils and adenoids tend
to grow exponentially large

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.810
in children between
the ages of 2 and 5.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:49.560
So that may subside as his
facial structure catches up.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.450
But it may not.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:52.760
So definitely want
to keep an eye

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.045
on that with a pediatrician
or a visit to the ENT.

00:28:56.045 --> 00:28:56.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.330
So because I'm a
bad sleeper, I'm

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.130
also awake when I
hear him wake up.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:02.837
And it sounds like he's afraid.

00:29:02.837 --> 00:29:03.920
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Right.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.170
And so that fear,
I mean, some of it

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:08.130
could be an active imagination.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:14.310
Some of it can be if
your breathing stops

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:19.690
or is interrupted, it's very
scary to wake up to that.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:23.190
So any type of apnea
that may be going on

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:28.827
because he has some type of
obstruction can be very scary.

00:29:28.827 --> 00:29:29.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.410
I hadn't thought of that.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.350
HENRY WEI: Thanks.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.870
Over here.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:33.870
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Yes.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.411
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:35.210
Thanks for coming.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.470
So I have a 3-year-old.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:40.220
And he takes an
afternoon nap most days,

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.020
but some days he
fights it or just

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.790
doesn't want to
sleep or whatever.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:47.270
How do we know when it's time
to give up on the napping?

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:50.870
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: And so
three years and how many months?

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.451
AUDIENCE: Like three months.

00:29:53.451 --> 00:29:54.950
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
So he's probably

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:58.580
in this stage of maybe sort of.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.380
Which means, let's say,
three or four days a week,

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.740
he could still really use a nap.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.340
But then the other days,
he's got enough energy

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.480
to keep going.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.000
So unfortunately, it's not--

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.979
the transition out of a
nap is rarely one week here

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:15.770
and one week there.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:20.120
It tends to progress
over let's just say

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.160
several months, two
to three months.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.030
Where, again, he may need a
nap for a few days in a row

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.710
and be compliant,
and then he's just

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.350
got enough energy not
to for several days.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.800
So I can't say that
there's a day you're going

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.620
to know when he won't need it.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.810
My guess is he's going to show
you by his mood and energy

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.020
level.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.010
When children do
stop napping, bedtime

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.350
tends to get earlier
because, of course,

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:52.050
they're just so tired
by the end of the day.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.840
So you want to
keep that in mind.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.140
And you can always
just enforce rest time.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.820
OK, you don't have to sleep.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.030
Just lay quietly, look
at a book quietly,

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.110
has to be a quiet time.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:07.337
And you can set a timer
for 30 or 45 minutes.

00:31:07.337 --> 00:31:08.420
You can also have a clock.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.600
So one thing I love
for children I'd really

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:18.080
say 15 to 18 months and older,
developmental clocks are great.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.490
There's lots of them out there.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:20.960
There are colors, right?

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.252
Blue is for night,
yellow is for day.

00:31:24.252 --> 00:31:26.210
It's not that your child
is going to tell time.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:29.530
They're going to
understand this is bedtime,

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:30.740
and this is morning time.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:36.890
And even for a nap, you can say
when the stop light says green,

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:38.600
you can come out from rest time.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.563
So that might be
something helpful.

00:31:40.563 --> 00:31:41.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.710
HENRY WEI: Great
question about naps.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.270
Over here.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:43.610
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Yes.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:44.010
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.090
Thanks for coming.

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:48.323
I have kind of a
three part question.

00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:48.823
[LAUGHS]

00:31:48.823 --> 00:31:49.206
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: OK.

00:31:49.206 --> 00:31:50.210
So go for it.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:51.680
AUDIENCE: Different issues.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.950
I have a daughter who will
be two at the end of May

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:58.160
and is still not sleeping
fully through the night.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.830
We took her to an
ENT when she was

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.440
much younger to see if
she had an adenoid issue

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.450
or some other breathing issue.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:09.500
And the feedback from the
doctor was her adenoids

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.160
are a little enlarged, but he
kind of said it's up to you

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.290
if you want to proceed
with the surgery.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:18.460
So my first question
is around how do I--

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.290
or what's a good way to sort of
advocate for her a little bit

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:22.280
more in that field?

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.930
Is it just seeing
more specialists

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:27.860
or going to the pediatrician,
which we didn't see for this?

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.320
My second question is--

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.509
or maybe I could ask that first?

00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:33.550
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Sure.

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:34.130
Yeah.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.790
So one of the hardest things
that I have found as a parent

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.180
myself is that ultimately,
it comes down to you.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.580
And I've been in that
situation both personally

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.610
and professionally where
it becomes your decision

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.550
to do elective surgery.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:53.000
I would always encourage parents
to see a second specialist,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.490
get a second opinion, right?

00:32:55.490 --> 00:33:03.410
And at the end of that, it does
become sort of your decision.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:07.070
My feeling is always if
your child is not sleeping--

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:12.000
which means they are having
trouble growing essentially,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.500
right?

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.710
Because we do grow
when we sleep--

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.020
and they're not breathing
well-- because ultimately,

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.410
things like that really come
down to breathing at some

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.150
level--

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.390
wouldn't you rather
help them out?

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:32.240
Particularly when we're talking
about things that are really

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.180
outpatient surgery, right?

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.154
So I would say definitely
a second opinion,

00:33:37.154 --> 00:33:38.570
and then ultimately,
it comes down

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:42.220
to your gut instinct,
which tends to be right.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.350
Yeah.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.660
AUDIENCE: And the
other two questions

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.490
that I had were
around my daughter

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.710
still needs a bottle in
the middle of the night.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:53.910
She sort of wakes
up, and I've tried

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:57.150
to change that behavior
by giving her a pacifier,

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.440
rubbing her back, et cetera.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:02.070
She'll keep moaning and moaning
until she actually gets milk.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.870
I've tried water in the bottle.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.340
Nothing seems to be working.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.650
Do you have any tips
to break that habit?

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.679
And finally, you mentioned
putting the child

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:11.940
into the crib.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.850
My daughter can climb out
of her crib now, [LAUGHS]

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.454
so I worry about
her safety there.

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:17.954
So those are my two
other questions.

00:34:17.954 --> 00:34:18.389
[LAUGHS]

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.472
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Right.

00:34:19.472 --> 00:34:23.340
So in terms of the bottle
at night, obviously,

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.610
that's just her way of
putting herself back to sleep.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:30.510
Particularly at the age
of almost two years old,

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:35.880
there's no easy way except
saying tonight, no more bottle.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.080
So with children, I'd say,
really after one-year-old,

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.159
we really want to tell
them what we're doing.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.330
Doesn't have to be
a long soliloquy.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:47.429
It should be short information.

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:50.510
Tonight, no more
bottles, to prepare

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.330
her sort of that afternoon
gives her a heads up.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:01.490
And then having sort of several
days of a tough night, right?

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.410
Of tantrums in the
middle of the night,

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.260
but knowing that it will pass.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.240
If magically all the bottles
in the world disappeared,

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.090
she would be OK.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.670
And I would also
want to know related

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:18.680
to her adenoids, breathing,
all that kind of stuff,

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.370
she may be waking because
she's actually thirsty

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:26.310
because she's potentially
breathing through her mouth.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:31.050
So that sort of supports your
case getting a second opinion

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:33.660
and trying to
understand why does she

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.160
wakes so frequently at night.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.980
Some of it may, obviously,
is habit behaviorally,

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.750
but some of it may be
physical sort of dry mouth.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:45.600
And then lastly, in terms of
climbing out of the crib, yes,

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.670
I am all too familiar with this.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.350
One of the reasons
I am here today

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:53.250
is because my older son climbed
out of his crib at 18 months

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.790
after trying for many, many
months and landed on the floor.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:59.670
And I said, OK,
we're done with this.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:02.340
So there are different opinions
out there about when children

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.500
are ready to go from
a crib into a bed,

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.480
and ultimately, we
want them safe, right?

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.970
So a mattress on the
floor or a toddler

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.670
bed that's very low on
the ground is always OK.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.680
But at that point,
we want to make

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.620
sure the room is the
crib safety wise, right?

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.950
So you need to completely
childproof their room.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:26.380
And I always suggest a extra
tall safety gate for the door.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:30.080
We don't want children
locked in their room,

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:36.030
and so a gate provides
communication, but safety.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:41.580
So I would say that would
probably be your best bet.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.080
HENRY WEI: Thanks
for your question.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.000
And a reminder to
folks, Googlers,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.229
you can go second opinion
for a benefits service

00:36:49.229 --> 00:36:50.520
that you have available to you.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.470
Or those watching on YouTube,
if you work for someone else,

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:55.092
you can ask your
employee benefits arm

00:36:55.092 --> 00:36:56.550
if they have that
available to you.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.679
All right, next
question over here.

00:36:58.679 --> 00:36:59.220
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.804
Thanks for coming.

00:37:00.804 --> 00:37:01.720
My wife is so jealous.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.430
She wishes she could be here.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:04.320
[LAUGHS]

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.110
So I'm going to try to channel
her with this question.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:13.140
And it's basically, I have
a 3-year-old, 10 months.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:18.540
And she wakes up often in
the middle of the night.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:22.200
We put her to bed, start
the routine at 7:30.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.120
She sleeps from
about 8:00 to 7:30.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.040
And she'll wake up in
the middle of the night,

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.740
and she'll cry for mama.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.400
And I'm like, it doesn't
bother me because she--

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.440
[LAUGHS] I mean, she doesn't--

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.480
if I try to go in there,
all hell breaks loose.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.520
So my wife goes in
there, and then she's

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.830
able to get her to sleep.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.110
But she's just had
it, and she wants

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:51.930
to just let her cry it out.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:59.250
Is that OK to let a kid
that's 3, almost 4 years

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.099
old cry it out?

00:38:01.099 --> 00:38:02.640
And if so, how should
we approach it?

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.230
How long-- you know?

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.560
And should I be going in there?

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.810
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: So you
always have options, right?

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:13.187
There's no one magical path.

00:38:13.187 --> 00:38:14.895
Otherwise, this would
all be very simple.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:22.230
The cry it out proponents would
say, yes, of course it's fine.

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:28.040
There are different
methods of handling it.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.130
In some ways, I would
encourage you as dad

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.570
to step in because of
course she goes nuts.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.600
There's a full blown tantrum
that's waiting to happen.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.390
But in some ways,
your child will

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:41.280
benefit knowing that
you're both in charge.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.330
And you can both help in
those kinds of situations

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:48.620
when she's stressed
and distressed, right?

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.800
Whether you want to do that or
not is your personal choice.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.720
With a child that's
almost 4 years old,

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.750
I think it really
benefits everybody

00:38:56.750 --> 00:39:01.100
to have them involved
in the process, which

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:06.940
is acknowledging you put
yourself to sleep, right?

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.030
And that's what's missing here.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.170
At bedtime, does she
have an easy time

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:15.490
putting herself to sleep, or
is mom putting her to sleep?

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:19.690
AUDIENCE: We have a
routine where we do books

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:24.920
and we do a song, and
then we put her to bed.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.980
And then we have this
thing called a freebie

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.720
where we close the
door, and then she's

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.040
like, oh, another kiss and hug.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.540
And we go back in.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.840
And that might happen twice.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.830
And then it's over.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:38.730
So we do this little
song and dance,

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:39.855
and then she goes to sleep.

00:39:39.855 --> 00:39:41.646
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
OK, but ultimately, she

00:39:41.646 --> 00:39:43.780
goes into her bed, and
she puts herself to sleep?

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:44.860
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: OK.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.735
AUDIENCE: So she goes
to sleep pretty easily.

00:39:46.735 --> 00:39:47.818
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Right.

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:49.180
Although some of that stalling--

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.460
AUDIENCE: See other stuff--

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:54.080
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
--may be evolving, right?

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.040
So whether you decide--

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.940
whoever decides to get involved
in the middle of the night,

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.530
what's really important
is to sit down

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.810
with her at a neutral time.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:07.590
Not at 7:00 PM on a
Monday night, right?

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:11.070
So let's say a weekend,
11:00 AM or something.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:14.670
And say, honey, you're
not getting healthy sleep.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:18.600
And it's really time for you to
learn how to put yourself back

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.550
to sleep at night.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:26.300
You can also-- and part of
that discussion should be

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.580
acknowledging that putting
yourself to sleep is that

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.920
skill, and every
child in a bed--

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:31.420
right?

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.920
So it's not good or bad--
every child in a bed

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.800
has to put themselves to sleep.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.330
So again, putting the
responsibility and the onus

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.310
on her.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.700
You can make a behavior
chart with her.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.700
Now, she may either
say, never mind.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.377
I don't care.

00:40:47.377 --> 00:40:48.710
I don't to hear this discussion.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.380
Or she may actually be
interested in learning

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.160
what we call sleep manners are.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.690
Sleep manners are just that.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:41:01.910
Manners of cooperating at
bedtime, laying in your bed

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:04.394
quietly, and staying
in your bed all night.

00:41:04.394 --> 00:41:05.810
And for a child
in this situation,

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:09.650
I would also suggest
putting yourself to sleep,

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.480
because that's obviously a goal.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.500
You can do days of the week
with those behaviors, put it up

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.680
in the kitchen, and then you
review it every single morning

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.380
and say, look, last night you
did a great job cooperating

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.460
at bedtime.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.860
You laid quietly in your bed.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:28.810
You called out at
night, so I know

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.160
you had a hard time with that.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.370
But I know you'll
do better tonight.

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:37.900
So it sort of acknowledges that
the responsibility is hers,

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:41.590
and over time you want to build
her up with rewards as she

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:43.570
maintains those behaviors.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.630
And those rewards should always
be an experience, not a thing,

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.790
because she's not going
to care about a toy.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:52.380
Within 24 hours, she's going
to care about stickers--

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:53.672
AUDIENCE: Are stickers a thing?

00:41:53.672 --> 00:41:55.921
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Stickers
are a thing on the chart.

00:41:55.921 --> 00:41:57.850
But what you're trying
to get to, let's say,

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:00.700
after three nights of
all of her manners,

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.470
or five nights of
all of her manners,

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:06.550
is a trip to the Central
Park Zoo with only mommy

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.090
because it's special
mom/daughter time.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.040
We want to reward
with experiences.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.460
So there are definitely going
to be full blown tantrums

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.800
for several nights in a row,
particularly a child that's

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.210
almost 4.

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:21.640
But if either mom
or you can stay

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.940
consistent with that in
saying, I'm saying here,

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:31.210
you lay in bed, you put yourself
to sleep, and sort of maintain

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:34.930
that firm boundary, she should
start getting better about it.

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:37.780
And you may also want
to get that clock

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.760
like I mentioned before.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.590
The clock is still
blue for night.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.370
It's nighttime.

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:43.570
It's not time to talk.

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:47.090
It's not time to hang out.

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:48.970
And when the clock
says it's morning,

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:53.410
then we can go spend time
in the kitchen or whatever.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:56.080
So having that firm boundary
at night is really important.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.780
But giving her the information
ahead of time I think

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.760
is key, because she's
completely cognizant and aware.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.230
So that's why I would say cry
it out will probably work.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:10.260
But I think it's more
respectful to give

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:14.560
her information about how
the rules are changing.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.960
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.650
HENRY WEI: So it sounds
like OK hours for sleep.

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:19.645
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:19.645 --> 00:43:20.790
This is a Google joke.

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:23.017
So we have a lot more questions.

00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:24.850
Let's see if we can get
through all of them.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:25.640
Next one over here.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.200
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Yes.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.220
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.094
This is very timely for
me because I actually

00:43:29.094 --> 00:43:32.240
have a 3-year-old
and a 6-month-old,

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.800
so I have a two part question.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.290
The first is what
are your thoughts

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.790
on co-sleeping within a room?

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:40.500
So not in the bed, but
the crib in the bedroom?

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.980
Our 6-year-old basically needs
to have a presence there.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.600
Otherwise, she
doesn't go to sleep,

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.810
and we have to sit in
a dark room with her.

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:49.892
What are your thoughts?

00:43:49.892 --> 00:43:51.600
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
So 6-year or 6-month?

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.480
AUDIENCE: 6-month-old.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:52.970
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: 6-month.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:55.080
OK, so the American
Academy of Pediatrics

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.450
will recommend room sharing--

00:43:57.450 --> 00:43:58.980
which is what you're
talking about--

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.820
for the first 12 months.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:01.320
OK?

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:01.800
And that's--

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.360
AUDIENCE: She senses
the presence of somebody

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:03.750
in the room.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:06.060
And if there's nobody in
there with her, she wakes up

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.129
and we have to get
her settled again.

00:44:08.129 --> 00:44:10.170
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: And
you know, 6-months, she's

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:11.160
still fairly young.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.420
So I wouldn't worry
about it too much.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.450
Room sharing works
for many people.

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:19.800
It doesn't work for everyone.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.790
Some parents find that
it disturbs their sleep

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:26.580
because they hear every little
thing that the baby does,

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.760
which doesn't necessarily
need attending to.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.540
And also some parents find
that the baby will sleep better

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.890
in a different room.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:37.290
So I think it's very personal.

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:40.470
But if you're comfortable
with it and you sleep well

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.500
and the baby's
doing well, then I

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.150
wouldn't worry about
transitioning it

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.035
until you feel ready.

00:44:47.035 --> 00:44:48.660
AUDIENCE: Well, the
second part of that

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:53.310
is the 3-year-old, he grew up
in a small, New York apartment,

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:56.970
and there was always
somebody in the apartment

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.980
in the room with him.

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.570
Now he needs a door open.

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:03.297
And we put a gate
up, and we've tried

00:45:03.297 --> 00:45:04.380
closing the door at night.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:08.310
But basically, if he
realizes the door is shut,

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:09.210
there's hell to pay.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:09.510
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Right.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:11.551
AUDIENCE: So how do you
address that for somebody

00:45:11.551 --> 00:45:15.669
that's kind of pretty far along
in their behavior and habits?

00:45:15.669 --> 00:45:17.460
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: I
would say if it's not

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.200
disrupting his sleep to
have the door cracked,

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.590
let him have it, right?

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:29.180
Because that's obviously a
psychological/control issue.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:33.680
I want to know that I
can leave and be OK,

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.780
and that I am not
completely separate.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.060
And that's OK.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.370
And I am OK with that
as long as there's not

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:43.350
light flooding in and
disturbing his sleep.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:43.850
You know?

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:46.450
I would let it go.

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:48.290
AUDIENCE: We make sure
that the door's open,

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:50.432
and if the door is closed--

00:45:50.432 --> 00:45:51.890
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
It's a problem.

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:52.265
AUDIENCE: It's a problem.

00:45:52.265 --> 00:45:53.348
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Right.

00:45:53.348 --> 00:45:55.820
So I would-- that's a
battle I wouldn't fight.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.900
[LAUGHS] There are
too many others

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.170
that you probably need to.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:02.710
HENRY WEI: It's a door's
always open policy over there.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:03.410
Thank you.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:04.366
Over here.

00:46:04.366 --> 00:46:05.990
AUDIENCE: So I actually
have a newborn.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:09.660
She's just 3 weeks, and
obviously, she isn't sleeping.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.980
So my question is what is the
right age to sort of start

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.340
all of these habits and--

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.200
so right now, she just
falls asleep in our arms.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.750
And we think that's fine
because we don't need sleep.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:24.560
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
[LAUGHS] Of course not.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.685
AUDIENCE: And as soon as
you place her in the crib,

00:46:26.685 --> 00:46:27.760
she's up.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.020
So it's the whole
shock factor I think.

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.860
But we're fine because
she's just 3 weeks old,

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.774
and our pediatrician says
she'll grow out of this.

00:46:35.774 --> 00:46:37.940
But we don't know when to
start these kind of habits

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.330
like when should we start
having a routine at bedtime?

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:43.517
When should we start basically
following all of this advice?

00:46:43.517 --> 00:46:44.600
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Right.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.760
So I would say--

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.430
I have a question, of course.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.150
You see I have a
lot of questions.

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:54.817
Does she dislike being flat
every time you put her down?

00:46:54.817 --> 00:46:55.400
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.120
So she's just 3 weeks, but
she goes on her side on her

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:03.780
on every time we
place her on the crib.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.792
Or even with us, she'll
always try to be on the side.

00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:09.500
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
So being on your side

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.200
tends to be where the
contents of your stomach

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.260
are the furthest away
from your throat.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:18.270
So that's usually very
comfortable for babies.

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:19.950
They're not used to being flat.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.260
They're not flat in
utero, and the idea

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.540
that the first three
months of a baby's life

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.810
is sort of the fourth
trimester, they're

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.090
adjusting to being
out of the room.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:31.600
So that's very common.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.830
I would say that after
the first six weeks

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:39.930
or so, we really want to see
a gentle schedule developing

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:42.270
where the clock
is not a dictator,

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:44.140
but the clock is a guide.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:47.680
Gee, I see you've been
awake for almost two hours.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.960
You must be very tired.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.230
I'm going to get ready to put
you down for sleep, right?

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:54.900
Whether that's during
the day or at night.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.230
So at about 6 to
8 weeks, I think

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:02.790
that it's a great time
to have a good gentle

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:08.580
routine for the evening and
bedtime and just start shaping

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.310
things, looking at
the clock, trying

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:13.360
to follow a gentle schedule.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.110
So right now, she
doesn't have the energy

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:20.040
to stay awake through a feeding
and all the other things that

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.290
go on, and that's
typically that's completely

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:24.370
typical and normal.

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:27.000
I do encourage
parents to just get

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.580
the baby used to wherever
they're going to sleep.

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.550
Bassinet, crib.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:37.740
Again, putting them down
three to five minutes so

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:40.230
that they look around,
they experience the place.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:44.800
It's OK, I'm fine, I can be
in here, it's not stressful.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.450
I don't just wake
up in this place,

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:47.950
and I don't remember
how I got here.

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.580
So if you can do that once
or twice a day, great.

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:53.940
And then at 6 to 8
weeks, can she gradually

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.930
start falling asleep in
the crib or bassinet?

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:59.850
Can you put her down
and see if she'll fall

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:01.470
asleep there one time a day?

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:02.490
Just once.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.250
If not, if there's a lot of
crying, pick her up, move on,

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.240
don't worry about it.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:12.300
So at this point, just getting
her use to a gentle schedule

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.260
is great.

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.410
And if you can do
that by 6 to 8 weeks,

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:18.697
you're in a very good place.

00:49:18.697 --> 00:49:19.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:20.238
HENRY WEI: Great.

00:49:20.238 --> 00:49:21.820
Let's go for just two more.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.450
And then I'll remind folks that
goodnightssleepcoaching.com

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:26.670
is Christina Gantcher's site.

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:27.170
Over here.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:28.169
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Yes.

00:49:28.169 --> 00:49:29.740
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.989
We're new parents in the room.

00:49:30.989 --> 00:49:33.570
We did extinction at 4 months,
and it worked really well

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:34.070
for us.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.160
Within five days, he
slept through the night.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.460
He's 5 months now, so
it was a month ago.

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.230
So no major sleep problems yet.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.130
But we travel every
weekend in the summer.

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:44.890
It's a four hour drive.

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:47.470
And I'm pretty scared to
start doing that with him.

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.840
He's already done the
drive when he was younger,

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.880
but it was before we
were really on a schedule

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.570
and doing a bedtime routine.

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:57.280
So my plan for now is to start
his routine in the apartment,

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.870
give him his bottle,
read his book,

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:01.330
put him in his pajamas,
his nighttime diaper,

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:04.240
put him in the car at 7:00 when
we normally put him to sleep,

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.770
and have him fall
asleep in the car,

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:07.690
and then move him to a crib.

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:09.820
It's worked once already.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.052
But do you suggest
that I wake him up

00:50:12.052 --> 00:50:13.510
when we try to move
him to the crib

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.950
so that he remembers I'm
not in the car anymore.

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:16.960
I'm in a crib.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.950
Or if he's sleeping, put him in
the crib and just let him be?

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:25.880
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: I would just
transfer as gently as you can.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:30.820
Because behaviorally,
it's not as

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:35.079
if you need him to remember
that you're transferring him.

00:50:35.079 --> 00:50:37.120
You're not going to start
the whole routine again

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:41.260
at whatever time you arrive,
so it sort of doesn't matter.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.920
And fingers crossed that he
handles that transfer easily

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.800
and moves on, and that's OK.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.250
And at this age, he's 5
months, so 6, 7, 8 months,

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:55.341
it may work fairly well for him.

00:50:55.341 --> 00:50:55.840
You know?

00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:00.070
I think it's toughest when we
try to do that at around a year

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:03.700
or so because most babies tend
to be very cognizant of what's

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:07.270
going on, and they won't
always transfer easily anymore.

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:10.940
So fingers crossed that
it could work well.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:11.836
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:51:11.836 --> 00:51:13.210
And then a quick
second question.

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:15.460
It hasn't happened yet, but
I'm terrified for teething

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.410
because he's such a
good sleeper already.

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:21.400
Any general tips for night
wakings as it impacts teething?

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.650
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: So
teething is one of these things

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:26.140
that you expect a tooth,
and four months later, it

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.140
comes out, right?

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.970
[LAUGHS] It can last months.

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:33.550
And also, we want to recognize
that teething happens all day.

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:35.946
It doesn't just happen at
1:00 in the morning, right?

00:51:35.946 --> 00:51:38.070
So if your child is waking
up and you think, oh, it

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:40.900
must be teething, you're seeing
signs all day long, right?

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.170
It's not just in the
middle of the night.

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:46.810
There's really only
two things I suggest.

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:48.250
Number one, ask
your pediatrician

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:50.214
what to give your
child before bedtime

00:51:50.214 --> 00:51:52.630
and potentially have it ready
for the middle of the night,

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:54.070
right?

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.530
And be consistent
with your behavior.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:00.580
It doesn't mean that you get
to backslide and do anything

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:04.570
differently, because getting
into some other behavioral

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:06.890
habit is not going
to help the teething.

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.710
AUDIENCE: So you're
a fan of extinction,

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:11.604
for example, where we didn't go
in at all when he was crying.

00:52:11.604 --> 00:52:13.270
And he cries in the
middle of the night,

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:16.190
and we suspected-- we've checked
his temperature, he's not sick.

00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:17.481
He doesn't have a dirty diaper.

00:52:17.481 --> 00:52:19.070
We suspect it might be teething.

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:21.917
Do you just then let him cry,
or give him something to soothe?

00:52:21.917 --> 00:52:23.000
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Right.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.390
I would-- whatever your
pediatrician suggests

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:27.820
between Motrin, Advil, Tylenol.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.000
I would definitely
give that, and then--

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:31.749
out of the room.

00:52:31.749 --> 00:52:32.290
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:32.590
Thank you.

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:33.490
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Yeah, sure.

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:35.410
HENRY WEI: OK, one last
question over here.

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:35.560
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Yes.

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.268
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:52:36.268 --> 00:52:39.730
I have a 22-month-old daughter
who sleeps through the night,

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:44.170
but she sleeps through the night
in our bed, which is definitely

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:44.990
not what I want.

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:48.520
My wife seems
ambivalent towards it.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:52.154
But we have another baby
coming in September.

00:52:52.154 --> 00:52:53.070
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: OK

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:56.800
AUDIENCE: So what's the
best way to transfer

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.122
her back to her crib?

00:52:58.122 --> 00:52:59.830
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
OK, so she has a crib

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:01.210
in her own room or your room?

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:02.110
AUDIENCE: In her own room.

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:03.068
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: OK.

00:53:03.068 --> 00:53:05.860
AUDIENCE: Which we've started
trying to put her in for naps,

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:07.210
and that works most of the time.

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:10.690
So she'll nap in her crib, but
at night time, it's a pattern.

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:13.510
So she'll go with her mom,
and she takes a long time

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:14.240
to fall asleep.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.670
So like half hour to
an hour most nights

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:20.650
of singing or just whatever.

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:22.570
My wife will go to
bed with her and get

00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:24.680
her to sleep before she
goes asleep in the bed.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.763
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: Right.

00:53:25.763 --> 00:53:27.280
And what time is that time?

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.050
AUDIENCE: She varies.

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:31.410
And she likes to go
to bed late, so--

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:31.910
well--

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:32.770
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: What time?

00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:33.580
AUDIENCE: But it
doesn't matter what time

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.680
we put her to bed, that
half hour to an hour rule

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.760
kind of holds.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:40.247
She's just active no
matter what happens, and--

00:53:40.247 --> 00:53:42.580
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: So were
you talking about late being

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.800
like 8:30, 9:00, or like 11:00?

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:45.610
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:46.150
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: OK.

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.941
AUDIENCE: 9:00-ish.

00:53:46.941 --> 00:53:48.700
8:00 to 9:00 is usual time.

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.658
CHRISTINA GANTCHER: OK.

00:53:49.658 --> 00:53:52.060
So I would say it's
great that you have her

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.980
in the crib during the day.

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:55.270
Keep doing that for sure.

00:53:57.850 --> 00:53:59.650
I would probably just
pick a time that's

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:01.330
really convenient
for both of you

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:04.040
and say, OK, starting
this Friday night,

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.390
she's falling to sleep.

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:08.230
She's falling asleep
at bedtime in her crib.

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:11.420
It's going to be tantrums
for several nights.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:17.470
If you think-- if you and your
wife decide that you can do it,

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:19.780
it will probably be
easier for your daughter

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:21.740
to do that separation.

00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:25.270
You can stay with her
and say, I'm here.

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:26.210
You're in your crib.

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:27.610
I'm here until you fall asleep.

00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:29.151
AUDIENCE: All right,
so moving-- yes.

00:54:29.151 --> 00:54:31.344
So the extinction is
probably bad for her

00:54:31.344 --> 00:54:33.010
because of the
attachment kind of thing.

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:35.030
So it would be better to do
one of the other methods?

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:36.446
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
Yes, I totally

00:54:36.446 --> 00:54:39.130
agree because she's really used
to having a physical presence,

00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:39.630
right?

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:42.290
So let's say you stay with her
for several nights in a row.

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:44.665
Then you gradually start moving
yourself out of the room,

00:54:44.665 --> 00:54:46.990
so you're by the doorway
or in the hallway.

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:49.450
And you're sort of coaching
her, but not doing it

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:50.350
for her anymore.

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:51.785
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:51.785 --> 00:54:52.660
HENRY WEI: All right.

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:53.976
Well, thank you, everyone.

00:54:53.976 --> 00:54:54.850
Thank you for coming.

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:57.490
Thank you to the Talks at
Google team and the event team.

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.437
And thank you Christina
Gantcher so much--

00:54:59.437 --> 00:55:01.270
CHRISTINA GANTCHER:
Thank you for having me.

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:03.394
HENRY WEI: --for coming
and sharing your expertise.

00:55:03.394 --> 00:55:04.480
And sweet dreams everyone.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.830
