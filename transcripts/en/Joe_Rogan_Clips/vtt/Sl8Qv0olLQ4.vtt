1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.800
The Joe Rogan experience do look and man,
man,
I think it's a weapon now.

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.360
You know a global car right here.

3
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:10.170
If I throw a hook from my right here right now suck,
right?
It's all calcified,

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:14.630
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
um,
where are you at right now in terms of like,

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.840
when does the UFC usually come to you with a,
an idea of what,

6
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:21.240
who are you gonna fight next time?
Obviously you beat Latifa.
He was top five.

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.350
Yeah.
So you're three and five.
What do they,

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.930
what do they got you ranked now eighth or ninth.
How's that work?
Do you tell?

9
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:32.220
How the fuck am I asking him?
How does,
how does Koreans are not in the top five?

10
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:35.610
I beat the number three and the five.
When I was three,
they put me at six.

11
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.593
I don't know,

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.890
they put me at six like I'll beat Glover and I went to six.

13
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.120
By the time I fought,
I was 10 that night in Cali.
I was ranked 10 thing.
And how,

14
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.050
how's that happen?
Then I'd be the leader who was six and I went,

15
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.970
or fifth or fourth one.
He was,

16
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.790
I went to six and then a week later I was at seven.

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.980
The next day he came out of the eight like,
which is like this.

18
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.090
This makes no sense and that's why there's no fights.
Yeah,

19
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.000
they don't even care what you clearly top 10 you know,
whatever number that is.

20
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:10.950
I mean it's a,
you got a murderer's row,
people in that division,
you know,
so they,

21
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.641
when,

22
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:14.900
when do you think they'll come to you with an offer from the was they wanted me

23
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:18.200
to fight Gus at a time.
Like I said,
after found the microphone.

24
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.170
I don't want to fight anything else until my babies here.

25
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.700
When the baby's here and everything's checked out,

26
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:25.850
I don't have to be in camp is stress this and this.
Once that's all done,

27
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:26.684
we can talk.

28
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.920
And they called me a couple weeks later about Gus because he tweeted me and had

29
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:33.850
them ask me area and I said the same thing.
Like I'm waiting til my baby's Jen.

30
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.540
That was March 15th the due date of my baby was March 12th but it's too close.

31
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:40.760
Not risking it,
you know?
Then it's like,
all right,

32
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:42.560
what about June 1st and I was just saying,
let me,

33
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.120
can I finish with my baby and stuff?

34
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:45.800
I'm not really even training my home with my wife.

35
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.930
I'm doing a little bit here and there,
but I'm worried about her now.

36
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.500
She's been with me ride down his whole time.
That was my time to focus on her,

37
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.610
what she needed.
She didn't want me to wait,
so I'm here and they kept calling.

38
00:01:55.611 --> 00:02:00.160
I kept calling.
I just kept saying,
no,
no,
no.
And they kept asking me and I'm like,

39
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.350
hi.
And Allie,
it was like,
I mean,

40
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.560
what if we get more money if they give him my wife's like,

41
00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:06.710
if we can get more or take it back.
If they give you more,
I'll let you go.

42
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.410
But yeah,
we can start camp or whatever because I had to give him more.

43
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.500
We do it and they say,
oh no,
you're not doing nothing.
I wouldn't wait,

44
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.913
let me finish this.

45
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.580
Literally my baby came out and I felt that,
I asked the doctors everything fine.

46
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:22.190
They did the test,
everything came back could like,
there's no problems.

47
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:23.960
And he had to go to the doctors.
Nothing.
She's like,
you're fine.

48
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:27.920
You got a healthy baby boy.
Congratulations.
Literally pick my phone up.

49
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.130
Tweeted Gus.
Gus,
you still want to go June 1st you want to do it?

50
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.500
I'm your huckleberry.
Let's go London.
I'll come.
Yes.
Court.

51
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.270
You know I wanted to fight.
Let's do it.
Ali called me.
It's on.

52
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:42.650
His managers called me.
We want to fight.
Let's do it.
June 1st same,
same pay.

53
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.360
No race on nothing.
Whatever I was getting,
let's go.
Takes Dana.
They literally,

54
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:50.130
they called me the day before on my way to the hospital.
I get a cough,
my lead,

55
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:51.930
they want to,
if you want to fight,
Bro,
I'm going away.

56
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.400
I call you after we figure it out.
I say yes.
Less than 24 hours later.

57
00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:56.720
They say no.
We gave him to Anthony Smith.

58
00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:00.580
Now the fuck y'all call me for yesterday,
harassing me all his camp.

59
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:04.690
Now I say yes and you're taking it away like why y'all?
What's going on and that.

60
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.320
That made me mad.
Then they call me for Luke Rockhold like I'm not,
no,

61
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.400
not taking a step back.
Like I want you to be here for the title.
I'll be Luke.

62
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.030
What are going to say?
Cause I guess if they told Ali,

63
00:03:14.031 --> 00:03:15.820
if I beat Glover since he was gonna fight a leader,

64
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.440
that premium contingent for title fight,

65
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.700
they gave me a new contract and everything with all that in it signed it.

66
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:21.210
Then as I go,

67
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.210
he need one more fight and there's a guy make him an a fight and Ali's and no,

68
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:26.260
cause he managed both of those.

69
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.530
Don't you think that Luke Rockhold is a good fight for you?

70
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.950
But it wouldn't do not find it,

71
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.910
but it would definitely elevate you in the public side,

72
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.530
the guy you don't think it would help you
rank is what?
No,

73
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.510
you would think Galit or the chief would have helped me in the rankings and go

74
00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:44.560
over,
I don't buy that because I think they'd like rankings.

75
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.090
Like even if it's not one,

76
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.690
one through ten eight any one of those guys could fight for the title if they

77
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:54.640
get look,
Tiago like Tiago Santos.
Right.
I mean you lost David Branch,

78
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:58.700
what a year ago.
Right at a middle.
Same that I beat up Pat Cummings.
Yeah.

79
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.260
With 20th or April 13th or 18th,
whatever.
Now he's fighting for the title.

80
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.990
I mean it was a quick ascension from,
you know,

81
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.980
devastating knockouts and fighting like a wild maniac like he does and he's a

82
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:12.520
wild fighter to watch.
Very,
very entertaining guy and that's all it took.

83
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.370
But who was in that?
He didn't have to be the big name guy.

84
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.690
That's thing he be young.
Black.

85
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:21.330
What you I killed on my fourth fight in UFC beat Jimmy the chimney.
Manoa.
Um,

86
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.060
stopped him there.
Anders and the other guy,
we're both 85 hours.
She didn't,

87
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.330
so he had two fights is because he had knockoff that thing.
Like I said,

88
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.030
I told him,
I was like,
Bro,
it's a good fight.
He's the same thing you said.

89
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.010
It's a good fight.
Like Ali,
let's look at who I fought.

90
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.530
I'll beat Glover who was third.
They still didn't put me in top flight.

91
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.050
I'll be a little TV.
What he says next to beat the champ,
whatever.

92
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.300
When I beat him,
they still don't give me the credibility.
It's like,

93
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:43.120
oh he's washed up now and I as I pop her Twitter I like,

94
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:46.300
I apologize to anybody I'd beat because once you lose to me it's Kinda like

95
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:49.030
you're a nobody.
I'm like I'm sorry for that time.

96
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:52.420
All their posts a thing of the day saying oh these guys all feel they get six

97
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:54.280
months.
I fell for the same thing I get two years.

98
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.030
I said I'm sorry times cause you lost to me.
I think that says

99
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.550
you get the short end of the stick.
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.600
It's just though the same thing is half of that asshole coach when you're in

101
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:09.250
college is it is in the same way and that's why your motivation back to tweets

102
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:12.160
and shit cause in my head things like that that I've been through,

103
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.250
you know I should learn but now it doesn't matter.
But in my mind,

104
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.560
I've voiced my opinion set coach and when I proved her wrong,

105
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.920
I ran into his assistant coach later on in life and he said he's,

106
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.080
he doesn't really like you anymore cause the guy actually I fall in the ultimate

107
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:25.900
fighter was his best friend,
Kelly and us,
one of his all Americans.

108
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.080
He used to call him back when I was in college trying to discipline me if I like

109
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.380
do some shit to piss him off,
he would have Kelly come in and try to beat me up.

110
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.010
Never happened.
Like I've,
he couldn't beat me up like that.

111
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.300
He used to get pissed at that.

112
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.630
So the fact that he thought he had like a hold on me with this transcript and I

113
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:44.230
got out and then I ended up fighting Kelly on the show and he said that two and

114
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:45.640
pregnant talking,
he'd kill you in MMA,

115
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.920
he could kill you and MMA when the opportunity came and I beat him and that

116
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:51.850
somebody telling me like he wasn't happy about that.

117
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.880
He didn't like the fact that you beat Kelly.
Like,
I'm sorry,

118
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.440
I don't do things that,

119
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.770
this thing where you don't feel like you get in the respect that you deserve.

120
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.120
It does motivate you though.

121
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:05.420
It does give you like a little bit of extra juice in the gym.
I mean,

122
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.390
I'm a motivated guy anyway.
Highly motivated.
I wake up,
my open my eyes,

123
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.300
it sounds to get to work.
So you son's born the Anthony Smith common.
He had a,

124
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:17.060
you know,
Anthony Smith survived against Jon Jones and you know,

125
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.300
especially early on he looked good,
you know,
showed good technique,

126
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.370
showed that he's,
he's really a world class fighter.

127
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.260
And I think that they just think that that would be,

128
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:27.230
he probably said yes when you said no,
and they gave it to them,
you know,

129
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:29.000
while you were waiting and your son was being born.

130
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.680
So now you're just waiting for another call.
But the thing is like,

131
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.810
go back to that real fast.
Say he say yes and he said,
no,

132
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.930
I watched this interview.
Excuse me,
what area?
Hawaii.

133
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.570
And they said the day after he followed Jon Jones,

134
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:44.740
they caught him about Anthony Summit or about,
uh,
Gus.
Right.

135
00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:46.640
So that was why I'm saying,
I know I was calling me.

136
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.790
So it's Kinda like they were just throwing it out there and Holly said,
uh,

137
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.420
I guess they offered it to Johnnie Walker.
Johnnie Walker's manager made a post.

I seen it offered us Gus,

139
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:57.380
like they were just throwing out there for whoever's gonna be the first person

140
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:59.900
to say yes.
Well,
they probably have a bunch of people say yes.

141
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:03.770
And then they sit down and they go over it.
Like,
what looks best for us?
Like,

142
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:04.490
what do we have.
