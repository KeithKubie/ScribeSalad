00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.660
- [Man] How have President
Reagan's policies affected

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.780
the government since he left office?

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.590
- What Ronald Reagan did was
set up a titanic debate really

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.130
between those who believed
in the new deal view

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.550
of government which was that
it was there to help those

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.550
who could not help themselves
and manage an enormous economy

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.330
and the enormous life of
the world's only superpower

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.130
or at least one of the two
superpowers and what that,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.420
on the new deal style, that
was what government should do.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.300
On the Reagan side, he said
get government out of the way

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.820
and let American free enterprise
and individual initiative

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.050
create greatness in America again

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.640
and so that was just setting
up that idealogic conversation

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.900
now continued all the way
through New Gingrich's revolution

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.960
in 1994 and his clashes with Bill Clinton.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.930
They were over the same kinds
of things that Ronald Reagan

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.080
had brought into the debate
when he was elected in 1980.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.880
Now the challenge was that
Reagan's defense spending

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.870
and his tax cuts ballooned the deficit

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.080
and what that ended up,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.230
what ended up happening is that the thing

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.610
he had come to Washington to try to solve,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.400
which was the budget deficit
had actually gotten bigger,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.970
and so Reagan, who came to
town as a tax cutter ended up

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.180
ultimately having to raise taxes

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.240
to solve some of those problems
of having a large deficit

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.440
and why is that bad?

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.440
Because deficits lead to
inflation and inflation

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.490
is what was strangling America
when Reagan came into office.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.280
Inflation was very high
and unemployment was high

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.601
and so, his solution to
it while it kicked off

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:39.160
a strong economic recovery also
ballooned the deficit which

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.453
is a problem that is still
one they wrestle with today.
