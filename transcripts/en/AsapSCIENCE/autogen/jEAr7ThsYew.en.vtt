00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.480
 With an estimated 2 million narcotics smuggled into the United States each day, and â…“ students 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.950
 Universities like Stanford say they have tried it, MDMA or "Molly" has become 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.159
 The most popular drug. But what exactly is it? How does it affect your body? 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:22.159
 Scientifically known as 3,4-methylene-deoxy-methylamine "ecstasy", is usually taken in the form of pills and hypothetical 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.050
 To be composed of a pure chemical. Ecstasy on the other hand, is an MDMA 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.890
 It has been chemically modified with the addition of other substances such as amphetamine and caffeine. 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.730
 In its pure form MDMA affects neurotransmitters in the brain. Neurons are chemicals 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.180
 In your body that transmits messages, while also controlling other things such as reflexes, and emotions 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.910
 And memory. In particular, the neurotransmitter labeled serotonin controls appetite, sleep 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.899
 Memory and learning in this mood. When there is something really great happening in your life 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.080
 For example, when you fall in love, there is an increase in the secretion of serotonin from the neurons 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.300
 Which eventually stimulates your body and makes you feel happy. And it happens 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.620
 Also when you take adequate amounts of MDMA, these same cells are stimulated to excrete 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.800
 Massive amounts of serotonin, along with other neurotransmitters such as dopamine 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.830
 Noraphenfarin leads to the release of more electrochemicals in the brain. This change creates 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.050
 Intense experience of happiness, social feeling, increased empathy and inability to sleep, 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.750
 Making it one of the most popular drugs used in concerts 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.500
 These feelings usually last about 3-8 hours, when the brain cells are normal 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.060
 To absorb serotonin, and chemically destroy it, but because MDMA excretes a lot of 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.740
 Serotonin, also destroys the body more than usual. This means when your brain works 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.409
 Due to its nature, there are fewer serotonin available to bind to your receptors 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.010
 Which make you feel comfortable with normal events. This can also lead to vertigo 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.990
 In addition to side effects such as negative mood, depression, irritability and feeling 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.710
 Very tired 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.130
 Regardless of the adverse effects, studies have shown that MDMA can be used as a potential treatment for PTSD 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.590
 And anxiety. Patients with PTSD "post-traumatic disorder" generally have a lack of brain connections 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.409
 Between the amygdala and the hippocampus (two regions of the brain), but the analysis of MRI showed that MDMA was actually active 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.250
 Increases communication in these areas. However, this treatment is still somewhat controversial 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.760
 Studies on mice and monkeys have shown that even small amounts of MDMA are not only destroyed 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.900
 The endings of brain cells that are involved in the release of serotonin, but potentially also be 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.639
 Cause permanent damage to the brain 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.370
