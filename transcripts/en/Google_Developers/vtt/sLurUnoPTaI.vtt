JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Hello, you've joined

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.296
us live at Google I/O.
I'm Jake and this is Paul.

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:06.670
And Paul, I don't
know about you,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.130
but when I have
a handheld mike I

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.020
find it changes my
personality and accents.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.970
PAUL LEWIS: Absolutely, Jake.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.010
JAKE ARCHIBALD: What
things in the keynote

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.140
particularly caught
your attention?

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.840
PAUL LEWIS: Can
we drop this now?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.589
Actually, I think I
was going to say this,

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.030
I think for me it was
Chrome Custom Tabs.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.500
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Chrome custom tabs.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.640
They were brilliant, yes.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.390
PAUL LEWIS: You can
have that back now.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.500
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah,
Chrome custom tabs.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
They were really-- I mean we've
seen native apps do this also

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.620
so far with like web views.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.490
They're keeping
you within the app

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.890
by using a web view of them
calling out into a browser.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.350
But this has a few
problems, right?

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.299
PAUL LEWIS: So I was noticing
this with the Twitter app

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.090
where it takes you to
the Twitter web view.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.099
And then it basically makes
you sign into Twitter again.

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:48.390
So you're like signing into
Twitter, inside of Twitter,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.841
inside of Twitter and it was
like Twitter's all the way

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:51.340
down.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.660
And I was like this is
bizarre, don't want to do this.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.410
And Chrome custom tabs
let's you break out

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.201
that-- gives you Chrome
with all the Cookie

00:00:58.201 --> 00:00:59.910
Jar, all that good stuff.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.320
But it gives you the
niceties of still feeling

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.390
like you're part of the
app that you were in.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think there's
a security element to this

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.900
as well.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.691
Because I don't know
about you but whenever

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:11.620
I'm using a native app and
it starts showing web content

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.170
but within its own
view, if I get a login

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.655
screen for something
like Twitter or Google

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:18.530
I don't have the confidence
that I'm actually

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.195
looking at a Twitter
or a Google property.

00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:23.330
It could just be any website
that just kind of has

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.890
a page that looks like that.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.800
And with the Chrome custom
tabs, it gives you confidence

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.440
that you're on the real
web, you can find the URL,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.470
you have that
safety and security.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.280
PAUL LEWIS: Yep, so
I think, what else?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.557
Oh, we saw ServiceWorker is
still getting a lot-- woo!--

00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:39.640
lot of love and attention.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.220
And obviously that
gives rise to push

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.087
messaging and notifications
as well as sort of as a

00:01:45.087 --> 00:01:45.920
follow on from that.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.390
And obviously, in
the next year I

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.410
guess we might see even
more things hanging off

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.910
Service worker like
background sync,

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.200
maybe if that comes through.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.890
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Yeah, Yeah, we've

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.290
got-- background sync is
in progress at the moment.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.410
I guess the main
difference for this year

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.640
is, because I was
presenting last year,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.850
and I was on stage
kind of saying,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.810
hey we've kind of
made a prototype.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.380
Look it kind of works.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.650
Well the demos kind of worked.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.510
Though we had some issues.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.699
And we were like maybe this
is going to be a thing,

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.240
hopefully we don't
break the web forever.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.884
And so it's kind of been almost
reassuring to see this year

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.800
people like the Guardian
are actually using it

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.050
for push notifications.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.259
And we've seen people use
it to make the web faster

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:22.300
and that's kind of like,
yeah, we didn't actually

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.420
destroy everything.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.090
Go, us.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.020
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah,
I think we've also

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.300
been hearing a lot about
performance, which obviously

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.370
makes me very happy.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.745
And it's nice to see that
that's getting a lot of airtime

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:35.042
again at I/O this year.

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:37.250
So we've been talking about
Rail and stuff like that.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.360
And then Polymer hit 1.0.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.180
Which means now they're
production ready.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.876
What was that?

00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:45.750
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That
was me trying to do 1.0.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.990
PAUL LEWIS: That
just does not look--

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.590
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Like I
did it right way around?

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.050
Yeah that's right.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.633
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah,
but it's just weird.

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:51.190
Don't do it.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.722
It's weird.

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:54.180
Unless I can get
you in to actually

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.787
sign for every single version
of an app bigger than 1.1.

00:02:56.787 --> 00:02:58.620
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
easier now because when

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.770
they naught point--

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.030
PAUL LEWIS: Five-- Eight--
Eight's fine but try and do

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.067
five.

00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:04.900
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's
the wrong way around.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.595
Yeah, OK.

00:03:05.595 --> 00:03:07.220
PAUL LEWIS: All right,
but in any case,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.960
that's really awesome.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.630
That means components
hopefully starting

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.910
to standardize and settle down.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.850
And can start to make its
way and move things forward.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.160
Well what else have
you been noticing?

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.790
JAKE ARCHIBALD: The Photos
app and their website

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.665
which is coming soon.

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:26.800
Which I'm really, really
looking forward to seeing what

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.420
they've done.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.110
I think for me
it's just-- the web

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.270
has taken another huge
chunk out of native,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.410
in terms of features
and performance, while.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.970
But it's remained-- it's
kept true to the web.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.410
And I think one
the things that we

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.806
saw in the keynote was
like Android saying, hey,

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:43.680
we're going to do this
permission model where

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.940
you ask for permissions
just before you use them

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.810
because then they've
got context and stuff.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.800
And I sat there going, yes,
that's what the web does.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.280
We win, for once.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.190
So I think we're going to see
more of that sort of stuff

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.510
and improving the
web but keeping

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.370
what makes the web great.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.270
PAUL LEWIS: Awesome.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.520
