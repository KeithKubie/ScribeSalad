00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Instructor] A quality control expert

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.790
at a drink bottling factory
took a random sample

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.090
of bottles from a batch and
measured the amount of liquid

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.780
in each bottle in the sample.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.620
The amounts in the sample
had a mean of 503 milliliters

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.800
and a standard deviation
of five milliliters.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.430
They want to test if this
is convincing evidence

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.500
that the mean amount for
bottles in this batch

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.520
is different than the target
value of 500 milliliters.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.430
Let mu be the mean amount of liquid

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.460
in each bottle in the batch.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.950
Write an appropriate set of hypotheses

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.620
for their significance test,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.140
for the significance test that the quality

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.990
control expert is running.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.220
So pause this video and
see if you can do that.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.400
Now, let's do this together.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.930
So first, you're going
to have two hypotheses.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.750
You're gonna have your null hypothesis

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.950
and your alternative hypothesis.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.346
Your null hypothesis is
going to be a hypothesis

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:58.760
about the population
parameter that you care about

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.310
and it's going to assume
kind of the status quo.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.550
No news here.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.620
And so the parameter that we care about

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.700
is the mean amount of liquid
in the bottles in the batch.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.140
So that's mu right over there.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.650
And what would be the
assumption that that would be,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.930
the no news here?

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.610
Well, it would be 500 milliliters.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.990
That's the target value.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.570
So, it's reasonable to say,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.480
well, the null is doing
what it's supposed to,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.660
that where the actual mean for the batch

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.530
is actually what the target needs to be,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.580
it's actually 500 milliliters.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.500
Some of you might have said,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.010
hey wait, didn't they say the amounts

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.970
in the sample had a
mean of 503 milliliters?

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.470
Why isn't this 503?

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.320
Remember, your hypothesis is going to be

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.970
about the population parameter.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.780
Your assumption about
the population parameter.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.240
This 503 milliliters right over here,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.070
this is a sample statistic.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.570
This is a sample mean
that's trying to estimate

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.410
this thing right over here.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.510
When we do our significance test,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.930
we're going to incorporate
this 503 milliliters.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.840
We're going to think about,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.380
well, what's the probability
of getting a sample statistic,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.590
a sample mean this far or further away

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.090
from the assumed mean if we assume

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.630
that the null hypothesis is true,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.670
and if that probability
is below a threshold,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.460
our significance level, then
we reject the null hypothesis

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.440
and it would suggest the alternative.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.680
But if we're just trying to generate

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.670
or write a set of
hypotheses, this would be

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.090
our null hypothesis, and then
our alternative hypothesis

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.140
is that the true mean for the batch

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.120
is something different
than 500 milliliters.
