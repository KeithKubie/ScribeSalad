and so Android has always had an
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.190
and so Android has always had an
animation api's and the number of API

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
animation api's and the number of API
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.819

zyre has grown as the system has grown

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829
zyre has grown as the system has grown
 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.049
zyre has grown as the system has grown
and become kind of more fully featured

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059
and become kind of more fully featured
 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.910
and become kind of more fully featured
there are a variety of different api's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
there are a variety of different api's
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.889
there are a variety of different api's
for different situations that have been

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
for different situations that have been
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.900
for different situations that have been
added over the different API releases as

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910
added over the different API releases as
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.420
added over the different API releases as
well as two and the new support

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
well as two and the new support

we hear that the variety the range of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
we hear that the variety the range of
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.210
we hear that the variety the range of
animation systems can be overwhelming

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
animation systems can be overwhelming
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.460
animation systems can be overwhelming
that you don't know which one to reach

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
that you don't know which one to reach
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.560
that you don't know which one to reach
for or which is the best for a certain

use case so our goal today is to really

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
use case so our goal today is to really
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.420
use case so our goal today is to really
give you a overview of the different

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
give you a overview of the different
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640
give you a overview of the different
animation systems so you what they're

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650
animation systems so you what they're
 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.929
animation systems so you what they're
good for what they might not be good for

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
good for what they might not be good for
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.550
good for what they might not be good for
and give you the confidence to know

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
and give you the confidence to know
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.020
and give you the confidence to know
which to reach for when you need to

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
which to reach for when you need to
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149
which to reach for when you need to
achieve something and we're gonna spend

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
achieve something and we're gonna spend
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.190
achieve something and we're gonna spend
a bit of extra time on the new hotness

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
a bit of extra time on the new hotness
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.800
a bit of extra time on the new hotness
that is motion they are today as well so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
that is motion they are today as well so
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.340
that is motion they are today as well so
let's dive right in first up is androids

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
let's dive right in first up is androids
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.920
let's dive right in first up is androids
oldest and original animation API which

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
oldest and original animation API which
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.249
oldest and original animation API which
was Android view animation I would urge

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
was Android view animation I would urge
 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.420
was Android view animation I would urge
you to kind of consider it deprecated

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430
you to kind of consider it deprecated
 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.920
you to kind of consider it deprecated
unfortunately it's not actually app

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
unfortunately it's not actually app
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600
unfortunately it's not actually app
deprecated as I'll get to in a minute

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
deprecated as I'll get to in a minute
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.219
deprecated as I'll get to in a minute
but maybe just think of it in that way

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
but maybe just think of it in that way
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.340
but maybe just think of it in that way
so this like I say an old elder

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
so this like I say an old elder
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.560
so this like I say an old elder
animation API and was kind of runs in a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
animation API and was kind of runs in a
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.600
animation API and was kind of runs in a
certain phase of the the view system so

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
certain phase of the the view system so
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.429
certain phase of the the view system so
everyone knows most views have like a

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
everyone knows most views have like a
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.679
everyone knows most views have like a
measure layout and a draw unfortunately

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
measure layout and a draw unfortunately
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.660
measure layout and a draw unfortunately
because the animations only run in the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
because the animations only run in the
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.710
because the animations only run in the
draw pass and it means that we can't do

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
draw pass and it means that we can't do
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820
draw pass and it means that we can't do
certain things like deferring

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
certain things like deferring
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.500
certain things like deferring
rendering when we don't need to and it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510
rendering when we don't need to and it
 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.820
rendering when we don't need to and it
also leads to certain things where

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830
also leads to certain things where
 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.340
also leads to certain things where
because the animation is only applied in

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350
because the animation is only applied in
 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.960
because the animation is only applied in
the draw pass you don't know maybe the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
the draw pass you don't know maybe the
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.790
the draw pass you don't know maybe the
lap the what it looks like it's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800
lap the what it looks like it's
 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.960
lap the what it looks like it's
somewhere in your layout maybe you've

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
somewhere in your layout maybe you've
 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.100
somewhere in your layout maybe you've
animated the button to a certain

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
animated the button to a certain
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.840
animated the button to a certain
position when you try and press it the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850
position when you try and press it the
 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.400
position when you try and press it the
views bounds haven't actually changed it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
views bounds haven't actually changed it
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.050
views bounds haven't actually changed it
only exists within the view system

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060
only exists within the view system
 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.000
only exists within the view system
there's drawing power system and so it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010
there's drawing power system and so it
 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.470
there's drawing power system and so it
can lead to a bunch of different and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480
can lead to a bunch of different and
 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.660
can lead to a bunch of different and
problems basically it's being

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670
problems basically it's being
 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.850
problems basically it's being
considerate and deprecated because it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
considerate and deprecated because it
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.970
considerate and deprecated because it
has much much better and replacements it

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980
has much much better and replacements it
 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.710
has much much better and replacements it
belongs in a museum

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720
belongs in a museum
 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.950
belongs in a museum
[Laughter]

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960
[Laughter]
 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.750
[Laughter]
I'd say deprecated except there are

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
I'd say deprecated except there are
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.720
I'd say deprecated except there are
actually well one single use case I can

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
actually well one single use case I can
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.940
actually well one single use case I can
think of where you still have to use it

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950
think of where you still have to use it
 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.190
think of where you still have to use it
and that is when you were doing window

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200
and that is when you were doing window
 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.260
and that is when you were doing window
animations so when you're doing window

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270
animations so when you're doing window
 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.210
animations so when you're doing window
animations when a new activity launches

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220
animations when a new activity launches
 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.480
animations when a new activity launches
then this API only accepts this type of

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490
then this API only accepts this type of
 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.400
then this API only accepts this type of
window animation because existed from

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410
window animation because existed from
 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.990
window animation because existed from
API one but also because these windows

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000
API one but also because these windows
 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.910
API one but also because these windows
animations have to declaratively and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920
animations have to declaratively and
 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.980
animations have to declaratively and
state all the information to perform the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990
state all the information to perform the
 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.840
state all the information to perform the
animation the fact that it runs in the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850
animation the fact that it runs in the
 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.949
animation the fact that it runs in the
draw part is useful because it

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959
draw part is useful because it
 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.630
draw part is useful because it
guarantees that the view is already

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640
guarantees that the view is already
 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.370
guarantees that the view is already
measured when you do this and that

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380
measured when you do this and that
 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.250
measured when you do this and that
allows it to define certain things like

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260
allows it to define certain things like
 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.110
allows it to define certain things like
here which she was seeing like a wide

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120
here which she was seeing like a wide
 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.390
here which she was seeing like a wide
delta animation which means 10% of the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400
delta animation which means 10% of the
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.060
delta animation which means 10% of the
the Y position so because it's already

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070
the Y position so because it's already
 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.710
the Y position so because it's already
definitely guaranteed to be measured and

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720
definitely guaranteed to be measured and
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.380
definitely guaranteed to be measured and
this can be useful the only other place

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390
this can be useful the only other place
 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.090
this can be useful the only other place
you might need to use it is if you're

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100
you might need to use it is if you're
 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.340
you might need to use it is if you're
doing fragment transactions so here when

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350
doing fragment transactions so here when
 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.199
doing fragment transactions so here when
you set the animations to run a fragment

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209
you set the animations to run a fragment
 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.740
you set the animations to run a fragment
transaction you can supply this Android

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.530
transaction you can supply this Android
view animation as an Arg but the API

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540
view animation as an Arg but the API
 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.470
view animation as an Arg but the API
also accepts the newer Android animator

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480
also accepts the newer Android animator
 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.780
also accepts the newer Android animator
so I urge you to kind of use the newer

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790
so I urge you to kind of use the newer
 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.540
so I urge you to kind of use the newer
one if you can so that was view

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550
one if you can so that was view
 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.990

animations basically only really use it

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000
animations basically only really use it
 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.449
animations basically only really use it
for window animations or if you really

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459
for window animations or if you really
 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.740
for window animations or if you really
really have to if you need to rely on

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750
really have to if you need to rely on
 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.390

so Nick has just talked about a view

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640
so Nick has just talked about a view
 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.400
so Nick has just talked about a view
animation now let's take a look at the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410
animation now let's take a look at the
 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.260
animation now let's take a look at the
animator the new animator API that was

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270
animator the new animator API that was
 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.760
animator the new animator API that was
introduced in API 11 so the new animator

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770
introduced in API 11 so the new animator
 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.650
introduced in API 11 so the new animator
API is much more versatile than the view

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660
API is much more versatile than the view
 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.540
API is much more versatile than the view
animation because it allows you to

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550
animation because it allows you to
 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.000
animation because it allows you to
animate more than just view properties

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010
animate more than just view properties
 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.530
animate more than just view properties
you can essentially use it to animate

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540
you can essentially use it to animate
 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.590
you can essentially use it to animate
any arbitrary property on any object and

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600
any arbitrary property on any object and
 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.350
any arbitrary property on any object and
you can even just anomie any value not

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360
you can even just anomie any value not
 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.960
you can even just anomie any value not
necessarily associated with any property

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970
necessarily associated with any property
 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.920
necessarily associated with any property
at all using the value animator API and

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930
at all using the value animator API and
 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.960
at all using the value animator API and
since the introduction of the animator

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970
since the introduction of the animator
 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.870
since the introduction of the animator
we've built a bunch of higher-level

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880
we've built a bunch of higher-level
 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.240
we've built a bunch of higher-level
animation constructs on top of the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250
animation constructs on top of the
 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.940
animation constructs on top of the
animator such as enemy director drawable

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950
animator such as enemy director drawable
 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.280
animator such as enemy director drawable
animate stateless drawable transition

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290
animate stateless drawable transition
 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.700
animate stateless drawable transition
and the default item in default item

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710

animator in recycler view and people

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520
animator in recycler view and people
 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.660
animator in recycler view and people
always ask me between animation animator

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670
always ask me between animation animator
 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.600
always ask me between animation animator
which any machine character I use and

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610
which any machine character I use and
 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.940
which any machine character I use and
the answer is definitely the animator

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950
the answer is definitely the animator
 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.180
the answer is definitely the animator
API because it's just much more capable

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190
API because it's just much more capable
 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.000
API because it's just much more capable
an in this section we're gonna look at a

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010
an in this section we're gonna look at a
 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.030
an in this section we're gonna look at a
few um animators we're gonna look at

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040
few um animators we're gonna look at
 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.100
few um animators we're gonna look at
value animators where you can animate a

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110
value animators where you can animate a
 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.050
value animators where you can animate a
value and we're gonna look at object

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060
value and we're gonna look at object
 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.900
value and we're gonna look at object
animator which not only animates the

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910
animator which not only animates the
 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.000
animator which not only animates the
value but also automatically sets that

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010
value but also automatically sets that
 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.820
value but also automatically sets that
value on a property we're also gonna

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830
value on a property we're also gonna
 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.870
value on a property we're also gonna
look at any other sets and then we're

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880
look at any other sets and then we're
 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.430
look at any other sets and then we're
also gonna take a look at the view

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440
also gonna take a look at the view
 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.290
also gonna take a look at the view
property animator it is not an animator

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300
property animator it is not an animator
 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.000
property animator it is not an animator
but it's backed by a value animator

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010
but it's backed by a value animator
 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.970
but it's backed by a value animator
we'll talk about a little bit more about

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980
we'll talk about a little bit more about
 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.810
we'll talk about a little bit more about
that in a minute and then also we're

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820
that in a minute and then also we're
 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.640
that in a minute and then also we're
gonna look at property values holder

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650
gonna look at property values holder
 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.440
gonna look at property values holder
which you can use in conjunction with

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450
which you can use in conjunction with
 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.880
which you can use in conjunction with
value animator so here's an interesting

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890
value animator so here's an interesting
 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.550
value animator so here's an interesting
animation with a little chuckling man

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560
animation with a little chuckling man
 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.820
animation with a little chuckling man
and that can be achieved with an America

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830
and that can be achieved with an America
 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.280
and that can be achieved with an America
drawable which people talk about in the

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290
drawable which people talk about in the
 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.340
drawable which people talk about in the
next section or you can use louder you

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350
next section or you can use louder you
 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.980
next section or you can use louder you
for it but now let's look past that and

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990
for it but now let's look past that and
 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.200
for it but now let's look past that and
on top of this little man there's a

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210
on top of this little man there's a
 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.160
on top of this little man there's a
there are text being animated in and out

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170
there are text being animated in and out
 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.190
there are text being animated in and out
so in order to achieve that we can just

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200
so in order to achieve that we can just
 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.560
so in order to achieve that we can just
simply create a object animator to

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570
simply create a object animator to
 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.230
simply create a object animator to
animate the Alpha property of this view

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240
animate the Alpha property of this view
 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.119
animate the Alpha property of this view
pretty straightforward notice

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.129
pretty straightforward notice
 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:35.510
pretty straightforward notice
how here I'm supplying us an Elfa string

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520
how here I'm supplying us an Elfa string
 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.089
how here I'm supplying us an Elfa string
and that is a bad idea

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099
and that is a bad idea
 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.010
and that is a bad idea
because when a property string being

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020
because when a property string being
 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.199
because when a property string being
being is being passed to the object

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:42.209
being is being passed to the object
 

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:44.329
being is being passed to the object
animator what we're gonna do is we have

00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:44.339
animator what we're gonna do is we have
 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:46.879
animator what we're gonna do is we have
to prefix a string with a set and get in

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:46.889
to prefix a string with a set and get in
 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.209
to prefix a string with a set and get in
order to then use reflection to find the

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219
order to then use reflection to find the
 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:52.579
order to then use reflection to find the
setter and getter in the target objects

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:52.589
setter and getter in the target objects
 

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:56.449
setter and getter in the target objects
class and that's inherently more costly

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:56.459
class and that's inherently more costly

class and that's inherently more costly
what we recommend instead is using this

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360
what we recommend instead is using this
 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.139
what we recommend instead is using this
view the Alpha property object it is

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:03.149
view the Alpha property object it is
 

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:07.009
view the Alpha property object it is
introduced in API 14 along with a bunch

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:07.019
introduced in API 14 along with a bunch
 

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:09.589
introduced in API 14 along with a bunch
of other property objects for other view

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599
of other property objects for other view
 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.839
of other property objects for other view
properties what happens in this view dot

properties what happens in this view dot
alpha is that whenever the animation

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:14.519
alpha is that whenever the animation
 

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:16.820
alpha is that whenever the animation
value gets updated the set value will be

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830
value gets updated the set value will be
 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.179
value gets updated the set value will be
called and then from there the set alpha

00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:20.189
called and then from there the set alpha
 

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:22.040
called and then from there the set alpha
will be called on the view so that's one

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050
will be called on the view so that's one
 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.169
will be called on the view so that's one
level of indirection much more efficient

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:24.179
level of indirection much more efficient
 

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:28.519
level of indirection much more efficient
than reflection if we take a closer look

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:28.529
than reflection if we take a closer look
 

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:31.249
than reflection if we take a closer look
at this animation we can see that all no

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:31.259
at this animation we can see that all no
 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:34.459
at this animation we can see that all no
text not only animate scene but also it

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:34.469
text not only animate scene but also it
 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:36.980
text not only animate scene but also it
blows up so there are three things going

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:36.990
blows up so there are three things going

Alpha skill X and skill Y um here's how

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:42.959
Alpha skill X and skill Y um here's how
 

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.600
Alpha skill X and skill Y um here's how
we can do that with property values

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:44.610
we can do that with property values
 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.279
we can do that with property values
holder we can create three property

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:46.289
holder we can create three property
 

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:49.609
holder we can create three property
value holders one for each property and

00:07:49.609 --> 00:07:49.619
value holders one for each property and
 

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:51.769
value holders one for each property and
then we can specify the start value and

00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:51.779
then we can specify the start value and
 

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:53.329
then we can specify the start value and
the end value for the for each of the

00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:53.339
the end value for the for each of the
 

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.129
the end value for the for each of the
property and once we have all these

00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139
property and once we have all these
 

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:57.469
property and once we have all these
property values holder is defined we can

00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479
property values holder is defined we can
 

00:07:57.479 --> 00:07:59.149
property values holder is defined we can
then set these property values holder on

00:07:59.149 --> 00:07:59.159
then set these property values holder on
 

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:01.819
then set these property values holder on
on the object animator so the then the

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:01.829
on the object animator so the then the
 

00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:04.069
on the object animator so the then the
object animator can then drive the

00:08:04.069 --> 00:08:04.079
object animator can then drive the
 

00:08:04.079 --> 00:08:07.909
object animator can then drive the
change of the property values and one

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919
change of the property values and one
 

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:11.540
change of the property values and one
caveat is when you use multiple property

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:11.550
caveat is when you use multiple property
 

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.509
caveat is when you use multiple property
value holders on one object animator you

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:14.519
value holders on one object animator you
 

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:17.419
value holders on one object animator you
are essentially animating all these

00:08:17.419 --> 00:08:17.429
are essentially animating all these
 

00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:19.790
are essentially animating all these
properties with the same interpolator

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800
properties with the same interpolator
 

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.269
properties with the same interpolator
using the same duration on the same

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:23.279
using the same duration on the same
 

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:26.629
using the same duration on the same
target object but a lot of times we want

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639
target object but a lot of times we want
 

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.419
target object but a lot of times we want
to animate scale X and skill-wise

00:08:28.419 --> 00:08:28.429
to animate scale X and skill-wise
 

00:08:28.429 --> 00:08:30.499
to animate scale X and skill-wise
simultaneously that's exactly what you

00:08:30.499 --> 00:08:30.509
simultaneously that's exactly what you
 

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:35.089
simultaneously that's exactly what you
need and if you want to define that same

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099
need and if you want to define that same
 

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:37.069
need and if you want to define that same
object in the emitter in XML with

00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:37.079
object in the emitter in XML with
 

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:38.990
object in the emitter in XML with
probably values holders it looks pretty

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000
probably values holders it looks pretty
 

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.529
probably values holders it looks pretty
straightforward now if you take a look

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539
straightforward now if you take a look
 

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.389
straightforward now if you take a look
at the bottom of this this animation

00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399
at the bottom of this this animation
 

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.980
at the bottom of this this animation
there's that button fading again

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:45.990
there's that button fading again
 

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.720
there's that button fading again
after all the text animations have

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:47.730
after all the text animations have
 

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.420
after all the text animations have
finished to coordinate these different

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:50.430
finished to coordinate these different
 

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.030
finished to coordinate these different
animations together we can't just create

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040
animations together we can't just create
 

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.800
animations together we can't just create
an animator set and then with the play

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:57.810
an animator set and then with the play
 

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.570
an animator set and then with the play
method it would return an animator set

00:08:59.570 --> 00:08:59.580
method it would return an animator set
 

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.420
method it would return an animator set
builder and we want to play the fade in

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:02.430
builder and we want to play the fade in
 

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.130
builder and we want to play the fade in
after it to fade out so and then while

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.140
after it to fade out so and then while
 

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.870
after it to fade out so and then while
the text is fitting you also want to

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880
the text is fitting you also want to
 

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.269
the text is fitting you also want to
blow it up so we're gonna play the fade

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279
blow it up so we're gonna play the fade
 

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:15.050
blow it up so we're gonna play the fade
in with just scale animation and then we

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.060
in with just scale animation and then we
 

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.790
in with just scale animation and then we
want to play all the text animations

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800
want to play all the text animations
 

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.110
want to play all the text animations
before the button phase in so that's

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120
before the button phase in so that's
 

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.780
before the button phase in so that's
pretty straightforward API and powerful

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:23.790
pretty straightforward API and powerful
 

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.579
pretty straightforward API and powerful
too now we've seen how we can animate

00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:28.589
too now we've seen how we can animate
 

00:09:28.589 --> 00:09:30.710
too now we've seen how we can animate
various properties using property values

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720
various properties using property values
 

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.810

animator and if these properties that

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.370
animator and if these properties that
 

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.400
animator and if these properties that
you're animating it happened to be view

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:37.410
you're animating it happened to be view
 

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.860
you're animating it happened to be view
properties here's a more straightforward

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:39.870
properties here's a more straightforward
 

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.840
properties here's a more straightforward
way to animate them you can just call

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:41.850
way to animate them you can just call
 

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.960
way to animate them you can just call
view da enemy that would create a view

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:44.970
view da enemy that would create a view
 

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.210
view da enemy that would create a view
property animator and then they're a

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.220
property animator and then they're a
 

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.910
property animator and then they're a
bunch of messes for various properties

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920
bunch of messes for various properties
 

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.250
bunch of messes for various properties
and then you set it end value for for

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.260
and then you set it end value for for
 

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.410
and then you set it end value for for
these properties and then optionally you

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420
these properties and then optionally you
 

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.900
these properties and then optionally you
can you can set any interpolator and

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:56.910
can you can set any interpolator and
 

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.990
can you can set any interpolator and

me is view property animator as

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:23.430
me is view property animator as
 

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.720
me is view property animator as
efficient as object animator I can

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:26.730
efficient as object animator I can
 

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.850
efficient as object animator I can
assure you it's actually slightly more

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860
assure you it's actually slightly more
 

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.430
assure you it's actually slightly more
efficient than the object animator the

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440
efficient than the object animator the
 

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.019
efficient than the object animator the
reason for that is view property

00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:33.029
reason for that is view property
 

00:10:33.029 --> 00:10:34.850
reason for that is view property
animator has been optimized for

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860
animator has been optimized for
 

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.370
animator has been optimized for
animating view properties and as a

properties that you're animating there's

00:10:42.699 --> 00:10:42.709
properties that you're animating there's
 

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:46.670

only one one pass of you validation gets

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680
only one one pass of you validation gets
 

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.100
only one one pass of you validation gets
triggered per frame whereas if you use

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.110
triggered per frame whereas if you use
 

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.230

the object animator to animate various
 

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.449
the object animator to animate various
properties then your each property

00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:53.459
properties then your each property
 

00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:54.980

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:05.850
use case where you just star the
 

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:11.650
use case where you just star the
animation and just forget about it now

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:11.660
animation and just forget about it now
 

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.329

you might have seen this animation

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.339
you might have seen this animation
 

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:19.639
you might have seen this animation
before in the previous place did you

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:19.649
before in the previous place did you
 

00:11:19.649 --> 00:11:21.530
before in the previous place did you
notice that there's a three little toss

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:21.540
notice that there's a three little toss
 

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.710
notice that there's a three little toss
animating at the end of the text and

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720
animating at the end of the text and
 

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.769
animating at the end of the text and
she's these three little dots are not

00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:27.779
she's these three little dots are not
 

00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:30.410
she's these three little dots are not
really a property for the for the

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420
really a property for the for the
 

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.900
really a property for the for the
textview so here we're gonna create a

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:32.910
textview so here we're gonna create a
 

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.019
textview so here we're gonna create a
value animator to animate the number of

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:36.029
value animator to animate the number of
 

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.420
value animator to animate the number of
thoughts we're gonna create a value of

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:38.430
thoughts we're gonna create a value of
 

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.790
thoughts we're gonna create a value of
integer type to enemy from zero to four

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800
integer type to enemy from zero to four
 

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.350
integer type to enemy from zero to four
and once it gets to four then wrap

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360
and once it gets to four then wrap
 

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.629
and once it gets to four then wrap
around and we start at zero because

00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639
around and we start at zero because
 

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:47.090
around and we start at zero because
there's a repeat count and with value

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100
there's a repeat count and with value
 

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.650
there's a repeat count and with value
animator you almost always want to use

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660
animator you almost always want to use
 

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.199
animator you almost always want to use
an update listener because value

00:11:51.199 --> 00:11:51.209
an update listener because value
 

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:52.939
an update listener because value
animator is just gonna animate it on its

00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:52.949
animator is just gonna animate it on its
 

00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:55.069
animator is just gonna animate it on its
own it has no impact to anything outside

00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079
own it has no impact to anything outside
 

00:11:55.079 --> 00:12:00.970
own it has no impact to anything outside
of it so here with with value with the

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:00.980
of it so here with with value with the
 

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.139
of it so here with with value with the
update listener we're gonna read the

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:03.149
update listener we're gonna read the
 

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:06.620
update listener we're gonna read the
value out of the value animator and that

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:06.630
value out of the value animator and that
 

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.019
value out of the value animator and that
I use it as the number of dots that

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:09.029
I use it as the number of dots that
 

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:12.050
I use it as the number of dots that
we'll want to show and and then we're

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060
we'll want to show and and then we're
 

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.970
we'll want to show and and then we're
gonna have a span of all string from the

gonna have a span of all string from the
 

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.650
gonna have a span of all string from the
textview we're gonna set a span for the

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:17.660
textview we're gonna set a span for the
 

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.569

task that shouldn't be showing and which
 

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.870

with each animation update we would

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880
with each animation update we would
 

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.790
with each animation update we would
update that the number of does that

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800
update that the number of does that
 

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.620
update that the number of does that
should be showing and then and then

recap when should we use what kind of

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:44.850
recap when should we use what kind of
 

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.259

animator object animator is kind of just
 

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:50.720
animator object animator is kind of just
all-purpose animator that as long as you

all-purpose animator that as long as you
 

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.009
all-purpose animator that as long as you
have a property you own animate you can

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:52.019
have a property you own animate you can
 

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:54.860
have a property you own animate you can
use that value animator is for animating

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:54.870
use that value animator is for animating
 

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.509
use that value animator is for animating
a more custom customized kind of

00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519
a more custom customized kind of
 

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:02.389
a more custom customized kind of

animation where you want to enemy this
 

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:04.490
animation where you want to enemy this
value and then you want to then use that

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500
value and then you want to then use that
 

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.040
value and then you want to then use that
value to apply it to something else your

UI and the view property animator is

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:10.470
UI and the view property animator is
 

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.430
UI and the view property animator is
best used when you have multiple

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440
best used when you have multiple
 

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.750
best used when you have multiple
view property is that you need to

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760
view property is that you need to
 

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.210
view property is that you need to
animate simultaneously on the same view

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220
animate simultaneously on the same view
 

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.800
animate simultaneously on the same view
and it's and because you can't really

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:20.810
and it's and because you can't really
 

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.880
and it's and because you can't really
coordinate this view property animator

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:22.890
coordinate this view property animator
 

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:27.260
coordinate this view property animator
with anything else is only good for the

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:27.270
with anything else is only good for the
 

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.620
with anything else is only good for the
fire-and-forget use case and then

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:30.630
fire-and-forget use case and then
 

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.750
fire-and-forget use case and then
probably values holder with probably

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760
probably values holder with probably
 

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.130
probably values holder with probably
values holder you can define multiple

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:36.140
values holder you can define multiple
 

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.650
values holder you can define multiple
properties and and then any any made

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660
properties and and then any any made
 

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.490
properties and and then any any made
them using an object animator the nice

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:43.500
them using an object animator the nice
 

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.430
them using an object animator the nice
thing about you probably values holder

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440
thing about you probably values holder
 

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.260
thing about you probably values holder
compared to view property animator is

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:48.270
compared to view property animator is
 

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.110
compared to view property animator is
that it not only allows you to animate

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120
that it not only allows you to animate
 

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.750
that it not only allows you to animate
multiple properties simultaneously

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:52.760
multiple properties simultaneously
 

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.970
multiple properties simultaneously
because it's really being set on the

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980
because it's really being set on the
 

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.829
because it's really being set on the
object together you can coordinate that

00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839
object together you can coordinate that
 

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:01.160
object together you can coordinate that
or you know see so you can traverse so

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:01.170
or you know see so you can traverse so
 

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.840
or you know see so you can traverse so
it's more powerful and then animator

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:02.850
it's more powerful and then animator
 

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.640
it's more powerful and then animator
said when you have multiple animations

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:04.650
said when you have multiple animations
 

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.860
said when you have multiple animations
that you want to coordinate any meter

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:06.870
that you want to coordinate any meter
 

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.820
that you want to coordinate any meter
said would be a good choice thank you

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:10.830
said would be a good choice thank you
 

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.310
said would be a good choice thank you
very much next up we've got an animated

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320
very much next up we've got an animated
 

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.740
very much next up we've got an animated
vector drawable so these are great for

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:15.750
vector drawable so these are great for
 

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.690
vector drawable so these are great for
doing a vector graphic animations like

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700
doing a vector graphic animations like
 

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.250
doing a vector graphic animations like
these wonderful little icons you see in

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260
these wonderful little icons you see in
 

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.019
these wonderful little icons you see in
the new google fit application and

00:14:21.019 --> 00:14:21.029
the new google fit application and
 

00:14:21.029 --> 00:14:23.150
the new google fit application and
animate affected drawable is actually

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160
animate affected drawable is actually
 

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.130
animate affected drawable is actually
kind of a very thin wrapper around to

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:25.140
kind of a very thin wrapper around to
 

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.930
kind of a very thin wrapper around to
more powerful things it basically

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940
more powerful things it basically
 

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.390
more powerful things it basically
connects together a vector drawable to

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:29.400
connects together a vector drawable to
 

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.760
connects together a vector drawable to
one or multiple object animators and

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:31.770
one or multiple object animators and
 

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.250
one or multiple object animators and
runs animations on them it has a very

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260
runs animations on them it has a very
 

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.040
runs animations on them it has a very
kind of small and focused API it's

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.050
kind of small and focused API it's
 

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.210
kind of small and focused API it's
basically implements the animatable

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220
basically implements the animatable
 

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.280
basically implements the animatable
interface which is basically just lets

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:40.290
interface which is basically just lets
 

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.530
interface which is basically just lets
you play pause and stop the animation so

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540
you play pause and stop the animation so
 

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.060
you play pause and stop the animation so
you can get an animator vegetal or like

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.070
you can get an animator vegetal or like
 

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:48.440
you can get an animator vegetal or like
this and just call start um ABD is great

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:48.450
this and just call start um ABD is great
 

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.050
this and just call start um ABD is great
for like performance-critical and vector

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060
for like performance-critical and vector
 

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.390
for like performance-critical and vector
graphic animation especially from new

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:53.400
graphic animation especially from new
 

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.630

gods where animated vector drawable was

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:55.640
gods where animated vector drawable was
 

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.920
gods where animated vector drawable was
re-implemented in native code and also

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:57.930
re-implemented in native code and also
 

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.320
re-implemented in native code and also
offloaded to the render thread which

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:00.330
offloaded to the render thread which
 

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.180
offloaded to the render thread which
means that even if you're yanking the UI

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:02.190
means that even if you're yanking the UI
 

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.500
means that even if you're yanking the UI
thread and you're not doing that right

thread and you're not doing that right
 

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.690
thread and you're not doing that right
and that your animation will keep on

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:05.700
and that your animation will keep on
 

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.980
and that your animation will keep on
playing but it also means that there's

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:06.990
playing but it also means that there's
 

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.350
playing but it also means that there's
just more rent of time on the thread for

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360
just more rent of time on the thread for
 

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.970
just more rent of time on the thread for
you to do your code rather than running

the progress for if you need to do
 

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.480
the progress for if you need to do
something like that then I urge you to

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:29.490
something like that then I urge you to
 

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.860
something like that then I urge you to
take a look at something like Lahti or

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:30.870
take a look at something like Lahti or
 

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.790
take a look at something like Lahti or
kiri KYR ie drawable and so it's really

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800
kiri KYR ie drawable and so it's really
 

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.260
kiri KYR ie drawable and so it's really
good for anything which is like

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:36.270
good for anything which is like
 

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.760
good for anything which is like
performance critical and that was a VD

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:39.770
performance critical and that was a VD
 

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:44.420
performance critical and that was a VD

momentum of the gesture into your UI to

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:01.140
momentum of the gesture into your UI to
 

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.860
momentum of the gesture into your UI to
create this sense of continuity and and

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:03.870
create this sense of continuity and and
 

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.700
create this sense of continuity and and
because when there are a lot of gestures

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:06.710
because when there are a lot of gestures
 

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.980
because when there are a lot of gestures
in flight you could then potentially

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:09.990
in flight you could then potentially
 

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.380
in flight you could then potentially
interrupt the existing ongoing animation

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:12.390
interrupt the existing ongoing animation
 

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.480

I'm sure you've seen any missions where

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:14.490
I'm sure you've seen any missions where
 

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.579
I'm sure you've seen any missions where
you want the animation to you want the

00:16:16.579 --> 00:16:16.589
you want the animation to you want the
 

00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:19.820
you want the animation to you want the
UI view to move from one location to the

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:19.830
UI view to move from one location to the
 

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.130
UI view to move from one location to the
other and then and then there's just her

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:22.140
other and then and then there's just her
 

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.400
other and then and then there's just her
from the users and as a result the

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:25.410
from the users and as a result the
 

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.240
from the users and as a result the
ending location would have changed and

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:28.250
ending location would have changed and
 

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.130
ending location would have changed and
in in this case if you use basic space

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.140
in in this case if you use basic space
 

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.260
in in this case if you use basic space
animation that would just simply change

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:33.270
animation that would just simply change
 

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:38.060
animation that would just simply change
some physics force and and then the as a

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.070
some physics force and and then the as a
 

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.130
some physics force and and then the as a
result the course question would be very

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:40.140
result the course question would be very
 

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.380
result the course question would be very
smooth and he also gives your app a more

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:42.390
smooth and he also gives your app a more
 

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:47.290
smooth and he also gives your app a more
realistic look so here I have an example

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:47.300
 

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.780
of just a little bubble with my cat's

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:50.790
of just a little bubble with my cat's
 

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.579
of just a little bubble with my cat's
picture on it and and it's you know

00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:54.589
picture on it and and it's you know
 

00:16:54.589 --> 00:16:56.930
picture on it and and it's you know
application overlay window so it's just

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940
application overlay window so it's just
 

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.800
application overlay window so it's just
on top of other applications and in this

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:00.810
on top of other applications and in this
 

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:04.730
on top of other applications and in this
case that is the beautiful timely app my

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740
case that is the beautiful timely app my
 

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.590
case that is the beautiful timely app my
goal is as I drag this little bubble

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600
goal is as I drag this little bubble
 

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.210
goal is as I drag this little bubble
around it I wanted to follow my finger

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220
around it I wanted to follow my finger
 

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.850
around it I wanted to follow my finger
and then when I let go it should rest on

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860
and then when I let go it should rest on
 

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:16.130
and then when I let go it should rest on
either side of the screen so to achieve

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140
either side of the screen so to achieve
 

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.590
either side of the screen so to achieve
this will obviously need to start with a

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600
this will obviously need to start with a
 

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.350
this will obviously need to start with a
non touch listener and then we're gonna

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360
non touch listener and then we're gonna
 

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.329
non touch listener and then we're gonna
use the velocity tracker to track the

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339
use the velocity tracker to track the
 

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.490
use the velocity tracker to track the
movement and then when there's action

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500
movement and then when there's action
 

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.630
movement and then when there's action
down when you to record a bunch of

down when you to record a bunch of
 

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.330
down when you to record a bunch of
positions in the subsequent movie events

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.340
positions in the subsequent movie events
 

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.669
positions in the subsequent movie events
where we're going to need to calculate

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679
where we're going to need to calculate
 

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:33.440
where we're going to need to calculate
how much it has moved your finger has

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:33.450
how much it has moved your finger has
 

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.350
how much it has moved your finger has
moved since since that Downey went and

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360
moved since since that Downey went and
 

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.690
moved since since that Downey went and
then update the the bubbles position

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700
then update the the bubbles position
 

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.020
then update the the bubbles position
accordingly and then when when there's

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.030
accordingly and then when when there's
 

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.760

base come in we're gonna calculate the
 

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.450
base come in we're gonna calculate the
velocity from the velocity tracker and

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460
velocity from the velocity tracker and
 

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.420
velocity from the velocity tracker and
then and then here for for

when the velocity is greater than zero

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.090
when the velocity is greater than zero
 

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.900
when the velocity is greater than zero
we're gonna just move to the right side

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:02.910
we're gonna just move to the right side
 

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.940
we're gonna just move to the right side
of the screen otherwise left side now

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:04.950
of the screen otherwise left side now
 

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.590
of the screen otherwise left side now
now that we have the final position

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600
now that we have the final position
 

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.660
now that we have the final position
where we want the bubble to rest on we

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:08.670
where we want the bubble to rest on we
 

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.400
where we want the bubble to rest on we
can create a spring animation to animate

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:10.410
can create a spring animation to animate
 

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.960
can create a spring animation to animate
that bubbles from ex prop that is a

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:13.970
that bubbles from ex prop that is a
 

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.070
that bubbles from ex prop that is a
custom property which I'll explain in

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080
custom property which I'll explain in
 

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.560
custom property which I'll explain in
the next slide now we can before we

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:18.570
the next slide now we can before we
 

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.060
the next slide now we can before we
start the animation we'll also want to

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:20.070
start the animation we'll also want to
 

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.180
start the animation we'll also want to
set the start velocity and this is

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.190
set the start velocity and this is
 

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.040
set the start velocity and this is
critical to ensure that that transition

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.050
critical to ensure that that transition
 

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.680
critical to ensure that that transition
from gesture to the animation is

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:27.690
from gesture to the animation is
 

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.480
from gesture to the animation is
seamless so this is my custom property

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:32.490
seamless so this is my custom property
 

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.670
seamless so this is my custom property
and the the whole point of this custom

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:34.680
and the the whole point of this custom
 

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.310
and the the whole point of this custom
property is really just to associate the

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320
property is really just to associate the
 

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.380
property is really just to associate the
animation value with the position of

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:39.390
animation value with the position of
 

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.550
animation value with the position of
that bubble whenever the animation value

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:43.560
that bubble whenever the animation value
 

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.770
that bubble whenever the animation value
changes we get this we get this set

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780
changes we get this we get this set
 

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.350
changes we get this we get this set
value a call with we're then gonna set

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360
value a call with we're then gonna set
 

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.580
value a call with we're then gonna set
that animation value on onto the layout

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:52.590
that animation value on onto the layout
 

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.790
that animation value on onto the layout
params X because that's because the view

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:55.800
params X because that's because the view
 

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.400
params X because that's because the view
is animating you know application

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:58.410
is animating you know application
 

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.080
is animating you know application
overlay window and then we're gonna have

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.090
overlay window and then we're gonna have
 

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.170
overlay window and then we're gonna have
have the window manager updating you

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:03.180
have the window manager updating you
 

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.690
have the window manager updating you
layout to reflect the change and then

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700
layout to reflect the change and then
 

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.510
layout to reflect the change and then
similarly you can get value we're just

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520
similarly you can get value we're just
 

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.760
similarly you can get value we're just
going to return the layout prime star X

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:12.770
going to return the layout prime star X
 

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.340
going to return the layout prime star X
that's me thank you next up is the

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:16.350
that's me thank you next up is the
 

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.430
that's me thank you next up is the
transitions API now the transitions are

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440
transitions API now the transitions are
 

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.230
transitions API now the transitions are
really about looking at two different

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240
really about looking at two different
 

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.090
really about looking at two different
lights two different layout states and

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100
lights two different layout states and
 

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.880
lights two different layout states and
and saying what has changed between them

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:25.890
and saying what has changed between them
 

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.530
and saying what has changed between them
and how do I create an animation to

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:27.540
and how do I create an animation to
 

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.930
and how do I create an animation to
animate those changes so really you can

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940
animate those changes so really you can
 

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.850
animate those changes so really you can
think of transitions as like a factory

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860
think of transitions as like a factory
 

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.070
think of transitions as like a factory
for creating animators based on those

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080
for creating animators based on those
 

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.520
for creating animators based on those
two inputs and while ago I might have to

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:37.530
two inputs and while ago I might have to
 

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.750
two inputs and while ago I might have to
up here and talked about how it's great

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760
up here and talked about how it's great
 

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.010
up here and talked about how it's great
for doing things like this we can have

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.020
for doing things like this we can have
 

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.510
for doing things like this we can have
two different trend and transition

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520
two different trend and transition
 

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.310
two different trend and transition
constraint sets and using transition

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320
constraint sets and using transition
 

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.230
constraint sets and using transition
manager but I think like this use case

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240
manager but I think like this use case
 

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.090
manager but I think like this use case
is actually better solved by a motion

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.100
is actually better solved by a motion
 

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.620
is actually better solved by a motion
layout so I wouldn't consider this a

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:48.630
layout so I wouldn't consider this a
 

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.810

good use anymore it did still have some

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820
good use anymore it did still have some
 

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.159
good use anymore it did still have some
good things going for it

00:19:52.159 --> 00:19:52.169
good things going for it
 

00:19:52.169 --> 00:19:53.749
good things going for it
this is probably one of my absolute

00:19:53.749 --> 00:19:53.759
this is probably one of my absolute
 

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:55.729
this is probably one of my absolute
favorite Android api's and transition

00:19:55.729 --> 00:19:55.739
favorite Android api's and transition
 

00:19:55.739 --> 00:19:57.470
favorite Android api's and transition
manager begin to late transition is like

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480
manager begin to late transition is like
 

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.479
manager begin to late transition is like
deceptively simple but you call this and

00:19:59.479 --> 00:19:59.489
deceptively simple but you call this and
 

00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:00.649
deceptively simple but you call this and
then you make some changes to the view

00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:00.659
then you make some changes to the view
 

00:20:00.659 --> 00:20:03.320
then you make some changes to the view
hierarchy and magic happens and that

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:03.330
hierarchy and magic happens and that
 

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.419
hierarchy and magic happens and that
magic is exactly what we just talked

00:20:05.419 --> 00:20:05.429
magic is exactly what we just talked
 

00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:06.680
magic is exactly what we just talked
about it looks at those two different

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:06.690
about it looks at those two different
 

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.330
about it looks at those two different
states of the UI works out what's

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340
states of the UI works out what's
 

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.310
states of the UI works out what's
changed creates an animator runs those

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320
changed creates an animator runs those
 

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.440
changed creates an animator runs those
animations so simple there's also an

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:12.450
animations so simple there's also an
 

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.430
animations so simple there's also an
overload we can control those

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440
overload we can control those
 

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.769
overload we can control those
transitions the other thing I really

00:20:15.769 --> 00:20:15.779
transitions the other thing I really
 

00:20:15.779 --> 00:20:17.330
transitions the other thing I really
love about transitions is that the what

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340
love about transitions is that the what
 

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.830
love about transitions is that the what
it does to the shape of your code base

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840
it does to the shape of your code base
 

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.289
it does to the shape of your code base
and so for example here's a change where

00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299
and so for example here's a change where
 

00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:23.509
and so for example here's a change where
I moved a bunch of code out of the view

00:20:23.509 --> 00:20:23.519
I moved a bunch of code out of the view
 

00:20:23.519 --> 00:20:25.940
I moved a bunch of code out of the view
layer into transitions so you when

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:25.950
layer into transitions so you when
 

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.259
layer into transitions so you when
you're doing animations sometimes your

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:27.269
you're doing animations sometimes your
 

00:20:27.269 --> 00:20:28.999
you're doing animations sometimes your
code can look a bit gnarly like this so

00:20:28.999 --> 00:20:29.009
code can look a bit gnarly like this so
 

00:20:29.009 --> 00:20:30.440
code can look a bit gnarly like this so
you're doing a lot of you look up stuff

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:30.450
you're doing a lot of you look up stuff
 

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.999
you're doing a lot of you look up stuff
adding pre-draw listeners and like

00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:32.009
adding pre-draw listeners and like
 

00:20:32.009 --> 00:20:33.619
adding pre-draw listeners and like
poking around to the view hierarchy and

00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:33.629
poking around to the view hierarchy and
 

00:20:33.629 --> 00:20:36.109
poking around to the view hierarchy and
by moving it to transitions we ended up

00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:36.119
by moving it to transitions we ended up
 

00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:37.489
by moving it to transitions we ended up
moving it to this much more kind of like

00:20:37.489 --> 00:20:37.499
moving it to this much more kind of like
 

00:20:37.499 --> 00:20:39.940
moving it to this much more kind of like
declarative composable architecture so

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:39.950
declarative composable architecture so
 

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:42.259
declarative composable architecture so
here I'm using some custom transition as

00:20:42.259 --> 00:20:42.269
here I'm using some custom transition as
 

00:20:42.269 --> 00:20:44.090
here I'm using some custom transition as
I wrote as well as compose with some of

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100
I wrote as well as compose with some of
 

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.409
I wrote as well as compose with some of
the framework transitions in order to

00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:45.419
the framework transitions in order to
 

00:20:45.419 --> 00:20:46.700
the framework transitions in order to
achieve the same behavior but in this

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:46.710
achieve the same behavior but in this
 

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.519
achieve the same behavior but in this
more composable manner so yes you might

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:49.529
more composable manner so yes you might
 

00:20:49.529 --> 00:20:51.289
more composable manner so yes you might
have to write some and some transitions

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:51.299
have to write some and some transitions
 

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:52.580
have to write some and some transitions
yourself like so here's one I have to

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:52.590
yourself like so here's one I have to
 

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.889
yourself like so here's one I have to
write to do a circular reveal but and

00:20:54.889 --> 00:20:54.899
write to do a circular reveal but and
 

00:20:54.899 --> 00:20:58.220
write to do a circular reveal but and
that code ends up being much more and I

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:58.230
that code ends up being much more and I
 

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.200
that code ends up being much more and I
don't know like nicer to work with and

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:00.210
don't know like nicer to work with and
 

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.029
don't know like nicer to work with and
much more focused and and I found it

00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039
much more focused and and I found it
 

00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:03.529
much more focused and and I found it
like a really good change to the code

00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:03.539
like a really good change to the code
 

00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:06.259
like a really good change to the code
base so transitions when should you use

00:21:06.259 --> 00:21:06.269
base so transitions when should you use
 

00:21:06.269 --> 00:21:07.999
base so transitions when should you use
them but for me there's actually one

00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:08.009
them but for me there's actually one
 

00:21:08.009 --> 00:21:09.560
them but for me there's actually one
really strong use case which is shared

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:09.570
really strong use case which is shared
 

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.269
really strong use case which is shared
element transitions between activities

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279
element transitions between activities
 

00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:13.639
element transitions between activities
or fragments and so it's pretty much the

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:13.649
or fragments and so it's pretty much the
 

00:21:13.649 --> 00:21:15.769
or fragments and so it's pretty much the
only thing you can use to achieve this

00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:15.779
only thing you can use to achieve this
 

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:18.129
only thing you can use to achieve this
and as you go like super custom and so

00:21:18.129 --> 00:21:18.139
and as you go like super custom and so
 

00:21:18.139 --> 00:21:20.239
and as you go like super custom and so
that is the use case for transitions

00:21:20.239 --> 00:21:20.249
that is the use case for transitions
 

00:21:20.249 --> 00:21:21.710
that is the use case for transitions
there's actually two transitions going

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720
there's actually two transitions going
 

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.299
there's actually two transitions going
on here there's the shared element which

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:23.309
on here there's the shared element which
 

00:21:23.309 --> 00:21:25.070
on here there's the shared element which
is between the two activities we see

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080
is between the two activities we see
 

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.899
is between the two activities we see
here and then once the details activity

00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:26.909
here and then once the details activity
 

00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:29.029
here and then once the details activity
launches and there's actually a window

00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039
launches and there's actually a window
 

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.159
launches and there's actually a window
content transition which is when the

00:21:31.159 --> 00:21:31.169
content transition which is when the
 

00:21:31.169 --> 00:21:33.560
content transition which is when the
window launches or when exits run this

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:33.570
window launches or when exits run this
 

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.359
window launches or when exits run this
and transition run these animations on

00:21:35.359 --> 00:21:35.369
and transition run these animations on
 

00:21:35.369 --> 00:21:36.590
and transition run these animations on
the content so when you see it come in

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600
the content so when you see it come in
 

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.299
the content so when you see it come in
here when the view arrives the rest of

00:21:38.299 --> 00:21:38.309
here when the view arrives the rest of
 

00:21:38.309 --> 00:21:40.039
here when the view arrives the rest of
the content animates upwards that's a

00:21:40.039 --> 00:21:40.049
the content animates upwards that's a
 

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:43.279
the content animates upwards that's a
window kind of transition so when should

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:43.289
window kind of transition so when should
 

00:21:43.289 --> 00:21:45.590
window kind of transition so when should
you use transition API and two shared

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600
you use transition API and two shared
 

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.849
you use transition API and two shared
elements for me is a really really

00:21:46.849 --> 00:21:46.859
elements for me is a really really
 

00:21:46.859 --> 00:21:49.070
elements for me is a really really
strong use case and window continent and

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080
strong use case and window continent and
 

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.349
strong use case and window continent and
enter and exits and also if you're

00:21:51.349 --> 00:21:51.359
enter and exits and also if you're
 

00:21:51.359 --> 00:21:52.999
enter and exits and also if you're
really looking to like modular eyes and

00:21:52.999 --> 00:21:53.009
really looking to like modular eyes and
 

00:21:53.009 --> 00:21:54.830
really looking to like modular eyes and
compose your animation code then

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840
compose your animation code then
 

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.149
compose your animation code then
transitions could be really helpful as

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159
transitions could be really helpful as
 

00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:58.310
transitions could be really helpful as
well as simple changes using that begin

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320
well as simple changes using that begin
 

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.950
well as simple changes using that begin
delayed method so and yeah transitions

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960
delayed method so and yeah transitions
 

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.589
delayed method so and yeah transitions
is definitely sort of a use case motion

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:03.599
is definitely sort of a use case motion
 

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:05.800
is definitely sort of a use case motion

all right so so far we've been talking a

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:09.420
all right so so far we've been talking a
 

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.050
all right so so far we've been talking a
lot about coding right and the nice

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:12.060
lot about coding right and the nice
 

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.550
lot about coding right and the nice
thing with coding is that it's super

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:13.560
thing with coding is that it's super
 

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.500
thing with coding is that it's super
powerful you can do a lot of things the

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:15.510
powerful you can do a lot of things the
 

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.410
powerful you can do a lot of things the
api's are really really complete on the

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:18.420
api's are really really complete on the
 

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.060
api's are really really complete on the
other hand it's also quite

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:20.070
other hand it's also quite
 

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.580
other hand it's also quite
time-consuming so you know taking my hat

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:22.590
time-consuming so you know taking my hat
 

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.770
time-consuming so you know taking my hat

make particularly for motion we want to
 

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.420
make particularly for motion we want to
make the motion design a lot more

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:38.430
make the motion design a lot more

accessible so one one thing that we

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:41.310
accessible so one one thing that we
 

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.950
accessible so one one thing that we
introduced recently in constraint here

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960

show up on screen but they are here to
help you create those layouts so to

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400
help you create those layouts so to
 

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.430
help you create those layouts so to
basically bring additional concepts to

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440
basically bring additional concepts to
 

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.930
basically bring additional concepts to
make it easier and in 2.0 we expose them

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940
make it easier and in 2.0 we expose them
 

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.270
make it easier and in 2.0 we expose them
completely so you can yourself create

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:14.280
completely so you can yourself create
 

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.820
completely so you can yourself create
helpers just by you know inheriting the

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:16.830
helpers just by you know inheriting the
 

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.890
helpers just by you know inheriting the
class and what's great is that it's a

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900
class and what's great is that it's a
 

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.990
class and what's great is that it's a
way of encapsulating a behavior in code

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000
way of encapsulating a behavior in code
 

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.540
way of encapsulating a behavior in code
and you know putting into a helper

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:23.550
and you know putting into a helper
 

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.820
and you know putting into a helper
we support the use of a personal read

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:25.830
we support the use of a personal read
 

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.890
we support the use of a personal read
studio so it's very easy to add widget

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900
studio so it's very easy to add widget
 

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.410
studio so it's very easy to add widget
to those helpers to help us reference or

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:30.420
to those helpers to help us reference or
 

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.060
to those helpers to help us reference or
switch jets and you can you can think

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:32.070
switch jets and you can you can think
 

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.750
switch jets and you can you can think
about it as a way of tagging those with

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760
about it as a way of tagging those with
 

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.720
about it as a way of tagging those with
jets with a specific behavior so in the

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:38.730
jets with a specific behavior so in the
 

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.400
jets with a specific behavior so in the
case of animation that's really nice

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:40.410
case of animation that's really nice
 

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.490
case of animation that's really nice
because you know you get the code you

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500
because you know you get the code you
 

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.470
because you know you get the code you
had your helper built on top of this

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480
had your helper built on top of this
 

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.840
had your helper built on top of this
code and we got all the wealth of the

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:47.850
code and we got all the wealth of the
 

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.330
code and we got all the wealth of the
Android animation API s and you can do

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340
Android animation API s and you can do
 

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.950
Android animation API s and you can do
stuff like that right so for example

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960
stuff like that right so for example
 

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.320
stuff like that right so for example
circular reveal you know pretty

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:54.330
circular reveal you know pretty
 

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.810
circular reveal you know pretty
well-known animation the only thing I

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820
well-known animation the only thing I
 

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.910
well-known animation the only thing I
really needed to do here is to define

00:23:58.910 --> 00:23:58.920
really needed to do here is to define
 

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.680
really needed to do here is to define
this piece of code and really what I'm

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:00.690
this piece of code and really what I'm
 

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:01.310
this piece of code and really what I'm
talking about

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320
talking about
 

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.240
talking about
yeah okay what I can you know what I

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:05.250
yeah okay what I can you know what I
 

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.750
yeah okay what I can you know what I
only need to do here is this code in

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760
only need to do here is this code in
 

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.370
only need to do here is this code in
that you see on the screen

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380
that you see on the screen
 

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.410
that you see on the screen
I'm simply calling the view animation

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:12.420
I'm simply calling the view animation
 

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.900
I'm simply calling the view animation
utils create circular River so I'm not

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:14.910
utils create circular River so I'm not
 

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.570
utils create circular River so I'm not
reinventing the wheel here and

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:16.580
reinventing the wheel here and
 

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.570
reinventing the wheel here and
not coming up with my new new way of

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:19.580
not coming up with my new new way of
 

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.970
not coming up with my new new way of
doing secure reveal but that's the only

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:21.980
doing secure reveal but that's the only
 

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.380
doing secure reveal but that's the only
thing I need to do for my helper and

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:23.390
thing I need to do for my helper and
 

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.110
thing I need to do for my helper and
then in your layered file you only need

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:26.120
then in your layered file you only need
 

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.860
then in your layered file you only need
to declare that helper and specify the

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:29.870
to declare that helper and specify the
 

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.340
to declare that helper and specify the
IDS of the widgets you want to apply to

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:33.350
IDS of the widgets you want to apply to
 

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:37.450
IDS of the widgets you want to apply to
so it makes basically it's a lot easier

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:37.460
so it makes basically it's a lot easier
 

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.000
so it makes basically it's a lot easier
for you to package blocks of reusable

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.010
for you to package blocks of reusable
 

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.149
for you to package blocks of reusable
code and and and you know use them in

00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159
code and and and you know use them in
 

00:24:43.159 --> 00:24:46.389
code and and and you know use them in
your application so going back to the

00:24:46.389 --> 00:24:46.399
your application so going back to the
 

00:24:46.399 --> 00:24:49.779
your application so going back to the
code stuff so the other way that we

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:49.789
code stuff so the other way that we
 

00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:52.180
code stuff so the other way that we
thought about making your life easier

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:52.190
thought about making your life easier
 

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.399
thought about making your life easier
beyond you know letting you build those

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:54.409
beyond you know letting you build those
 

00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:57.460
beyond you know letting you build those
reusable bricks is by moving to

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:57.470
reusable bricks is by moving to
 

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:01.180
reusable bricks is by moving to
decorative way for animation so you can

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:01.190
decorative way for animation so you can
 

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.070
decorative way for animation so you can
think about it as a specification for

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080
think about it as a specification for
 

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.730
think about it as a specification for
motion and we interpret this

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:06.740
motion and we interpret this
 

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.399
motion and we interpret this
specification with a motion engine and

00:25:09.399 --> 00:25:09.409
specification with a motion engine and
 

00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:11.799
specification with a motion engine and
on top of that we are building a

00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:11.809
on top of that we are building a
 

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:14.230
on top of that we are building a
graphical motion editor so it's

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240
graphical motion editor so it's
 

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.509
graphical motion editor so it's
something we introduced at Google i/o we

00:25:16.509 --> 00:25:16.519
something we introduced at Google i/o we
 

00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:18.340
something we introduced at Google i/o we
are still working on it we decided to

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:18.350
are still working on it we decided to
 

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.870
are still working on it we decided to
focus those last few months on the

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880
focus those last few months on the
 

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.759
focus those last few months on the
library side let's implement this motion

00:25:21.759 --> 00:25:21.769
library side let's implement this motion
 

00:25:21.769 --> 00:25:23.950
library side let's implement this motion
engine because we cannot want to make

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:23.960
engine because we cannot want to make
 

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.200
engine because we cannot want to make
sure that it's right for you and for

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:26.210
sure that it's right for you and for
 

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:30.879
sure that it's right for you and for
units but just a quick overview on the

00:25:30.879 --> 00:25:30.889
units but just a quick overview on the
 

00:25:30.889 --> 00:25:33.340
units but just a quick overview on the
chrome build it's coming along and

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:33.350
chrome build it's coming along and
 

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.690
chrome build it's coming along and
hopefully it will come soon

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:34.700
hopefully it will come soon
 

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.379
hopefully it will come soon
in Canary version of Android studio but

00:25:38.379 --> 00:25:38.389
in Canary version of Android studio but
 

00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:39.789
in Canary version of Android studio but
essentially we want to make sure that

00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799
essentially we want to make sure that
 

00:25:39.799 --> 00:25:41.470
essentially we want to make sure that
the concept in the libraries are right

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480
the concept in the libraries are right
 

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.799
the concept in the libraries are right
before kind of reducing the troll so

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:44.809
before kind of reducing the troll so
 

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:46.299
before kind of reducing the troll so
that's kind of like the overall approach

00:25:46.299 --> 00:25:46.309
that's kind of like the overall approach
 

00:25:46.309 --> 00:25:49.419
that's kind of like the overall approach
we have for helping you so the help

00:25:49.419 --> 00:25:49.429
we have for helping you so the help
 

00:25:49.429 --> 00:25:51.730
we have for helping you so the help
button one and and this motion

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:51.740
button one and and this motion
 

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.049
button one and and this motion
specification on the other the the thing

00:25:56.049 --> 00:25:56.059
specification on the other the the thing
 

00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:58.240
specification on the other the the thing
that's kind of nice if I look at this in

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:58.250
that's kind of nice if I look at this in
 

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:02.230
that's kind of nice if I look at this in
particular is that you can specify this

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240
particular is that you can specify this
 

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.320
particular is that you can specify this
motion and will then take care of it you

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:05.330
motion and will then take care of it you
 

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.509
motion and will then take care of it you
don't really have to write code for it

00:26:07.509 --> 00:26:07.519
don't really have to write code for it
 

00:26:07.519 --> 00:26:09.930
don't really have to write code for it
it's it's really completely declarative

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:09.940
it's it's really completely declarative
 

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.940
it's it's really completely declarative
so the one way right now that we

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:12.950
so the one way right now that we
 

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.950
so the one way right now that we
implemented this motion spec is through

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960
implemented this motion spec is through
 

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.750
implemented this motion spec is through
motion the ads so what is motion layout

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760
motion the ads so what is motion layout
 

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.810
motion the ads so what is motion layout
it's it's a view group so one caveat is

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:19.820
it's it's a view group so one caveat is
 

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.090
it's it's a view group so one caveat is
that it means you can only animate the

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:22.100
that it means you can only animate the
 

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.000
that it means you can only animate the
children of that view group and it's a

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.010
children of that view group and it's a
 

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.529
children of that view group and it's a
subclass of construct yet so if you know

00:26:26.529 --> 00:26:26.539
subclass of construct yet so if you know
 

00:26:26.539 --> 00:26:27.909
subclass of construct yet so if you know
constantly art it's great you can

00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919
constantly art it's great you can
 

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:28.989
constantly art it's great you can
directly

00:26:28.989 --> 00:26:28.999
directly
 

00:26:28.999 --> 00:26:31.449
directly
use motion mayor 20 mature existing

00:26:31.449 --> 00:26:31.459
use motion mayor 20 mature existing
 

00:26:31.459 --> 00:26:33.279
use motion mayor 20 mature existing
constraint layouts on the flip side you

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:33.289
constraint layouts on the flip side you
 

00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:34.899
constraint layouts on the flip side you
do have to know how to use constraint

00:26:34.899 --> 00:26:34.909
do have to know how to use constraint
 

00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:38.139
do have to know how to use constraint
layout but it does a lot so if we do

00:26:38.139 --> 00:26:38.149
layout but it does a lot so if we do
 

00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:40.089
layout but it does a lot so if we do
layout transitions we interpolate

00:26:40.089 --> 00:26:40.099
layout transitions we interpolate
 

00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:43.449
layout transitions we interpolate
properties as well we we have a really

00:26:43.449 --> 00:26:43.459
properties as well we we have a really
 

00:26:43.459 --> 00:26:46.779
properties as well we we have a really
powerful support for touch driven motion

00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:46.789
powerful support for touch driven motion
 

00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:49.659
powerful support for touch driven motion
so it's kind of like taking a little bit

00:26:49.659 --> 00:26:49.669
so it's kind of like taking a little bit
 

00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:52.769
so it's kind of like taking a little bit
of values areas of animation and

00:26:52.769 --> 00:26:52.779
of values areas of animation and
 

00:26:52.779 --> 00:26:56.429
of values areas of animation and
packaging it into a single place so

00:26:56.429 --> 00:26:56.439
packaging it into a single place so
 

00:26:56.439 --> 00:26:59.019
packaging it into a single place so
roughly speaking the only thing you have

00:26:59.019 --> 00:26:59.029
roughly speaking the only thing you have
 

00:26:59.029 --> 00:27:01.839
roughly speaking the only thing you have
to understand is we are animating

00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:01.849
to understand is we are animating
 

00:27:01.849 --> 00:27:03.819
to understand is we are animating
between two states we have a start state

00:27:03.819 --> 00:27:03.829
between two states we have a start state
 

00:27:03.829 --> 00:27:07.659
between two states we have a start state
and an end state and we just interpolate

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:07.669
and an end state and we just interpolate
 

00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:10.779
and an end state and we just interpolate
between those two things so in addition

00:27:10.779 --> 00:27:10.789
between those two things so in addition
 

00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:14.499
between those two things so in addition
to basically supporting layout changes

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:14.509
to basically supporting layout changes
 

00:27:14.509 --> 00:27:16.029
to basically supporting layout changes
so essentially if you have two versions

00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039
so essentially if you have two versions
 

00:27:16.039 --> 00:27:17.649
so essentially if you have two versions
of the layout or to go from one to

00:27:17.649 --> 00:27:17.659
of the layout or to go from one to
 

00:27:17.659 --> 00:27:20.879
of the layout or to go from one to
another we also see bought you know

00:27:20.879 --> 00:27:20.889
another we also see bought you know
 

00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:23.499
another we also see bought you know
custom properties so for example if you

00:27:23.499 --> 00:27:23.509
custom properties so for example if you
 

00:27:23.509 --> 00:27:25.239
custom properties so for example if you
want to animate colors and we also

00:27:25.239 --> 00:27:25.249
want to animate colors and we also
 

00:27:25.249 --> 00:27:27.489
want to animate colors and we also
support the concept of keyframes and you

00:27:27.489 --> 00:27:27.499
support the concept of keyframes and you
 

00:27:27.499 --> 00:27:29.649
support the concept of keyframes and you
can think about keyframe as essentially

00:27:29.649 --> 00:27:29.659
can think about keyframe as essentially
 

00:27:29.659 --> 00:27:33.519
can think about keyframe as essentially
a modifier on that you know transform

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:33.529
a modifier on that you know transform
 

00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:37.059
a modifier on that you know transform
between the start and the end so to kind

00:27:37.059 --> 00:27:37.069
between the start and the end so to kind
 

00:27:37.069 --> 00:27:40.599
between the start and the end so to kind
of summarize we motion layout it's it

00:27:40.599 --> 00:27:40.609
of summarize we motion layout it's it
 

00:27:40.609 --> 00:27:43.389
of summarize we motion layout it's it
allows you to think about your animation

00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:43.399
allows you to think about your animation
 

00:27:43.399 --> 00:27:45.819
allows you to think about your animation
your transition your motion as a

00:27:45.819 --> 00:27:45.829
your transition your motion as a
 

00:27:45.829 --> 00:27:48.609
your transition your motion as a
declaration you just specify what it

00:27:48.609 --> 00:27:48.619
declaration you just specify what it
 

00:27:48.619 --> 00:27:51.249
declaration you just specify what it
should do and we take care of it it

00:27:51.249 --> 00:27:51.259
should do and we take care of it it
 

00:27:51.259 --> 00:27:53.529
should do and we take care of it it
specifically is great when you want to

00:27:53.529 --> 00:27:53.539
specifically is great when you want to
 

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:56.529
specifically is great when you want to
do fine tuned animation what we call

00:27:56.529 --> 00:27:56.539
do fine tuned animation what we call
 

00:27:56.539 --> 00:27:58.809
do fine tuned animation what we call
like this book and image bespoke motion

00:27:58.809 --> 00:27:58.819
like this book and image bespoke motion
 

00:27:58.819 --> 00:28:01.359
like this book and image bespoke motion
so where you know it's very specific

00:28:01.359 --> 00:28:01.369
so where you know it's very specific
 

00:28:01.369 --> 00:28:03.339
so where you know it's very specific
what you want to do it's about like

00:28:03.339 --> 00:28:03.349
what you want to do it's about like
 

00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:04.959
what you want to do it's about like
coordinating a bunch of witches together

00:28:04.959 --> 00:28:04.969
coordinating a bunch of witches together
 

00:28:04.969 --> 00:28:07.359
coordinating a bunch of witches together
in a very specific way and finally it's

00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:07.369
in a very specific way and finally it's
 

00:28:07.369 --> 00:28:09.759
in a very specific way and finally it's
really nice as well for the touch Riven

00:28:09.759 --> 00:28:09.769
really nice as well for the touch Riven
 

00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:19.859
really nice as well for the touch Riven
motion I don't think I need to make yeah

00:28:19.859 --> 00:28:19.869
motion I don't think I need to make yeah
 

00:28:19.869 --> 00:28:23.709
motion I don't think I need to make yeah
so I want to just kind of like show you

00:28:23.709 --> 00:28:23.719
so I want to just kind of like show you
 

00:28:23.719 --> 00:28:25.929
so I want to just kind of like show you
guys though a lot of things and it'll be

00:28:25.929 --> 00:28:25.939
guys though a lot of things and it'll be
 

00:28:25.939 --> 00:28:29.709
guys though a lot of things and it'll be
a little more visual from here on n so

00:28:29.709 --> 00:28:29.719
a little more visual from here on n so
 

00:28:29.719 --> 00:28:32.669
a little more visual from here on n so
this is where you want to create a

00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:32.679
this is where you want to create a
 

00:28:32.679 --> 00:28:39.490
this is where you want to create a
carefully crafted custom coordinated

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:39.500
carefully crafted custom coordinated
 

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.680
carefully crafted custom coordinated
yeah crazy-cool animation you can do

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:44.690
yeah crazy-cool animation you can do
 

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:53.230
yeah crazy-cool animation you can do
stuff like that so so how did it be do

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240
stuff like that so so how did it be do
 

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:58.899
stuff like that so so how did it be do
that it's just two by two chains the

00:28:58.899 --> 00:28:58.909
that it's just two by two chains the
 

00:28:58.909 --> 00:29:01.720
that it's just two by two chains the
change into one chain and each letters

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:01.730
change into one chain and each letters
 

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.200
change into one chain and each letters
of U and then we use the stagger and a

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:05.210
of U and then we use the stagger and a
 

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.510
of U and then we use the stagger and a
color change in a custom attribute it's

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520
color change in a custom attribute it's
 

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.210
color change in a custom attribute it's
fairly simple to build it took me a few

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:10.220
fairly simple to build it took me a few
 

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.640
fairly simple to build it took me a few
minutes at it it looks cool and that's

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:12.650
minutes at it it looks cool and that's
 

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.230
minutes at it it looks cool and that's
kind of what what this stuff is all

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240
kind of what what this stuff is all
 

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.940
kind of what what this stuff is all
about so the first thing you can drive

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:18.950
about so the first thing you can drive
 

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:22.539
about so the first thing you can drive
our stuff with touch essentially it will

00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:22.549
our stuff with touch essentially it will
 

00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:24.640
our stuff with touch essentially it will
handle swipes if you flick it won't go

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:24.650
handle swipes if you flick it won't go
 

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.460
handle swipes if you flick it won't go
across quickly it understands the

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:27.470
across quickly it understands the
 

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:32.560
across quickly it understands the
velocity and and manages that the next

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:32.570
velocity and and manages that the next
 

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.960
velocity and and manages that the next
thing to understand is we're starting

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:34.970
thing to understand is we're starting
 

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.730
thing to understand is we're starting
from two constraint sets but we have

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:36.740
from two constraint sets but we have
 

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.850
from two constraint sets but we have
keyframes and in this case here I'm

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:39.860
keyframes and in this case here I'm
 

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.770
keyframes and in this case here I'm
starting with two constraint sets and

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:41.780
starting with two constraint sets and
 

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.830
starting with two constraint sets and
I'm not having any keyframes and you see

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840
I'm not having any keyframes and you see
 

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.770
I'm not having any keyframes and you see
how it crosses right there right there

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:47.780
how it crosses right there right there
 

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.440
how it crosses right there right there
they overlap so what you do is you add

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:50.450
they overlap so what you do is you add
 

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:52.630
they overlap so what you do is you add
some key position

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640
some key position
 

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.529
some key position
keyframes and you accelerate in the X

00:29:56.529 --> 00:29:56.539
keyframes and you accelerate in the X
 

00:29:56.539 --> 00:29:59.260
keyframes and you accelerate in the X
you finish the X part of the motion and

00:29:59.260 --> 00:29:59.270
you finish the X part of the motion and
 

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.250
you finish the X part of the motion and
halfway through and that gives you a

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:02.260
halfway through and that gives you a
 

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.830
halfway through and that gives you a
kind of smooth you know use you can have

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840
kind of smooth you know use you can have
 

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.740
kind of smooth you know use you can have
seen this it's your settings menu so the

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:11.750
seen this it's your settings menu so the
 

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.140
seen this it's your settings menu so the
more extreme end of what we can do with

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.150
more extreme end of what we can do with
 

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.840
more extreme end of what we can do with
with keyframes our key cycles and here

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:16.850
with keyframes our key cycles and here
 

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.940
with keyframes our key cycles and here
you can see a bunch of different kind of

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:18.950
you can see a bunch of different kind of
 

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.340
you can see a bunch of different kind of
effects that we can do essentially

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:21.350
effects that we can do essentially
 

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:23.740
effects that we can do essentially
anything that's oscillating it's shaking

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:23.750
anything that's oscillating it's shaking
 

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.289
anything that's oscillating it's shaking
or it's bouncing around you don't want

00:30:26.289 --> 00:30:26.299
or it's bouncing around you don't want
 

00:30:26.299 --> 00:30:28.690
or it's bouncing around you don't want
to actually go and build out complex

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:28.700
to actually go and build out complex
 

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.510
to actually go and build out complex
paths with keyframes this solves it and

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520
paths with keyframes this solves it and
 

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.680
paths with keyframes this solves it and
then in alpha 2 we introduce time cycles

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:35.690
then in alpha 2 we introduce time cycles
 

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:36.970
then in alpha 2 we introduce time cycles
and and this is a kind of a crazy

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:36.980
and and this is a kind of a crazy
 

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.930
and and this is a kind of a crazy
animation you can do with it of course

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:40.940
animation you can do with it of course
 

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.419
animation you can do with it of course
this is way too over-the-top and please

00:30:43.419 --> 00:30:43.429
this is way too over-the-top and please
 

00:30:43.429 --> 00:30:48.570
this is way too over-the-top and please
don't use this in product

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:48.580
 

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:53.560
but so let's get into how to use it

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:53.570
but so let's get into how to use it
 

00:30:53.570 --> 00:31:00.430
but so let's get into how to use it
right so thank you so first of all there

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440
right so thank you so first of all there
 

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.590
right so thank you so first of all there
is a bunch of documentation that we

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600
is a bunch of documentation that we
 

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.570
is a bunch of documentation that we
created so I'm going to pass quickly but

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:04.580
created so I'm going to pass quickly but
 

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.250
created so I'm going to pass quickly but
no please look at those articles there's

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:06.260
no please look at those articles there's
 

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.530
no please look at those articles there's
also a github with example so look at

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:08.540
also a github with example so look at
 

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.770
also a github with example so look at
that but one thing you you may ask

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:11.780
that but one thing you you may ask
 

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.240
that but one thing you you may ask
yourself is that okay this is all great

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:13.250
yourself is that okay this is all great
 

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.310
yourself is that okay this is all great
but how do I use that in my application

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:15.320
but how do I use that in my application
 

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.080
but how do I use that in my application
do I have to restart everything from

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:17.090
do I have to restart everything from
 

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.560
do I have to restart everything from
scratch

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:17.570
scratch
 

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.720
scratch
not quite now this is an example here

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:19.730
not quite now this is an example here
 

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.420
not quite now this is an example here
where you have a collapsible toolbar in

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:22.430
where you have a collapsible toolbar in
 

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.060
where you have a collapsible toolbar in
a coordinator layout and and to do these

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:25.070
a coordinator layout and and to do these
 

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.710
a coordinator layout and and to do these
kind of things with the normal

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720
kind of things with the normal
 

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.210
kind of things with the normal
collapsible toolbar it's a bit annoying

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:28.220
collapsible toolbar it's a bit annoying
 

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.430
collapsible toolbar it's a bit annoying
you have to do it in code etc etc you

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440
you have to do it in code etc etc you
 

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.220
you have to do it in code etc etc you
can simply use a motion layout instead

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:33.230
can simply use a motion layout instead
 

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.260
can simply use a motion layout instead
so you still use coordinate or a yacht

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:35.270
so you still use coordinate or a yacht
 

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:36.610
so you still use coordinate or a yacht
you don't really change anything else in

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:36.620
you don't really change anything else in
 

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.350
you don't really change anything else in
your code but the collapsible toolbar

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360
your code but the collapsible toolbar
 

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.840
your code but the collapsible toolbar
becomes emotionally out and take all the

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:40.850
becomes emotionally out and take all the
 

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.020
becomes emotionally out and take all the
advantages of it similarly if you have a

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.030
advantages of it similarly if you have a
 

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.430
advantages of it similarly if you have a
drawer layout you don't have to use the

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440
drawer layout you don't have to use the
 

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.350
drawer layout you don't have to use the
menu class you can use a code sorry

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360
menu class you can use a code sorry
 

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.330
menu class you can use a code sorry
motion layout for it and do anything

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:49.340
motion layout for it and do anything
 

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:49.980
motion layout for it and do anything
crazy

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:49.990
crazy
 

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.320
crazy
same thing for view pager you can easily

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:53.330
same thing for view pager you can easily
 

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.620
same thing for view pager you can easily
plug motion layout into it the the last

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:56.630
plug motion layout into it the the last
 

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.890
plug motion layout into it the the last
example is interesting it's really looks

00:31:59.890 --> 00:31:59.900
example is interesting it's really looks
 

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.170
example is interesting it's really looks
like coordinator layout but actually

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:02.180
like coordinator layout but actually
 

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.140
like coordinator layout but actually
this is pure motion layout and what's

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:05.150
this is pure motion layout and what's
 

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:08.860
this is pure motion layout and what's
nice about it is that it actually is two

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:08.870
nice about it is that it actually is two
 

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:11.830
nice about it is that it actually is two
motion layout nested and we have one for

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840
motion layout nested and we have one for
 

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.600
motion layout nested and we have one for
the collapsible toolbar it's in fact

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:13.610
the collapsible toolbar it's in fact
 

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:16.150
the collapsible toolbar it's in fact
it's exactly the same one I used before

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:16.160
it's exactly the same one I used before
 

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.510
it's exactly the same one I used before
for the control layout example and it's

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:19.520
for the control layout example and it's
 

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.490
for the control layout example and it's
simply nested into an outer motion

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:21.500
simply nested into an outer motion
 

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:25.030
simply nested into an outer motion
layout and what's really nice is that in

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:25.040
layout and what's really nice is that in
 

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.840
layout and what's really nice is that in
order to specify or the this overall

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:28.850
order to specify or the this overall
 

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:31.600

screen gives I just need to create those

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:31.610
screen gives I just need to create those
 

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:34.150

two states the Staton and you see that

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:34.160
two states the Staton and you see that
 

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.670
two states the Staton and you see that
in the end I bring up a fab and I simply

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:36.680
in the end I bring up a fab and I simply
 

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.150
in the end I bring up a fab and I simply
make the the the motion layout that's

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:40.160
make the the the motion layout that's
 

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.950
make the the the motion layout that's
for the toolbar a little smaller and

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960
for the toolbar a little smaller and
 

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.280
for the toolbar a little smaller and
basically we take care of all of it

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:44.290
basically we take care of all of it
 

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:47.350
basically we take care of all of it
so to summarize for the current state

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360
so to summarize for the current state
 

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.600
so to summarize for the current state
we're still working on the graphical

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:49.610
we're still working on the graphical
 

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.640
we're still working on the graphical
editor but for the library we released

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:51.650
editor but for the library we released
 

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:55.870
editor but for the library we released
it already at Google i/o and since then

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880
it already at Google i/o and since then
 

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.460
it already at Google i/o and since then
we did an alpha 2 with a few more

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:57.470
we did an alpha 2 with a few more
 

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:58.810
we did an alpha 2 with a few more
properties

00:32:58.810 --> 00:32:58.820
properties
 

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.390
properties
and you know even for its in alpha it's

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:01.400
and you know even for its in alpha it's
 

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.010
and you know even for its in alpha it's
actually built upon constantly at one

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:03.020
actually built upon constantly at one
 

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.660
actually built upon constantly at one
point when so it's actually pretty

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:04.670
point when so it's actually pretty
 

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:08.230
point when so it's actually pretty
stable and in fact because it's pretty

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240
stable and in fact because it's pretty
 

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.930
stable and in fact because it's pretty
stable quite a few people has started to

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:10.940
stable quite a few people has started to
 

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.330
stable quite a few people has started to
build stuff with it and we'll go through

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:13.340
build stuff with it and we'll go through
 

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.070
build stuff with it and we'll go through
some examples just to give you a little

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:15.080
some examples just to give you a little
 

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.140
some examples just to give you a little
taste of what's what you can do with

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:17.150
taste of what's what you can do with
 

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:23.140
taste of what's what you can do with
motion layouts so I looked on the

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:23.150
motion layouts so I looked on the
 

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.090
motion layouts so I looked on the
Twitter a lot I checked

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:25.100
Twitter a lot I checked
 

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.800
Twitter a lot I checked
motion layout on Twitter all the time

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:26.810
motion layout on Twitter all the time
 

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:29.050
motion layout on Twitter all the time
and I I thought I would just share a few

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:29.060
and I I thought I would just share a few
 

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.100
and I I thought I would just share a few
interesting animations that people have

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:33.110
interesting animations that people have
 

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:35.140
interesting animations that people have
published so most of these you can

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:35.150
published so most of these you can
 

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:38.950
published so most of these you can
actually find in github

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960
actually find in github
 

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.830

these people publish them as videos and

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840
these people publish them as videos and
 

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.960
these people publish them as videos and
I've asked all of them to sort of show

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:43.970
I've asked all of them to sort of show

view Pedro did it in motion layout but

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:07.580
view Pedro did it in motion layout but
 

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.810
view Pedro did it in motion layout but
he also added weight to drive it from

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:10.820
he also added weight to drive it from
 

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.390
he also added weight to drive it from
code and that's a very interesting you

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:13.400

going to explore it's a little bit how
 

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.210
going to explore it's a little bit how
can you in code reuse some of this

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:21.220
can you in code reuse some of this
 

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:26.200

the two of them and you notice that it's
 

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.090
the two of them and you notice that it's
super easy to come up with your own ways

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:46.100
super easy to come up with your own ways
 

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.890
super easy to come up with your own ways

and this is our Chris Bane's

00:35:59.900 --> 00:35:59.910
 

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:05.430
and he did a very interesting one and

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440
and he did a very interesting one and
 

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.320
and he did a very interesting one and
it's a whole app it's actually the all

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:07.330
it's a whole app it's actually the all
 

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:11.180
it's a whole app it's actually the all
the codes involved that is out there and

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:11.190
the codes involved that is out there and
 

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:14.430
the codes involved that is out there and
it is very custom so let's take a look a

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:14.440
it is very custom so let's take a look a
 

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.460
it is very custom so let's take a look a
little closer look at it so what's great

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:17.470
little closer look at it so what's great
 

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.220
little closer look at it so what's great
with it is this is the type of motion

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:20.230
with it is this is the type of motion
 

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.620
with it is this is the type of motion
that would be kind of fun going to build

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:22.630
that would be kind of fun going to build
 

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:24.630
that would be kind of fun going to build
purely by code because there's a lot of

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640
purely by code because there's a lot of
 

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.570
purely by code because there's a lot of
subtle coordination across so many

it's all one page one motion layout and

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:22.420
it's all one page one motion layout and
 

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.740
it's all one page one motion layout and
it can produce a fairly sophisticated

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:24.750

view and I've sort of made it look like

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:27.670
view and I've sort of made it look like
 

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.390
view and I've sort of made it look like
a dialer yeah and this entire behavior

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400
a dialer yeah and this entire behavior
 

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.630

this touch behavior zero code from your
hand it's all declarative pretty awesome

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:45.210
hand it's all declarative pretty awesome
 

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:49.289
hand it's all declarative pretty awesome
cool so today well hopefully we've given

00:37:49.289 --> 00:37:49.299
cool so today well hopefully we've given
 

00:37:49.299 --> 00:37:51.539
cool so today well hopefully we've given
you a guided tour through this variety

00:37:51.539 --> 00:37:51.549
you a guided tour through this variety
 

00:37:51.549 --> 00:37:53.579
you a guided tour through this variety
of animation API so that does exist on

00:37:53.579 --> 00:37:53.589
of animation API so that does exist on
 

00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:55.289
of animation API so that does exist on
the platform and our goal was really to

00:37:55.289 --> 00:37:55.299
the platform and our goal was really to
 

00:37:55.299 --> 00:37:57.329
the platform and our goal was really to
make you more familiar with what they're

00:37:57.329 --> 00:37:57.339
make you more familiar with what they're
 

00:37:57.339 --> 00:37:58.529
make you more familiar with what they're
good at and what they're not so good at

00:37:58.529 --> 00:37:58.539
good at and what they're not so good at
 

00:37:58.539 --> 00:38:00.450
good at and what they're not so good at
so I'm gonna try and summarize that as a

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:00.460
so I'm gonna try and summarize that as a
 

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.519
so I'm gonna try and summarize that as a
takeaway for you here so that you are

00:38:02.519 --> 00:38:02.529
takeaway for you here so that you are
 

00:38:02.529 --> 00:38:03.930
takeaway for you here so that you are
confident in picking the right one at

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:03.940
confident in picking the right one at
 

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.269
confident in picking the right one at
the right time for complex coordinated

00:38:06.269 --> 00:38:06.279
the right time for complex coordinated
 

00:38:06.279 --> 00:38:07.680
the right time for complex coordinated
layout and especially for that nice

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:07.690
layout and especially for that nice
 

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.479
layout and especially for that nice
handoff between gesture and animation

00:38:09.479 --> 00:38:09.489
handoff between gesture and animation
 

00:38:09.489 --> 00:38:11.370
handoff between gesture and animation
then really really really do check out

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:11.380
then really really really do check out
 

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.890
then really really really do check out
motion layout next up if you need to

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:13.900
motion layout next up if you need to
 

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.410
motion layout next up if you need to
build interruptible and animations or

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:16.420
build interruptible and animations or
 

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.359
build interruptible and animations or
again do gesture to animation with like

00:38:18.359 --> 00:38:18.369
again do gesture to animation with like
 

00:38:18.369 --> 00:38:20.039
again do gesture to animation with like
that velocity tracking then look at the

00:38:20.039 --> 00:38:20.049
that velocity tracking then look at the
 

00:38:20.049 --> 00:38:23.609
that velocity tracking then look at the
physics layout and system if you need to

00:38:23.609 --> 00:38:23.619
physics layout and system if you need to
 

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:25.289
physics layout and system if you need to
do shared element transitions or window

00:38:25.289 --> 00:38:25.299
do shared element transitions or window
 

00:38:25.299 --> 00:38:26.849
do shared element transitions or window
content transitions in your application

00:38:26.849 --> 00:38:26.859
content transitions in your application
 

00:38:26.859 --> 00:38:29.450
content transitions in your application
then transitions is the API for you and

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460
then transitions is the API for you and
 

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.859
then transitions is the API for you and
if you need to do vector graphic

00:38:31.859 --> 00:38:31.869
if you need to do vector graphic
 

00:38:31.869 --> 00:38:33.239
if you need to do vector graphic
animations then check out animated

00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:33.249
animations then check out animated
 

00:38:33.249 --> 00:38:37.049
animations then check out animated
vector drawable if you need to do window

00:38:37.049 --> 00:38:37.059
vector drawable if you need to do window
 

00:38:37.059 --> 00:38:38.700
vector drawable if you need to do window
animations and only if you need to do

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:38.710
animations and only if you need to do
 

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.279
animations and only if you need to do
window animations then the original SDK

00:38:41.279 --> 00:38:41.289
window animations then the original SDK
 

00:38:41.289 --> 00:38:42.809
window animations then the original SDK
one view animation system should be use

00:38:42.809 --> 00:38:42.819
one view animation system should be use
 

00:38:42.819 --> 00:38:45.359
one view animation system should be use
it's your only choice and if you need to

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:45.369
it's your only choice and if you need to
 

00:38:45.369 --> 00:38:47.099
it's your only choice and if you need to
animate properties of views and it's

00:38:47.099 --> 00:38:47.109
animate properties of views and it's
 

00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:48.239
animate properties of views and it's
supported by then look at the view

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:48.249
supported by then look at the view
 

00:38:48.249 --> 00:38:50.789
supported by then look at the view
property animator if you need to do like

00:38:50.789 --> 00:38:50.799
property animator if you need to do like
 

00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:53.880
property animator if you need to do like
custom custom view animation or some

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:53.890
custom custom view animation or some
 

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.410
custom custom view animation or some
custom thing driven just by an animation

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:55.420
custom thing driven just by an animation
 

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.039
custom thing driven just by an animation
pulse then look at a value animator and

00:38:58.039 --> 00:38:58.049
pulse then look at a value animator and
 

00:38:58.049 --> 00:39:00.930
pulse then look at a value animator and
lastly like else use object animator

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:00.940
lastly like else use object animator
 

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.299
lastly like else use object animator
object animator is your go to default

00:39:03.299 --> 00:39:03.309
object animator is your go to default
 

00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:05.609
object animator is your go to default
for general purpose animation so

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:05.619
for general purpose animation so
 

00:39:05.619 --> 00:39:06.989
for general purpose animation so
hopefully that's made a bit clearer so

00:39:06.989 --> 00:39:06.999
hopefully that's made a bit clearer so
 

00:39:06.999 --> 00:39:08.459
hopefully that's made a bit clearer so
next time you have to build something

00:39:08.459 --> 00:39:08.469
next time you have to build something
 

00:39:08.469 --> 00:39:10.589
next time you have to build something
you wouldn't be you know paralyzed by

00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599
you wouldn't be you know paralyzed by
 

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:12.450
you wouldn't be you know paralyzed by
choice of the different animation API s

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:12.460
choice of the different animation API s
 

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.489
choice of the different animation API s
and so thank you very much for joining
