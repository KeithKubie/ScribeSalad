evening everyone, and thank you

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.820
for attending our
book event tonight.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.510
I'm Guy Lamolinara, and I'm from

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.630
And, this event is
part of a week's worth

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.200
of events we're doing,
related to Frankenstein.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.910
We're having film screenings,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.770
and all of these are meant to
celebrate the 200th anniversary

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.510
of Mary Shelley's
novel, Frankenstein,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.540

and early 20th century
popular fiction.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.510
Please welcome Charlotte
Gordon and Michael Dirda.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.210
[ Applause ]

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda:
Well, Charlotte

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.390
and I spoke beforehand,
and she's going

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.730
to give a short presentation,
based on her study

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.010
of Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary
Shelley, and then we'll kind

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.840
of watch and do a
casual conversation

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.250
about both what she said, and
these two interesting women.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.150
But, also about Frankenstein.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.850
I urge you to think of
questions to ask us.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.450
It's always much more
fun, particularly

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.400
when you have a relatively
small group,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.170
to interact with the audience.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.430
So, you know, think
about the novel,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.300
think about the things you'd
like to know about Mary Shelley,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.970
or Mary Wollstonecraft,
or Frankenstein.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.070
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: So,
when I was a young teacher,

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.900
I used to always teach
Frankenstein, and, you know,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.520
honestly I knew nothing
about it other than, like,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.710
all the cliches that
Frankenstein--

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.880
you know, the first
science fiction novel.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.070
And, you know, Mary
Shelley, whatever.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.510
I knew about her,
but not really.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.590
And so, it was with great
surprise that I found out that

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.480
in fact, Mary Shelley was the
daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.600
I'm a highly educated
individual,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.000
so how did this slipped my--
you know, my teacher's mind,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.550
and mind, is beyond me.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.020
So, in this image, I just wanted
people to see these images.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.220
The picture of the woman in
white is Mary Wollstonecraft.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.510
And, in this picture,
she's actually pregnant

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.920
with Mary Shelley, who is in
the black, looking kind of tired

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.580
at this point in her life,

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.390
because she's been
through a lot.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.920
When I found out that
Wollstonecraft was the mother

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.150
of Mary Shelley, I thought
that was so interesting.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.860
And, I thought, well, of
course, cool, radical woman

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.870
who wrote A Vindication of the
Rights of Woman, of course,

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.440
she's going to be the daughter
of cool, radical Mary Shelley

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.740
who wrote Frankenstein.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.950
She must have influenced her
so much, because I knew nothing

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.480
about Mary Wollstonecraft.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.100
I did not know that 10
days after she gave birth

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.580
to Mary Shelley, Mary
Wollstonecraft died.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.380
My theory went right
out the window.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.300
I thought, wait, how does cool,
radical author of A Vindication

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.960
of the Rights of Woman influence
cool writer of Frankenstein?

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.730
And then, I thought
about myself,

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.070
the fact that I was even
asking these questions--

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.720
I mean, I'm profoundly
influenced by dead people,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.520
so is Michael, by the way.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.090
Of course--

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: I sees them.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.200
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: [laughs]
Of course little Mary was going

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.870
to influenced by her mother,
and in fact, that portrait

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.410
that I just showed you
of Mary Wollstonecraft

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.320
in the white dress, hung in
little Mary Shelley's house,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.840
and lots of other
interesting things as well.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.220
But, I wanted to quickly give
you a kind of overview of things

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.050
that a lot of things that people
don't know about the novel.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.210
And, in some ways, we could
call this little introduction

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.940
Frankenstein's Grandmother.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.830
Because, really, Frankenstein,
when I came to think about it,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.520
and I came to read about
these women, in many ways,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.540
Frankenstein is a tribute
to Mary Wollstonecraft.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.350
And, whenever I say that to my
students they say, but wait,

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.680
there's no strong
women in this novel.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.700
It seems to be all
about, you know--

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.810
it's dystopian, and the
only person who seems

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.010
to have any power at all
is Doctor Frankenstein.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.830
How could this be a-- what
we would say in academia,

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.290
how could this be a
proto-feminist novel?

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.780
How could this be a novel about
the need for strong women?

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.060
And, what I came to understand
is that really, Frankenstein is

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.360
in fact a story about
what the world would look

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.280
like without mothers.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.000
Without strong women.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.940
That it is a dystopian
picture of a world

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.720
where women don't have power,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.930
and are effectively
disenfranchised.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.770
And so, this interested
me-- when I realized this,

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.470
this interested me all the
more in Mary Wollstonecraft.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.460
So, I'm going to just flip
through some quick images

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.470
so that we can have a
sense of who she is,

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.650
because this will put
us all on the same--

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.620
you know, a level playing field.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.790
So, I went on a kind of
pilgrimage to find out more

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.270
about Mary Wollstonecraft,
long before I knew I was going

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.900
to write about her in my
book, Romantic Outlaws.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.160
And, this is a picture of the
house we think that she grew

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.810
up in, in northern
England, in Yorkshire.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.140
And, because I'm a writer, of
course I had to have a picture

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.350
of the window we think
she stared out of

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.840
when she was super glum and
depressed, when she was 16.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.330
Why was she glum and depressed?

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.030
She had a horrible family.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.170
Her father was an alcoholic.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.730
Her mother was very weak,

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:18.490
and Mary's earliest memories
actually are of falling asleep

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.960
on the threshold of her
parent's bedroom door

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.720
to protect her mother
from her abusive father.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.380
And, all of that happened in
this house that we see here.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.420
For the rest of her life,
she would be anti-marriage,

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.590
and she's an 18th century
woman, and to be married

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.890
in the 18th century meant--

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.930
and none of my students ever
know this, so forgive me

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.360
if I'm telling you-- you look
like you already know all this,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.550
but I still have to say it.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.830
You couldn't own property.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.480
Children were not your own.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.010
There was no such
thing as divorce.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.490
It took quite literally an act
of Parliament to get divorced.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.310
Your husband's responsibility
was to discipline you.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:01.630
Which meant, essentially,
that he could punish you,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.400
what we would call
abuse, abuse you freely.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.280
Why? Because an out-of-order
family meant an out-of-order

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.770
or uncontrolled town, which
meant an out of control,

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.090
you know, wild county.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.990
Which meant the whole country
would be wild and uncontrolled,

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.410
and England would turn
into France, and you know,

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.710
who knew what would happen?

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.010
A revolution, maybe.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.540
So, the great humane innovation
of the 18th century was

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.910
that husbands should
not use a whip

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.140
that was thicker than the thumb.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.090
And, that's where we get the
idea of the rule of thumb.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.340
Mary Wollstonecraft
was outraged by this.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.670
And, she spent essentially
the rest of her life,

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:44.300
after this early
experience with her parents,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:49.630
trying to right the injustices
that she saw growing up.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.380
But first, she was
really depressed.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.310
And then, a very beloved
mentor said, you know,

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.780
I think you should read this
person named John Locke.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.060
I think you'll find him
really inspirational.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.930
And, whenever I say John
Locke to my students,

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.180
their eyes roll back in
their head with boredom.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.130
And, I have to remind them, that
in fact in the 18th century,

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.840
John Locke was considered
so radical

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.080
that he wasn't even allowed
on the campus at Oxford.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.330
I mean, he was really a
shocking person to read.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.830
And, in 1775, which
is the very same year

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.870
that Mary Wollstonecraft
was reading John Locke,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.370
so was John Adams.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.130
So was Jefferson.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.640
He was, in fact, literally
inspiring revolutions.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.030
And, for Wollstonecraft,
he inspired her to think

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:38.890
that women, in fact, could have
the same [gasps] rights as men.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.950
And so, I thought that it
would be interesting just

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.940
to hear Locke's words
for one second,

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.680
because we're a small,
nerdy group in here.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.570
I feel that you can
stand it, right?

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:54.020
So, Locke said, "the state of
nature is one of equality".

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:58.740
I feel like we should all-- "of
equality, wherein all the power

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.290
and jurisdiction is reciprocal.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.710
No one having more
than another."

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.810
When Wollstonecraft read that in
1775, she had found a political

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.560
and philosophical
underpinning for her feelings

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.960
that life wasn't fair.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.320
Her father should not be allowed
to treat her mother that way.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.780
And, in fact, Mary had an older
brother who was tyrannical,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:22.040
and he should not be allowed
to treat her that way, either.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.010
She-- we're going
to skip through some

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.030
of these fascinating images.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.050
Lots of interesting things
happened in her life,

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.160
many of which are actually, from
my point of view, very funny.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.670
But, by the time she's 31,

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.600
she's tried out all the
different things that you can do

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.610
as the woman if you
don't get married.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.270
Because she is against marriage.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.630
So, what are the options for
you in the mid-18th century?

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.290
Well, if you didn't want
to sink down the food chain

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.710
to become a prostitute,
you can be a governess.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.930
Fun. There's many funny
stories about Wollstonecraft

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.230
as a governess, however.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.910
The idea of hiring
Mary Wollstonecraft

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.210
as a governess still
amuses me, but anyway.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.630
Wollstonecraft was a governess.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.940
She was a companion to an
elderly woman, who had a history

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.590
of intimidating her companions,

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.330
but not when it came
to Wollstonecraft.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.320
She was scared of
Wollstonecraft,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.610
which I think tells us a
lot about Wollstonecraft.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:13.910
She started a school that was

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.010
so radical no one would
send their students there.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.840
Like, all classic
Wollstonecraft.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.020
By the time she's 31, this
is how she presents herself

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.320
to the world.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.670
And, if you know other portraits
of women during this time,

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.060
they're often holding, like,
little frilly parasols,

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.340
and like, you know, trying to
look marriageable and pretty.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.620
And, this picture is a definite
self-representation of self

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.000
as scholar or, in my
mind, as prime minister.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.750
She's really, this is an anti--

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.620
well, I don't want to use the
words feminine and masculine,

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.750
but this is very much
conscious depiction of self

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.680
as serious-minded individual.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.400
She does not want to
be seen as a woman

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.460
in the 18th century sense.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.450
She's not anti-woman, but she
is anti the images of women

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.820
that people had in
the 18th century.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.340
She comes to fame by
writing A Vindication

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.190
of the Rights of Woman.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.850
And, when she wrote A
Vindication of the Rights

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.280
of Woman, no one said to
her, gee, thanks so much

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.310
for writing A Vindication
of the Rights of Woman.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.300
They said, you are a
whore, Mary Wollstonecraft.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.940
You are a hyena in petticoats.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.550
But, she persevered.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.180
And, I will speed up our life
story just a little bit more.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.540
But, she-- the French Revolution
breaks out, and Wollstonecraft,

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.730
as opposed to the rest of
the English were fleeing home

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.600
from Paris, Wollstonecraft
gets on the first ship she can,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.180
to go become the first
female war correspondent

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.620
in Paris, which she loves.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.750
When she gets to France, there's
a lot of violence, as we know.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.630
She arrives just as the king
is about to be executed.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.930
He gets executed.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.680
She doesn't really like
all this bloodshed,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.310
but she's totally
behind the revolution.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.730
It was like, yes, this
is how life should be.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.030
Rich people should
be on the run.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.510
Poor people should be rising up.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.810
Women should be able
to get divorced.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.110
They should have equal rights.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.410
This is great.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.540
She falls in love with a
sexy American named Gilbert.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.840
She gets pregnant.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.140
They have a baby.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.440
Life is great.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.740
She's living her philosophy.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.500
He doesn't believe in
marriage either, which is kind

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.090
of an enforced servitude
of women, he says.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.390
This is terrific.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.000
And then, he leaves her.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.670
She's got this little baby.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.000
She's super depressed.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.650
What is she going to do?

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.570
She goes and tracks him down.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.360
He's living with an "actress."

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.090
She says to them, you know,

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.980
how about the three
of us live together?

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.520
Then, you and I, Gilbert,
can talk about ideas,

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.690
and be philosophical soul
mates, and you, young woman,

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.990
do you have an education?

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.010
And, what are you going to
do when he gets tired of you?

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.730
How are you going
to earn a living?

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.740
The young woman is like,
get out of my life.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.940
You may not live with us.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.490
Go away. So, Mary
gets super depressed.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.140
Sad things happen.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.790
She tries to kill herself.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:06.160
Gilbert in all of his
wisdom says to her, listen,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.970
one of my merchant
ships-- stay with me here--

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:13.420
has gone missing in Scandinavia.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.230
I'm wondering if you could go
find it for me, and then, maybe,

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.000
you know, maybe we
could get back together

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.300
if you find this ship.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.600
Scandinavia?

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.900
Merchant ship?

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.200
Nobody in this time
period went to Scandinavia.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.140
Men did not go to Scandinavia.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.900
But, the suicidal
Mary Wollstonecraft

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.400
with her toddler go to
Sweden, where in fact,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.700
she roams around in the
beautiful Scandinavian summer,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.480
you know, smelling the pines,
and picking strawberries,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.810
and admiring waterfalls.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.750
And, at night she comes
home, and she writes

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.690
about how much better
nature is making her feel.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.680
And, when she comes back
to England, Gilbert's like,

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.290
well you didn't find my ship--
she didn't find his ship--

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.720
I'm going to go on living
with my cute actress.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.320
She gets depressed, but
you know what she does?

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.270
She revises all of her writings
that she did in Scandinavia,

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.530
and she publishes a book that
most people have never heard

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.880
of today, but was actually her
best-selling book of the time,

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.960
called Letters from Scandinavia.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.840
And, in Letters from
Scandinavia,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.220
she writes about the
healing properties of nature

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.760
and how it gives
her inspiration.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.870
And, it's read by two young men.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.910
One was named William
Wordsworth.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.510
And, one was named Samuel Taylor
Coleridge, and they said, wow.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.240
This is a really
great way to write.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.540
Maybe we should try it.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.130
They greatly admired her.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.550
I was certainly never taught
that Wollstonecraft was

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.250
in fact one of the
initiators of Romanticism.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.840
But, both Wordsworth
and Coleridge,

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.370
if they were here tonight would
say, in fact, we got a lot

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.160
of our ideas from
Mary Wollstonecraft.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.310
Mary Wollstonecraft meets,

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.840
a kind of rock star political
philosopher named William

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.710
Godwin, who read Letters from
Scandinavia, and said, you know,

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.970
if ever there were
a book calculated

00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.440
to make the reader fall in love
with the author, it's this book.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.740
They get together.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.040
She gets pregnant again.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.340
Big quandary.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.640
What are we going to do?

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.940
Neither of them believe
in marriage.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.740
They've both written
publicly about this.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.040
If they get married,
they're going

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.380
to be ridiculed by
their friends.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.780
But, if they don't get married,

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.410
this little baby's
going to be a bastard.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.710
What should they do?

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.680
And, if they do get-- what about
little Fan-- They get married.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.980
Their friends make fun of them.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.150
I want to show-- there she is.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.150
She's pregnant with the baby.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.660
They move to that great
neighborhood in The Polygon,

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.720
which has since been torn
down, and is now North London.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.210
They get married in
Saint Pancras Old Church,

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:40.610
which is right near Saint
Pancras railroad station.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.590
And, everything,
again, is great,

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.230
though their friends
have made fun of them.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.310
Mary gives birth.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.290
It's a little girl,
her name is Mary.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.240
Everyone's worried that the
little girl won't survive,

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.890
but seems to be OK.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.830
And then, the tragedy happens.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.000
Mary Wollstonecraft
dies of childbed fever,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.680
just 10 days after giving birth.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.650
And, in fact, William
Godwin is heartbroken.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.510
So that, little Mary
Shelley's first memories

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:16.080
as a teeny little girl are
walking to the graveyard,

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.450
and actually learning to read
on her mother's gravestone.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.080
And, this is true.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.780
This is not apocryphal.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.900
The first words that she learns
to trace, and the first letters,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.110
are M-- you know, Mary
Wollstonecraft Godwin,

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.950
which was, in fact, little
Mary Shelley's original name,

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.350
Mary Godwin.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.550
And, the gravestone--
you can't see it here--

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.440
the gravestone actually
said, Author of A Vindication

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.470
of the Rights of Woman.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.940
So, I don't know about you guys.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.160
I mean, my first words I
think were, like, dog and cat.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.460
But, I think little
Mary Shelley's--

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.690
her first words were
vindication and woman.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:54.290
Which, again, most people don't
know this, that this is part

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.720
of the origin story, of
course, of Frankenstein.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.130
Which is why I'm
telling you all this.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.200
Because I would much rather
be chatting with Michael.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.000
But, I want us all to know this,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.870
so that when our conversation
begins, you can know some

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.940
of these-- it's kind of
an invisible back story

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.960
to this really incredibly
famous novel.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.730
So, by the time little
Mary has come of age,

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.240
even by the time she's 10 or
11, she's pretty much decided

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.120
that she wants to live according
to the ideals of her mother.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.050
By the time she meets this
handsome young man, Percy,

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.640
she's 16, and he's 20.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.020
And, inconveniently,
he's already married.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.230
But, neither of them
believe in marriage.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.530
No problem.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.500
And so, she says to him, he does
not say to her, she says to him,

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.360
you know, my heart
is with you, Percy,

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.910
or whatever exactly she said.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.570
He said, Great.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.710
She says, you know, you're
already married, so we're going

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.160
to have to run away together.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.750
He's like, fine.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.050
Where should we go?

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.400
And, she says, well, Paris.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.290
Because that's where
my mother went.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:54.590
So, they do.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.890
They run away together to Paris.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.190
She's 16. I'm leaving

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.690
out an important
character, but that's OK.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.600
And, what did they
take with them?

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.890
They don't take, you
know, sexy lingerie.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.060
They take a giant stack of
Mary Wollstonecraft's books

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.580
that they read to each other.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.780
So, I tell all of this to
you as a kind of back story,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:20.180
so that you can understand that
by the time young Mary sits

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.040
down to write Frankenstein,
it's really only two years

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.530
after she's run away
with Percy to Paris.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:31.870
They go to Geneva, and if you--
I think Michael and I can talk

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.180
about this-- but she starts
writing the ghost story

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.490
Frankenstein when she's
17ish, 18 years old,

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.440
and it's published
before she's 20.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.120
And so, she says, I am
doing this in part to live

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.740
up to my mother and my father.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.850
And so, I'm going
to leave it there,

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.500
but this is the back
story of Frankenstein

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.160
that most people don't know.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.450
And, I wanted you
to know the history

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.400
of the women behind
Frankenstein.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.160
Because it's kind of famously--

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.200
you know, women are so
famously absent from it.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.850
And, I think now
Michael and I could talk.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.560
But, I want to get the
picture of the house

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.140
where we think it was
actually begotten.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.590
This is the Villa
Diodati in Geneva

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:23.850
where Lord Byron makes
his famous challenge,

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.270
which we can talk about
if you want to hear it.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Thank you.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.230
That was great.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.530
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
You're welcome.

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Well, I
wanted to ask a question

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.870
of the audience first.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:42.310
I once taught Frankenstein
at a college course I gave.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:47.540
And, I told the class that
I would give an A to anyone

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.940
in the class who could
tell me the first words

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.020
that the creature
speaks in the novel.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.140
Not the--

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.890
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Look at the faces.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:03.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: It's-- there
are three wonderful words.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.450
"Pardon this intrusion."

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.440
Which tells you a lot
about the novel already,

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.430
if you have these images
of the movie in mind,

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.500
which is strictly
a horror movie.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.800
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Oh, that's lovely.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Whereas
the novel is very much a

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:24.930
philosophical account of
all sorts of issues dealing

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:32.160
with science, creation, moral
responsibility, what it means

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.320
to be civilized, educated.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:40.050
It's a book, you know,
it's a book to think with,

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:43.290
not just simply to react to.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.790
But, let's go to the background
of how the book came about.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.730
Charlotte's told us about
Mary Wollstonecraft,

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.550
and a bit about Mary Shelley.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.350
Not Shelley yet,
still Mary Godwin.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:02.700
She runs off with Shelley,
taking her half-sister

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.480
with her, Clair Clairmont.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.780
And--

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.080
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: True.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda:
The whole situation

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.650
of the Romantics is so tangled--

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:14.950
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: [inaudible]

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: -- erotically.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.460
Everybody-- it's like the '60s.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.280
Everybody sleeps with
everybody else, practically.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.730
They get involved
after they, you know--

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:31.300
Percy Shelley apparently
at one point

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.090
when Mary Shelley's had
a child that has died,

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.500
runs off with Claire
for a while.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.800
Comes back.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.660
They eventually all end
up at the Villa Diodati

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.440
on Lake Geneva with Lord Byron.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.520
And, it's been a
terrible summer.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:57.080
They called it-- because some
volcano erupted or something,

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.170
there was, you know,
terrible weather.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.870
And, they decide to tell
these ghost stories.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:07.510
Interestingly, they had
a visitor early in the--

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.130
that same period
when they were there.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:14.100
Of-- a character named
Matthew Gregory Lewis.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.780
Any of you know who
Matthew Gregory Lewis was?

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.080
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.380
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: He was the
author of the great Gothic novel

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.130
of the time, The Monk.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.960
Which again, is filled with sex,
and all sorts of naughtiness.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.350
So, these things
were in the air.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:36.500
The characters are
interested in new ideas.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.490
Electricity, and galvanism, and
there's-- they've got this--

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.730
they're living in the
middle of, you know,

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.610
the time of the Gothic romances.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:49.700
And so, they decide that they're
going to tell ghost stories.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.260
Why don't you tell us about what
ghost stories they came up with?

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.560
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Well,

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.770
I think there's many interesting
stories about this story,

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.780
which is Lord Byron
says, famously,

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.740
and Mary tells us this
story in her introduction

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.540
to the revised Frankenstein.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.900
So, if you're a critical
reader, you have to think

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.140
about the story she's telling,
and why she tells this story.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.910
But, she says that Byron
set a challenge to everybody

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.440
who was there, to the
assembled, saying, essentially--

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.150
I'm translating now-- you know,

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.570
I'm sick of all the
books we're reading.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:25.870
We all are.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:27.170
We're bored.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.490
Let's see who can write
the scariest ghost story.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.820
And, Michael's going to
fill this in, but I'm going

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.840
to tell my part of it,
which is, the part I care

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.180
about because I teach students
who have many silly ideas

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.140
about this story, and it
comes from Mary herself.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.850
So, the way she tells
it, Byron, and Shel--

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.750
everybody got right to work,
they had no difficulty.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:53.860
But, she, Mary, struggled to
come up with an idea, alas.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.670
But then, a dream came to her,
a dream vision, came to her.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.820
And then, she was
able to write it down.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:07.840
OK. She writes that many years
after everybody else has died.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.680
And, by this time, people
know who wrote Frankenstein.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.140
When it was first
published, it was anonymous.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.370
And, most people thought it was
written by a man, perhaps Percy.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.980
When they find out that it was
written by a woman, they say,

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.920
what kind of monstrous
woman would have come

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.310
up with this novel.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.570
This is perverse, a perversity.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.790
And so, Mary, who by this
time is a single mom,

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.760
living back in London,
trying to make a living,

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.450
has been exiled essentially
by London society for years,

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.580
for running away with
Percy and Claire.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.090
Living, what the British press
called living in the midst

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.190
of the league of incest.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.200
I know. I know.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.560
Shocking.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda:
Shelley once said, Incest,

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.600
like so many other-- let's see--

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.950
incorrect things is a very
poetical circumstance.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.250
[laughs]

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.550
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Dare I-- I know.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.850
I love that.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:09.150
His publisher's trying
to talk him

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.240
out of making his two main
characters, who are lovers,

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.110
brother and sister, as he says.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Hey, it
worked for [inaudible].

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.770
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Anyways, here's what we know

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:20.080
about what really happened.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.920
Because, everybody
who was up there,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.380
not only were they
sleeping with everybody,

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.090
they were also keeping
journals and writing letters.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.680
And, there was one young man
up there who had a giant crush

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.160
on Mary, and recorded
her every action.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.530
Polidori. And, in fact he
says she got right to work.

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.200
And, there's no evidence

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.510
of her having any
difficulty writing this book.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:44.600
In fact, there's not even
evidence of the dream.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.790
So, why does she
tell this story?

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:50.430
It seems clear that she
tells this story to kind

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.590
of make it more acceptable
to the reading audience

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.080
that this woman wrote this book.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.340
I didn't mean to; it
came to me in a dream.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.350
And, for those people who were
initiated, who knew anything

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.700
about Romantics,
only special people,

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.210
of course, had dreams like this.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:10.400
So, on the other hand, it was
also a kind of-- what do we--

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.140
again, I've just
learned this phrase.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.440
I think it's old now.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.090
It's sort of a humble
brag to say, you know, oh,

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.330
I didn't have the idea
myself, it came in a vision.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.780
It was a very Romantic
thing to happen.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.750
But, it also excused
her on a very deep level

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.030
from being this monstrous
woman who came

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.110
up with this idea herself.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:33.290
So, that's-- in all the
introductions to Frankenstein,

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.540
often that story is retold.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.630
And, I find it irritating,
because I would like people

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.700
to understand that Shelly,
Mary-- Godwin at that point,

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.350
and then Mary Shelley
when she revises it,

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:46.990
took herself very seriously

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:50.000
as a craftsperson,
and worked very hard.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.150
From the moment she started
writing that manuscript,

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.400
she didn't stop for two years.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.320
And, we have the notebooks
of the second draft,

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.050
so we can see how hard she
worked and what she did.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.440
So, I just have to correct that.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Yes, yes.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.210
Polidori, by the way,
was the only other person

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:09.060
who really produced
any important work

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.410
of supernatural literature.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:15.570
He wrote a book, a
novella, called The Vampyre.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:19.040
Where the vampire is
essentially based on Byron.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.360
In fact, when it was published,

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.880
people thought Byron
had written it.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:31.610
And, it really set the ideal
of the vampire as a brooding,

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:36.510
elegant, intensely
sexy, romantic figure.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.910
And, it goes all the up,
you know, to the present.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.210
But, Polidori-- also,

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.020
these families are
intricately connected,

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.290
but Polidori's sister
became the mother

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.950
of Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
and the Rossetti family.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.760
So, there were these
wonderful connections.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.710
Claire Clairmont, we'll finish
up with her, was the only one

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.730
to live to any great length.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.440
She lived to be a
great old lady.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.330
Became a governess
for a long time.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.630
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: [inaudible]

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:05.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: But,
she served as the model

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:09.270
for Henry James's great
story, The Aspern Papers.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:13.730
So, a lot came out
of this small circle.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:15.030
Now--

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.330
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Can we say
one more thing about Claire?

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Sure.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.590
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: There
is a recent discovery,

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.250
which for people like us--

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:24.130
I'm including you in the
us-- was very exciting.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:28.340
So, a lot of us have wondered,
how did people really feel

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.490
about the sexual
experimenting that was going on.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:34.710
And, you know, Percy and
Byron, but especially Percy,

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.210
he used the phrase free love.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.130
And, Mary was always trying
to live up to, you know,

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.090
his standards of free
love, and tried to sleep

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.500
with his friends and stuff.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.380
But, she didn't really want to.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:50.230
[laughs] So, we just found in
the public library in New York,

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.750
in between the pages of a
book, Claire Clairmont saying,

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.020
in fact, free love for
women was horrible.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.770
It was a terrible
experience for us.

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.500
It was great for the men on
some level, but we suffered.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.990
Now, having said that, she
was the model for James,

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.800
and she spent a lot of
time rewriting her history

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.100
and her letters.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.420
So, this was a re-written--

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.730
who knows what the
mood of the day was.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.940
But, still, I think
it's very interesting

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.990
that the woman's
experience of this kind

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.890
of "commune" was very
different from the men's.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:23.190
Not that the men were having

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.540
such a great time
either, and-- by the way.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:30.450
Did you know that, like, I feel
like it's like common knowledge

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:34.030
that Byron's main
erotic interest,

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:38.580
besides his half-sister and
other women, was actually men.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.330
And, it seems very clear that
he had a very deep interest

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.630
in Percy.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.480
And, I forget who it was in
England who was, you know,

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.230
bent out of shape that
I wrote that in my book.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.530
[inaudible]

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: [laughs]

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.130
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: I know.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Well, there's
been-- his early travels,

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:58.250
he talks a lot about the Greek
and Arab boys that he would see.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:03.790
Now, you stress the importance
of Mary Wollstonecraft,

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:08.110
but Mary Shelley dedicates
the book to her father--

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.410
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:10.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda:
-- William Godwin.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:16.430
And, Godwin himself was
an extremely interesting--

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:19.380
both thinker, but also novelist.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.310
Caleb Williams is one of the
earliest detective stories.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.850
Sort of a chase thriller.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.810
But, he also wrote a
couple of, sort of,

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:31.520
Gothic-y novels himself.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.660
About the saint, Saint
Leon, or Saint Leon.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.080
Saint Leon, about the search
for the elixir of life.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.660
And, just to continue
with men a little bit,

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:50.020
Shelley also wrote a couple of,
sort of, crummy Gothic novels,

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:55.760
where you have gigantic
cretin men, or creatures.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:01.070
And, Gothic elements like the
elixir of life, to extend life.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:06.540
Why do you feel that
Mary Wollstonecraft was

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:10.510
so much an influence when we
have examples from the men

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:13.920
in her life working
the same field,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.930
essentially, that she does?

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:17.230
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: I think

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.360
that they were a huge
influence on her as well.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.660
I'm just trying to correct the
fact that most people don't know

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.050
that Wollstonecraft
was also an influence.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.730
So, I think everything
you're saying is spot on.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:30.180
And, in fact, I also think
Frankenstein can be read as part

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.760
of a kind of marital dispute
between Percy and Mary,

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:39.210
because Percy writes a long
poem called Prometheus Unbound.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.170
And, of course, we know

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:44.020
that Frankenstein's subtitle
is A Modern Prometheus.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.300
And so, this was part
of an ongoing quarrel

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.380
that they were having as
two very close people.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.140
Between pessimism and optimism,

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.060
but also between many other
ideals about how to live a life.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.310
And, I think in some
ways, it's self-evident,

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:04.910
that Doctor Frankenstein's
obsessive ambition

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.230
and commitment to
work at the expense

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:11.930
of his personal relationships,
I think Mary is saying not good.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.670
Percy on the other
hand, admires it.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:18.040
Like, he admires Prometheus,
and he's like, go, yes.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.090
We can solve the
world's problems

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.950
through this kind of ambition.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.560
And so, I think-- I'm so glad--

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.940
this is why it's so
great to have, you know,

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.380
the in tandem discussion
of Frankenstein,

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.260
because I'm so much
intent on kind

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.950
of correcting the
historical record

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.080
that has left Wollstonecraft
out,

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.370
that I will sometimes not
even mention the influence

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:40.670
of Godwin and Percy.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.590
And, Godwin was a huge
influence for many, many reasons

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.390
that I can talk about
now, or not.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.320
I don't know if there's
any interest.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Let me ask
you a question about the--

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.820
you brought up the
later introduction

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.760
to the 1831 text,
which she revised.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.020
For a long time, that
was what people read.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.320
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: But, in
the last couple of decades,

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:09.220
the original, 1818 text,
has come to be preferred.

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:10.520
What happened?

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.070
What is different
between the two?

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:15.560
Why do we have this shift
from the later text?

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.650
For a long time, textual
scholars used to say,

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:21.730
you take the author's last
corrected version as the,

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:23.900
you know, the foundational text.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.040
But, that's not the
case anymore--

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.340
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: No.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: -- in
the case of Frankenstein.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.940
Why not? What happened?

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.240
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: And, I
want to see if I can keep--

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.440
you all are so nice to be out
here tonight, I have to see

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.030
if I can keep you interested.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:41.230
So-- because this could
get-- it can get arcane fast.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.220
The 1818 edition, that's the one

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.470
that I just wrote the
introduction for at Penguin,

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:48.440
is the-- it's the first one.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.210
It's less-- there's
less-- it's shorter.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.520
It's one that Percy was
more directly involved in.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.970
And, if you look at
the draft manuscript,

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:59.710
you can see in his
handwriting, his emendations,

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.680
which are very interesting
for us to see.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.630
The 1831, she does-- of
course, Percy's long dead.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:06.930
So is Byron.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.400
And so, one of the reasons why

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.180
that was the edition
most people read is

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.770
that was seen as more Mary.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:15.340
It was-- it has her revisions.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.830
No one is working, you
know, on it with her.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:21.530
And, the second wave
feminists in the '70s and '80s,

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.410
the text becomes
a little suspect.

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:29.480
Because the women seem to get
weaker, feminist theorists say.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.930
It seems like it's becoming
a more-- one of the tropes,

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.610
one of the ideas
about Mary Shelley,

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:38.370
which is another
reason I wrote my book,

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:42.300
was that Mary Shelley
was seen as starting life

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.230
as a revolutionary when
she runs away with Percy,

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:47.820
and then becoming
kind of interpolated.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.960
Becoming kind of corrupted
by Victorian ideals

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.130
about what a woman
should be like.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.850
That the story went that she
was so interested in fitting

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.860
in that she was willing to sell

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.090
out those original
revolutionary ideas.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.260
And, that was most
famously promulgated

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.520
by the great biographer
Richard Holmes

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.230
in his very beautiful
biography of Percy Shelley,

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.250
where he kind of puts Mary down.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:16.870
Elevates Claire, and has
since apologized for this,

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:19.060
and no longer, you know,
holds to this idea.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Good.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.660
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda:
I didn't know that.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.260
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.560
Which is great.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.900
But, so there was sort
of a-- what's the word?

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.440
Like, a-- not a kickback.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.900
There was-- people didn't like
this idea about Mary Shelley.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.990
They wanted to see her
as more revolutionary.

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:39.240
In the 1831 edition, for a
while was seen as more of a kind

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.260
of sell out, a sell out edition.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:47.530
Now, I would say, for most
scholars, and most teachers,

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:51.630
there is-- for most-- there is
in fact a pretty equal divide

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.250
about which edition
you're going to teach.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:57.130
Currently, the 1818
one is more in fashion,

00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:00.190
but the 1831 is also
super interesting,

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:02.020
because you can see
what Mary adds in.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.030
Well what does she add in?

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.950
There's more philosophy,
if anything.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.300
There's more ideas.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.730
There's not more action.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.300
But, there's more reading,
there's more literature,

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.870
there's more discussion of
what is the nature of creation.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:18.480
Why are we here?

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.910
It doesn't read as quickly.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:24.470
So, students, in fact, find it
a little bit more difficult even

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:28.170
than the 1818, which does
read more like a teenage girl,

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:31.230
despite Shelley's emendations,
which are pretty funny.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.700
So, this is-- I'm going
to stop discussing this,

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.010
because there's been-- Yes?

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:37.870
I don't want to lose
our few people here.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:39.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Well,
the whole question

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.820
of Shelley's emendations--

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.120
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
They're so funny.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: -- has
given rise, I gather,

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.160
to a school of thought
that, in fact--

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.700
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: No, a
tiny group of stupid people.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: That Shelley
himself actually wrote the book.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:58.940
So, I mean, this-- I mean, I'm
not giving it any necessary--

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.240
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: I know.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: -- credence.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.610
But, I've-- he did a
good deal of scribbling

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:07.000
around with the manuscript.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.870
Supposedly he was,
you know, an editor,

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.560
just giving the usual
response of a, you know,

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:16.480
a spouse to a writing
partner's work.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.160
But, what is the
reason that people think

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.440
that Shelly could have--
that is, the male Shelley,

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.630
could have written the book?

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:26.930
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
This is so--

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.060
I wish all of my talks could
have-- this is so great.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.850
You're asking all the
greatest questions.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:35.360
I used to know the numbers by
heart, because this question

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.870
so engaged me, is the
polite way to put it.

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:41.510
And so, I don't want
to say the numbers,

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.230
because I'll get them wrong,
but they're in my book.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:48.270
I think he adds-- we know almost
exactly how many words he added

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:50.070
to the 1818 edition.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:53.480
In part because of the work,
the amazing scholarship

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.900
of Charles Robinson at the
University of Delaware,

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:59.020
who went through the notebooks,
and did a kind of coding.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.590
Because you can see
his handwriting

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:01.890
versus her handwriting.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:04.690
I'm tempted just to
say how many words.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.940
It's like, 7,000 words
out of 80,000 words.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.840
Or, it's-- the percentage
is very small.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.370
Far less for example, than
the percentage of emendations

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:17.420
that Ezra Pound does to
T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.670
And, you know, there's never
been this debate about--

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.590
well, in some circles,
there is a debate

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.890
about who really
wrote Wasteland.

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:24.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda:
Pound just cuts.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:25.490
But, Percy adds.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.690
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Percy adds and cuts.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:32.710
Percy's emendations tend to be
changing vocabulary from kind

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.630
of simple verbs to
fancier verbs.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:38.390
He puts in a very funny--
one of my favorites is,

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:42.030
when she's talking about
the Alps, and Switzerland,

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:44.060
he puts in-- that's one
of his longest ones.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.400
It's about this long.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.250
Where suddenly-- I think it's
during one of the chase scenes,

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.910
and suddenly there's this
pause in the narrative,

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.190
where we get a history
about Republican values.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.910
The values of democracy
in Switzerland,

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.040
and how it's always been
a more free country.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.340
And, like, wait.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.280
I thought I was reading
a Gothic novel.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.880
But, in fact, suddenly, I'm
reading political philosophy,

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.180
by it seems, someone else.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.620
So, I think there's teeny
little moments like that.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.470
But, essentially,
it is her story.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:17.280
They talk about it.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.540
And, that-- but that
really interesting structure

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.480
of Frankenstein that
never goes away,

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.520
that sort of Russian
doll structure,

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.510
where we have the
story within the story.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.410
And, that balance, right?

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:29.710
That is Mary's.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.010
That is Mary's.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.310
It's not Percy's.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:38.090
His ideas-- I mean, maybe the
better analogy is Fitzgerald

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:41.760
to Max Perkins than
Pound to Eliot.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.250
I mean-- but I think even
that is too active an analogy.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.370
That Percy does--
she does hand--

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:48.970
we can see the manuscript.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.570
They sat in bed together
with this writing desk,

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:53.290
and she would hand
it over to him.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:55.360
And, he did act as
a kind of editor.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.440
You can see him fixing
the commas.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.160
Giving her some fancier
verbs here and there.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.250
But, not actually
altering that overall,

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:05.320
sort of idea of the structure.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.770
Unless you want to say talking

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:10.070
about ideas before you're
writing it is writing the book.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.390
But, it was her book.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:13.690
It was her book.

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:15.090
And, he was a beloved editor.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.140
But we also don't say
about Percy's poems

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.890
that she wrote his poems.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.190
And, as some of you know,

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:23.860
he died with all his
papers in great disarray.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.240
So, if you look at his
notebooks in the Bodleian,

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.920
you can see parts
of stories written

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.220
on different pieces of paper.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:34.130
Parts of poems, some of his
most famous poems, are in--

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:38.430
are written on literally,
different sheets of paper.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.280
So, who puts those together?

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.210
Who's the miracle editor there?

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.990
Mary. And, she probably does
much more active editing

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.510
of Percy's work, than he
really does of thinking

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.680
through the sort of, novelistic
ideas of Frankenstein.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.450
But, never has his work--

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:56.990
never has his authorship
been challenged.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.110
So, just-- see, my
students taught me this too,

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:06.470
just saying that-- I think
that we can let that question

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.210
of the authorship of
Frankenstein rest.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.640
But, it's very interesting--
it's interesting historically

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.940
that we've questioned it.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.140
I think it tell us a
lot about, you know,

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.860
the history of women
and literature.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Shelley
was the first poet I

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:21.070
ever discovered.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:25.320
I was sitting in a parking
lot, behind a department store,

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.350
and I noticed a bunch of
kids prowling through--

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.590
there were these huge dumpsters.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.390
And, they came out
with a pile of records.

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.650
Huge-- someone must
have hidden them there.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:37.950
And, I jumped out of the car,

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:39.260
and I said give me
some of those.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.930
And, I took them home.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:45.880
And, one of them was Poems of
Shelley, read by Vincent Price.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.180
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: No!

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: And, I
put it on my record player,

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:50.970
and I was just enchanted.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:54.910
Some them, you know, I-- some
of them were incredibly corny.

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:56.530
I can remember to this day.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:01.290
"I arise from dreams of thee, in
the first sweet sleep of night,

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.830
when the winds are
breathing low,

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.340
and the stars are
shining bright.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:10.010
I arise from dreams of thee, and
a spirit at my feet hath led me

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:13.640
who know how, to thy
chamber window sweet.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.230
I die! I faint!

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:17.020
I fail!" It goes on.

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.770
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: [inaudible]
I think that's how they talked

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:22.890
to each other.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:24.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda:
Well, you mentioned

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:28.770
when Mary Wollstonecraft
in Paris, and Wordsworth.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.750
Of course, Wordsworth
was in Paris

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.110
as well during the Revolution,

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.970
and read about it
in the Prelude.

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:37.570
And, I've always thought he
wrote about Paris in the way

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:39.410
that I think about the '60s.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.170
As a couplet.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:44.740
Bliss, was it in that
dawn, to be alive.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:49.490
To be young was very heaven.

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:53.120
Frankenstein's a very strange
book in a number of ways.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.800
I mean, we think of the
story's-- this scary story,

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.320
but we know it's a
philosophical romance.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.470
But, there's even
this sort of strange,

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:09.950
kind of Arabian Tales family
of a Christian convert.

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:14.020
Elements that, you know, it
ends up in the North Pole,

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.740
where they're going over
the ice like something

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:21.130
out of the Ancient Mariner,
which was an apparent influence.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.600
You have any sense
of why the novel has

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.560
such a strange structure?

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.310
Why it brings in all
these disparate elements?

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:33.580
I mean, he leaves--
I guess, Geneva,

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:36.310
or wherever he was--
or Germany I guess.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:38.440
He made the original creature,

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.220
goes to the Orkney
Islands to make the female.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.320
And then, he has a change
of heart in the middle

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.310
of everything, and destroys it.

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:51.360
The book is provocative.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:57.320
And yet, it seems so
almost inconclusive

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.930
in a way that might be useful.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:02.040
You know, it can support
all kinds of theories,

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.560
all kinds of interpretations.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:09.150
When you teach the novel,
what do you try to emphasize?

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:13.560
What elements particularly
appeal to you and your students?

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.750
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
First, I want to ask Michael

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:18.710
that question, ask all
of you that questions,

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:22.760
but one of the topics that we
have just been discussing is,

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.440
how she gives equal weight--
because we've been talking a lot

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.560
about this in the
current political climate.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.680
So, Shelley-- I hate
to call her Shelley

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.130
because in 1818 she
was still Godwin,

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:37.700
but Shelley gives equal weight
to Doctor Frankenstein's point

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.580
of view, and the
creature's point of view.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:44.240
And, there's something I
think intrinsically ethical

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.590
about that, which if we want
to talk about, you know,

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:51.380
our current climate, we can,

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:55.380
but I think that she's really
putting a lot on the reader

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.940
to ask these questions.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:58.450
So that Michael is
so exactly right.

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:02.440
It is a kind of unresolved,
intrinsically unresolved novel.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.780
Because we have these
different points of view

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.560
that are given equal weight.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.600
And, we also have this,
kind of, off-stage audience,

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.630
which is the sister
of the explorer.

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:15.890
Now, I know-- for those of you

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:17.640
who haven't read this
novel in a while--

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: It's
all written as letter.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.240
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.870
You might have forgotten this,
but in fact, the novel begins

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:25.950
with the explorer
writing to his sister,

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:30.070
who has the very same
initials that Mary will have

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:31.460
when she marries Percy, MWS.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:38.700
And so, this sister seems to be
the only person who has any kind

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.930
of reasonable ideas
about how to live life,

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:44.070
because the explorer's
always saying to his sister,

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:48.490
don't worry, I'll try to, like,
save my life and that of my men.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:50.480
But, I don't want to
fail, and turn back

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.750
from exploring, you
know, the pole.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.350
But, you can hear her-- we
never get to hear it directly,

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.740
but you can hear in the
background this sort

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:00.560
of invisible chorus, Come home.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.860
Relationships matter.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.140
Stay connected, be
in a community.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.110
You don't need to go be this
solo explorer in the Arctic.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:10.720
You can be human, and
apart of community.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.800
But, I think it's so interesting
that that voice is implicit.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.300
We hear-- the book seems
to be a reaction to that.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.190
So, that's of interest to me.

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:21.570
I always try to point out why--

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.460
you know, she doesn't
have to do that, right?

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.350
We could have just had
one version of the story,

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.090
but why do we have
these different versions

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.040
of the story layered
against each other?

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.580
I think that's so interesting.

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:33.630
And then, of course,
the biograph--

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:36.090
can I just say one more
biographical thing.

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:37.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Sure.

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:38.690
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: One
more biographical piece

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:39.990
of information.

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.510
And, I think Michael
and I were probably--

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:43.020
I don't know if this
went on at Cornell,

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.770
but we might have been
trained similarly.

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:47.890
You may not realize this, but
it's a scandalous thing to do,

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:51.300
to look at an author's biography
when you're reading a text.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.300
So, all of my professors
were new critics.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.420
And, you were only supposed to
look at the text, and not think

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.720
about the author's life at all.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.570
So, every time I write a
biography, I always am plagued

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:03.740
by guilt, because of course
that's what I'm doing.

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.060
I'm mining their lives, so
for the reading of the book.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:11.440
So, when you read Frankenstein,
especially the 1818 version,

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.290
I just want to tell
you something.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.210
That as she was writing this,

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:18.300
she endured two horrible
tragedies.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.470
One was, if you remember,

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:23.870
Mary Wollstonecraft first
daughter, little Fanny.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:27.470
Little Fanny is three
years older than Mary,

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:29.160
and they were very close,

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.830
but Fanny lost her mother
when her mother died.

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:34.100
And, Gilbert, the
stupid sexy American,

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.900
vanished and never came back.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:39.070
So, Fanny never really
had her own parents.

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:41.510
Although Godwin adopted
her, he was very clear

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:44.100
that his own daughter
was superior to Fanny.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.790
I mean, he loved Fanny.

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:48.990
Kind of. I mean, she wasn't
as sparkly and amazing

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:50.740
as his own daughter, and so

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:55.170
when Mary is revising this
novel, Fanny kills herself.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:59.670
And, another horrible suicide
happens at the same time,

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.340
which is, if you remember,
Percy had been married

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.210
when he ran away with Mary.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:08.180
And, his abandoned wife also
killed herself during the

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:10.670
revising of this book.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:15.450
So, there is a way in which I
think Mary is writing about--

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:19.090
I love that-- I'd forgotten
those were the first words.

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:20.390
It's so beautiful.

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:25.030
That Mary's really writing
about how do we receive others.

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.310
That those women, they both died

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.400
because they'd gotten
exiled from their community.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.040
They'd gotten exiled
because Fanny was a bastard.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:38.490
She was the daughter of a woman
who'd had sex out of wedlock.

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:42.740
Harriet, Percy's
abandoned wife, dies in part

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.860
because she's been
abandoned by Shelley,

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.630
but also because
she'd become pregnant

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:48.980
with another man
who wasn't Shelley.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.600
And so, had become one

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.270
of the monstrous women
of that time period.

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:56.320
So, I think there's a sort
of drum beat of the dangers

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.150
of what we do to one another.

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.560
Of people who trespass, who
step out of their territories.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: That's
really the explanation--

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.180
the mon-- the creature.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.480
Well, the monster--

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.780
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: -- the
creature gives for his murders.

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.370
He said that he has
been a misery.

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:17.630
Just sheer misery that
he's been rejected, alone.

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:21.490
He's educated himself by
observing this family.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:24.320
Learned, you know--
read Paradise Lost,

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.640
and John Locke, and everything.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.290
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
He's highly educated.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:32.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: The world
sees him as a monster, and it's,

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:37.820
you know, he is made a
monster by the world,

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.200
not by Doctor Frankenstein.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.500
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.020
And, I think that that's
where that ethical--

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.340
you know, if she had just
come out and written it.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.640
If she had been her mother,

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.840
she would have written a
political essay about this,

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.410
but by putting the
narratives next to each other,

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:56.570
we get to see how the
creature has been abandoned

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:58.130
and not parented.

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:01.060
And, how in fact, he was
so ready to be loved.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.240
I mean, there he is,
reading Paradise Lost.

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.850
In fact, I wrote
an essay for Slate

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:08.280
about how I think
Elon Musk needs

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.110
to re-read Frankenstein, right?

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:13.230
Because I think, really,
the moral of the story

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:16.090
from that point of
view is we need

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:17.660
to take care of our inventions.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:21.570
We need to parent our work
when it goes into the world.

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:23.500
We need to prepare
the world for it.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.440
And, we need to parent
and nurture it,

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.310
or it will become monstrous.

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:30.400
And so, Frankenstein,
when we hear his story,

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.250
we can understand why
he does what he does.

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:36.530
But, we are better able
to judge it by hearing

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:38.680
that poor creature's
point of view.

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: You
mentioned at the beginning

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.810
that Frankenstein is often
regarded as the sort of,

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:47.200
the first real science
fiction novel.

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.990
You know, this is
a view promulgated

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:55.040
by the writer Brian Aldiss, in a
book called Billion Year Spree.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.450
What is there about Frankenstein

00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:59.780
that makes it a science
fiction novel as opposed to some

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:02.370
of the earlier, you
know, candidates.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:05.150
Things like the Voyages
to the Moon you get

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:07.990
from Cyrano de Bergerac
and the like.

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:12.730
Is it simply because it's
a scientist who determines

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:16.360
to conduct a kind of experiment?

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:21.480
And, this is really the
first such incidence of this?

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.870
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
I don't know.

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:24.670
I'm just so-- I feel
like Michael and I,

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:27.120
we should go right
out to dinner to--

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.420
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Well, I mean--

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:29.720
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.020
It's such a great question.

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:32.320
So--

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.620
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: The
interesting thing is

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:37.070
that although we only remember
Mary Shelley for Frankenstein,

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:40.470
she went on to write
other, sort of,

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:44.050
science fictional
and Gothic-y works.

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:47.510
She wrote a novel about the
elixir of life, called--

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:50.190
well, short story--
The Mortal Immortal.

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:52.360
And, she wrote a novel about,

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.900
essentially the end
of the world.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.200
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.690
The Last Man.

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:59.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: The Last Man.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.910
And is really-- ends
with one guy left alive.

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:03.700
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Roaming the earth.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: It's one

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.470
of the great science
fiction themes.

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:08.050
There's others.

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:14.170
Was there any influence
on the novel that you know

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:17.270
of from legend-- the
Jewish legend of the gloom.

00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:18.830
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Oh,
I've wondered that myself.

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:21.730
I haven't found evidence,
and I've wondered about that.

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:23.030
I don't know.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.330
I don't know.

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:26.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: You know, the
golem was created out of clay

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:31.730
by a rabbi of Prague,
and came alive

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:34.280
to help protect the
Jews of Prague.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.600
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Because Mary was Mary,

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.030
she kept copious reading lists.

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:40.330
I love Mary.

00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:41.710
I mean, when she got
sad and depressed,

00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:43.980
she taught herself
ancient Greek.

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:47.730
Like, I know-- she was
amazingly self-disciplined.

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:50.050
One of her disciplines
was keeping a reading list

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:51.730
of all the books that she read.

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:53.030
And so, we know what
she was reading

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:54.370
when she was writing
Frankenstein.

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:56.540
And, one of the most
influential books that she

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.590
and Percy read during this time
were descriptions of slavery

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:02.610
in Barbados and Jamaica.

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:05.660
In fact, they gave up
sugar during this time.

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.890
They were, you know,
political activists,

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:10.620
which was Richard Holmes's great
contribution in his biography

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:13.880
of Percy, is showing how
politically active Percy was.

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:17.120
But, I think in terms
of the science question,

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.610
Holmes also wrote a book

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:21.030
that I know Michael knows
called The Age of Wonder.

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:22.520
And, I don't want to be--

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: I reviewed it.

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.160
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:29.470
And, something that I think
that he knows as well as I do,

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:32.220
and I think many of you
know, is the word science,

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:35.560
as we know it today, had
very different meanings then.

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.000
People weren't scientists,
right?

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.310
You did science, and
you were also a poet,

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:42.610
and you might look at the stars.

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:47.190
So, if you're Percy, you might
burn paper boats on a lake,

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:50.240
or sit up in the barn all night,
to see if a ghost would come.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:53.630
But, that was all investigation.

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:57.460
So, Mary wouldn't have seen--
she would have been confused

00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:01.690
by the word science
as we used it.

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:06.720
For her, she would say this book
is a story about an imagination,

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:11.380
obsession, ambition, men
and women, community.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:13.290
But, she would say it's
more about invention

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:16.350
and imagination than science.

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:19.020
You can see why we would
call it science, right?

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.860
We've got a guy,
essentially in a lab.

00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.420
We've got him in a lab.

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:23.970
But, I love what he's reading.

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:26.540
It's not like he's working
with [inaudible], you know.

00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:30.630
He's reading, you
know, those crazies.

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:32.610
He's a great reader,
Frankenstein.

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: I think
a [inaudible] now is

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:40.390
that Victor Frankenstein, the
creature are in some ways twins.

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:41.690
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:42.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: They're
sort of Jekyll and Hyde.

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:44.290
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Did
you see the National?

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:46.120
Did you see that
production of Frankenstein?

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.420
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: No.

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.360
Oh, I know that Benedict
Cumberbatch--

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.660
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: -- and
Johnny Lee Miller played the--

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:56.930
Victor and the creature,
and they would alternate

00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:59.660
from day to day who was who.

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:01.760
Whom. But, I didn't see it.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.060
Did you see it?

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:04.360
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Was it good?

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.960
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Oh, it was unbelievable.

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Who was the
monster and the [inaudible]?

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:09.560
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: I saw it
twice, so I could see them both.

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:10.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda:
You saw it twice?

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.160
Really? And, which was better?

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.460
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: I know.

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.760
I wanted to have an opinion.

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.060
It's like we're reading
the book, right?

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.360
I thought they were
both amazing.

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.960
They were amazing.

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Wow.

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:21.560
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
It was so sympathet--

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.860
and then, I read the-- did you
read the interviews with them

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.160
about what it was like?

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: No.

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:26.760
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
I mean, I think it's--

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.060
to really responsibly
read Frankenstein,

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.380
I feel like you have to
have that experience, right?

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.090
To be Frankenstein,
and to be the creature.

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:35.610
You have to embody both
of those points of view.

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:38.410
As well as the sister back home.

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:39.710
[inaudible]

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:41.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: I think
maybe we should open

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:42.310
to some questions now.

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:43.610
Yes?

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:45.540
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank you.

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:46.840
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.880
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] I think
that this work is,

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.400
as far as science
fiction is concerned,

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.560
what differentiates it
from fantasy, for example,

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:58.110
looping back [inaudible]
ancient Greek times,

00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:00.350
and voyages to other worlds.

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.970
And, that's fantasy.

00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:04.620
[inaudible] scientific ideas,

00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:08.990
more about [inaudible] some
future time [inaudible]

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:10.490
or possible.

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:15.420
But, what I want to say is,

00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:20.370
along those lines,
this is very today.

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:23.450
It's very meaningful
to me, Frankenstein,

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:26.850
because of the ability to--

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:32.460
for artificial intelligence,
and androids perhaps.

00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:35.170
And, this is a Faustian
kind of tale.

00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:37.020
Faustian hubris.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:40.950
And one of the lessons
we might learn from this,

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:44.980
especially now [inaudible] we
can become Doctor Frankenstein,

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:50.660
say, a scientist, is
what lines can you cross.

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:52.850
[inaudible] to be Prometheus?

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:58.690
To bring, you know-- to
create life, and what is this?

00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:00.590
Is this a cautionary tale?

00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:05.040
Or [inaudible] because
scientists can do it.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.500
They will do it.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.620
Maybe not in our country,
but in another country.

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.550
And so-- and I separate
from that,

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:14.510
we're going to have artificial
intelligence, probably.

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:16.640
We're going to have androids.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.940
Are they slaves?

00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:21.430
Are they like, you know,
like children [inaudible]

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:26.190
so it brings up a whole host
of relevant questions today.

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:27.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: I'm going

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:29.090
to repeat the gist
of what he just said.

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:30.390
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: It
was beautifully said.

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:32.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda:
Just for the playback.

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:38.210
Basically, that Frankenstein
seems all the more relevant

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:42.840
today, because of our
rapidly expanding technology,

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:45.700
and to artificial
intelligence, and development

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.800
of robots, and androids.

00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:51.640
And, more than ever, it's
a useful cautionary tale

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:59.880
about limits, about examining
what we're actually doing

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:07.020
when we create new forms
of intelligent beings,

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:10.600
as machines in some
ways might be called.

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.050
And, that's true.

00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:13.390
I mean, this is what it's--

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:16.390
it's a book that we
keep coming back to.

00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:21.520
I mean-- I guess the most
famous revisiting of the novel,

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:26.120
in a way, might be H.G. Wells's
The Island of Doctor Moreau,

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:32.390
where we see again the
creation of creatures out of--

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:36.420
in this case, out of animals,
which are intelligent.

00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:40.090
But with, you know,
horrible consequences still.

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:42.390
Are there other questions?

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:46.710
&gt;&gt; Did Mary Shelley during
her life have any inkling

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:49.510
of how influential
her book had become,

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:54.530
or was it really the movies
that helped spread this story?

00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:56.550
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Did
Mary Shelley have any inkling

00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:58.590
of how influential
the book would become.

00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:01.140
It is the most-taught
book, apparently,

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.440
at least in this country.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.690
I know, isn't that interesting?

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:06.580
My students, if I
say Percy Shelley

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.190
to them, they're like, who?

01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:11.510
If I say-- and I say he was
married to Mary Shelley,

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:13.680
the author of Frankenstein,
and the all say.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.220
Oh. Unlike you.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.010
[inaudible] Anyway.

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:19.800
No, she didn't.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:24.370
I think 500 copies were
the initial print run.

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:25.730
They didn't sell out.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:27.830
She made no money
from Frankenstein.

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:29.690
She was in Italy
when it did come out.

01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:32.730
When she came back home,
and it had been discovered

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:36.650
that she was the author, and she
was, you know, in social exile,

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:41.390
by that time, playwrights and
theater troupes, so, you know,

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:44.920
the 18th century ideas of
movies, had taken the story,

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.700
and in those times,
you weren't protected

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.330
if you were a novelist,
by copyright.

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:51.730
So, they could do whatever
they wanted with your story.

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:55.040
So, they were putting
it on the London stage.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.450
And there were protests
against it.

01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:57.750
You know, people marching

01:00:57.750 --> 01:01:00.070
with placards saying this
is, you know, immoral.

01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:03.890
But, Frankenstein-- she writes
a letter saying I've come home

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:05.770
and found myself famous.

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:08.290
So, she knows that
Frankenstein has become part

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:09.640
of the popular conversation.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.790
And, the word Frankenstein
itself, very quickly,

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:15.940
becomes no the scientist,
but the monster.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.940
There's an early political
cartoon that shows,

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.240
I think it's the Irish.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.370
I forget. This book now is
five years-- four years old.

01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:24.670
That's my only excuse.

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:28.060
It's either the Irish are
being depicted as a monster,

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.670
Frankenstein, or the English.

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:32.140
I forget. Sorry.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:37.370
But, the word Frankenstein and
the elision between Frankenstein

01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:39.990
and the monster happens
very early on.

01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:43.480
So, she does know
that it's, you know,

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.140
had sort of a cultural
impact, enough that she's going

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.900
to be asked to revise
it in 1831.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.760
And, she becomes, you know,

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.510
she starts to head the
list of her publisher.

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:57.730
She is well-known as
a literary person.

01:01:57.730 --> 01:01:59.330
But, she never would
have dreamed

01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:01.700
that she would become
a household name,

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.050
or that everybody would
read Frankenstein.

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:06.340
Ever. She would never
have known that.

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.910
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: I
love the first title

01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:10.870
for when it became a stage play.

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:15.350
It was called Presumption,
or the fate of Frankenstein.

01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:17.570
And-- which tells you a lot.

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:18.870
Right there.

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:23.420
But, certainly the
James Whale movie,

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:28.720
and Boris Karloff have made
it universally recognizable.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.180
Do you feel any kind of
resentment about the film,

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.910
that it gives a false
interpretation

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:37.620
and view of the novel?

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.390
And, that too many people are--

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:43.410
think that the book is in
fact something like the movie,

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:46.830
when it is very little
like the movie.

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:49.080
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Do you?

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Do I?

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:51.750
I've never been a movie person.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.050
So, I'm a book guy.

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:56.890
So, yes. Anything that'll
put down movies, negatively,

01:02:56.890 --> 01:02:58.630
is good as far as I'm concerned.

01:02:58.630 --> 01:03:02.340
Our culture's too involved with
film as far as I'm concerned.

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:05.050
But, I'm out of place
and out of time.

01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:06.950
So, yes. I prefer the book

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.220
because the book raises
all kinds of questions

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:10.780
that the movie just skirts.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.080
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.240
&gt;&gt; I'm interested to learn

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:22.270
from your talk tonight how
socially [inaudible] they were

01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:25.190
about not eating
sugar after learning

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:27.460
about Barbados and Jamaica.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:32.010
Could you tell us
a little bit more

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:33.310
about their social activism?

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.610
[inaudible]

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:35.910
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:37.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Free thinkers.

01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:38.510
Atheists. The works.

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:39.810
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Anti-marriage.

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:41.110
Anti-institution.

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:42.410
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:43.710
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Shelley--

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.010
I mean, there's so many
funny stories about Shelley,

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:46.310
I don't know which one of
us should jump on that.

01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:47.610
So, the question is--

01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:48.910
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:50.210
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Shelley was.

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.510
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:52.810
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:54.110
So, the question was
how active were they,

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:55.430
were Shelley and Mary?

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:56.730
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:59.190
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: So,
we can both answer this,

01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:00.980
but one of the great
contributions

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:04.510
that Richard Holmes
does, is he gives us a--

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:06.210
and this book is very, very old.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.510
It's his first biography.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.630
And, it's a biography
of Percy Shelley.

01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:13.240
And, he gives us this
complete picture of Percy

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.270
as essential a radical.

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:20.210
Ad, thanks to Mary, who,
for many strategic reasons,

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:25.650
paints the dead Percy as kind
of an angelic Victorian figure,

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:30.540
we almost lose track of
the sort of bad boy Percy.

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.170
She says, you know,
he dies early

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:34.660
because he was too
good for this world.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.380
She mentions, never, any
of his atheism, his--

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:43.690
none of this was mentioned when
his editions of poems come out,

01:04:43.690 --> 01:04:46.180
so that they'll sell and
people will read them.

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:47.920
But, there's many famous
stories about Percy.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.610
He's kicked out of Oxford for
writing a tract about atheism.

01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:53.750
He goes up to Ireland
to campaign.

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:55.550
People don't know
what to make of him.

01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:56.850
He's like, come on.

01:04:56.850 --> 01:05:00.230
Unite! That's how he gets
in touch with Mary's family,

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:03.530
is he writes a fan
letter to William Godwin,

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:07.210
saying I really respect
your views on anarchy

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:09.010
and lack of government.

01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:12.060
I'd really like to meet
you and support you.

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:15.070
And, Godwin, who always needs
money thinks this young nobleman

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:16.410
would be of interest to meet.

01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:18.360
And, that's how Mary
ends up meeting him.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.940
But, Percy would do things
like sending political messages

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:26.410
in bottles out in the sea, and
send fiery kites up into the--

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:28.500
you know, so people
would hear the message

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:31.240
of freedom for all, and justice.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.410
He wrote a very famous poem--

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:34.710
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: [inaudible]

01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:36.010
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Portesting Peterloo.

01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:37.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: All in
all, he's the kind of guy

01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:40.210
who doesn't deserve to
have the name Percy.

01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:42.130
I mean, he's not at all--

01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:43.430
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: No.

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:44.730
He was wild.

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:46.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: -- that
kind of writer, and thinker.

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:50.980
He was very much against
everything, basically.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.280
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: And, lived as
free a life as he could imagine.

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.320
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
And that-- he didn't--

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.740
the always interesting
contradiction to me is,

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.630
he didn't pay his bills either.

01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:00.760
So, there he was fighting for
the rights of working men,

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.060
and then they'd like--

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.360
&gt;&gt; He wouldn't pay them.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.660
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: No.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.960
He'd like, leave town.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: There
was another question here?

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.060
Yes?

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:19.090
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:20.660
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
This is on Frankenstein.

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:25.070
So, Frankenstein is actually
first received most popularly

01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:26.480
by the French.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.560
Which I think is
really interesting.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.630
You know, there's a lot of
disorganization in Europe

01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:33.770
when this book comes out.

01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:35.550
And, Germany as we
know it doesn't--

01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:37.020
you know, it doesn't exist.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:39.490
But, the French are
very interested in it.

01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:43.560
And, she becomes kind of
a celebrity en France.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:48.790
And, I don't know when we could
really say the first German

01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:50.090
translation is.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:51.810
And, I think that's a
really interesting question.

01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:53.540
I want you to go
find out and tell me.

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.680
I never thought to ask.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.980
I never thought to ask--

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.280
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.580
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Can I
tell you one thing about Mary

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:00.880
and translations, though?

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.640
Which is so off-topic.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.710
So, Mary always has to make
a living after Percy dies.

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:08.660
She's always trying to
make a living with her pen,

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:09.960
just like her mother did.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.090
And, she does go on and
write five more novels,

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:13.390
which are all really
interesting,

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:14.690
and not very readable.

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:19.150
Because they're very informed by
ideas, and not by ideas like how

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:21.840
to make a realistic
plot, and character--

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.190
you know, she's not
interested in any of that.

01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:27.190
And so, at the end of her
life, writing life, the first--

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:29.920
the guy who starts the
first English encyclopedia,

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.500
not the French one, comes to
her, and says, I would like you

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.210
to write the entries for us.

01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:39.910
For the great French authors,
the great Italian authors,

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:41.510
the great Portuguese writers.

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:44.500
I think also the
great Greek writers.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:49.320
And, Mary is the only-- he asks
her this, not because he wants

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.610
to include a woman in
his stable of writers,

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:53.460
because she is the only woman.

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.070
It's because she's the
only English writer

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:57.130
who knows all of
those languages.

01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:59.970
Se was so exquisitely
self-educated.

01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:01.640
And, she enjoyed
doing these entries.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.170
She was really a great
writer of non-fiction.

01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:06.320
These are her hardest
works to find,

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.400
because they were encyclopedia
entries that weren't signed.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.760
So, she goes to the man, and
she says, I really enjoyed this,

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:16.630
I think we should do an
encyclopedia of women writers.

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:20.080
And he, scoffed at
that and said, well A,

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.130
no one would read it,
and B, there aren't any.

01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:23.610
And so, no thank you.

01:08:23.610 --> 01:08:25.290
So, here's what she does.

01:08:25.290 --> 01:08:27.270
She writes these
sort of palimpsests.

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:30.880
She writes, for example--

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:34.300
this is my version of
her Michel de Montaigne--

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:38.590
Michel de Montaigne, great
French essayist was helped

01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:41.040
by his niece, Marie,
a great editor,

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.890
and a poet in her own right.

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:47.310
Here is an example of one of
her poems in the entirety.

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:49.860
So, this was very
much how she operated.

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:52.900
So, I think this is so not
an answer to your question,

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:54.310
but the word translation.

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:57.220
I just wanted you to know
how Mary Shelley operated

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.610
as a political activist.

01:08:58.610 --> 01:09:02.230
She had to figure out a way
during the Victorian era

01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:06.470
to get her points across in a
way that was far more difficult

01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:07.780
than the preceding generation,

01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:10.460
where Mary Wollstonecraft was
a famous political activist.

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:12.040
I mean, she was a
famous radical,

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.340
and so was William Godwin.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:16.780
And, actually it was harder
to be an activist when Percy

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.080
and Mary were together,

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.730
and later when Victoria
takes the throne.

01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:23.080
It's harder to be an activist.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.930
You have to figure out
different ways to do it.

01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:26.730
It was dangerous.

01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:39.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.460
She was a language person.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.480
So, Percy knew Greek and Latin.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:45.630
And so, he was actually
her first teacher

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:46.930
with Greek and Latin.

01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:48.250
Then, they spent so
much time in Italy.

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:51.260
And then, she believed that, you
know, every civilized person--

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.370
oh, I think it was actually
Spanish and Portuguese.

01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:58.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: I wonder
if-- did she know Beckford?

01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:00.120
William Beckford who
wrote Vathek, or Vathek.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.420
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Oh.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Which
was sort of influence on--

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.570
you know, it was
30 years earlier--

01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:07.430
but an influence
on Frankenstein.

01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:10.890
But, he wrote a famous journal
about his time in Portugal.

01:10:10.890 --> 01:10:12.670
And, there could possibly be--

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:13.970
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
That's great.

01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:15.270
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: --
of interest to that.

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:16.570
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: I
never thought of that.

01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:17.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Kincaid and
the Portuguese literature.

01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:19.400
Just speculation.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.700
Are there other questions?

01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:29.510
If not, I think-- oh wait,
there's one last question there.

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:35.070
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:36.370
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
That's interesting.

01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:37.670
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:38.970
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:42.890
It sort of makes sense, because
when you asked that question,

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:46.020
it doesn't come to mind.

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:48.070
Thank you.

01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:51.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: And, it's
interesting, that timing, 1912.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:56.860
Which is about the time
there was a great compromise,

01:10:56.860 --> 01:11:01.660
German horror writer, Hanns
Heinz Ewers, who wrote novels

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:05.080
about creation of
kinds of Frankensteins.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:09.970
He later was compromised
because he joined the Nazis

01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:12.300
and wrote the Horse Vessel song.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:17.070
But, [inaudible], vampire,
and a couple of other books,

01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:22.170
all deal with very much
Frankensteinian themes.

01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:29.210
So, an interesting
juxtaposition of time.

01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:30.510
Well-- oh.

01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:31.810
In the back.

01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:33.610
Another question, still.

01:11:33.610 --> 01:11:38.100
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.880
Vathek. William Beckford.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:46.000
It's an Arabian nights-style
Gothic romance

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.800
about a very corrupt khalif,
and what happens to him.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.550
V-a-t-h-e-k.

01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:57.850
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:04.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Well, it's--
it leads to his own destruction.

01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:06.590
He's gone too far, basically.

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:08.710
The idea of presumption,

01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:12.210
of going beyond the
limits of what is proper.

01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:14.680
He's taken-- in a
way you could argue

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.450
that Victor Frankenstein's
assuming either God-like role,

01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:26.340
or taking the woman's position
in a way, part of your theory--

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:32.410
not theory, but viewpoint,
that he is--

01:12:32.410 --> 01:12:33.710
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Assuming.

01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:35.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda:
Assuming powers

01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:39.120
that don't belong
to human beings.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.550
Again, are there
any final questions?

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:44.650
&gt;&gt; What's your next book?

01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:45.950
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon:
Which one of us-- ?

01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:47.250
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:49.880
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: We know
what Michael's next book is.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.230
I want him to hurry up.

01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:54.810
We have to send him home, so
he can go back to writing it.

01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:57.880
I'm returning to
17th century America.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.180
So, yes.

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:00.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: That's
all you want to say?

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.780
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Yes.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.080
Sort of a mess right now.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.380
Your'e smart.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda:
Well, good luck.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:06.980
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: Thank you.

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:08.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: [inaudible]

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.080
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Gordon: [laughs]

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.300
