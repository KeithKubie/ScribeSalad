homes today comes through a series of
 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:09.720
homes today comes through a series of
water treatment processes and piping and

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730
water treatment processes and piping and
 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.190
water treatment processes and piping and
pumps and you know things that bring

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200
pumps and you know things that bring
 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.259
pumps and you know things that bring
that water to us today and then the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269
that water to us today and then the
 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.029
that water to us today and then the
wastewater is returned back to treatment

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.039
wastewater is returned back to treatment
 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.460
wastewater is returned back to treatment
to treatment plants a couple of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470
to treatment plants a couple of
 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.020
to treatment plants a couple of
challenges those municipalities are

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.030
challenges those municipalities are
 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.630
challenges those municipalities are
facing one is that the infrastructure is

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640
facing one is that the infrastructure is
 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.990
facing one is that the infrastructure is
aging it's leaking there's between a lot

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000
aging it's leaking there's between a lot
 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.090

of cities have between 30 and 60 percent

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100
of cities have between 30 and 60 percent
 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.590
of cities have between 30 and 60 percent
of the water that they produce never

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600
of the water that they produce never
 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.880
of the water that they produce never
makes it to the end of the line because

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890
makes it to the end of the line because
 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.800
makes it to the end of the line because
it leaks out of these pipes it's

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810
it leaks out of these pipes it's
 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.299
it leaks out of these pipes it's
difficult for them to replace it because

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309
difficult for them to replace it because
 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.180
difficult for them to replace it because
there just isn't the reserve the revenue

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190
there just isn't the reserve the revenue
 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.810
there just isn't the reserve the revenue
to be able to invest in this replacement

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820
to be able to invest in this replacement
 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.060
to be able to invest in this replacement
one of the other challenges is it's very

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070
one of the other challenges is it's very
 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.459
one of the other challenges is it's very
energy intensive between three and

municipalities budget goes to energy to
 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.520
municipalities budget goes to energy to
produce and pump this water around so we

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530
produce and pump this water around so we
 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.369
produce and pump this water around so we
look at smart grid type of technology

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379
look at smart grid type of technology
 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.590
look at smart grid type of technology
not unlike we see in the energy smart

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600
not unlike we see in the energy smart
 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.770

improve this system part of that is to

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300
improve this system part of that is to
 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.000
improve this system part of that is to
be able to detect where are these leaks

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010
be able to detect where are these leaks
 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.490

infrastructure we as consumers if we

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890
infrastructure we as consumers if we
 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.440
infrastructure we as consumers if we
really understood where our water was

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450
really understood where our water was
 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.480
really understood where our water was
was going and we had some control over

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490
was going and we had some control over
 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.580
was going and we had some control over
that and we could you know use the water

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590
that and we could you know use the water
 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.709
that and we could you know use the water
and off-peak hours all the same type of

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719

grid I think it would really improve our

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619
grid I think it would really improve our
 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.120

overall consumptive habits of water

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
overall consumptive habits of water
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.069
overall consumptive habits of water
another thing is that there the water

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079
another thing is that there the water
 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.740

pricing structure is it's a real

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750
pricing structure is it's a real
 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.779
pricing structure is it's a real
challenge for us today many parts of the

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789
challenge for us today many parts of the
 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.340
challenge for us today many parts of the
world including many parts of United

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350
world including many parts of United
 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.649

States basically water is free and so as

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659
States basically water is free and so as
 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.300
States basically water is free and so as
long as water is free or highly

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310
long as water is free or highly
 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.459

subsidized there's really there's

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469
subsidized there's really there's
 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.190

there's kind of no incentive for us to

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200
there's kind of no incentive for us to
 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.929
there's kind of no incentive for us to
reduce our consumption or change our

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939
reduce our consumption or change our
 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.940
reduce our consumption or change our
behaviors so I think a smart system

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950
behaviors so I think a smart system
 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.800
behaviors so I think a smart system
would give us that insight that we need

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810
would give us that insight that we need
 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.870
would give us that insight that we need
to really change behaviors because I do

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880
to really change behaviors because I do
 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.169
to really change behaviors because I do
think people want to want to be smart

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179
think people want to want to be smart
 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:08.940
think people want to want to be smart
consumers of our water but without that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950
consumers of our water but without that
 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.889
consumers of our water but without that
information it's very difficult to make

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.230
 
there's a lot of really smart

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240
there's a lot of really smart
 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.270
