00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:15.320
STUDENT: All right.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.870
It's a ball.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.870
STUDENT: Red ball.

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:21.166
KYLE KEANE: Hold the
red ball for a moment.

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.580
And then, you're going to
start tossing it again.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.420
But I'm going to
add a blue ball in.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.326
STUDENT: Oh no.

00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:25.962
KYLE KEANE: And
now you guys have

00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:27.930
got to keep all the
balls in the air.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.640
All right.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.590
So I'm gonna give the creation
of the blue ball to else.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.857
Would you like to
create the blue ball?

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:36.440
STUDENT: Sure.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.944
KYLE KEANE: All right.

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:39.620
All right.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.464
And then it should be kind of
distinct from the red ball.

00:00:43.464 --> 00:00:45.884
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:49.185
And when you're ready,
pass the blue ball.

00:00:49.185 --> 00:00:51.002
And when you're ready,
pass the red ball.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:52.648
Let's see if we can
keep both going.

00:00:52.648 --> 00:00:54.112
STUDENT: So red ball?

00:00:54.112 --> 00:00:54.910
STUDENT: Red ball.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.010
STUDENT: Blue ball.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.860
