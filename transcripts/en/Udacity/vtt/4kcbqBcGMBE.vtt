00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.240
Containers were developed to solve
problems with installing and

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.500
running software across different
operating environments.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.328
You saw the problems
of just installing and

00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:10.374
running the applications
on a single machine.

00:00:10.374 --> 00:00:11.936
Now imagine trying to run and

00:00:11.936 --> 00:00:15.395
install EngineX on multiple
machines across different OSes.

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:17.535
It would be a nightmare.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:18.336
With containers,

00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:22.100
you get independent self-contained
packages that avoid version conflicts.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.530
This is part of the appeal
of container images.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.660
They're easy to distribute
because they carry all of their

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.550
dependencies with them.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.620
Now, the point of containers is that we
want isolation from various processes.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.790
We've already talked about
isolation of the file system level,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.150
but there are other
kinds of isolation too.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.620
For instance,
network isolation means that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.250
each instance gets its own IP address.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.120
They're all free to buy in port 80,
which is EngineX's default port,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.480
without us having to deal with any
init scripts or startup files.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.430
An important concept to note,
whereas two separate virtual

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.090
machines on a computer will
run two whole separate OSes,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.850
multiple containers run in
the same operating system,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.070
because containers are a logical
construct we use within the OS.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.150
That's what makes them so lightweight,
and easy to start up and shut down.
