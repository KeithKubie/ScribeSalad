00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.738
Let's try adding a new property to the blue object.

00:00:02.738 --> 00:00:05.822
Now of course, when we go to do a lookup on a property that got

00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:09.490
copied onto the blue object, we get the value we'd expect.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.270
Which was originally copied over from gold.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.079
And it's no different for the property that was added manually by our code.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.110
As with the gold object, a lookup for

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.160
a property that isn't available on blue should result in undefined.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.795
Let's make another replica of the gold object,

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:28.409
this time using a different strategy to achieve that similarity.

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.379
Rather than copying the properties over one by one,

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.590
the idea would be to give the rose object some linkage to the gold object.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.820
Such that whenever a requested property can't be found on rose,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.622
it uses gold as sort of a fall back source of properties.

00:00:43.622 --> 00:00:46.540
The Object.create function can create objects for

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.940
you that have this delegation lookup feature.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.600
Just pass in your desired fall back object.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.060
And it produces a new object, that delegates field lookups to the fallback.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.060
You can still interact with this special new object in the same way you

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.820
would any other regular object.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.480
But when you ask that object for a property that can't be

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.226
found directly on the object itself, it does something rather interesting.

00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:11.626
The lookup falls through, up the chain to the prototype object.

00:01:11.626 --> 00:01:14.270
So what do you think will get logged in this situation?
