ROMAN NURIK: All right,
I think we're live.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.610
All right, so assuming that
we're live, hello everybody,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.870
and welcome to this
week's episode of

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.580
Android Design in Action.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.875
We don't have a theme or topic
this week, or any set of

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:20.730
redesigns today.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.720
What we'll be doing instead is
having a hangout with a bunch

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.580
of folks from the design
community.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.770
I don't know if this is public
and free to join--

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.960
not free to join.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.040
If you're able to join.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.520
If you, for some reason, cannot
join and you do want to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.020
join, just go to the Google+
page for Android developers

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.120
and leave a comment on this
post, and we'll go ahead and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.010
invite you so that
you can join.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.160
So we're just going to have a
Q&amp;A general discussion type

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.470
event today.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.500
Before we get started, let's
do some quick introductions

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.800
for folks that are
already here.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.170
I'll start.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.110
So I'm Roman Nurik.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.200
I'm on our Android Developer
Relations Team at Google, and

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.150
I'm one of the co-hosts of
Android Design in Action.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.340
ADAM KOCH: Hey guys,
Adam Koch.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.404
I'm also one of the co-hosts
on the show.

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.830
If we go over to London.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.485
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:18.420
So, Nick Butcher here, another
Android developer advocate.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.480
And I'm joined by--

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.830
CHRIS BANES: Chris Banes is also
one of the dev rel for

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.460
Android, but I'm a
guest this week.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.710
I don't usually come
into this.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.210
Who else have we got?

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.980
ROMAN NURIK: All right, should
we head over to Marie?

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.780
MARIE SCHWEIZ: Hi, I'm Marie.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.560
I'm an Android designer for four
years, and now in Berlin

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.084
as creative director
for Novoda.

00:01:41.084 --> 00:01:42.080
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.990
And Juhani?

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.685
JUHANI LEHTIMAKI: Hey guys.

00:01:44.685 --> 00:01:46.240
So I'm Juhani.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.350
I'm a developer, but
I'm a design fan.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.190
I've wrote a book Smashing
Android UI and write a blog in

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.550
androiduipatterns.com, and
I work for Snapp TV.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.890
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.120
All right.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.340
So, Dandre was here,
and then he left.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.280
Let's head over to Andreas.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.990
Andreas, do you want to
introduce yourself?

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.085
Or if you want, do you have any
immediate questions you

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:16.335
want to ask?

00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:22.080
Or not, OK.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.070
Let's head over to Dandre.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.910
How about you?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.250
How's it going, man?

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.550
MALE SPEAKER: Hey,
can you hear me?

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.450
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, we can
year you just fine.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.700
MALE SPEAKER: Dandre.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.890
I'm an Android developer and
designer from San Francisco.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.800
ROMAN NURIK: Cool,
welcome, man.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.730
And we also have Lucas.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.830
Hey Lucas, how's it going?

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.933
Do you want to introduce
yourself real quick?

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:48.850
LUCAS ROCHA: Hello,
can you hear me?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.260
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, we can
hear you just fine.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.010
LUCAS ROCHA: OK.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.730
So, I work for Mozilla.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.400
My day job is Mozilla, working
on Firefox for Android.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.720
And I also created an
app called Pattrn.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.640
It's a wallpaper app.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.570
We've got quite a few downloads
in Google Play.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.090
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, it's been
featured numerous times.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.165
Good stuff.

00:03:15.165 --> 00:03:16.524
All right, let's see
who else is here.

00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:17.570
I think David Jones.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.970
I'll go ahead and unmute you,
good sir, and Ron Elam.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.380
So, if anybody hasn't introduced
themselves and

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.510
wants to, feel free.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.950
Otherwise, let's jump into the
meat of today, which is kind

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.710
of general discussion and Q&amp;A.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.272
So before, we actually have a
Google Moderator page set up,

00:03:39.272 --> 00:03:41.140
and we have a few questions
in there.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.560
We'll get to that if there's
time, but if anybody has any

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.170
initial points of discussion or
topics they want to raise,

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.620
or questions that you want other
folks to provide their

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.170
feedback on, please
go ahead and ask.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.890
So anybody want to kick things
off with their own questions

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.490
or points of discussion?

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.290
No?

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.468
NICK BUTCHER: No one's
got any questions?

00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:13.880
Perfectly satisfied.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.564
JUHANI LEHTIMAKI: I have a topic
we can discuss, but I

00:04:15.564 --> 00:04:17.870
don't have any questions.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.440
ROMAN NURIK: Sure.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.270
Juhani, you want to go ahead
and introduce the topic?

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.260
JUHANI LEHTIMAKI: So, the up
and side navigation, or the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.240
drawer navigation.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.790
It's great, right?

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.150
But it's quite messy
right now.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.500
So we've got to figure out how
to [INAUDIBLE], because now

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.600
even Google applications
work quite differently.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.395
Google+ you can't swipe, and
YouTube you can't swipe to

00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:45.050
other navigation
apps and so on.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.630
I wonder if you guys have a
recommendation what you feel

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.840
the interaction should be.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.670
Should you reserve a bezel swipe
for it, or does swipe

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.420
always work?

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.370
And my personal opinion about
the icon is that it's the up

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.020
icon, but I know you
guys haven't--

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.990
but let's see what's going
to happen with that.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.420
Mostly about the interaction
like swiping and stuff, how

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.250
you feel as to that?

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.510
ROMAN NURIK: So I guess we could
probably talk about the

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.810
navigation drawer, and I'll
probably take up some time.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.030
And that was actually
the number one

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.070
question in the moderator.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.750
I think it got something
like 20 votes.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.440
I actually put together a little
bit of, not really

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.310
documentation.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.550
It's the unofficial
recommendations from our team

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.970
about what we've been
recommending to folks publicly

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.630
as well as internally.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.180
And we could probably
start with that.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.570
So let me just share that real
quick, and then as you guys

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:46.250
want to talk about what your
feelings are towards the

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.080
subject, then feel free.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.540
So I'm going to screen share
my tiny little guide on

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.600
navigation drawers.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.660
I don't know if you
guys can see that.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.695
You guys can see that?

00:05:56.695 --> 00:05:58.030
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.590
ROMAN NURIK: So the current
guidelines are, basically, a

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.350
drawer is a slide out menu that
allows users to switch

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.590
between views of your app.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.600
And it's obviously exposed using
the action bar's app

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.640
icon with the up current and
revealed by an edge swipe.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.510
And actually in some cases like
the YouTube app, it's not

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.260
really an edge swipe, it's
a full screen swipe.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.695
Anyway, that makes sense, and
personally, my opinion is that

00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:24.910
it makes a lot of sense to do a
full screen swipe when there

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.160
aren't competing gestures.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.430
For example, if you don't
have swipe to dismiss--

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.140
Actually, hold on.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.050
AJ just joined.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.120
Let me go ahead and unmute AJ.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.980
Hey AJ, how's it going?

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.510
So when you don't have swipe to
dismiss, or you don't have

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.980
other horizontal gestures like
for example a map as your

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.720
primary content view, I think
it makes sense to do a full

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.610
screen swipe, because that's
probably what people are

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.350
trying to do anyway.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.630
That's just, again,
really my opinion.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.580
And the current guidelines say
edge swipe, and I'd say that,

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.110
by default, you should
probably just

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.980
used the edge swipe.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.960
The other thing is that--

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.410
where is it--

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.300
only suitable for the
topmost level.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.520
So another thing that folks
sometimes use drawers for--

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.600
and hold on, let me
unmute David.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.550
He just joined.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.430
The other thing that people use
drawers for is to provide

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.560
exposed global navigation
throughout the app.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.880
For example, if I'm in a detail
screen three levels

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.210
deep somewhere, what if I want
to expose global navigation,

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.540
let the user do a full
context switch?

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.650
And sometimes folks use
drawers for that.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.930
I don't think that that really
fits in with how they're meant

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.690
to used on Android, but
certainly it's something

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.300
that's become popularized.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.980
So the current guidelines don't
really call for exposing

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.060
drawers in deeper levels, but
it's definitely something that

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.660
we can explore.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:56.450
If you guys have feedback or
arguments either way in this

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.670
direction, feel free
to speak up.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.470
NICK BUTCHER: It's my position
that it's kind of dictated by

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.150
the content somewhat.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.950
If you have a strong hierarchy
to your content, then I feel

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.060
like the up button should always
take you up through

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.680
that hierarchy of content,
and it shouldn't be

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.562
exposing the drawer.

00:08:13.562 --> 00:08:15.370
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.520
That's fair.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.090
Anybody else?

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.350
Any other thoughts?

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.750
Actually, this is one thing
that's pretty common right now

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.940
is using the drawer for global
access and using, instead of

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.409
the up icon or the up counter
in the app icon, using the

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.640
three horizontal lines.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.159
And I know you guys can't
really see who's talking

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.690
because I'm sharing the
hangout screen, but--

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.049
Something like that is a little
more common on other

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.310
platforms, and so it's
definitely something that I

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.890
think that we should try to
standardize on at some point

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.530
in the future.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:56.260
Actually, a little point about
the three horizontal lines is

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.070
somebody called that the
hamburger icon, because it's

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:05.550
basically two buns and meat
patty in between.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.590
But yeah, it's definitely
something that's been used

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.870
throughout, and I think that
users understand what it is,

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.590
the three horizontal lines,
but really the current

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.260
guidelines are for the app
icon and the up counter.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.450
Well, let me just jump into some
of the unofficial stuff

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.110
before I take this screen
off, so you can

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.020
see our faces again.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.580
So, like the current guidelines
say, only at the

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:34.880
top level, the up counter and
app icon, it should also not

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.800
slide the action bar.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.290
So this is a point
of contention.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.715
This is definitely something
that is a little inconsistent

00:09:39.715 --> 00:09:41.860
right now across Google Apps.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.830
So the Google+ app, for example,
does slide the action

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.490
bar out of the way to make
room for the drawer.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.960
The YouTube app does not.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.220
We definitely recommend not
sliding the action bar out of

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.850
the way, and I think there's
really two reasons for that.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.070
The first is that, from a
framework standpoint, from the

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.040
development standpoint,
it's actually kind of

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.950
difficult to do that.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:05.180
And it kind of imposes extra
effort and extra work to get

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.470
that done, and some people say,
in that case, let's just

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:10.940
recreate the action bar.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.030
Let's just reimplement the
action bar so that we can

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.490
slide it out of the way.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.240
And that's not really something
that you should be

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.150
doing, because there's a lot of
nuances with how the action

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.090
bar's implemented.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.120
So you should try to avoid
implementing the

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.450
action bar on your own.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.310
The other point is that the
action bar is really kind of a

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.870
core navigational anchor.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.730
It's really the number one
structural component of an

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.450
app, I'd say.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:42.950
And so moving that out of the
way slowly deteriorates this

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.940
relationship the user has
with that action bar.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.330
Making sure that it's stable is
very, very important, and

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.610
if you start moving it out of
the way and sliding it away

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.970
and so on, that could
potentially deteriorate the

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.295
experience.

00:10:54.295 --> 00:10:58.020
So those are the two points that
I'd say about sliding the

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.630
action bar.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.850
And then, again, edge swipe or
full swipe, and then the other

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.590
thing that folks sometimes put
into the navigation drawer is

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.290
things like settings and help.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.920
And we really don't recommend
putting things like settings

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.240
and help there, because those
are really meant to be in the

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.270
action overflow.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.680
The action overflow is those
three vertical dots in the

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:29.540
action bar that, when you press
them, you see additional

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.850
actions that you can take.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.040
And so settings, help, about,
feedback, terms of service,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.710
privacy policy, things like
that, those are really

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.650
overflow items.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.420
And so we feel that those should
belong in an action

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.230
overflow and not in the
navigation drawer.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:51.230
So these are the unofficial
other items I'd add to our

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.390
official guidelines.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.140
But certainly--

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.360
let me just turn off the
screen share there--

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.502
in terms of where we're going
with the guidelines, I think

00:11:58.502 --> 00:12:01.870
that there's definitely a lot
that we can add to the current

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.450
set of guidelines, and that's
something that we'll be doing

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:04.860
in the future.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.150
It's just a question of
time and resources.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.600
So hopefully at some point,
we'll do that.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.828
Anybody have any other
thoughts on

00:12:11.828 --> 00:12:12.320
the navigation drawer?

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.200
I just did a big spiel and took
a lot of time to talk

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.420
about it, but if you have
any thoughts, feel

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.180
free to speak up.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.380
ADAM KOCH: One quick thing I
wanted to mention is how you

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.440
said, don't move the action
bar out of the way.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.400
That works in with how you also
mentioned that settings,

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.030
about how it should be
in the overflow.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.680
I see a lot of people put those
things in their drawer,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.240
because they've slid across the
action bar, and now the

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.830
overflow's no loner
accessible.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.030
So that's another good reason
to keep the action bar in

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.570
place so that you can keep
that overflow still

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.820
accessible.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.200
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.150
NICK BUTCHER: Keep it to
navigation option as well.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.330
I think, because you have this
extra real estate, people get

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.070
tempted to dump all sorts of
extra information in there.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.620
And I think that really waters
down the power as a

00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.730
navigational tool.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.930
I tend to think of it as very
similar to the spinner

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.080
navigation like you might see
in Google Maps, for example.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.850
It's a similar thing, but if
you have a larger list of

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.360
items, it can become unwieldy
in that spinner

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.370
and harder to do.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.250
So I think the draw can be a
good alternative there, as

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.420
well as not sacrificing
some real estate.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.590
So don't be tempted to just
chuck any old thing in there

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.980
because you have some more
space and a vertically

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.230
scrolling container.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.250
JUHANI LEHTIMAKI: So I'm just
wondering if you guys have had

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:33.810
any chance to do any usability
testing of how users see the

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.530
site navigation with the
context of back button.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.390
Because I know if you guys
tried the [? Word ?]

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.270
application, I don't know if
they fixed it, but when it

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.780
first launched, the site
navigation actually was very

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.150
difficult to use because
it didn't make sense.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.420
When you backed, you actually
had to skip screens.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.030
I think the Google application
is quite good, but I don't

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.500
know if I'm just a special user
or how users in general

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.890
feel where the back should take
you after you navigate

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.560
within the site menu.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.140
ROMAN NURIK: I don't know too
much about the research we've

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.500
done specifically around
navigation drawers.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.496
I'm sure that we've done some
amount of research, but I

00:14:10.496 --> 00:14:13.520
don't really know the details.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.690
I know we did a whole bunch of
research on the action bar and

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:22.000
up icon, and that was
a few years ago.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.620
Maybe two years ago we did a big
study on that, but I think

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.740
that a lot of our guidance is
a result of direct user

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.780
testing with that.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.140
But the navigation drawer, I'm
not really sure what kind of

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.440
formal testing we've
done on it.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.770
So I don't really know how
to answer that question.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.340
NICK BUTCHER: I think a lot
of the weirdness with back

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.660
navigation falls out from
whether or not you make it

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.010
globally accessible as well,
because if you have

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.170
applications such as, say,
Spotify or something like

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.360
that, which let's you get to the
side drawer from anywhere,

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.610
then you can build up these
incredibly long back stacks,

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.150
which gets quite complicated.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.430
Whereas if you do stick to the
guidelines, Roman's unofficial

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.460
guidelines, of only making it
available from top level

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.390
navigation screens, then you
don't get these very, very

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:08.040
complex navigation stacks, and
I think the back button

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.040
becomes a lot clearer.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.400
ROMAN NURIK: That's
a fair point.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.080
Do you guys have any thoughts?

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.250
Again, since this is a kind of
a discussion and Q&amp;A, I don't

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:22.050
want to just be spewing out
recommendations from our team.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.560
I'd love to hear you guys'
thoughts on what's the right

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.200
way to do it, or even like, if
you don't like the up icon,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.625
and this is definitely something
that's been brought

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:32.525
up before, if you don't like
using the up icon or the up

00:15:32.525 --> 00:15:35.540
counter for this purpose, what
are the things have you

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.830
thought about, and
things like that.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.430
So this is not just for
official guidance.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.950
If you guys have thoughts,
please do share.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.835
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, Ed Lee in
the comments chimes in that

00:15:45.835 --> 00:15:47.820
the burger menu is getting
quite common.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.662
Even Chrome uses the icon.

00:15:50.662 --> 00:15:52.020
ROMAN NURIK: What?

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.715
NICK BUTCHER: I think
Chrome uses the icon

00:15:53.715 --> 00:15:55.800
in, is it in iOS?

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.190
CHRIS BANES: Yes.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.830
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, the
hamburger icon.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:04.090
They use that on the desktop
basically for the overflow.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.700
I'd say it's a little
different.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.700
You can't really compare two
very distinct platforms.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.720
Like if you look at the desktop
platform verses

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.840
Android, there are definitely
different norms on each.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.990
So even the iconography, even
the direction of if there's a

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.580
search icon, where
the handle is.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.280
Is it to the left
or to the right?

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.910
Even little things like
that, they can

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.280
differ across platforms.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.150
So I'd say that it's more
important, I'd say, to be

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.590
consistent with Android rather
than consistent across

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.090
different platforms.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.710
NICK BUTCHER: So yeah, it's
not in Chrome, sorry.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.770
It's on google.com.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.962
If you go to google.com on
mobile, you get the burger.

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:45.110
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.360
ROMAN NURIK: That's fair.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.640
MARIE SCHWEIZ: Mostly, if I see
swiping navigations, I'm

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.970
cleaning the concept.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:04.460
People are sending me concepts
and want feedback from me, and

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:09.569
I say mostly it's messy to put
all the functionality in this

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.150
menu, and everything is fine.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:16.849
And if you have something like
a shopping application, they

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:21.150
do the whole functionality for a
shopping basket and all this

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.310
stuff in the swipe menu.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.250
And then they want a secondary
action bar to handle

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.349
functionalities for the
shopping basket

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.230
and all this stuff.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:36.640
And mostly, if you're cleaning
up the navigation, the

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.110
secondary action bar is gone.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.510
That's what I learned
in the past.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:48.170
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I mean,
using the drawer as the main

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.790
navigation, I use it
as a last resource.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:57.560
I mean, if you don't have any
other way to show visually on

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.740
the app the sections,
go there.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:05.275
But I think it's very, very easy
to just throw everything

00:18:05.275 --> 00:18:07.450
in there and forget about it.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:11.505
And--

00:18:11.505 --> 00:18:13.490
MARIE SCHWEIZ: It's not right.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.730
MALE SPEAKER: It's not right,
because the users

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:15.916
are not seeing it.

00:18:15.916 --> 00:18:19.340
And if the users are not seeing,
they're probably not

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.930
going to remember that
that is there.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.050
So I think it's a trend.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.340
It's obviously a trend.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.630
A lot of people are using it.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.770
MARIE SCHWEIZ: I
don't think so.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.990
I think it's like, OK, we don't
know how we build real

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.940
mobile use cases, and then we
put all the menu and we have

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.610
the whole system on Android.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.160
ROMAN NURIK: But it
is a trend, right?

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.620
It's definitely a trend that
folks are doing it.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:52.210
And I think that, like AJ says,
it's becoming more and

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.710
more like a default.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.650
And what it should be is
really a last resort.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.270
And I think that there are two
points I want to make there.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.210
The first is that sometimes
there are drawers that have

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.920
three items in the left pane.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.330
You swipe it open, and there's
three items there.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.170
Drawers are really just
replacements for

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.430
tabs in that case.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:15.020
So it's really just an
alternative presentation of

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.080
horizontal tabs at the
top of screen.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.840
And so at that point, why don't
you just simply use tabs

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.790
or use a spinner?

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.960
I mean, that's less
heavy weight and

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.260
more immediately visible.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:30.310
And the other point I wanted to
make is that this actually

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.900
reminds me of one of the
problems that we saw with

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.360
original menu button
on older devices.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.760
One of the problems was that
people were putting core

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.920
functionality into something
that wasn't immediately

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.490
visible and something that
wasn't immediately clear what

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:46.870
functionality was available.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.490
And so you would press the
Menu button and hope that

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.280
there's interesting stuff in
there, hope that the thing

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.510
that you're trying to do is
in there, and it wasn't

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.060
immediately on screen.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.320
One of the reasons we actually
came up with the action bar

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.270
pattern was to put more
fundamental actions and

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.690
navigation on screen.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.950
And I think that with the
drawer, we're seeing kind of

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.040
the reverse of that.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.490
We're putting less and less
stuff on screen for the

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:13.110
purposes of making
or optimizing the

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.550
real estate for content.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.200
But I think that there's
probably a better balance to

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.140
be struck in a lot of cases
between content and Chrome.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.360
You still want to show the key,
most important navigation

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:28.070
in some way, as well
as your content.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.510
But I'd say that what
AJ says is right.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.970
It shouldn't be a default.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.980
It should really be kind
of a last resort.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.160
If there's no other pattern that
works really well, then

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.840
the drawer may be an option.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.710
MARIE SCHWEIZ: It was because
the product managers say, we

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.860
want catalog in our shopping
application.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.410
We want a category view.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.790
We want all the stuff we want
in this little small

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.150
application, and then
you have too much.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:59.180
They can develop a mobile
application with maybe three

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.230
useful functionalities.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.390
That's the mobile case.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.420
That's the reason why
we have mobile.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:11.040
I'm maybe in a store, and I will
order the shoes at home,

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.240
delivery service.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.050
So one case, just ordering.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:19.190
And I think the messy point,
or the too much

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:24.395
functionalities, it's a little
bit Windows Explorer.

00:21:24.395 --> 00:21:27.170
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, I think it's
really up to us as the

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.756
designers to talk to folks
like that and say, you do

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:34.120
really need to optimize around
the core competencies and core

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.760
best use cases of your app.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.130
Like, make sure that the two or
three things that users are

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.190
expecting to do with your
app are really easy and

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.270
straightforward.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.480
And if folks that are asking
for these apps to be built

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.920
say, but we need like seven,
eight, nine different

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.770
functions, then I guess it's
the job of the designers to

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.630
say, given those nine functions,
how do we best

00:21:54.630 --> 00:22:00.060
present these not as functions
but has as flows and as

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.760
benefits to the user.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.490
So I'd say, maybe it's our job
to pare things down to the

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.150
most important, and then
put other things in.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:13.840
Put other items like secondary
functions into the overflow or

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.320
into other navigational
elements.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.670
MARIE SCHWEIZ: I agree.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.140
NICK BUTCHER: I quite like it
when an app has a tight focus

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.770
and doesn't try to
do everything.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.130
Why not launch a second
app, perhaps,

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:25.860
for a different thing?

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:30.270
MARIE SCHWEIZ: Yeah, or you have
the tablet case, more on

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:35.340
application and more
functionalities on tablet.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.100
CHRIS BANES: That's
true, actually,

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.150
you've mentioned tablets.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.770
Also it makes it easier to do
a master detail flow on

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.360
tablets, because you can show
that drawer by default on a

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.010
tablet, and you have that same
UI, so you can reuse

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:48.810
everything, so it just
makes it easier.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.700
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, and YouTube
does that really

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.840
nicely as well.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.660
So it uses this responsive
design so when you have a

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.585
certain amount of horizontal
real estate, the drawer is

00:22:56.585 --> 00:22:57.776
opened by default.

00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:00.420
CHRIS BANES: There are
positives to it.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.780
MARIE SCHWEIZ: What I've said
in the past is, OK, other

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.400
systems like iOS working
really straight.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.420
They're working a step deeper,
deeper, deeper in the

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:18.940
application, and Android works a
little bit more chaotic, but

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.535
every time, step very
close to the user.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.410
ROMAN NURIK: Marie,
still there?

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.440
I think Marie may have frozen.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.020
MALE SPEAKER: She's frozen.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.690
ROMAN NURIK: OK, well.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.740
When she gets back, we'll let
her finish that thought.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.900
But before we move on-- we
have five minutes left--

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.930
does anybody else have any?

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:46.410
NICK BUTCHER: I think
there will be

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.970
moderator questions, or?

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:49.010
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, we
should probably

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.940
jump into the moderator.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.410
When we return, she can
finish her thought.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.020
Before I jump into the
moderator, does anybody else

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.000
have anything they'd
like to bring up?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.560
MALE SPEAKER: Can I talk about
the quick return bar?

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.256
ROMAN NURIK: Sure,
yeah, go ahead.

00:24:03.256 --> 00:24:04.625
MALE SPEAKER: There's basically,
the pattern that

00:24:04.625 --> 00:24:08.020
you presented in the code, and
I shared one that does an

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.450
implementation like in Google+
where it's on the bottom.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.978
NICK BUTCHER: OK, Lars did
one of those, right?

00:24:13.978 --> 00:24:15.650
Lars forked it.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:16.930
MALE SPEAKER: Sorry,
what was that?

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.800
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, Lars forked
your code, didn't he?

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.180
Roman, what's his name?

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.570
ROMAN NURIK: Lars Vogel?

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.520
NICK BUTCHER: [? Birkman ?].

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.770
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, Lars,
[? Birkman ?], OK.

00:24:26.142 --> 00:24:26.740
That's cool.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.220
I haven't seen it yet.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.930
So Dandre, did you want to
make a point about its

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.092
usefulness, or do you have
any questions about it?

00:24:37.092 --> 00:24:40.400
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I was
curious, like, so there's a

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.160
little bit of weirdness about
scrolling up bringing

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.490
something from the bottom, but
the advantage, of course, is

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.490
that it's on the bottom,
so it's a lot

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.210
closer to your finger.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.070
Maybe if you were scrolling
up, you'd just scroll up a

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.200
little, and it's right there.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.300
And if you're on a tablet or
something, or if you scroll

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.095
up, and the thing's
at the top, then

00:25:01.095 --> 00:25:02.210
it's really far away.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:08.110
So I was curious, what's the
ideas about, should it be on

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.715
the top or bottom, or
if it were just a

00:25:10.715 --> 00:25:13.820
weird pattern at all.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.080
ROMAN NURIK: Well, I think
that the placement, it's

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.960
generally better to
put it at the top.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.210
It's a little more natural.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.690
I'd say that the Google+ app in
general, when talking about

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.170
things that Google+ app does,
it's a little more

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.110
experimental on the UI side.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.160
They're definitely trying lots
and lots of those things.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.510
And some of them work
really well.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:35.070
Some of them are really
just experiments that

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.530
they'll pull out.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.870
So I wouldn't say that follow
the Google+ app to the T as to

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.980
what it does.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.830
But specifically in this case,
I think one of the reasons

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.920
that they moved it down is that
the iconography that they

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.440
were using wasn't as clear as
it could be, and then they

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.890
wanted to show text as well.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.490
And then at that point, the bar
itself became quite large.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:02.780
So it became just a little bit
of a burden at the very top of

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.210
the screen.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.130
So they moved it to the bottom,
but I don't think that

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.560
that's really finalized.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.800
I don't really know
if it's finalized.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.410
But certainly it's something
that we're still exploring,

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:14.830
but I'd say that by default, you
should probably use sticky

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:18.220
bars at the top unless it's
really following your

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.180
scrolling gesture.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.116
So if you're scrolling down and
you want to show something

00:26:22.116 --> 00:26:25.856
at the very bottom like, for
example, I don't know if this

00:26:25.856 --> 00:26:30.490
is very common, but jump to the
top or jump to the bottom.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.790
If it's showing up in the
direction you're scrolling,

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:33.470
that would probably
make sense.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.590
So, if you're scrolling up,
probably showing something at

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.580
the top is better.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.770
NICK BUTCHER: One exception
that I quite like is the

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.750
Foursquare app does something
quite nice where, as you're

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.985
scrolling down your feed, if
you go back to the top, it

00:26:45.985 --> 00:26:48.990
actually pops up some kind of
filters at the bottom, which

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:50.350
is actually a quite nice
way of doing it.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.645
So it doesn't do it just with
the general scrolling up, but

00:26:52.645 --> 00:26:54.780
just when you reach the
very top, it pops in,

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.670
which I quite like.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.010
ROMAN NURIK: That's fair.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.980
Marie, did you want to finish
your thought real quick?

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:07.585
MARIE SCHWEIZ: My network is
not really stable today.

00:27:07.585 --> 00:27:08.510
ROMAN NURIK: That's all right.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:12.150
We'll follow up over
on Google+.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:12.990
MARIE SCHWEIZ: No problem.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.430
I see that you can handle
the topic very careful.

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.640
ROMAN NURIK: So let's see.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.300
Dandre, did you have any other
questions on the quick return?

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.610
It's not really a formalized
pattern, the quick return, and

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.940
actually that name is just
something that me and Nick

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.460
came up with.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.010
It's not really a
formal thing.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:34.910
But certainly, I think, in
general when there's something

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:38.760
that's not documented in our
official guidelines, we have a

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.250
bug filed internally to make
sure that it gets documented.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.210
It's just a question of
time and resources.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.600
So at some point, we'll have
probably some more guidance on

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.850
quick return.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.630
MARIE SCHWEIZ: I have a question
about resources.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.880
ROMAN NURIK: Sure.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.150
MARIE SCHWEIZ: So mostly, I'm
working for-- in the past--

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:05.830
now I'm employed by Novoda, but
in the past, I'm working

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.350
for a lot of creative
agencies.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:13.130
They're doing something like
catalog, or shopping, or

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:19.720
tools, or gadgets, or
automotive, or sports brands,

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.020
all this stuff.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:28.530
And I try to show them
how Android works.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:33.010
Big thanks to my friend
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:42.320
who took maybe 30 screen shots
from Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.330
And I have now 30 screenshots
with his private mail account

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:47.500
and all the private stuff.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.690
But I use this stuff to show
the [INAUDIBLE] and the

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.590
designers, look how
Android is today.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:29:04.260
And what I really need is maybe
just screenshots from an

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.380
actual system, a Nexus 4.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.040
I haven't done Nexus 4.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.770
I have just older phones.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:16.910
I prefer the older phones
actually, not just because

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.860
they have keyboards.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:24.140
ROMAN NURIK: I think AJ is
signing an agreement, right?

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.880
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I mean,
right now, it's really hard to

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:32.770
find screenshots of the
Nexus 10 resolution.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:33.620
You can't find it.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.580
I can't.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.140
There are no--

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.460
MARIE SCHWEIZ: Or just how a
system application looks.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.420
MALE SPEAKER: When [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.175
HTPA comes in, you'd better,
guys, have a couple of

00:29:44.175 --> 00:29:45.550
screenshots first.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.050
ROMAN NURIK: I will say this.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.990
So if there are specific
screenshots

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.600
that you guys need--

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.400
I mean, it's obvious that we
can't all buy every device.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.030
If you guys need certain
screenshots at any point, just

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.090
let us know publicly.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.450
We'll share publicly.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.410
We're more than happy
to do that.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:02.700
And we have a bunch
of test accounts.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.910
So I know that this isn't like
an official resource, but this

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:06.830
is definitely something
that we can help

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:08.230
with in one off cases.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:13.430
But certainly, we do plan on
updating the design site with

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.720
this kind of stuff.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.610
So I don't know if it will
be full resolution, but

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.320
certainly, we want to make sure
the design set is up to

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.730
date so that you can share at
least those screenshots, those

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:28.550
framed screenshots with
your product managers

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.060
and clients and such.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.721
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I'd always
say whenever I start working

00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:33.520
with a designer whose not worked
with Android before, I

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.170
always encourage them, if they
can, get hold of a device and

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.290
just get used to the
patterns and so on.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:41.000
I know that might not be
possible, depending on your

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.440
clients or whatever it is, but
that's going to be the first,

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.750
best solution.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.820
If not, there's always
the emulator, but--

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.660
MARIE SCHWEIZ: I can tell you,
from time to time, I never get

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.910
my device back.

00:30:56.481 --> 00:30:59.770
ROMAN NURIK: I think we're
losing our room, and I think

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:00.700
we're a little over time.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.150
So let's stop there and
continue sometime in

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:05.850
the next few weeks.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.680
I think we should do more of
these, and probably on deeper

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.290
dives into specific subjects.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.900
But thanks everybody for
joining, and definitely we

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.850
have food for thought and more
bugs to file in terms of more

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.070
design research things
to come out with.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.460
So again, thanks for joining,
and we'll see you

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.144
hopefully next week.

00:31:25.144 --> 00:31:27.480
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.730
MARIE SCHWEIZ: Bye.
