donkeys out of this crate and one of
them has a hat on and they look very sad

them has a hat on and they look very sad
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.650
them has a hat on and they look very sad
and they're in different crates and one

and they're in different crates and one
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.360
and they're in different crates and one
of them says sold to the salt mines and

roughly speaking and they look very sad

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
roughly speaking and they look very sad
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.679
roughly speaking and they look very sad
and then one of them gets hauled out of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
and then one of them gets hauled out of
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.390
and then one of them gets hauled out of
a crate and he still got to have he has

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
a crate and he still got to have he has
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.760

braying jackass prior to being enslaved
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.260
braying jackass prior to being enslaved
and so that's that's another thing

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
and so that's that's another thing
 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.640
and so that's that's another thing
that's quite interesting about the story

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
that's quite interesting about the story
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.190
that's quite interesting about the story

braying that the probability that you're
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780
braying that the probability that you're
going to become enslaved by a tyrant is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
going to become enslaved by a tyrant is
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.149
going to become enslaved by a tyrant is
extraordinarily high and I always can't

like that because on the one hand well

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850
like that because on the one hand well

guilty but they were innocent and they
 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.870

a conundrum here they are being terribly
 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.240
a conundrum here they are being terribly
punished but by the same token they're

also the perpetrators of their own
 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.450
also the perpetrators of their own

proper ideological formulas but then he

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530
proper ideological formulas but then he
 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.820
proper ideological formulas but then he

it repented of that and started to

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960
it repented of that and started to
 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.140
it repented of that and started to
realize their their own role in it or

the error of the system then he would

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860
the error of the system then he would
 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.060
the error of the system then he would
start communicating with them you know

start communicating with them you know
 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.630
start communicating with them you know
as if they were people who who you could

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640
as if they were people who who you could
 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.449
as if they were people who who you could
communicate with yeah so that was very

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459
communicate with yeah so that was very
 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.740
communicate with yeah so that was very
interesting as far as I'm concerned

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750
interesting as far as I'm concerned
 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.990
interesting as far as I'm concerned
anyways this kid is still a little bit

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000
anyways this kid is still a little bit
 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.650

human he starts to cry for his mom and
the coachmen basically throws him back

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100
the coachmen basically throws him back
 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.680
the coachmen basically throws him back
into the crate and says that he's not

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690
into the crate and says that he's not
 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.180
into the crate and says that he's not
ready yet and the reason for that is

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190
ready yet and the reason for that is
 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.040
ready yet and the reason for that is
that he could still he still had the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050
that he could still he still had the
 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.890
that he could still he still had the
power of independent speech you remember

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900
power of independent speech you remember
 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.230
power of independent speech you remember
right at the beginning of the movie when

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240
right at the beginning of the movie when
 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.510
right at the beginning of the movie when
the mouth was painted on Pinocchio we

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520
the mouth was painted on Pinocchio we
 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.360
the mouth was painted on Pinocchio we
saw that mask that was really glaring at

the process and I said that character

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470
the process and I said that character
 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.349
the process and I said that character
recurs continually throughout the movie

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359
recurs continually throughout the movie
 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.670
recurs continually throughout the movie
and there's a good example of that

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680
and there's a good example of that
 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.830
and there's a good example of that
because the coachman is the enemy of

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840
because the coachman is the enemy of
 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.350
because the coachman is the enemy of
anything that has its own voice so he's

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360
anything that has its own voice so he's
 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.030
anything that has its own voice so he's

the anti Geppetto that's a good way of
 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.680
the anti Geppetto that's a good way of

thinking about it he's a tyrannical
 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.640
thinking about it he's a tyrannical
aspect of the
