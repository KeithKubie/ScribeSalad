00:00:00.144 --> 00:00:02.449
- What I want to do in this
video is get some practice

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:04.228
finding surface areas of figures

00:00:04.228 --> 00:00:07.605
by opening them up into
what's called nets.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:09.369
And one way to think
about it is if you had

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.247
a figure like this, and if
it was made out of cardboard,

00:00:12.247 --> 00:00:13.762
and if you were to cut it,

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:17.047
if you were to cut it right
where I'm drawing this red,

00:00:17.047 --> 00:00:20.666
and also right over here
and right over there,

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.825
and right over there and also in the back

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:24.175
where you can't see just now,

00:00:24.175 --> 00:00:26.247
it would open up into something like this.

00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:27.719
So if you were to open it up,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.265
it would open up into something like this.

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:32.145
And when you open it up, it's much easier

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:34.307
to figure out the surface area.

00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:36.567
So the surface area of this figure,

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:38.554
when we open that up,
we can just figure out

00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:40.713
the surface area of each of these regions.

00:00:40.713 --> 00:00:41.900
So let's think about it.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.970
So what's first of all the surface area,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.178
what's the surface area
of this, right over here?

00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:51.448
Well in the net, that
corresponds to this area,

00:00:51.448 --> 00:00:56.435
it's a triangle, it has a base
of 12 and height of eight.

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:59.898
So this area right over
here is going to be one half

00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:03.020
times the base, so times 12,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.801
times the height, times eight.

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:08.195
So this is the same
thing as six times eight,

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:12.066
which is equal to 48 whatever
units, or square units.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.959
This is going to be units of area.

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:15.572
So that's going to be 48 square units,

00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:17.548
and up here is the exact same thing.

00:01:17.548 --> 00:01:19.228
That's the exact same thing.

00:01:19.228 --> 00:01:20.260
You can't see it in this figure,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.499
but if it was transparent,

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.360
if it was transparent,
it would be this backside

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.452
right over here, but
that's also going to be 48.

00:01:27.452 --> 00:01:29.492
48 square units.

00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:32.148
Now we can think about the areas of

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:35.214
I guess you can consider
them to be the side panels.

00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:37.668
So that's a side panel right over there.

00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:41.376
It's 14 high and 10 wide,
this is the other side panel.

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:45.614
It's also this length over here
is the same as this length.

00:01:45.614 --> 00:01:47.578
It's also 14 high and 10 wide.

00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:51.250
So this side panel is
this one right over here.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.214
And then you have one on the other side.

00:01:53.214 --> 00:01:54.925
And so the area of each of these

00:01:54.925 --> 00:01:58.735
14 times 10, they are 140 square units.

00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:02.243
This one is also 140 square units.

00:02:02.243 --> 00:02:04.491
And then finally we
just have to figure out

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.910
the area of I guess you can say the base

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.552
of the figure, so this whole
region right over here,

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:14.256
which is this area, which is
that area right over there.

00:02:14.256 --> 00:02:16.743
And that's going to be 12 by 14.

00:02:16.743 --> 00:02:21.743
So this area is 12 times 14,
which is equal to let's see.

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:24.540
12 times 12 is 144

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.830
plus another 24, so it's 168.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.845
So the total area is
going to be, let's see.

00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:36.046
If you add this one and
that one, you get 96.

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:37.984
96 square units.

00:02:37.984 --> 00:02:40.527
The two magenta, I guess
you can say, side panels,

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:45.079
140 plus 140, that's 280. 280.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.019
And then you have this
base that comes in at 168.

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.360
We want it to be that same color.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.690
168. One, 68.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.792
Add them all together, and
we get the surface area

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:58.004
for the entire figure.

00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:01.587
And it was super valuable
to open it up into this net

00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:03.216
because we can make sure
we got all the sides.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.272
We didn't have to kinda
rotate it in our brains.

00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:07.197
Although you could do that as well.

00:03:07.197 --> 00:03:09.775
So, with six plus zero plus eight is 14.

00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:14.337
Regroup the one ten to the tens
place, there's now one ten.

00:03:14.337 --> 00:03:18.251
So one plus nine is ten, plus eight is 18,

00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:22.970
plus six is 24, and then you have

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.369
two plus two plus one is five.

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.107
So the surface area of this figure is 544.

00:03:29.107 --> 00:03:31.260
544 square units.
