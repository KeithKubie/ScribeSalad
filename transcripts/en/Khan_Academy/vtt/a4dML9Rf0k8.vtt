00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.220
- Hello AP Calculus students.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.980
This is Sal Khan of the Khan Academy.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.330
And as well all know,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.970
the AP Calculus exams,
both the AB and BC exams

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.430
are coming up this Thursday, May 5th.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.050
And I'm sure you are buzzing

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.400
with as much excitement as I am.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.010
And in case you didn't already realize it,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.240
Khan Academy has a lot of
resources for you in calculus.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.780
You could either jump
in and learn the things

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.930
that you wanna learn, or we
have what we call our missions,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.290
where it'll guide you
through all the calculus

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.470
that you need to learn for
either the AB or the BC exams.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.270
But on top of that,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.830
in preparation for this
super exciting exam,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.500
on Monday, May 2nd, we are
going to have live office hours.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.470
And so from 4 to 5 PM
Pacific Standard Time,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.100
it will be myself and Grant,
who is our calculus fellow,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.240
and we will be answering your
questions about calculus.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.680
It could be reviewing things.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.670
It will be going through example problems.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.760
Or we might point you
to the right resources

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.220
on Khan Academy itself.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.600
And so, show up.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.290
It's going to be a lot of fun.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.860
You do not want to miss out on this.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.240
