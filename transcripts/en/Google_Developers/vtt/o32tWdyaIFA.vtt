Niccolai: Hi. My name
is Marzia Niccolai,

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:09.934
and I'm a Developer Programs
Engineer here at Google.

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:11.534
Today we're gonna
talk you through

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:13.601
how to create and manage
your Application

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:16.567
with Google App Engine's Admin.
Console.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:18.667
You can get started with
Google App Engine

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:19.934
with any Google account

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:22.000
or Google Apps
for your domain account.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.901
Go to appengine.google.com
and sign in with your account.

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.534
If this is the first time
you've signed in,

00:00:29.534 --> 00:00:32.501
you'll be asked
to verify your account via SMS.

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:34.000
But because I've already
done that,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.133
I can go ahead and Sign in
and create an Application.

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:46.067
The first thing
you'll be asked to do

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.400
is choose an Application
Identifier.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.434
This is the unique string
that identifies your Application

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:51.934
in our system.

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:58.334
You can check the Availability
just by clicking on the button.

00:00:58.334 --> 00:01:01.534
Next, go ahead and enter
your Application's Title.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:08.901
Here you also have the option

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:11.901
to set your Application's
Authentication Options.

00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:14.901
By default,
we've selected Google Accounts,

00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:16.667
but if you have a Google Apps
for your domain,

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.701
you can also
set your Application

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:21.501
to authenticate against
accounts from that domain.

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:23.133
Just click the Edit button,

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.634
click Restrict to the following
Google Apps domain:

00:01:25.634 --> 00:01:28.000
and enter your domain
information.

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:33.734
However,
for this demonstration,

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:35.667
we're just gonna go back
to Google Accounts

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:38.267
since this is the default.

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:40.067
Then accept the terms of service

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:42.767
and click Save.

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:46.000
As you can see, your Application
was registered successfully.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.167
Just put the App ID
in your App.yaml file

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:50.601
when you upload
your Application.

00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:52.334
Because the Application
we just created

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:53.834
doesn't have any data,

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.834
now I'm gonna show you
how to manage an Application

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:58.267
with an existing
Application App gallery.

00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:03.234
When we click on the App ID,

00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:05.667
we'll be taken to
the Applications Dashboard.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.100
This is an overview

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.100
of all the system
traffic information.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.934
The first graph that we see

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:14.033
is related
to the Applications Traffic.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.634
It shows the Request per Second
over a 24-hour window.

00:02:17.634 --> 00:02:19.434
We can also select the dropdown

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:21.834
to see what other graphs
are available.

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:23.934
As you can see,
we can also see the number

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:25.167
of Errors we receive

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:27.534
as well as the number
of Megacycles Used

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:31.167
and Quota Denials
our Application has received.

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:35.501
Just select the desired graph
to bring it up.

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:38.534
The next section
is our Application Quotas.

00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:40.067
Here we can see an overview

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:42.567
of all the system resources
we've used

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:45.234
with respect to the free limits
set by App Engine.

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:48.567
Let's scroll down
to look at the information

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:51.100
related to each of our
Applications handlers.

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:56.334
The first table we see
is the Current Load table.

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:58.167
This gives a breakdown

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:00.234
of all of the handlers
of our Application

00:03:00.234 --> 00:03:03.334
that have been visited
since midnight.

00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:05.667
We see the name
of the handler on the left,

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:07.801
and on the right,
we see columns

00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:09.667
related to the resource
usage.

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.000
For each handler,
the first thing we see

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.067
is the request rate
for that handler.

00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:16.200
Then we see
the total number of requests

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.200
that Application handler
has received since midnight.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.601
The next thing we see
is the Average CPU

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.601
consumed by that handler
over the past hour.

00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:26.667
And finally we see
the % CPU

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.534
that handler has consumed
since midnight.

00:03:29.534 --> 00:03:32.767
The table on the right shows
our most errorful handlers.

00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:35.100
On the left-hand side,
we see the handler name.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.901
Then we see the total
number of Errors

00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:39.901
it has received
since midnight

00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:42.300
as well as the percentage
of requests to that handler

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.100
that have received Errors.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.200
This is all the information
that's available to you

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.100
on the Dashboard page.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.267
Next, we can look at our logs
to see more in-depth reporting

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:53.467
for each of our requests.

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:58.200
Just click on the log's link
on the left-hand side.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.200
By default, we show all of
the requests to your Application

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.334
that have resulted
in an Error.

00:04:03.334 --> 00:04:07.334
But we also allow you to filter
on different Severities.

00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:09.667
Just click on the dropdown

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:12.000
to choose the appropriate
level of filtering.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.834
Let's go back
to the Error logs.

00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:19.367
Here we see the 20 most
recent requests

00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:21.033
that resulted in an Error.

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:23.601
If we wanna see more
information about the request,

00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:25.767
we just click on that line.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.334
This expands the section

00:04:29.334 --> 00:04:30.968
and gives us more
in-depth reporting

00:04:30.968 --> 00:04:33.067
as to the Error we received.

00:04:33.067 --> 00:04:35.033
As you can see,
in addition to the information

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:36.667
that we received
about the Error,

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:38.734
we also provide
some information

00:04:38.734 --> 00:04:41.000
about the amount
of CPU resources

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.267
this request has consumed.

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:45.100
Also remember
that you can download your logs

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.601
using appconfig.pi
and analyze them offline.

00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:51.367
Next, let's look at
the information available

00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:53.367
in our Datastore section.

00:04:55.834 --> 00:04:57.767
If we click on
the Index link,

00:04:57.767 --> 00:05:00.167
we can see the status
of all of the Indexes

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:03.400
that we've specified
in our index.yaml file.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.267
Next, we can go to
the Data Viewer

00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:08.767
to see the information stored
in our Applications Datastore.

00:05:10.734 --> 00:05:12.767
When we click on
the Data Viewer,

00:05:12.767 --> 00:05:14.601
we can see the information
in the Data Viewer

00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:16.934
either by Kind
or by Querying.

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:19.634
Let's look at our dropdown
to see what kind of Kinds

00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:21.467
we specified in our Application.

00:05:25.234 --> 00:05:27.767
We can also click into
an individual Entity

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:29.734
to see information
related to that Entity.

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:36.133
If we wanna look
for a specific Entity,

00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:38.033
we can do a GQL Query.

00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:41.434
Just click on the Query button
and enter your GQL Query.

00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:48.968
When you run the Query,
the results will be returned.

00:05:48.968 --> 00:05:51.667
In the Admin Console,
you can also Administer

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:54.067
all of your
Application Settings.

00:05:54.067 --> 00:05:58.100
If we click on the
Applications Settings link,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.968
we have the ability to change
the Application Title.

00:06:01.968 --> 00:06:03.167
The next thing we can do

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:05.334
is add new Administrators
to our Application

00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:07.601
by clicking on
the Developers link.

00:06:10.968 --> 00:06:12.968
When you add new Developers
to your Application,

00:06:12.968 --> 00:06:16.100
they have full administrative
power over that Application.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.901
Simply type in a valid
Google account...

00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:27.067
and click the Invite link.

00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:29.300
This will send an email
to the Developer

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.167
asking them to accept
your Invitation.

00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:34.067
Once the Developer
accepts your Invitation

00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:36.000
to administer your Application,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.133
their status will move
from Pending to Active.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:42.033
In order for the new Developer

00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:43.501
to have full
administrative powers,

00:06:43.501 --> 00:06:46.133
you'll need to redeploy
your Application.

00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:47.567
With Google App Engine,

00:06:47.567 --> 00:06:50.868
we allow you to set Major
Versions for your Application.

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:52.701
You can manage
these Major Versions

00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:56.901
by clicking on
the Versions link.

00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:59.300
Whenever you upload
an Application

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.934
with a new Major Version,

00:07:00.934 --> 00:07:04.467
that Version
will appear on this screen.

00:07:04.467 --> 00:07:06.901
The Default Version
of your Application

00:07:06.901 --> 00:07:11.033
is what your users will see
when they hit your URL.

00:07:11.033 --> 00:07:14.067
But if you'd like to see
your code running in production

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:15.901
and aren't quite ready
to make it live,

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:18.567
you can also view other Versions
of your Application

00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:21.701
by clicking on the link
next to the Version number.

00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:24.601
When you click on this link,

00:07:24.601 --> 00:07:28.067
this will take you to that
Version of the Application.

00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:30.567
Non-active Versions
are only available

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:32.667
through clicking on this link.

00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:35.067
Once you're ready
to make a Version Default,

00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:38.000
simply click
next to the Version number...

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.400
and click
the Make Default button.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.267
This Version is now the Version
your users will see

00:07:45.267 --> 00:07:47.000
when they visit your URL.

00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:51.901
Finally, with Google App Engine,

00:07:51.901 --> 00:07:53.434
if you do not wanna serve
your Application

00:07:53.434 --> 00:07:55.801
off the appspot.com domain,

00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:58.167
you can add your own
Google Apps Domain.

00:07:58.167 --> 00:08:00.834
Simply click
on the Add Domain button.

00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:05.734
This will ask you
to enter a Domain Name.

00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:13.033
Click
on the Add Domain button,

00:08:13.033 --> 00:08:16.300
and you'll be taken to
your Google Apps login page.

00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:26.067
Sign in with
an Administrator account.

00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:31.501
Here, after accepting
the terms of service,

00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:33.000
enter the subdomain

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.133
where you wish to serve
the Application

00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:37.234
and click
Activate This Service.

00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:41.467
Your Application
will now be served

00:08:41.467 --> 00:08:44.133
off of this subdomain.

00:08:44.133 --> 00:08:46.200
And that's really
all there is to it.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.200
For more information,
visit appengine.google.com.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.501
Thanks for watchin'.
