it's just that so far they've only been

it's just that so far they've only been
 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.030
it's just that so far they've only been
able to remove very very simple memories

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040

trialed in humans and it does work to a
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.930

lesser extent instead of removing

about these tests though is what was

work when they were being done a lot of

sort of like a hard drive where you can

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
sort of like a hard drive where you can
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.200
sort of like a hard drive where you can
flick through memories as you like and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
flick through memories as you like and
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.730
flick through memories as you like and
those memories are just the same as they

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
those memories are just the same as they
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530
those memories are just the same as they
were when they were first created but

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
were when they were first created but
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120
were when they were first created but
turns out that's not actually the case

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
turns out that's not actually the case
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.040
turns out that's not actually the case
the scary truth is that every single

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050
the scary truth is that every single
 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.600
the scary truth is that every single
time you remember something what you're

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610
time you remember something what you're
 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850
time you remember something what you're
actually doing is completely recreating

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
actually doing is completely recreating
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.550
actually doing is completely recreating
that memory from scratch and this isn't

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
that memory from scratch and this isn't
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.200
that memory from scratch and this isn't
a perfect process so every single time

a perfect process so every single time

changed a little bit so what this means

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
changed a little bit so what this means
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.050
changed a little bit so what this means
is that the memories you recall the most

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
is that the memories you recall the most
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.399
is that the memories you recall the most
often are the ones that are actually

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
often are the ones that are actually
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.290
often are the ones that are actually
farthest away from what probably

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300
farthest away from what probably

secondly I'd like to talk about dangers

in space we're in a pretty good place

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440
in space we're in a pretty good place
 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.750

everything's dandy apart from the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
everything's dandy apart from the
 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609
everything's dandy apart from the
obvious fact that we're in danger all

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619
obvious fact that we're in danger all
 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.500

the time science is constantly

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510
the time science is constantly
 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.179
the time science is constantly
discovering lots of lovely things out in

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:08.189
discovering lots of lovely things out in
 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:09.619
discovering lots of lovely things out in
the universe and have the potential to

the universe and have the potential to
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.279
the universe and have the potential to
kill us

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
kill us
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.890
kill us
for example our Sun you might think it's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
for example our Sun you might think it's
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.850
for example our Sun you might think it's
quite nice gives

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
quite nice gives
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.950
quite nice gives
life and all that but turns out one day

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960
life and all that but turns out one day
 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.510
life and all that but turns out one day
it's gonna burn us all to death

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520
it's gonna burn us all to death
 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.550
it's gonna burn us all to death
eventually our Sun is going to run out

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
eventually our Sun is going to run out
 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.300
eventually our Sun is going to run out
of fuel

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310

at which point it will expand to a size

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990
at which point it will expand to a size
 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.260
at which point it will expand to a size
so big that it could potentially engulf

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270
so big that it could potentially engulf
 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.270
so big that it could potentially engulf
the entire planet Earth but even if it

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280
the entire planet Earth but even if it
 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.890
the entire planet Earth but even if it
doesn't it's still going to be about two

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
doesn't it's still going to be about two
 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.210
doesn't it's still going to be about two
thousand times hotter than it currently

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
thousand times hotter than it currently
 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.090
thousand times hotter than it currently
is which is hot enough to boil all of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100
is which is hot enough to boil all of
 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.070
is which is hot enough to boil all of
our oceans fortunately though the death

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080
our oceans fortunately though the death
 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.240
our oceans fortunately though the death
of our good old Sun isn't going to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250
of our good old Sun isn't going to
 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.770
of our good old Sun isn't going to
happen for at least five billion years

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
happen for at least five billion years
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.949
happen for at least five billion years
so we will all be dead by then but one

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959
so we will all be dead by then but one
 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.540
so we will all be dead by then but one
thing we do have to worry about which is

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550
thing we do have to worry about which is
 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.449
thing we do have to worry about which is
a bit shorter term is asteroids it's

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459
a bit shorter term is asteroids it's
 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.620
a bit shorter term is asteroids it's
understandable if you're not really that

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630
understandable if you're not really that
 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.210
understandable if you're not really that
worried about asteroids I mean have you

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220
worried about asteroids I mean have you
 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.860
worried about asteroids I mean have you
ever seen an asteroid fall to earth

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870
ever seen an asteroid fall to earth
 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.630
ever seen an asteroid fall to earth
probably not so what's the big deal but

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640
probably not so what's the big deal but
 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.040
probably not so what's the big deal but
a good way you can get an idea of how

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050
a good way you can get an idea of how
 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.900
a good way you can get an idea of how
often asteroid attacks actually happen

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
often asteroid attacks actually happen
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.640
often asteroid attacks actually happen
is to take a look at the surface of the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
is to take a look at the surface of the
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.140
is to take a look at the surface of the
Moon do you see all those little holes

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
