00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.100
Here's an example of OCL. In this case,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.450
we're talking about using the OCL as an extension to a class model diagram.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.330
In the class model diagram, there's an account class. The account class has

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.600
a deposit operation. That operation takes in a real number called amount.

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:22.690
The pre keyword indicates the precondition, in this case,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.480
that the amount being provided in this deposit is greater than zero.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.490
The postcondition, indicated by the post keyword is indicating what must be

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.500
true after the execution of this particular operation.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.860
In particular, the balance afterwards must be equal to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.680
the balance before plus the amount that was deposited.
