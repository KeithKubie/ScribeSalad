1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,710
Hey, what's going on? It's Built burn.

2
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:06,600
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, January 22nd,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,250
2018 what's going on? How
are you? Hi. How's it going?

4
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:13,180
How's it going? All right. All right.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,130
Let's just get right down to it.

6
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:21,480
The New England patriots are
going to the Superbowl again.

7
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:26,370
Super Bowl unfucking believable.
How many times can they win?

8
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:30,330
Games like that. It's incredible. I
thought the officiating was great.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,340
Everything was great. Fantastic.
I liked how it all washed up.

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,810
I really enjoyed that referee laughing
his ass off after we scored a touchdown.

11
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:47,670
That was tremendous. I love everybody
who saw that rough cracking up laughing,

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,630
uh, which you are not supposed
to do by the way, as a referee.

13
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:54,660
And that guy will definitely
get disciplined because
what happens is that every

14
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:57,420
mouth breathing more and goes,
fuck the caves fixed.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,960
He's laughing cause they
just, you know, like,

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,020
which I understand that
it's the knee jerk reaction.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,160
But think about what you're saying.
All right.

18
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,440
Let's just say for the sake of argument
that referee was, was on the take.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,610
All right. Which you know, God knows.
I always said that about the NBA.

20
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:21,870
And then they caught that fucking guy
and everybody said I was nuts. All right.

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,680
Put yourself in that guy's position. All
right, judge you by his age, you probably,

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,700
I'm going to assume you had a wife
and kids. He's got a mortgage,

23
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:34,180
she's got a house and he's risking
all of that and his freedom

24
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,930
to fix an NFL game.
Put yourself in that position.

25
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,750
Are you going to be laughing when the
team scores or are you going to be fucking

26
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,750
stone faced and you really going
to be sitting there going, yeah,

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,630
just like we fucking said.
You know,

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,370
so I'm hoping the NFL films will
come out just to hear what, what,

29
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,350
uh, whatever patriots said that made him
laugh cause he's going to get in trouble

30
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:05,100
for that because that opened this
floodgate. Everybody was just saying like,

31
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,310
oh look at all the penalties will
do solely boo boo boo boo boo boo.

32
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,910
I still don't like the ticky
tack pass in inference stuff. Um,

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,980
however, having said all
of that, uh, you know,

34
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:20,190
I think the Jaguars defense
was a little overrated.

35
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,270
Everybody kept talking about how fucking
great their defense was and completely

36
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:30,810
ignored that the week before they gave
up 42 fucking points to the Steelers in

37
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:34,020
the playoffs when it counted.

38
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,020
Everyone just kept talking about
how great their fucking thief.

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,700
But that defense is that the only reason
why nobody really fucking brought that

40
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:45,840
up
was because they fucking,

41
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,350
their offense scored 45 points.

42
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,770
So I dunno,

43
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,390
I dunno what the fuck to tell you
about that. Great Jaguar defense.

44
00:02:57,391 --> 00:03:01,660
They also played in a week division.
They beat the cults twice.

45
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,480
That's why I don't, this is
what, this is my deal. Okay.

46
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:08,560
I'm not saying they don't ever have a,
they actually do have a great defense,

47
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:13,540
but they're young and they do dumb
things like take stupid penalties right

48
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,470
before they have,

49
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,970
when the home team whose favorite
is only scored three points,

50
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,270
that fucking helmet to
helmet hit by the way.

51
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,150
Stupid fucking penalty.
Big Chunk a yards.

52
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:30,040
And then you'd take a fucking bonehead
pass interference call on the next play.

53
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,420
And you basically give the Patriots a
touchdown. You give them fucking hope.

54
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,500
And then also your great defense gives
up two touchdowns in the final fucking

55
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:42,110
six minutes.
So I don't know what to tell you.

56
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,160
There was a brutal hold call on the final,
uh,

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,710
important offensive player of the
game. I will give you that, but okay,

58
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:52,220
let's say they call holding there.
We're going to run it the next play.

59
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,250
You guys are going to burn your last
time out. We're going to kick the ball.

60
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:58,250
You're going to be down on the 10 fucking
yard line and you're telling me what

61
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:02,240
the minute and Change Blake Bortles is
going to run the length of the fuck.

62
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,800
I mean, it could happen. It could
fucking happen, but I dunno.

63
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,710
I Dunno. But anyways, that's why
I don't give a shit about, uh,

64
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,310
you know, regular season stats, you know,

65
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,780
I mean, okay, here's a, here's a thing.
Pumping up the fucking Jag was defense.

66
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,890
Regular season. They'd beat the cults
without Andrew Luck. 27 nothing. Okay.

67
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,690
They beat the browns and only
gave up seven fucking points.

68
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,790
They beat the cults again,
30 to fucking 10 they beat the Texans.

69
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,290
45 to seven.

70
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,660
These are all fucking teams that
you're not going to see in January.

71
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,330
All right. But if you go
through their fucking season,

72
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,910
they played the titans twice a playoff
teams. They lost to him both times,

73
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,620
let up 37 fucking points and had a
close game at the end of the year.

74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,490
They played the rams that were a
playoff team. They lost to them.

75
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,520
The only playoff team that I'm,

76
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:07,080
I'm looking here real quick that they
beat was the Pittsburgh Steelers beat him

77
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:12,081
30 to nine and then they met him in the
plant and they let up 42 fucking points.

78
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,590
So
I don't know.

79
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,720
I mean how much more advantage
could the defense have? I mean,

80
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,770
Edelman wasn't in the game are number one
receiver on next number one option was

81
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:25,920
rob Gronkowski and you're knocked him out,
you know,

82
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:28,320
on a helmet to helmet hit
that if a Patriot did,

83
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:32,550
it would have been viewed as like the
like, like you killed Christ or something.

84
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,260
MMM. But whatever it was a great game.
Jaguars should have won the game.

85
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:41,470
I just thought they were too young
and didn't know how to win the game.

86
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,070
Didn't know how to put the
Patriots away. And, um,

87
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,190
I dunno if it, Tom Brady's Tom Brady,
not to mention Tom Brady also had like,

88
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,420
I don't know what the fuck happened
guy cut his fucking hand.

89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:55,880
Yeah.

90
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,160
We have an almost 41 old
quarterback with the,

91
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,890
with the fucking stitches
in his throwing hand.

92
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,220
Edelman is out and you knock out Gronk
Koski and I don't want to heal up.

93
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,470
Bronkowske wasn't doing shit ground.
Koski does something on every play.

94
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:12,740
He draws double coverage and you didn't
have to fucking deal with that anymore.

95
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,840
So I don't know what the fuck to tell you.
Uh,

96
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,270
I do feel bad for Jaguar
fans because you know,

97
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:20,240
that's a fucking football city that
nobody seems to give a shit about.

98
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,470
You know what I mean? I like
to Jackson, you know what,

99
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:28,430
I've actually come around
and those helmets too. So
it was a great fucking game.

100
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,620
Um, the Patriots are limping into the
Superbowl and should be underdogs,

101
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:37,550
but won't be cause every mouth breathing
moron who doesn't know shit about

102
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:42,350
football, we'll put money on the
Patriots for somehow we will be, I mean,

103
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:47,060
the eagles just look like fucking world
beaters. They have an amazing defense.

104
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,430
They have to fucking base,
nearly have pros and fucking

105
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,680
Malcolm Blunt. I mean, I don't know why
the fuck are we ever got rid of him. Um,

106
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,270
I'm sure there was a reason
for it, but uh, yeah,

107
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,890
I mean the eagles should be favorites,

108
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,460
but they won't be just historically
because it never fucking wanted and we've

109
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:11,150
won a lot. So, um, so then if we lose,

110
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,130
it's going to be like
an unbelievable upset.

111
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,630
What does it say about Brady's
legacy? Um, we shall see.

112
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,280
We shall see. And I feel bad for, um,

113
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,100
uh,
New England fans.

114
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,030
They're going to go to that game with
the behavior of eagles fans and all of

115
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:33,410
that shit. And uh, you know,
I saw some of the footage,

116
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:38,060
some of this shit was funny, but
like, I dunno, Philly fancy, you know,

117
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:41,130
what they act like. Do you remember when
you didn't know how to talk to women?

118
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:44,840
So you just fucking went out and did
crazy shit every weekend hoping that the

119
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,730
women would then hear this
story and be like, oh,

120
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:48,320
that's the guy I want to go out with

121
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,640
and it's, don't get it, man. I just don't,
you know, fucking vikings fans. Oh, hey,

122
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,490
oh, are you? Oh,

123
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,490
you're doing like the fucking Nice Midwest
people you throw in full beers at him

124
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,600
. I Dunno, but on the other
side it's just like, you know,

125
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:11,140
that's what you're going to get.
Why the fuck would you wear your,

126
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,710
your vikings gear to the Goddamn game?
Um,

127
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,680
but that's really getting played out,
showing that type of shit. And uh,

128
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,650
and they did the classic thing
too. You know, it's funny with,

129
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:28,550
with every like NFL city they have,
they have like the story,

130
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,720
like whenever there's a game in Boston,

131
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,110
they have to play that stupid
fucking departed music.

132
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,830
I'm shipping up to
Boston and I lost my leg.

133
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:43,640
And then they're going to show Paul revere
and fall this freedom trail shit that

134
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,770
nobody gives a fuck about.
Who lives in Boston.

135
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,770
I walk by that fucking statue a
million times. I never look at it.

136
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,500
Um,

137
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,500
and I don't eat clam chowder anytime
Philly in a major sporting event,

138
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,500
at some point some fucking Douche is
going to try to teach you how to order a

139
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,640
Philly cheese steak.

140
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,950
It's like we got it.

141
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,520
Gimme a Wiz with gimme one without,

142
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,690
don't say Philly cheese steak.
You're in Philly.

143
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,360
You could literally walk up there
to any fucking cheese steak place in

144
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,500
Philadelphia and be like,

145
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,530
I would like a cheese steak with onions
and peppers and provolone cheese and

146
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,440
you're going to get it
because at the end of the day,

147
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,290
they're a fucking business
and they need your money.

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,020
They always do that.

149
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:41,560
They show the fucking rocky statue and
then they bring up the fact that they

150
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,290
threw fucking batteries at Santa Claus

151
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,980
is if that is the only fucking thing
that has ever happened in Philadelphia,

152
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:55,981
why don't they ever reenact Ben Franklin
fly in that fucking stupid kite with

153
00:09:56,531 --> 00:10:01,110
the key on it, right? Why
don't they bring up the 83.

154
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:05,610
Philadelphia 76 is the most underrated
fucking championship team of all time.

155
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:10,050
Who I've said forever that I would
put up against the 96 balls. Okay.

156
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,240
I would take doctor Jay
[inaudible] fucking Andrew, Tony

157
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,270
to fucking knocked down a lot
of what Jordan and fucking, uh,

158
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,600
what's his face are going to do.
Scottie Pippin.

159
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,480
And then underneath you got fucking Moses
Malone one on one against Luc Longley.

160
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,390
Um, I'm not saying they would have
won, but I'm saying, you know,

161
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,880
be a hell of a fucking series anyways.
Congratulations to the,

162
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,160
uh, to the fucking eagles.
What a game. Good Lord. They,
that was, they gave them the,

163
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:52,440
they gave the vikings
seal right there, Fred. I,

164
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:55,200
but there was a lot of biking fan wishing
that they just fucking lost to the

165
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,960
saints after that beat down.

166
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,830
They took them right across the
fucking lap. Spanked at fanny. Um,

167
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,100
is it weird that, I mean, as
much as I love the vikings,

168
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:12,940
I kinda was rooting for the
eagles just because, uh,

169
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,730
I dunno case Keenum I just
can't get past that name.

170
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,360
Case, keen him. It just makes
me still feel so fucking old.

171
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,760
Somebody named a kid case.

172
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,933
Yeah.

173
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,150
Couldn't just name Robert.

174
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,213
Yeah,

175
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,250
sorry, I'm being a cunt. Um, so anyways,

176
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:43,010
if you are a Patriot's fan, um,
yeah, just know that you know, it's,

177
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,370
it's going to be a terrible
fan experience, uh,

178
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,720
because nobody does anything about that
level of fucking ridiculous behavior.

179
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:55,090
And I think at this point they get so
much fucking hype out of how bad they

180
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,460
behave.
They like trying to outdo one another.

181
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,200
Like do remember a few years ago there
was like some off duty cop went to like a

182
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,190
Philly's game and this guy was swearing
and shit behind him and he goes, hey,

183
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:06,611
take it easy.

184
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:10,750
I got my kid here and the guy put his
fingers down his throat and threw up on

185
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,180
the guy's kid.
I mean,

186
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:17,200
at that point it's just like he
just doing that just to do it right.

187
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,310
I Dunno.
So anyways,

188
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:22,360
so now we're gonna have to sit through
fucking too goddamn weeks of them talking

189
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:27,361
about fucking throwing batteries at
Santa Claus and showing the fucking Paul

190
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,910
Revere Statue. And I'm shipping
up to Boston and I lost my leg.

191
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,063
MMM.

192
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,330
I Dunno.
I think the eagles are,

193
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,770
yeah.

194
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,430
An overwhelming favorite.
If people knew how to gamble on football,

195
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,130
I would think, but uh,
that's not how it works.

196
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,230
Yeah.

197
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,250
But I think it's definitely,
it's the eagles game to fucking lose.

198
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,980
Um, I might be crazy, but
that's, that's definitely what
I think. But, uh, all right,

199
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:58,240
so there you go. There's, there's my,

200
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:03,530
there's my football talk condolences
to the fucking Jaguars in Vikings fans.

201
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,083
MMM.

202
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,260
Hey. You know what I'm actually excited
to watch is that thing where they have,

203
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,493
uh,

204
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,810
some Thursday on CBS
about the NFL players.

205
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:19,230
Like who's like the most to like
basically whatever your hobby is,

206
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,700
they got guys in the NFL playing
drums, guitar, cooking and Shit.

207
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,210
I actually want to watch that
because I want to see how good the,

208
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,050
the football player drummers are. How
stupid is that, right? Oh, whatever.

209
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,020
You got a thousand fucking
channels. You've got to find
something to watch, right?

210
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,853
MMM.

211
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,230
Anyways, did you guys
see that fucking, um,

212
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,210
okay.

213
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,120
The fuck is that,
that that one year anniversary,

214
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:49,540
I forgot member that lady when Trump
got in and was just screaming. No,

215
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,570
I don't understand that,
that type of protest

216
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,550
to do something like that because I
think a lot of people were thinking that,

217
00:13:59,551 --> 00:14:04,140
but to literally do what that woman did
makes anybody who doesn't like Trump

218
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:05,940
look like a fucking lunatic.

219
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,333
Hmm.

220
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,160
You know, just so much. Just weird
shit like that. Like I saw last night,

221
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,000
the Sag awards had all women presenters.

222
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,120
I just fucking for the fucking life
of me who comes up with this shit,

223
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,500
all of it just seems like
self preservation to me
and none of it seems like

224
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,240
you're actually going
to work on the problem.

225
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:35,870
Like that's all the sag awards have
to fucking do is just have all female

226
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:40,430
presenters and be like, yes, see that.
They're all good people over there.

227
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:45,380
They get it. It's a show of solidarity
as a show of strength. I Dunno.

228
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,340
I think it's a pretty weak fucking effort.
You know,

229
00:14:49,341 --> 00:14:50,630
we're going to wear all black.

230
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,880
We're going to where we're going to
have all female presenters. There we go.

231
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,810
We've been vetted.

232
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,803
Yeah,

233
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,470
I hate that word by the way.

234
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,373
MMM.

235
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,440
Yeah, that's, that's the whole
fucking thing. It's just a,

236
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,090
I mean, who, who the fuck?
Who is pro sexual harassment?

237
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,630
Why would you need to go that much out
of your way to do something as silly as

238
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:23,620
that, which in a lot of ways is kind of
reverse sexist, isn't it? I don't know.

239
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,950
Here's one fucking thing about this.

240
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,580
This is the only business I know
about is this business that I'm in.

241
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:30,320
This business is fucking brutal and a,

242
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,360
it routinely picks people up and slams
him against the pavement emotionally

243
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,220
every fucking day. Regardless of
what's between you, between your legs.

244
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,063
I Dunno.

245
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,220
All right. I, I don't know.

246
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,170
I don't even know what I'm trying to say
here. I just look at it and I'm like,

247
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:52,960
well, if they just decided they were
going to have all male presenters,

248
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:57,340
that would be considered the
most sexist thing ever. And uh,

249
00:15:57,341 --> 00:16:00,730
and then on the other side, if you
want all this fucking, all these

250
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,683
creeps,

251
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,280
well, islands speeds specific. Only the
male creeps in Hollywood if you want.

252
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:11,100
All of them out. I don't know that
that's the fucking way to do it.

253
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,700
If that's an effective way
to do it everywhere buddy.

254
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:18,150
Where's the same colored shirt?
And you have all women presenters.

255
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,650
You know, I don't have a, I don't
have a degree in fighting crime,

256
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,670
whatever that degree is.

257
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,063
Uh,

258
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,810
but I don't think same colored
shirts is going to do it.

259
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,310
We have to stop Isis. Okay. Everybody
wear blue shirts on Tuesday.

260
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,070
Okay.

261
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,460
He's not wearing a blue shirt.
Does that mean he's in Isis?

262
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,043
MMM,

263
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,290
it does not. What it is,
Bill, it says it's symbolism.

264
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:54,060
It's a sign of strength though. Jesus.
All right. Maybe that is what it is.

265
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:57,930
I have no fucking idea. Um, this,
this why, this is why I watch sports.

266
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,650
I watch fucking sports. So once
again, the New England patriots,

267
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,660
they're in their 10th fucking super bowl.

268
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,100
They have a chance to
win this six Superbowl.

269
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,023
Literally what

270
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,290
Tom Brady Belicheck and these guys are
doing as much as you guys fucking hate

271
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,050
him.
Every fucking time we win a game,

272
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,530
the sub giant Goddamn conspiracy
because nobody will give it up.

273
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,020
That there are fucking great team.
Uh,

274
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:25,680
what they've done at this point has
transcended the game of football.

275
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,660
All right? You gotta put them
up there with like the fucking,

276
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,480
I would say the Yankees from Dimaggio to,
uh,

277
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,490
Mickey Mantle that run there with the
amount of world series that they went to,

278
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,640
the amount that they want.

279
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,353
MMM.

280
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,560
The Canadians back in the day,
the Celtics in the 60s. I mean,

281
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:54,120
that's literally what you're watching.
And for them to be doing it now,

282
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,860
you know the reason why that never happens
anymore because now there's like 30

283
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:03,570
fucking teams and every,
basically every sport.

284
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,900
It's just too, it's too difficult
to do and somehow they are doing it.

285
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:08,220
So as much as you hate him,

286
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,350
can you at least give it up on
that or are you just going to say,

287
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,080
I don't know if we're going to start
weighing football's again and fucking,

288
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,560
I dunno. I Dunno. Um, all right.
Speaking of the Canadian say,

289
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:23,820
how are you guys doing up there?
Montreal. Okay. How are you?

290
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:26,580
Watch any Bruins Canadians Games lately.
We fucking,

291
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,950
we beat them three times
in the last eight days.

292
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,430
And the only reason why I know that
is cause Joe Barton from the, uh,

293
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,230
the great puck off podcast told
me I've been so goddamn busy. Uh,

294
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,540
I only watched the first
period of one of the Games.

295
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,190
I've missed so much Bruins hockey,

296
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,040
this and I know they're playing great
and they're on this amazing streak and a

297
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,410
pretty excited that they'd beat the
Canadians three times in the last eight

298
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:49,770
games.

299
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,340
I know I had all the games taped so I'm
gonna I'm going to have to watch them in

300
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:57,300
like one period segments now cause uh,
cause I got the Kiddo at home.

301
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,200
But uh, having said that, everybody knows
the regular season doesn't mean shit.

302
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,080
Um,
you know,

303
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,380
and Regulus I'm telling you,
regular season stats,

304
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,310
just go back to somebody's schedule and
look at what they did against playoff

305
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:13,450
teams.
And even then,

306
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,580
I think in football it gives you a
little bit more of a gauge. But like, uh,

307
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,480
in basketball,
baseball and hockey,

308
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,640
I don't think it means shit
because on any given night,

309
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,980
any they play so many games,
any team can beat another team.

310
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,870
But a wedding in the playoffs and
winning four out of seven is it's a whole

311
00:19:34,871 --> 00:19:39,580
different ballgame. So, um, I just wish
more announcers would do that shit.

312
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,340
You know what I mean? Look at the
division, like even look like,

313
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:45,640
look at the Patriots for how many years
we've gotten all these double digit wins.

314
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,050
The fucking AFC east has been so goddamn
weeks, so many years, so many years.

315
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,160
Like the jets,

316
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,020
who by the way beat the Jag was in the
regular season that jet's fucking suck.

317
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,930
The dolphins have socked in. The
bills have such, so many of those.

318
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,050
You escaped Gibson, you
know, or at least mediocre.

319
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,640
And that has given us five to
six wins every fucking year.

320
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,423
MMM.

321
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,080
Anyway, all right. I'm done. I'm done
with, I'm done with the Goddamn sports.

322
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:16,860
Let's talk about, uh, it
was my dogs and my daughter.

323
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,530
It was my daughter's first birthday.
This, uh, this past weekend.

324
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:26,160
I can't believe it. She's already won.
She's no longer a baby. She's a toddler,

325
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,000
which is pretty amazing. And I gotta
be honest with you, it's a little sad,

326
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,480
you know what I mean? She's now motoring
around the house and uh, I dunno,

327
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,250
it's already going by way
too fast. And uh, so anyways,

328
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,760
it was her birthday, right?
So I decided that, you know,

329
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,100
every year for her birthday is a dad.
I'm going to make her a homemade cake.

330
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,390
And I did it. And uh, we had like the, uh,

331
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,780
invited all of these people. Like
it's weird, like all of our friends,

332
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,770
a bunch of our friends I should say,
um, had kids in like the last year,

333
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,990
I'd like the last three years.

334
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:06,991
So we had 16 little kids over here plus
their parents and a few of them brought

335
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:10,960
friends. Like we had like a, a,

336
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,380
yeah,

337
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,830
we had, we had a house party, but
it was just kids. It was awesome.

338
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,110
The kids were, uh, it was, it was amazing,

339
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:24,830
man. It just blew my mind
cause I was sitting out,

340
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:27,090
there was like 30 people
in my house at least.

341
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,390
And I remember standing
there thinking like, wow,

342
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:32,340
like literally like a year and a half ago,

343
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:37,341
this would have been a bunch of guys
sitting here smoking cigars on the back

344
00:21:37,621 --> 00:21:38,910
porch,
drinking booze.

345
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,440
And now I've got all these kids
running around all of this stuff.

346
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:46,230
And I gotta tell you after
watching all the kids,

347
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:47,730
I'm kind of psyched I had a daughter,

348
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,470
two little girls, they're made, they're
like little adults. They just stay,

349
00:21:55,471 --> 00:21:58,620
sit there if they're emotionally stable,

350
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,880
the little boys that they're,
they're fucking lunatics.

351
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,410
They're running all over the
place. That club, I got this,

352
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:11,880
this fountain out in my front yard
and I know that sounds wild bill. Wow.

353
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,500
You got a fountain in your front yard.

354
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,150
You know what I would say about our
farm to go back and watch that, uh,

355
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,120
Fred Armisen sketch on SNL
when he does that thing.

356
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:23,660
Marble columns when they would,

357
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,440
talking about putting marble columns
on the front of Split entry houses.

358
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,060
I hate this fucking fountain.
I've never liked it.

359
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,030
It's just a giant, it's,
it's like a fucking,

360
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,790
it's just a giant place for mosquitoes
to Fuckin and give us West Nile virus.

361
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,830
You know what I mean?
But they give you though,

362
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,490
then you got to buy these little fucking
donuts of poison that you throw in

363
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:52,120
there. And then a bird comes by and
drinks out of it and then the bird dies.

364
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,550
So I never have any water in there.

365
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:58,420
So these boys run out there that
climbing up on the fucking thing.

366
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:01,180
I'm having a panic attack that
one of them's gonna fall down.

367
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,820
You get them off of that,

368
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:06,970
then they're throwing rocks down
to the driveway hitting the cars.

369
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,560
I couldn't get, I, you know, a
little kid so I didn't get upset,

370
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:13,990
but I was just like, wow man, this is, uh,

371
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,150
having a girl is a lot easy
on the parenting thing.

372
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,370
I mean, they sit down, they're like
chill. They're thinking, you know,

373
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,860
the boys are just like hilarious.
I don't know if you turn your back,

374
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:31,170
one of them's going to be,
I get an idea.

375
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,930
What if I jumped through
the screen door? So, um,

376
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,060
I dunno. Made me feel lucky again.
So everybody gathers around, um,

377
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,730
to sing happy birthday.
And I got this cake that made and uh,

378
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,420
I've never made a cake before and
I didn't, I didn't try it out.

379
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:55,100
I didn't want to test a slice now of a
giant slice taken out. So I was basically,

380
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,403
uh,

381
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:00,170
going to have 30 people all taste the
cake in front of me and I was waiting for

382
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:03,110
this tastes like shit, the cake's
too dry or whatever. But uh,

383
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:08,620
fortunately everybody seemed
to like the cake and um,

384
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,940
after that, the whole Party was downhill.
That was, that was like the big thing.

385
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:15,350
I was just like,
I just have to get pat.

386
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:16,940
I got to get on the other
side of the cake here.

387
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,720
People eat the cake and they
actually like it. God knows.

388
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:24,950
If my wife didn't like it, she would've
let me know, you know? Well, in fact,

389
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:27,980
she did try the frosting the night before
and she let me know that she thought

390
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:30,410
it could have been a little more shocked.
It just tastes sweet.

391
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,130
I just wish there was more cocoa in it.
You know what I mean?

392
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,750
And I just went like, yeah. And then
had like a full on fucking panic attack,

393
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:40,983
you know?

394
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,800
It's like, why would you tell me that she,
you know, I'm stressing about this shit.

395
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,420
I don't know. That's what they do.
That's what they do. What, what, what,

396
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:52,880
what would they be doing if they
weren't fucking criticizing us?

397
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:55,770
Okay.

398
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,130
Why can't there be an award show
about that? Where they protest,

399
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:02,400
the lack of complements a man gets
the second he marries a woman.

400
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,100
I don't give a shit if my wife cooked
a shoe. How does it taste bill? Oh,

401
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,970
it's delicious though.
Can I have more than the laces?

402
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,800
It's almost like pasta except
their shoe laces, you know,

403
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,780
put on a fucking brave face.

404
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,740
Too many times I've made something.

405
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,150
Yeah,

406
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,680
okay. I've made my wife dinner and she's
been the first bite she bites into.

407
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:31,190
She goes,

408
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,540
[inaudible] [inaudible], [inaudible]
[inaudible] and then she runs over and

409
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,860
grabs some salt or something like that.
Or just like if I ever fucking,

410
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,100
a few times I've ever done that,

411
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,490
I did it for, I think for the first
time since I can ever remember.

412
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:49,410
I did it this year and it
was just one of those nights,

413
00:25:49,411 --> 00:25:54,000
it was late night and she was tired
and she just went to the fridge and she

414
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:56,160
usually can look in there
and figure something out.

415
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,310
And this time she just didn't throw
it together and it wasn't good.

416
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,400
And she was like, how was
it? I didn't say anything.

417
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:06,670
I just kind of gave her a look like you.
And then she immediately,

418
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:07,504
she was just like,

419
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,870
yeah,
you think it's bad.

420
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,870
And then immediately it would
be like, no, no, no, no. It's
good. It's good. It's just,

421
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:22,580
you know, you've made better,
you know, and they need just

422
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,890
fallen down the fucking whole. You're
like, why did I, why was I honest?

423
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,780
She does it to me all the fucking time.

424
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,593
Okay.

425
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,800
I thought this was a little dry at that.
[inaudible] it's like a fuck.

426
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:36,820
I feel like I'm on the,
uh,

427
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:39,460
the iron chef whenever I put
something on the fucking table.

428
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:41,850
Yeah.

429
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,180
I mean, I'm literally talking
like oatmeal, like if I
put too much milk in there,

430
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:50,130
she'd be like, it's too soupy, it's
too soupy, and I want to be like,

431
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:53,880
you know what? If it wasn't as hot as it
was, what bill was that as hot as it is?

432
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:57,570
I would literally dump that over your
fucking head. All right. What do you,

433
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:59,040
what do you like a food critic?

434
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,380
This is actually making me
upset kind of a fucking person.

435
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Another person makes them a meal
and all you do is criticize it.

436
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,170
How about you at least go,
hey,

437
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,750
I really appreciated that you took
the time out to make me a meal.

438
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:14,830
That's one of the most kindest,

439
00:27:14,831 --> 00:27:18,520
loving things at one human being could
do for another meeting by a human being.

440
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,480
Having said that,
I like a little bit less milk.

441
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,210
There's no way to criticize it
without coming off like a jerk.

442
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,300
I'm just in the future just to let
you know, I like a little less milk,

443
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,990
by the way, making a homemade cake
not that hard. It's not that hard.

444
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:41,020
Don't be intimidated. It's easy
up making a pie. The Pie crust,

445
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:44,800
that's a fucking art. Making a
cake, not that fucking hard. Um,

446
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,120
I made a three layered cake and
what's going to happen is, um,

447
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,200
each layer is going to be a
little fucking little. Uh,

448
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,020
I know I was really hard
to try and make them level.

449
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,190
I don't know how to do that yet.

450
00:27:57,191 --> 00:27:59,290
I'm sure there's something
I can watch them on youtube.

451
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:03,340
But when you go to make it, if you
know each layer cake, you know,

452
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,580
if one's leaning to the left,
the others lean to the right,

453
00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:07,560
you just spin them around,

454
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,300
you put it together like Legos and know
that you're going to have frosting in

455
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:14,550
the middle. We can kind of level it
out and no one's gonna. Notice my, my,

456
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,610
my kid had a little lean
to it. Nothing crazy. Um,

457
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,720
probably the hardest thing
is frosting the cake. Um,

458
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,310
I started to watch videos on that,
but it was just, I was just too full.

459
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,020
I don't know.
It's just too fucking boring.

460
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:33,510
And there was all this playoff football
on. I wanted to watch that. So, um,

461
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,400
I probably could've done a better job at
that. I don't know. I'll ask my wife, God,

462
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,810
no, she'll fucking tell me. Right.

463
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:44,140
But enough with me complaining about her
complaining. Right. I sh I should be,

464
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,970
I should be secure enough
in my own baking skills.

465
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,870
Um,
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

466
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,260
no, no. You did this one wrong.
You know, I was trying to,

467
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,240
cause I never a lot of shit to
talk about, uh, this week. Um,

468
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,380
other than,

469
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,960
than just being completely blown away
that my daughter's already a year old.

470
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,060
I can't believe it. And uh,
I got her up this morning,

471
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,250
you know, and I just couldn't
believe how big she wasn't.

472
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,030
It was already thinking like
she used to be able to fit,

473
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,720
like her head would go from my elbow,

474
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,150
not even to the tips of my fingers.
Like I could just hold it just like that.

475
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,973
Yeah.

476
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,060
Now she just, she's,
she's huge. What happened?

477
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,273
You know,

478
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:41,260
there's nothing I can now see why people
have a bunch of kids cause you keep to

479
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:42,730
hit reset.

480
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:47,590
There's nothing better than having a baby
around your house. It's the greatest.

481
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:51,550
It's like a puppy times a million.
Um,

482
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,670
but what is cool, she started to
talk, so I'm waiting for these,

483
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,060
uh, the conversation cause some of
the kids, my God, they were hilarious.

484
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,580
Um, there was this little boy,
right? And he was talking to this,

485
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,450
they wanted to see like outside my house,
like along the side. So I go, all right,

486
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:12,520
I'll take you over there.
Just be careful cause you know,

487
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,480
there's all these concrete steps and shit.
I don't want somebody's fallen down.

488
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:22,480
So, uh, he points to the side of
the house. He goes, what's this?

489
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:27,280
And uh, I go, oh, that's the back of the
chimney. It was a little kid. He goes,

490
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:30,220
what's that? And then the little
girl answers and she goes,

491
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,600
that's where Santa Claus comes down and
the smoke goes up when you have a fire.

492
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:44,830
Then I think the little kid like the girl,
and he goes, uh, he says to me, he goes,

493
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,390
does she live here? And I started
the answer, the girl wants again,

494
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,370
answered the question.
She goes, no. She goes,

495
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:56,050
I live out in the desert and
the boy goes in the sand.

496
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,340
She goes,
now what the heck?

497
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,640
Kid was bombing. I was pulling for
him. I was like, yeah, you know,

498
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,350
say something funny, make
a left. Um, whatever.

499
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,770
I just liked that he was working on
his game at like four years of age.

500
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,300
Um,
which reminded me when I was a little kid,

501
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,460
I liked this girl who
lived in my neighborhood.

502
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,590
So I just went over a house,
not even invited.

503
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:30,970
I just went over her house, knocked on
the door, take your name was Michelle.

504
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,880
I knocked on the door and a moments. I
was like, yeah, hey, it's Michelle ohm.

505
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,590
She goes, yeah, she's sitting
there watching TV. And I go, okay.

506
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,710
So I went in there and I sat
down and watched TV with the,

507
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,380
her, her mother, and I
think her younger sibling.

508
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:50,680
And I never said a word for like an hour.

509
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,310
I just sat there watching
t cause I didn't know,

510
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,850
I didn't know what to do.
And then I just got up and left.

511
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,260
I always wondered what
that woman was thinking.

512
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,620
Like this little red headed boy came over
to visit my, our, our daughter today.

513
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,740
Honey. He came, he didn't
say a word and then he left.

514
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:15,190
It's an odd little fellow.
Um, anyways. All right,

515
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:17,680
let me read a little bit of advertising
here for this week. All right.

516
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:21,650
Dollar Shave club doe.
I remember those.

517
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,290
Another girl I had a crush on,

518
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,970
there was these two twins when I was in
first grade and I had a crush on one of

519
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:31,420
them. And uh, the other
one had this giant pen,

520
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,630
which I thought was the coolest
thing ever. Even though it was pink,

521
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,060
it was just a giant pen,
which was amazing in the early seventies,

522
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,070
like were, there was no fucking
computers and shit. I guess they were,

523
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,450
but computers were gigantic.

524
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,900
So she dropped it on the floor and she
didn't realize it and I took it and then

525
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:55,010
I started writing with, it was funny
was the way they had the desk set up.

526
00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:00,790
They had like us in like little groups
of four and we faced each other and she

527
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:04,430
was diagonal to me.
And I'm writing with this giant pink pen.

528
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,160
And she's going,
that's my pen.

529
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,210
And I was like, no, it isn't.
It's mind. So she's like an idiot.

530
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,560
Then she tells the teacher

531
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,700
and then she's going, Billy, is
that your pen? And I was like, yes.

532
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:22,470
And then the girls go, no, it was my pet.
Uh, I was going, no it isn't. It's my pen.

533
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,240
And then she did teach.
She's just like,

534
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,670
I don't think your mom
would buy you a pink pen.

535
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,310
And she took it and gave it back to the
girl. And you know, as a little kid,

536
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,490
like the embarrassment of that goes away.
Like eight seconds later,

537
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:37,930
you can't even remember. Like, you know,

538
00:33:37,931 --> 00:33:39,840
you don't have like the
mental capacity to be like,

539
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:44,220
did I just really try to pull that off?
You know,

540
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,270
why the fuck would I do that? Right.
So then I remember I went out,

541
00:33:48,271 --> 00:33:49,650
asked and I had to go to the bathroom.

542
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:54,240
So I went out to the bathroom and her twin
sister, the one I had the crush on, oh,

543
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:58,110
this is like the next day I went out to
go to the bathroom and her twin sister.

544
00:33:59,250 --> 00:33:59,620
Yeah.

545
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,210
Who I had a crush on

546
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,750
k walking out at the same time.

547
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,520
And to me when she saw me, she really
put her eyebrows down. She goes,

548
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,060
I heard what you did, I heard you
tried to steal my sister's pen.

549
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:16,740
And I just looked at, I think I said,
no I didn't and I just walked away.

550
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,240
And that was the end of that romance.

551
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,700
Um Oh there's a lot of sad stories. All

That's dollar shave club.com/burr dollar

572
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,750
There is no better time to try the club.
You know what's funny?

573
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,400
The only time I notice I
have my Invisalign in at
this point is when I go to

574
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:48,240
read this copy.

575
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,620
Okay?

576
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,640
I already suck at reading out loud,
but I become this mush mouth jackass.

577
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,610
By the way, I'm on train
number seven of 16. Wednesday.

578
00:36:00,611 --> 00:36:04,380
I go to trade number eight and I'll be
fucking halfway done all week from now.

579
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,970
Be Halfway done.
Um,

580
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,200
and I gotta tell you I'm
happy that I'm doing it.

581
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,630
They're happy that I'm doing it,
you know,

582
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,590
then all I gotta do for the
rest of my life is at night.

583
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:15,960
You throw in a little fucking mouth
guard to keep the teeth where they are,

584
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:19,890
where they are. And I'll have, I'll have
these love, nice teeth like fair faucet,

585
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:25,150
you know, I'll fucking white. You know, my
skin just gets older and older, you know,

586
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,670
people keep that teeth looking nice and
young so it looks like led lights coming

587
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:33,990
out of the year. Old fucking
pruned up face. All right.
Movement watches everybody.

588
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,850
Mvmt
uh,

589
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,190
and it's that time of
year when you could say,

590
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,360
I'd like a nice watch for no money.
All right?

591
00:36:44,361 --> 00:36:46,280
And it's that time of year again.
Uh,

592
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,340
you thought gift giving was
all over after Christmas,

593
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:53,510
but Valentine's Day is coming
up and you know what that means?

594
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,890
That means that guy has to spend
money and the woman does not,

595
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,200
even though it's bolted your
relationships, right? It's
both of your relationship,

596
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:09,530
I should say. I mean, if we really
want to have everything equal,

597
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:13,090
how about every other year
the lady pays for it, right?

598
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,220
Takes you out for a steak dinner.
Okay?

599
00:37:16,221 --> 00:37:19,700
Blows you in the back of the Uber on the
way home. Just, you know, make an effort.

600
00:37:19,701 --> 00:37:23,840
Ladies. Just make an effort. But
Valentine's Day is coming up so you know,

601
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,120
you must find the perfect gift.

602
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,170
Okay?

603
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,840
You know what I love about the fact that
I'm already married is I don't have to

604
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:35,220
deal with the pressure, this fucking
horse shit anymore. You know what I mean?

605
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,840
That whole, where is this
relationship going? Oh Shit.

606
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,860
Shut the fuck up.

607
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,360
Talk about how you may have procrastinated
in the past or your own experience

608
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:48,690
with how hard finding the perfect
Valentine's Day gift can be.

609
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,800
Well, you know who the fuck
knows what a woman wants, right?

610
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:57,370
Jesus Christ that changed every five
seconds and God knows it's gonna be

611
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:58,204
expensive.

612
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,320
What if you don't have a lot of money
and the woman you with you just sort of

613
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,840
banging, then you're not sure
if you're going to marry her,

614
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:08,950
but you got to get her some nice so
she'll keep touching it right when it'd be

615
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:11,980
nice to be goodbye or nice watch,
but not break the bank.

616
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:16,090

all they're worried about is what the
fuck they're wearing on this side.

621
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,160
You know, I really don't like this holiday

635

more high end than move

701
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:21,890
Okay.

702

All right. Let's read some questions here
for the week and let's get going. Billy,

703
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:28,830
you stupid La Cunt. All right, here we go.

704
00:43:28,831 --> 00:43:32,490
You never mentioned why
exactly you move to La.

705
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,050
I didn't know I was required to.
Why did you move to la?

706
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:43,090
I just listened to you and
Jim Floren cunt. Slash.

707
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:45,640
Florentine. He said, uh,

708
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,650
and Florentine said he
didn't see a difference with
comedians in New York City.

709
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,180
I find it hard to imagine that La,
Oh God,

710
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:59,870
this guy, I find it hard to amount. I'm
just going to read exactly what I wrote.

711
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,000
I find it hard to imagine that La,

712
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:06,770
there are a lot less cons in the
audience that get offended too easily.

713
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:08,311
Uh,

714
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:13,311
you then agreed with Jim that maybe it's
because you now live there and are used

715
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:17,570
to it. But the way you said
it didn't seem believable.

716
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,520
So what's the deal?

717
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,753
All right.
Like

718
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,370
there wasn't one capital letter,
no punctuation whatsoever.

719
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:28,890
A couple of periods maybe.
Um,

720
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,380
I'm not required to tell you
why I fucking moved here,

721
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:35,210
but I will to eat up some time.
Um,

722
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:36,660
yeah,

723
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,650
I was living in New York, I was
just sick of being there. It just,

724
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:44,850
it just gets a point where you know, you
get to be told too old and you're like,

725
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,680
I can't live like an animal anymore,

726
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:51,720
which means you're either going to
move outside the city or in my business

727
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:52,800
you're going to go to la.

728
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:57,420
And I had nothing going on in my
career other than the OPN Anthony show.

729
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,730
But the writing was on the wall
with that show where, you know,

730
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,440
those guys, like they had a bunch
of comics on and I was one of them.

731
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:14,441
Jim Norton got us all in and you know,

732
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:16,820
there was no money in
the budget to pay us.

733
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,700
But the way that they paid
us opie and Anthony Show,

734
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:21,740
because they assaulted the fucking earth,

735
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,190
they used to run
advertisements of our gigs.

736
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:31,070
And um, Dan, our gigs would
sell out and it was great.

737
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:35,450
But then the corporate cons there
said that they couldn't do it anymore,

738
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,090
you know, so then he kind
of had the hype, you,

739
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:43,460
your show during the show, which
would get in the way of, you know,

740
00:45:43,461 --> 00:45:45,440
whatever craziness was going on.

741
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,680
So that's kind of where my career was at.

742
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:51,110
I was on a radio show and
I wasn't getting paid.

743
00:45:51,111 --> 00:45:53,030
I wasn't getting any acting work.

744
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,590
And the only way I was
getting paid on the OPN,

745
00:45:57,591 --> 00:46:00,020
Anthony showed they no longer let them do

746
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,080
for whatever reason,
which is really short sighted

747
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,760
on Sirius XMS side because
opie and Anthony were this
launching pad for standup

748
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,640
careers. And they will make in like they,

749
00:46:19,641 --> 00:46:22,460
they made us become like these draws.

750
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,143
MMM.

751
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,620
And then that would then feed back into
the show because then these people were

752
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,320
selling all these tickets were like,
hey, I'm going to be an EOP anti show.

753
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:36,130
So if you know, you know what way,
what is it? Totally fucking worked.

754
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,560
It was the perfect fucking
relationship for about three years.

755
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:46,480
And then like what always happens is
the money people come in and they fucked

756
00:46:46,481 --> 00:46:47,380
the whole thing up.

757
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,160
So I mean that's not the
only reason I was, I was,

758
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,010
uh, leaving, but that's basically,

759
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:58,490
that was as it's high
up as I got in New York.

760
00:46:58,491 --> 00:47:02,650
I was on a radio show not getting paid.
That's it.

761
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,530
That's the best I could do. I had
already done an episode of law and order,

762
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,200
so,
you know,

763
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:11,720
and I couldn't get on the soprano's
cause that was a bunch of Italians and I

764
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:15,890
look like fucking idea Billy
red face over here. So, uh, the,

765
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,140
there was like no opportunity left for me.

766
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:23,890
And I was going down to the comedy
cellar like every single night and it was

767
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,110
like, it was like groundhog
day and I just, uh, you know,

768
00:47:29,111 --> 00:47:33,470
and I went out to la and I hated La
and I just came out here. I started,

769
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,331
each time I went out,

770
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:39,100
I was starting to like it and I
was fighting that feeling and uh,

771
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,910
I dunno, I just said, fuck it.
One day it's like, you know what,

772
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,530
I wouldn't mind living in an apartment,
paying a ton of money,

773
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:51,040
but I could actually have like
a couch that also wasn't my bed.

774
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,910
I wouldn't mind having a car.
Then I moved out here.

775
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:58,930
I had this apartment,
it was still a one bedroom,

776
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:03,250
but I had front and backstairs the
backstairs I did share with my neighbor,

777
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,140
but still,
that was amazing to me.

778
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:10,300
And I had a garage where I could park
my car and even though the traffic was

779
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:11,410
fucking horrific,

780
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,850
just the fact that I could live a
little more like a human being again.

781
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,153
Um,

782
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:19,390
okay.

783
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,030
Was appealing.

784
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,180
And then there was a ton of acting work
out here that I could potentially get.

785
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:27,770
Then I moved out here and
within the first year, um,

786
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:28,930
okay.

787
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:32,830
I got on breaking bad.
So that's why I came out here.

788
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:34,060
But I do have to tell you that the,

789
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,450
that I thought when it came out here
that the comedy scene was horrific.

790
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,420
So what I was trying to say on the
podcast is when I go back to the New York

791
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,870
now, it's just like, it's just,
I think it's just changed,

792
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:50,920
but because I'm not there every day,
I noticed the change.

793
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:53,760
Um, and out here last night, you know,

794
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,870
I was telling a couple of
jokes and there was silence.

795
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:58,840
So maybe that's what it was. I
don't know why you took it. So, uh,

796
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,950
so personally,
but that is a big fucking thing.

797
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:07,750
The whole east coast west
coast thing, um, I do, however,

798
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,860
I'm one of those weird people that
I do love both coasts, but, uh,

799
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,280
you know, I dunno, I'm
kind of out here right now.

800
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,750
I used to think like I'll always
move back when now I don't,

801
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,250
I don't know that I will. Who knows?
I don't fucking know. I have no idea.

802
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:25,380
I was kinda thinking about global warming.
Eventually I was going to,

803
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,020
I was going to have to move back there,

804
00:49:27,021 --> 00:49:30,980
but now it seems like it's
going to be all crazy weathers.

805
00:49:30,981 --> 00:49:34,310
So the fact that it was hot out here
now it's going to be extremely hot.

806
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:36,880
And the fact that it was cold back there,

807
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:41,630
now it's going to be extremely
fucking cold. And uh, I dunno,

808
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:46,970
I did like 40 something winners back east.
Okay.

809
00:49:46,971 --> 00:49:48,920
I put my time and,
all right.

810
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,170
I'd rather shove a lot of
a mud slide in this snuff.

811
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:58,070
So there you go. Alright. Alright,
Bill. My problems with women,

812
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:03,740
this is funny. He wrote my problems
with woman. Oh my problems with woman.

813
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,530
Yeah,

814
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:09,140
dear bill's very dull boy. Oh,
I love that one. All right.

815
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,960
I'm a huge fan from,

816
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:12,490
yeah,

817
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:13,750
I don't even know how to say this.

818
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:15,080
Yeah.

819
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,780
F E R m a n a g h

820
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:26,360
Furman na Nog. I don't
know, Ireland, Ireland.

821
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,920
I'm years old and I've
always been a fat cunt.

822
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,330
Well, that's good, man. You're,
you're looking at yourself
on asleep. Now let's, what,

823
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,490
what can we do about this?
Recently,

824
00:50:37,491 --> 00:50:41,930
I lost the weight and started getting
into the gym. They, you go, I'm now six,

825
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:43,280
one and 200 pounds.

826
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:47,930
So naturally have started getting
more female attention. All right,

827
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:50,420
this is all good.
I was never been,

828
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,990
I was never been successful with women,

829
00:50:53,991 --> 00:50:57,680
but now I'm turning this franchise
around. They, you'd go, well, dude,

830
00:50:57,681 --> 00:51:00,560
you're only 17. Give you just
getting out of the gate here.

831
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,970
My only problem is I'm a quiet guy
and don't know how to talk to them.

832
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,470
They seem to just want to talk about
bullshit or gossip and meaningless crap.

833
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,220
Oh God, dude, you can't
be this cynical at 17.

834
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:17,120
The sound like me right now
and I'm going to be 50. Um,

835
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,060
I try and be funny and make them laugh,
which can only get me so far.

836
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:28,120
I can't maintain a relationship because
they open their mouths and I contemplate

837
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:32,930
suicide. Jesus, he sounded like a writer.

838
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:38,060
You creative or something
or you think too much?

839
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:42,560
Uh, I consider myself as
straightforward, no bs kind of guy,

840
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,780
but I'm just a wanker. Uh, is
this a problem with me or them?

841
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:51,530
I don't hate women. I just don't
get along with them. If possible.

842
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:53,750
I would love to hear what Nia has to say.
Oh,

843
00:51:53,751 --> 00:51:57,140
she wouldn't like how you worded
all of this. Uh, thanks bill.

844
00:51:57,141 --> 00:51:59,510
And Go fuck yourself. Ps, if
you're getting into soccer,

845
00:51:59,511 --> 00:52:04,130
I suggest you support either Tottenham
or Liverpool is they have young,

846
00:52:04,131 --> 00:52:09,080
exciting teams and aren't
soulless corporate entities
like Chelsea, man city. Oh,

847
00:52:09,081 --> 00:52:10,280
I didn't know that.
All right.

848
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:16,910
I'll support Liverpool then. That's
where the Beatles and from, right.

849
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:20,780
I don't fucking know why. Anyways. Um,

850
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,670
all right. What's your problem?
Uh, I don't know. I think
you're a little defensive.

851
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,110
I think you're a little insecure,
so you're kind of projecting on them.

852
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:33,420
I know that that's what I did.
Uh,

853
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:38,500
so I would say open yourself
up a little bit more and uh,

854
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,510
you know, realize how amazing they
are. But women are just like men.

855
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:48,980
The good one is hard to find.
Good woman, hard to find.

856
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,890
So, um, you're only 17 too.

857
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:56,660
And I think also trying to make them
laugh is always a good thing. And, uh,

858
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:01,760
what I've learned is a lot of times
they just want you to listen and, uh,

859
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,820
they don't want you to try to
solve their problems. So just,

860
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,960
you know, when they tell a story,
hold both their hands and be like,

861
00:53:10,961 --> 00:53:15,370
oh my God, uh, I dunno.

862
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:20,770
Why would you ask me? Like, I know
anything about women? Jesus Christ,

863
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:24,790
they fucking hate me.
My fan base is a fucking sausage fest.

864
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:30,690
Um, I gotta give you more
advice than that. Uh,

865
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,700
yeah, dude, you, you see, this is a
weakness of mine, understanding women.

866
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,790
I have no idea.
You just basically a,

867
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,400
I dunno, it's like right in Charlie
Manson being like, hey, how do I, uh,

868
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:49,500
get along with people a little
more, a little more better? Um,

869
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,220
just probably better example, right?
Did he just die? What a fucking lifer.

870
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,020
What a fucking life.

871
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,860
I just can't imagine spending
that much time in jail.

872
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,260
Like he never getting out again.
You're in your thirties.

873
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:08,940
You're never getting out again. Okay.
You're not just sitting there like,

874
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:09,774
really?

875
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:11,603
Yeah.

876
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:14,270
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Um,

877
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,870
fascinating guy and in all the wrong
reasons you like, you've really like,

878
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:25,020
I literally never come in as far as
we know. Never committed a murder,

879
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:30,120
but with such a fucking lunatic.
I remember seeing a horror movie.

880
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,430
We're all a guy to do was just whisper
in somebody's ear or something like that

881
00:54:34,431 --> 00:54:36,920
and then they just fucking would
just do whatever the guy said.

882
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,770
Just had that like literally the
fucking devil he spent his whole life,

883
00:54:42,771 --> 00:54:44,390
you know, just imagine
if he ever, you know,

884
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,940
he got Micky Dolenz as
part of the monkeys.

885
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:49,803
It's unreal.

886
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:53,360
Somebody like Hitler's drawings.

887
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:55,890
Yeah.

888
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,100
So you have to encourage
people. Alright. Westerns.

889
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,620
Everybody a dear Billy Sundance.
Billy the Sundance. Okay.

890
00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:04,770
I've been just getting into Western.
I wasn't a huge fan as a kid.

891
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:08,220
I was more into space and
futuristic stuff. But as a,

892
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:12,210
around my mid twenties and then
living more of a loner life,

893
00:55:12,211 --> 00:55:13,770
I'm starting to connect more.

894
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:19,140
I'm really looking forward to
the new Christian Bale movie.

895
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,900
Hostiles Oh,
I can't wait to see that.

896
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:26,490
I hope I said that correctly
because I loved three 10 to Yuma.

897
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,920
I loved the original to my other
favorites are tombstone and butch Cassidy.

898
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:36,921
I was hoping to hear which one your
favorites are and get some recommendations

899
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,070
to watch while I'm snowed
in for the next four days.

900
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:44,520
All the best to you and your family.
I would say a the Clint Eastwood's,

901
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:49,020
the Spaghetti Westerns fistful of
dollars, the good, the bad and the ugly.

902
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:55,150
Um, they had like a trilogy of those, um,

903
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:58,690
the outlaw Josey Wales, you
know, I hate to say this,

904
00:55:58,691 --> 00:56:01,930
but I've never seen the unforgiven that
was right when I started doing stand up

905
00:56:01,931 --> 00:56:06,880
and I just started missing out
on shit. Um, I liked those.

906
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:08,080
The wild bunch.

907
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:11,503
MMM.

908
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,300
Let's see, uh, the magnificent seven,

909
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:23,470
the original Westworld.
There's one that combines futurist future,

910
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:28,050
a rustic shit there. Um,
Psi Phi and Westerns.

911
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:30,820
Yule Brenner was incredible
in that you'll Brendan,

912
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:33,250
one of my favorites of all time.
Not because he's bald like me,

913
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:36,100
but I just thought it was a shit.
Um,

914
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,490
I never saw butch Cassidy
and the Sundance kid.

915
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:46,250
Yeah, I think that I would say that,
that that was all of them. I never,

916
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:49,440
never quite into the John Wayne ones.
Those ones were too far back in the day.

917
00:56:49,441 --> 00:56:54,210
I like the ones from like the 60s. I liked
those and I liked all the war movies.

918
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:58,860
Kelly's heroes, dirty dozen bridge
over the river. Kwai Oh, that Shit.

919
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:04,560
Um, so those are my recommendations. I
would go with the Clint Eastwood, uh,

920
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:09,570
Spaghetti Westerns. Alright. My
life's flopped. My fucked life.

921
00:57:09,571 --> 00:57:13,650
Sorry. My fucked life to
sounds like a Sitcom, right?

922
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:20,130
Oh fuck. The battery to the battery.
Just die. All the battery's gonna die.

923
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:25,080
Oh fuck. I gotta wrap this up.
All right, my fuck life. Hey,

924
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:29,080
if I don't get through all this, thank
you to everybody for listening. And uh,

925
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:29,681
once again,

926
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:33,250
congratulations to the Patriots and
the Eagles and congratulations to the

927
00:57:33,251 --> 00:57:36,820
Jaguars and the vikings on
two great seasons. All right.
For grade seasons there,

928
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,830
right my fuck life.
Dear bill and Nia,

929
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:44,570
I'm 17 and still in high
school. I'm a bit of a, I mean,

930
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:49,270
a bit of a pickle. A, what the fuck is
war on with this thing? It keeps beeping.

931
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,690
I think I'm falling from my best friend.

932
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,720
I realized after we were
falling asleep at her house,

933
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:00,310
she had just taken off from makeup and
made a joke like, sorry, I look so bad.

934
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:01,150
But when I looked at her,

935
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:04,420
I thought she looked so beautiful
and cute and her sweatshirt,

936
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:07,990
that was just a little too big for her.

937
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:12,890
What does his flashdance however,
she's currently dating a cunt. Well,

938
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,890
what the fuck are you doing over at house?

939
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:21,890
All right, I'm back. I guess my,
my recorder was almost filled up.

940
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:25,820
Sorry about that sound. We had to fucking
attitude things together as always,

941
00:58:25,821 --> 00:58:30,050
as always making my life
difficult. Um, anyways. Yeah.

942
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:34,520
So what are you doing over
at this person's house?
She's dating somebody else.

943
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,950
Anyway, she goes, he's a loser.

944
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:41,870
No Job's still gets an allowance and
expensive car that his mommy bought him.

945
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:44,180
Sits at home all day playing video games,

946
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:48,110
getting stoned and treats people like
he's above them. She knows I hate him.

947
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:52,610
And I openly mock him, um,
in front of our friends,

948
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,920
her and even him,
uh,

949
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:00,140
like he got are this really generic but
expensive looking hard shape necklace.

950
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,110
Um, when she showed it to everyone,
I looked at him and said loudly, wow,

951
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:11,720
must've cost your mom quite
a big whatever that means.

952
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:16,280
As you can imagine, he tries to avoid me.
Yeah, well you're being a fucking cunt.

953
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:22,910
Uh, we share the same friends
and they hate him and like me,

954
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,960
but mind you, I'm no prize
either. I'm trying to get a job.

955
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:29,900
Unlike him out Jesus,
you don't even have a fucking job.

956
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,940
And then saving up for a car.

957
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,430
So our choices are two guys who don't
have a job and she has a rich mom.

958
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:41,720
Well there you go. I tend
to be nice, a nice guy,

959
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,700
but can at times, cause people are put
my jokes and even be a deck with my joke.

960
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,950
She sounded like you're being a dick.
I'm not saying you are,

961
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:52,430
but you're being a dick to this guy.
He's at least three inches taller than me.

962
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:56,480
Enhanced. Some are
better looking, I guess.

963
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:00,740
He's got this great smile that
makes me want to fuck him up for,

964
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:04,460
well that makes me want
to fuck it up for him.

965
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,030
But recently I've started to turn my
life around, quit bare porn and drugs.

966
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:15,380
My grades are going up, applying
for college, working out a lot,

967
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:19,310
but all this in hopes of catching her eye.
Like I said,

968
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,800
she's my best friend and as a boyfriend,

969
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:23,750
so I really don't know how to handle this.

970
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:28,400
Any help from you and Neil would be
greatly appreciated. Ah, yeah dude. Um,

971
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,950
I would start fishing in
a different watering hole.

972
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:32,983
All right.

973
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:34,851
You know,

974
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:39,851
for you to sit there and stand there
and be a cunt to her boyfriend talking

975
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:43,970
about a boyfriend and you go on
over that for over a fucking house.

976
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:47,543
MMM.

977
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,550
It sounds to me like you're the,

978
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,760
you're like Chris Rock says you're
in the friend zone. So what you need,

979
01:00:55,830 --> 01:01:00,600
what you need is you need some
time away from her. All right?

980
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,500
Move on with your fucking life. Keep
working out. Get you shit going.

981
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,650
And who knows?
You might just meet somebody else.

982
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,380
And then eventually when
she dumps his losers,

983
01:01:10,381 --> 01:01:12,850
she comes around and sees you
should be, oh my God, look at you.

984
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:16,170
You're going to college. You look,
Greg, you've been working out, you know,

985
01:01:16,171 --> 01:01:18,870
watch porn. Who knows? Maybe it'll happen,

986
01:01:18,871 --> 01:01:20,760
but I could tell you it's
definitely not going to happen.

987
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,590
If you could just going to be your friend,

988
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:27,790
they making snide remarks about
her, her boyfriend. Come on.

989
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:31,980
Do you gotta be better than that?
That's just coming off like a, you know,

990
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:35,730
you're acting like a fucking,
you're acting like a Douche.

991
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,630
D and I don't know how else to put
it. Um, that's not a strong move.

992
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,850
All right?
Um,

993
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:47,550
then you should have more going on in
your life then the fucker be, you know,

994
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,940
you still have more self esteem
than that. All right? Okay.

995
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:55,780
She wants to date this fucking guy.
Guess what? It's her loss. All right?

996
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,960
So fuck it. Get on with your life. Keep
working out and work out for yourself.

997
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,620
Go to college for yourself.
Do all this shit for yourself.

998
01:02:04,621 --> 01:02:05,910
Feel good about yourself.

999
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:10,830
You start putting out more of a positive
vibe and it's supposed to, you know,

1000
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:15,690
hanging around her shitting on her current
boyfriend. I mean that's just like,

1001
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:20,850
I don't know if that's not a good
look. Okay. I in you all right.

1002
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:27,330
Do what I just said Dope. Cause I
don't have any professional training.

1003
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:32,040
All right. Dumping my girlfriend
a Billy billboard brow.

1004
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:37,800
I fucking asshole. That's
another good one. Recent fatty,

1005
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:40,710
a podcast stand up and all that jazz.
Anyways,

1006
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:46,170
I'm a 24 year old dude and I've been
dating and living with my girl for almost

1007
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:48,420
four years now and I finally had enough.

1008
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,110
She's a real Downer and talk shit
about people including a friend's,

1009
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:54,240
like it's an Olympic sport now.

1010
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:58,100
The problem is she lost a job a month
ago on account of a shit-talking.

1011
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:02,250
It hasn't exactly been going
out and looking for a new
one because she's anxious

1012
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,640
or whatever. Leaving me to
pick up her end of the bills.

1013
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:09,330
She didn't have any savings because she
had picked up the habit of going out and

1014
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:13,260
drinking every night. I honestly
wouldn't have a problem, uh,

1015
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,580
just up and leaving.

1016
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:20,120
But the apartment is a stone's throw from
the beach and my other roommate and I

1017
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:21,600
really don't want to leave

1018
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,630
the fucking decisions people
make right near the beach.

1019
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,900
The other roommate is my best friend.
Okay.

1020
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:34,530
She's got a lot of books and
shit and the bed is hers.

1021
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:39,300
So when be a little,
so would be a little difficult to do.

1022
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:43,080
The old put all this stuff in a box trick,
a deep down.

1023
01:03:43,081 --> 01:03:46,530
I do still have loved for her.

1024
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,110
So the idea of kicking
her out hurts my heart,

1025
01:03:49,111 --> 01:03:52,080
but I just can't deal with the
endless drama and unhappiness.

1026
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,090
We'd love to hear what your advice
on the podcast and as always go fuck

1027
01:03:57,091 --> 01:03:57,751
yourself.
Yeah.

1028
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:02,751
The more the relationship has run its
course and you need to go your separate

1029
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:08,970
ways. And sometimes when that happens, you
know somebody, yeah, somebody gets hurt.

1030
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,033
All right?

1031
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,920
But you're not doing her any favors if
you don't want or to be with you and you

1032
01:04:13,921 --> 01:04:17,850
just, you just wasting
her and your time. So,

1033
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:19,763
uh,

1034
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,740
yeah.

1035
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,573
You know,

1036
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:27,370
this is why you don't fucking live with
somebody unless you know you're going to

1037
01:04:27,371 --> 01:04:31,780
marry him. I don't, I don't
know. I don't know if, yeah, boy.

1038
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:34,930
Um,
so what do you do?

1039
01:04:34,931 --> 01:04:37,930
Break up with her and then tell her
to move out all at the same time?

1040
01:04:37,931 --> 01:04:42,850
Or are those two separate conversations?
I just break up with her

1041
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,890
and then let her bring up
where am I going to live?

1042
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:48,330
Yeah.

1043
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:51,120
Then I'd be like, well, I don't know.
I mean the coastline is pretty long,

1044
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:54,180
so I'm sure there's another
beachfront apartment she could be.

1045
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:59,040
And I'm assuming your name's on the lease.
Usually when there's a breakup,

1046
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,020
the guy has to leave
and leave half his shit.

1047
01:05:01,021 --> 01:05:04,610
So it seems like you're in
a decent position here. Uh,

1048
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,190
who wants a negative drunk without a job?
I don't think you want,

1049
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:10,950
that doesn't sound like you want it.
Um,

1050
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:14,640
and I think the love you have for her
was who she used to be or who you thought

1051
01:05:14,641 --> 01:05:18,610
she was. So neither. Yeah.

1052
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:19,910
Those are happening right now.

1053
01:05:19,911 --> 01:05:24,350
So it's time for you to tell her to hit
the bricks. Happy new year, sweetheart.

1054
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:27,260
Beat it.
You can't say it like that.

1055
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:32,830
I just tell her, look, we need to
talk and sit down. She could deal.

1056
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:34,930
What's the problem?
What's the problem?

1057
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,680
Me and you just to fight through
that fucking horrible feeling.

1058
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:41,450
There's nothing worse.

1059
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,920
The only worse than a woman crying is
when she's about to cry because you still

1060
01:05:45,921 --> 01:05:49,010
have hope that she's not going to cry.
So you're on pins and needles.

1061
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:52,550
Once she's crying, you're
like, fuck, this sucks.

1062
01:05:52,551 --> 01:05:56,930
But you kind of know what's
going to happen. Um, yeah.

1063
01:05:56,931 --> 01:06:01,310
You just got to sit down and just
say, listen, um, I'm not happy.

1064
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:06,420
This isn't working for me anymore and

1065
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,900
we need to break up. All
right? Just like that. Boom,

1066
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:18,180
boom, boom. And you got to get that
out. You got to get all of that out.

1067
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:23,840
Don't sit there and be like, oh,
I don't know how to say this.

1068
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:26,700
A Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,
and turn it into a 45 minute thing.

1069
01:06:26,701 --> 01:06:31,590
Rip The bandaid odd. Just rip it
off. We need to talk. I'm not happy.

1070
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:37,270
We need to break up.
Okay.

1071
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,490
You go into the two minute offense.

1072
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,163
Okay.

1073
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,930
Okay. You don't get out of
bounds. You keep the clock run it.

1074
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:48,500
You want this game to
be over? No, I dunno.

1075
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:52,580
Yeah. That's what I would
do. That's what I would do.

1076
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,290
Just sit down and just say,
all right, in eight seconds,

1077
01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:02,260
this relationship is going to be
over. Okay. I'm on this side of,

1078
01:07:02,261 --> 01:07:05,360
of the eight seconds. All I do.
How long does it take to say that?

1079
01:07:05,361 --> 01:07:08,510
I'm going to time it right now.
All right. We need to talk.

1080
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:14,430
I'm not happy.
We need to break up.

1081
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,140
I just did that in like five seconds

1082
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,470
and then she go, Whoa, what
have we, blah, blah, blah. No,

1083
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:25,950
I've made the decision we need to break
up. It just, it's just not working for me.

1084
01:07:25,951 --> 01:07:28,770
I don't love you the way I used to love
you. That's what can I say about it?

1085
01:07:28,771 --> 01:07:30,870
They can get mad. They can
cry, they can do all that shit,

1086
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,790
but the thing is you conveyed it and
you're out. Where am I going to live?

1087
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:39,430
I don't know.
We'll figure that out.

1088
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:44,230
I guess that's the next thing we need to
figure out. Yeah. Well it's your life.

1089
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:45,310
Gonna suck after that,

1090
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,850
but it's never going to suck more than
staying in a fucking relationship.

1091
01:07:48,851 --> 01:07:53,290
You don't want to be in. All right. And
that's one to grow on. Go fuck yourselves.

1092
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:54,430
I'll talk to you on Thursday.

1093
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:01,890
All right, I'm back. I guess my,
my recorder was almost filled up.

1094
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:05,820
Sorry about that sound. We had to fucking
attitude things together as always,

1095
01:08:05,821 --> 01:08:10,020
as always making my life
difficult. Um, anyways. Yeah.

1096
01:08:10,021 --> 01:08:14,520
So what are you doing over
at this person's house?
She's dating somebody else.

1097
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:16,940
Anyway, she, he goes, he's a loser.

1098
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:21,860
No Job's still gets an allowance and
expensive car that his mommy bought him,

1099
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:24,170
sits at home all day playing video games,

1100
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:28,100
getting stone and treats people like
he's above them. She knows I hate him.

1101
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:32,600
And I openly mock him, um,
in front of our friends,

1102
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:35,090
her and even him,
uh,

1103
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:40,150
like he got are this really generic but
expensive looking hard shape necklace.

1104
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:46,100
Um, when she showed it to everyone,
I looked at him and said loudly, wow,

1105
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:51,280
must've cost your mom quite
a big whatever that means.

1106
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:56,270
As you can imagine, he tries to avoid me.
Yeah. Well, you're being a fucking cunt.

1107
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:02,910
Uh, we share the same friends
and they hate him and like me,

1108
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:06,960
but mind you, I'm no prize
either. I'm trying to get a job.

1109
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:09,900
Unlike him out Jesus,
you don't even have a fucking job.

1110
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:11,850
And then saving up for a car.

1111
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:17,580
So our choices are two guys who don't
have a job and she has a rich mom. Well,

1112
01:09:17,581 --> 01:09:21,750
there you go. I tend
to be nice, a nice guy,

1113
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,740
but can at times piss people off with my
jokes and even be a dick with my jokes.

1114
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:28,950
You sound like you're being a dick.
I'm not saying you are,

1115
01:09:28,951 --> 01:09:32,400
but you're being a dick to this guy.
He's at least three inches taller than me.

1116
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,480
Enhanced. Some are
better looking, I guess.

1117
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:40,920
He's got this great smile that
makes me want to fuck them up. Push.

1118
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:44,460
Oh,
that makes me want to fuck it up for them.

1119
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,013
Okay.

1120
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:51,030
But recently I've started to turn my
life around, quit bare porn and drugs.

1121
01:09:51,031 --> 01:09:55,380
My grades are going up, applying
for college, working out a lot,

1122
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:59,310
but all this in hopes of catching her eye.
Like I said,

1123
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:01,800
she's my best friend and as a boyfriend,

1124
01:10:01,801 --> 01:10:03,750
so I really don't know how to handle this.

1125
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:08,400
Any help from you and Neil would be
greatly appreciated. Ah, yeah dude. Um,

1126
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:12,900
I would start fishing in a
different watering hole. All right.

1127
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:14,820
You know,

1128
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:19,820
for you to sit there and stand there
and be a cunt to her boyfriend talking

1129
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,970
about a boyfriend and you're going
over that for over a fucking house.

1130
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:27,603
MMM.

1131
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:31,170
It sounds to me like you're the yearlings.

1132
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:35,740
Chris Rock says you're in the friend zone.
So what you need,

1133
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:40,750
what you need is you need some
time away from her. All right?

1134
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:44,500
Move on with you fucking life. Keep
working out. Get you shit going.

1135
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:45,933
And who knows?

1136
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:50,350
You might just meet somebody else and
then eventually when she dumps this loser,

1137
01:10:50,351 --> 01:10:52,840
she comes around and sees you.
She'll be, oh my God, look at you.

1138
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:56,170
You're going to college. You look,
Greg, you've been working out, you know,

1139
01:10:56,171 --> 01:10:58,870
watch porn. Who knows? Maybe it'll happen,

1140
01:10:58,871 --> 01:11:00,760
but I can tell you it's
definitely not going to happen.

1141
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,590
If you could just going to be your friend,

1142
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:07,790
they making snide remarks about
her, her boyfriend. Come on.

1143
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:11,980
Do you gotta be better than that?
That's just coming off like a, you know,

1144
01:11:11,981 --> 01:11:12,814
you're acting like a,

1145
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:18,170
you're acting like a Douche and I
don't know how else to put it. Um,

1146
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,960
that's not as strong move.
All right.

1147
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:27,570
Um, and you should have more going on in
your life than the fucker be, you know,

1148
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:30,930
used to have more self esteem
than that. All right? Okay.

1149
01:11:30,931 --> 01:11:35,890
She wants to date this fucking guy.
Guess what? It's her loss. Alright,

1150
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:40,980
so fuck it. Get on with your life. Keep
working out and work out for yourself.

1151
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,610
Go to college for yourself.
Do all this shit for yourself.

1152
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:45,900
Feel good about yourself.

1153
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:50,850
You start putting out more of a
positive vibe as opposed to, you know,

1154
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,710
hanging around her, shitting
on her current boyfriend.
I mean, that's just like,

1155
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:00,840
I don't know if that's not a good look.
Okay. I believe in you. All right.

1156
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:07,350
Do what I just said or dope cause I
don't have any professional training.

1157
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:12,060
All right. Dumping my girlfriend
a Billy billboard brow.

1158
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:18,560
I fucking asshole. That's another
good one. Recent fanny of podcasts.

1159
01:12:18,561 --> 01:12:20,730
Stand up and all that jazz.
Anyways,

1160
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:26,160
I'm a 24 year old dude and I've been
dating and living with my girl for almost

1161
01:12:26,161 --> 01:12:28,410
four years now and I finally had enough.

1162
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:32,100
She's a real Downer and talk shit
about people including your friends,

1163
01:12:32,101 --> 01:12:34,230
like it's an Olympic sport now.

1164
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:38,150
The problem is she lost a job a month
ago on account of a shit-talking.

1165
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:42,240
It hasn't exactly been going
out and looking for a new
one because she's anxious

1166
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:45,660
or whatever. Leaving me to
pick up her end of the bills.

1167
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,350
She didn't have any savings because she
had picked up the habit of going out and

1168
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:53,250
drinking every night. I honestly
wouldn't have a problem, uh,

1169
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,570
just up and leaving.

1170
01:12:55,110 --> 01:13:00,110
But the apartment is a stone's throw from
the beach and my other roommate and I

1171
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:01,620
really don't want to leave

1172
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:07,650
the fucking decisions people make.
It's right near the beach.

1173
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,920
The other roommate is my best friend.
Okay.

1174
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:14,550
She's got a lot of books and
shit and the bed is hers.

1175
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:19,290
So when be a little,
so would be a little difficult to do.

1176
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:22,470
The old put all their
stuff in a box trick. Uh,

1177
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:26,550
deep down I do still have love for her.

1178
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,100
So the idea of kicking
her out hurts my heart,

1179
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:32,100
but I just can't deal with the
endless drama and unhappiness.

1180
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:37,110
We'd love to hear what your advice
on the podcast and as always go fuck

1181
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:37,741
yourself.
Yeah.

1182
01:13:37,741 --> 01:13:42,741
The more the relationship has run its
course and you need to go your separate

1183
01:13:44,311 --> 01:13:48,840
ways. And sometimes when that happens, you
know somebody, yeah, somebody gets hurt.

1184
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:50,043
All right?

1185
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:53,820
But you're not doing her any favors if
you don't want to or to be with you and

1186
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:57,840
you just, you just wasting
her and your time. So,

1187
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:01,260
uh,
you know,

1188
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:07,320
this is why you don't fucking live with
somebody unless you know you're gonna

1189
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:11,770
marry him. I don't, I dunno.
I Dunno if you're, yeah. Boy.

1190
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,920
Um,
so what do you do?

1191
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:18,100
Break up with her and then tell her to
move out all at the same time or are

1192
01:14:18,101 --> 01:14:22,860
those two separate conversations?
I just break up with her

1193
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:26,880
and then let her bring up
where am I going to live.

1194
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:28,310
Yeah.

1195
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:31,100
And I'd be like, well, I don't know.
I mean the coastline is pretty long,

1196
01:14:31,101 --> 01:14:34,160
so I'm sure there's another
beachfront apartment she could be.

1197
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:39,010
And I'm assuming your name's on the lease.
Usually when there's a breakup,

1198
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,030
the guy has to leave
and leave half his shit.

1199
01:14:41,031 --> 01:14:44,610
So it seems like you're in
a decent position here. Uh,

1200
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:48,200
who wants a negative drunk without a job?
I don't think you want,

1201
01:14:48,201 --> 01:14:50,930
that doesn't sound like you want it.
Um,

1202
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,830
I think the love you have for her was
who she used to be or who you thought she

1203
01:14:54,831 --> 01:14:56,540
was.
So,

1204
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,260
okay.

1205
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,900
Yeah.
Neither of those are happening right now.

1206
01:14:59,901 --> 01:15:04,370
So it's time for you to tell her to hit
the bricks. Happy new year, sweetheart.

1207
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:07,260
Beat it.
You can't say it like that.

1208
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:09,120
Okay.

1209
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,800
I just tell her, look, we need to
talk and sit down. She could be a,

1210
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:15,400
what's the problem? What's
the problem? Me and you,

1211
01:15:15,401 --> 01:15:18,690
you just got to fight through
that fucking horrible feeling.

1212
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,440
There's nothing worse.

1213
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:25,910
The only worse than a woman crying is
when she's about to cry because you still

1214
01:15:25,911 --> 01:15:29,000
have hope that she's not going to cry.
So you're on pins and needles.

1215
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:32,540
Once she's crying, you're
like, fuck, this sucks.

1216
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:36,920
But you kind of know what's
going to happen. Um, yeah.

1217
01:15:36,921 --> 01:15:41,300
You just got to sit her down and
just say, listen, um, I'm not happy.

1218
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:46,390
This isn't working for me anymore and

1219
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,900
we need to break up. All
right? Just like that. Boom,

1220
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:58,180
boom, boom. And you got to get that
out. You got to get all of that out.

1221
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:03,820
Don't sit there and be like, oh,
I don't know how to say this.

1222
01:16:03,821 --> 01:16:06,700
A Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,
and turn it into a 45 minute thing.

1223
01:16:06,701 --> 01:16:11,560
Rip The bandaid odd. Just rip it
off. We need to talk. I'm not happy.

1224
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:17,270
We need to break up.
Okay.

1225
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,490
You go into the two minute offense.

1226
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:21,253
Okay.

1227
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:24,930
Okay. Get, don't get out of
bounds. You keep the clock running.

1228
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:28,590
You want this game to
be over. No, I dunno.

1229
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,590
Yeah, that's what I would
do. That's what I would do.

1230
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:37,300
Just sit down and just say,
all right, in eight seconds,

1231
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:42,210
this relationship is going to be
over. Okay, I'm on this side of,

1232
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:44,230
of the eight seconds.
All I do,

1233
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,710
how long does it take to say that I'm
going to time it right now. All right,

1234
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:51,750
we need to talk.
I'm not happy.

1235
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:56,130
We need to break up.
I just did that in like five seconds

1236
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:01,940
and then she goes, what
if we blah, blah, blah.

1237
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:04,940
Now I've made the decision we
need to break up. It's just,

1238
01:17:04,941 --> 01:17:07,310
it's just not working for me. I don't
love you the way I used to love you.

1239
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:10,880
That's what can I say about, they can mad.
They can cry, they can do all that shit,

1240
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:15,880
but the thing is you conveyed it and
you're out. Where am I going to live?

1241
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:19,390
I don't know.
We'll figure that.

1242
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:24,260
I guess that's the next thing we need
to figure out and Whoa, it's your life.

1243
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:25,310
Gonna suck after that,

1244
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:28,850
but it's never going to suck more than
staying in a fucking relationship.

1245
01:17:28,851 --> 01:17:33,290
You don't want to be and all right, and
that's one to grow on. Go fuck yourselves.

1246
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:34,430
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
