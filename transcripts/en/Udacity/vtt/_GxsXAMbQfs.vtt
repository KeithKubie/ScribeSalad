00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This finishes my class on the 3 Ms.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In the next one, we'll learn about variance and standard deviation.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
These are actually fun topics relating to the spread of data.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We learn the difference between data like this and data like this

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that is much more spread out, even though the 3 Ms might agree in all of these data.

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And we're going to sharpen our skills to really understand how to look at data.
