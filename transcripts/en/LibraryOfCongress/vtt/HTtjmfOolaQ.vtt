00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.790
&gt;&gt; All right, everyone.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.980
I think we're going
to get started, here.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.000
To make sure we fit this
into your lunch hour.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.660
Welcome to the Pickford Auditorium.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.960
I'm Rob Casper.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.260
I'm the head of the Poetry
and Literature Center here

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.480
at the Library, and I'm delighted
to welcome you to the second

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.060
of our Making the Case series with
The National Book Critics Circle.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.450
Before we begin, let me ask you
to turn off your cell phones

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.680
and any other electronic
devices that you might have

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.860
that will interfere with the event.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.160
And let me tell you a little bit

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.320
about the Poetry and
Literature Center.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.890
We're home to the Poet Laureate
Consultant in Poetry and we put

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.820
on literary readings,
lectures and panels

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.560
of all sorts throughout the year.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.940 position:56%
If you'd like to find out more about
events like this, you can just go

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.920
to that table outside, and
sign the sign-up sheet.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.350
You can also visit us at our
website, www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.300
In an ongoing effort to learn
more about our marketing

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.360
and communication outreach
as well as continue

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.070
to provide the highest
quality program and events,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.480
we would appreciate if you
would evaluate this event.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.780
So, there are some
evaluation sheets.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.560
I'll remind you at the end.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.670
Please take one, fill it out.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.130
You can leave it on this table,
leave it outside, or give it to me.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.890
We really want to know what
you think and what we can do

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.770
to improve our programming here
at The Library of Congress.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.400
The mission of The Poetry and
Literature Center is to "Foster

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.810
and enhance the public's
appreciation of literature",

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.910
and I can't imagine a
better partner in that work

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.190
than The National Book
Critics Circle.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.190
The NBCC honors outstanding writing
and fosters a national conversation

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.660
about reading, criticism
and literature.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.310
The National Book Critics Circle
Awards are given each March.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.410
They just had their new
awards a couple of months ago,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.000
and they honor the best literature
published in the United States

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.900 position:56%
in six categories;
autobiography, biography, criticism,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.280
fiction, non-fiction and poetry.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.510
These are the only national
literary awards chosen

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.310
by critics, themselves.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.980
To find out more about
the organization,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.010
you can visit their
website, www.bookcritics.org.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.820
Last fall, critic and
scholar, Steven Burke,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.460
helped us to launch this series

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.470
with a poetry-focused lecture
titled, "The Poem is You".

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.080
I am thrilled and delighted today
to introduce Elizabeth Taylor

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.720
to provide us with a
complimentary lecture on fiction.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.770
Her lecture titled, "American
Fiction: Connecting the Dots",

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.710
will help us get a sweeping
sense of where the art is at,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.270
from a critic who served
both as president

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.740
and as a board member of the NBCC.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.640
After her lecture, we'll have a
brief Q and A session as well,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.010
and we have a mic, when you come
over and just get you miked,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.100
so we can capture what
you say for our webcast.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.360
And note that this event
is being videotaped

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.610 position:56%
for a future webcast at The Library.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.230
And by participating in the Q
and A, you give us permission

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.560
for the future use
of that recording.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.510
Now, please join me in
welcoming Elizabeth Taylor.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:32.050
[ Applause ]

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for being here.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.990
I really appreciate it.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.950
Thanks so much to The Library
of Congress for inviting me

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.270
for this incredible
initiative to bring books

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.250
and reading to the world.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.740
So, and I'm honored to be here
to talk about being a critic

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.580
in the world of literature.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:03.630
And it's just a very
rewarding kind of job to have.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.610
So, let me just say, a
friend of mine had gone

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.670
on the United Airlines website.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.970
This was just a few days ago,
to check her flight for Paris.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.930
And she'd forgotten her password.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.650
And, to reset it, she was asked to
answer some questions and then, so,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.790
she, of course, the question
was, what are you reading?

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.150
And she, of course, chose that.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.580
So, here's what she found.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.620
This was the list.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.330
So, anybody notice a word
missing from this list?

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.360
[Crowd replying] No fiction!

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.020
Where's fiction?

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.250
There's, you know, historical.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.550
There's magazines.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.850
There's mystery.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.150
But, there's just.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.440
There's professional development.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.840
But no fiction.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.980
So, it doesn't even make the list.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.140
So, I started thinking, how
long has it been this way,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.280
that we sort of think of fiction
as the sort of, the sideshow?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.860
What's going on?

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.390 position:56%
So, of course, I looked to the past.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.150 position:56%
And to the great Robert Penn Warren.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.230
He was a native Kentuckian.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.100
He won three Pulitzer prizes.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.970
His first was in 1947 for the
astonishing, now classic novel

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.240
about American politics,
"All the King's Men".

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.230
So, in 1966, May 10th, like almost

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.280
to the day fifty years
ago, we're here.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.940
Warren spoke at the Plaza
Hotel to a huge audience.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.270
And there weren't attendance
records.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.230
But there's, I saw the pictures,
so I could discern who was there.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.860
So, it was a grainy black
and white photograph.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.160
And I could discern
a few famous faces.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:02.390
There was Barbara Tuckman, I saw
Rose Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.230
That was, like, how important this
literature was, that, you know,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.010
that these people were there.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.950
So, Warren began his talk
by saying, the only trend

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.710
of the novel is, we're
told toward death.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.010
That's reassuring, right?

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.930
He said, it's been declared dead
in the 1920's before "The Sound

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.480 position:56%
and the Fury" and "Finnegan's Wake".

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.970
He said, even D.H.
Lawrence had said,

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.330
it...D.H. Lawrence
actually wrote this.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.670
It becomes harder and harder to
read the whole of any modern novel.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.110
One reads a bit and knows the rest,
or one doesn't want to know more.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.130
That's, but Warren admitted, too,
that he occasionally sentiment.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.280
So, he told the group at the Plaza.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.190
I'm 1960, I admit, I'm
bored by a good many novels.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.900
Bored by the some that stand high

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.340
on the bestseller list,
in critical esteem.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.260
And this makes me feel
out of step with the march

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.590
of civilization and chit chat.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.620 position:56%
But there are other novels, he said,

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.140
also some on the bestseller
list, that do not bore me.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.290
In fact, compel and fascinate me.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.780
And, it's hard to put
these fascinating novels

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.150
in a single package marked "trend".

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:30.680
The trouble with, is that
a good novel is apt to rear

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.230
up on its hind legs and
shout, "Leave me alone!

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.640
If you call me a trend again,
I'll spit in your eye".

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:46.100
So, in this, kind of world where
words are flying off screens

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.230
and devices and there are more and
more works of fiction published,

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:57.420
you know, it's amazing, you know,
to think that, how hard it is

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.930
to find really good books.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.520
And, estimates vary
widely about sort

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.440
of how many books are
published, it's a,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.020
vary from works of
fiction, actually.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.610
From 250,000 to 2 million.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.230
I mean, there's just, it's
really hard to discern.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:21.330
And paradoxically, I'll note
that, with the demise of newspaper

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:27.240
and book sections, you won't
hear about a lot of these books.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:33.340 position:56%
But, let me try to explain how I,
as a critic, experience that volume.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:38.190
As the chair of the fiction
jury of The Pulitzer Prizes,

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.680 position:56%
we receive boxes and boxes of books.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.380
Over 300 works of fiction a year.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.270
And that's just a small fraction,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.730
considering that there's
an entry fee,

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.610
and many people just don't submit.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.380
Most of them don't submit.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.270
At The Tribune, where I worked
and ran the book section

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:05.700
for fifteen years, I received 200
books a day, in the tiny book room.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.600
So, to reduce the number,
I have asked publishers

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.450
to send them to me at home.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.830
And, so, what does
that mean for a critic?

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.120
So, this is just a sample day.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.370
So, this is what comes
for me in a day.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:24.000
That's like, I just sorted
out, like the fiction.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.390
So, that's like, a lot.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.060
And so, the question
that people of us

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:38.120
on The National Book Critics
Circle board is that a huge part

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.980
of what we do isn't just writing.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.080
It's about discovery.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.720
It's like, what's in
those boxes and envelopes.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:54.660
You know, and, my excitement over
what's in them is really, it is a,

00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:00.760
it exceeds my aggravation
about the falling over,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.500
the piles in my living room.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.950
And that, I believe, that part is
just not, people just don't think

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.200
about when they think
about being a critic.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.340
So, it's being about an engaged
critic, attuned to what's

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.760
on the page and the
world that reflects,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.400
and from which it has emerged.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:28.120
What's worthy of our
attention, and that is, I think,

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.960
the question to think about.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.790
So, over the years, I've sort
of acquired a critical gene.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.220
And this critical gene informs,
actually, how I see the world.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.690
About, it's about living and
reading and thinking actively,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.730
and not only about literature.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:51.310
But also, sort of, by being
simultaneously less judgmental,

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.360
but with stronger convictions.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.630
Part of the work we do is trying
to understand the landscape

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.630
and not be a slave to it.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.510
A little mini case study.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.010
Huge admirer, everyone's
probably read the novel,

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.560
"Purity", but Jonathan Franzen.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.310
I'm sure, anyway.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.420
For about, he was on the
cover of Time Magazine.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.250
Not many novelists are.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:25.030
And, newspapers, magazines
across the country.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.440
It all felt compelled to weigh in.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.240
This was a big, serious novel.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:38.170 position:56%
But that meant that reviews and
essays were not going to other works

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:46.520
of fiction, that, you know, that
wonderful, wonderful works that,

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.760
they just didn't ever,
weren't published

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.390
because of the Franzomania.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:58.430 position:56%
And, in fact, if you read, as I did,
like, most of the reviews, like,

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:03.900
from everybody from the, you
know, newspaper in Tennessee,

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.310
to Washington State and
even internationally.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.090
The reviews kind of
sounded like, the same.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.160
So, like, why do we need all
those reviews of the same book

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.590
when we could be like, really
discovering a new voice?

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:25.110
Now, that is I will
note, a minority view.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.560
This is what book critics
argue about all the time.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.140
But, then, we do argue about
everything all the time.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.820
But being a critic is
about making choices.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.190
And I think it's important.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:45.060
There's another statistic, again,
these, you know, statistics, are.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.880
Just have to take them
with a grain of salt.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.640
But, that the only stand-alone
book section in the country,

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.570
the New York Times, said
to reviews, only 1 percent

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.350
of the books published in America.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.650
That's really small.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:06.030
There's so many books that, you
know, it's hard to hear about.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.680 position:56%
But the secret truth of being a
critic is that we all love the hunt.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.380
And the sense of discovery.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.940
We want that super
tingle of excitement.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.020
We want to find that new voice.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.540
At the same time, because a
critic, we have to see things

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.290
from the counterintuitive
thing, I mean,

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.560
I worry about this bias
against older writers.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.750
About, sort of, maybe writers
whose first two books didn't really

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.050
pan out.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.490
So, they had to go to
a really small press.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:42.280
And maybe a writer who's they just
write, while they have a day job.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.310
Ten hours, they're raising
their children, whatever.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.140
And they don't have a part
in the literary community.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.080
And I think it's really important
to try to refine them, too.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:59.230
And resist that impulse to
find the next pretty new thing.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:03.420
This, so. Literary prizes,
I think, can help that.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:09.420
I think, as a judge, I mean, I sort
of try to sort out the pedigree

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:14.070
of a book and really respond
to what's on the page.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.790
I think that, and through fiction,
you can really see, it's kind of a

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.370
through line of American concerns.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:28.400
As we're looking to find
magical books, there are,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:34.790
despite what Warren said
about themes, some do merge.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.810
So, keep thinking of this.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.110
At The Library of Congress, I
came across Louis Untermeyer.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.490
Does anybody remember him,

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.610
the Poetry Collections
from our childhood?

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.980
And he was appointed the
fourteenth consultant to poetry

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.880
at The Library of Congress.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.100
So, but the year, and this
was in 1961, but in 1960,

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.260
he chaired the Fiction Jury
for the Pulitzer Prizes.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.450 position:56%
I think prizes are important because
they can get people's attention.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.930
Can, you know, people
see those [inaudible]

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.800
of a national book
critic circle prize

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.340
and essentially saying, read this.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.040
And there's so many books to
read, that's what prizes can do.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.500
So, in his report on the
Pulitzer Prizes, Untermeyer,

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.030
this was in 1960, he found
that, for the American novel,

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:32.970
1960 was disappointing in the
performance of established writers.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.210
Gratifying in the achievements
of younger ones.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:41.210
He charged that William Styron
and John Updike had failed to live

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.230
up to their early promise.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:48.650
And that James Michener
and John O'Hara,

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.060
he grappled with larger themes.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.890
But, "Their reach generally
exceeded their grasp".

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:01.050
But Untermeyer praised what he
called the string of new talent,

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:06.090
which constantly revitalizes
American fiction.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:12.280
In what may go down as the best
literary backhand compliment

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.890
in history, he wrote of the
winner that, "The achievement,

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.060
it seems to us, may
be gaged by the fact

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:25.910 position:56%
that her story embraces virtually
all the clichés of a southern novel,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:32.710
they're nevertheless made to
appear here as fresh and original.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.700
Clichés? So, he was, of course,

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.750
talking about "To Kill
a Mockingbird".

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.050
It's amazing.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.860
Full of clichés.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.650
So, but this was actually a sort

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.210
of a pivotal point
for American fiction.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.800
That this novel was recognized.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.040
That was written.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.040
The legacy of slavery
has haunted that novel,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:07.030
and it actually shaped much
literature over the generations.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:15.500
And this kind of became clear
to me, Warren's comments aside,

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.760 position:56%
this trend became evident in the
New York Times Book Review Survey 25

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.060
years ago.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.630
No wait, actually,
only a decade ago.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.920
That sought to identify the
opinions of the "Single Best Work

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.170
of American Fiction Published
over the Last 25 Years."

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.140
So, you can imagine, like,
people talking about this.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.500
What is meant by published?

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.800
What is best?

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.100
What is American?

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.160
You know, just, was all sort of.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:46.510
But, interesting, the best book
they landed on was "Beloved".

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.740
It was sort of interesting
to see the line from

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.230
"To Kill a Mockingbird"
to "Beloved".

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:56.550
You know, it was a stab in the
heart, an agonizing remembrance

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.320
of a former slave in post-war Ohio.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.580
But it did what great novels do.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.770
Blended sort of private
destinies into public events

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:13.140 position:56%
and it infused the story of a
family trauma, repression of memory,

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.110
themes that we still see now

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:19.580
and had mythic dimensions
and an otherworldliness.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:23.330
But, interesting, just an
aside about the prizes,

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.250
critically acclaimed, but failed
to win the National Book Award

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.690
or The National Book
Critics Circle Prize.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.030
In fact, the National Book Award,
the winner was a book that,

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.890
probably a very nice book, but
nobody can remember or heard of,

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.530
"Paco's Story", about
the Vietnam War.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:49.430 position:56%
So, after she failed to win these
prizes, 48 African American writers,

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.610
or black writers, as
they were described then,

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:57.200
protested in open letters
to the New York Times.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.420
It was really rallied and
they expressed their passion

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.720
for "Beloved".

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.200
It went on to win The
Pulitzer Prize.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.490
And it's interesting to
see that through line.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:15.540
So, Jane Smiley, thinking
about sort of "Beloved",

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.080
is a wonderful writer
and a critic, herself.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.810
I trust you've read her.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:24.730
And she has written a, "Beloved"
seemed to have the historical scope

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:29.180
of a best or most important
novel would have.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.670
And that, what the
most important thing

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.340
over the last 25 years
was the rethinking

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.140
and rewriting of American history.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.460
It's interesting, that she
slightly even looked further back.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.460
She said Smiley was struck in
the formal contrast between

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.970
"Beloved" and "Uncle Tom's Cabin".

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:57.520
They take up a really difficult
subject, but, as Smiley said,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.790
still uses melodrama and polemic,
the novels straightforward,

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.270
suspenseful and infuriating
because she is furious.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.070
But Morrison is much cannier.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:11.380
She uses the form of a ghost story,
and it fills in with folk tales.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:16.220
Of course, that's what Morrison
wanted to do, Smiley says.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.100
To rewrite history to tell
the story of a truer way

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.870
than had ever been told before.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:29.100
And Smiley, herself, is sort
of brilliant about how history,

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.410
memory and history
mutate into fiction.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:37.940
As you may know, remember,
she wrote "The Thousand Acres"

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:42.080
which was a reimagination
of American farmland

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.850
through the lens of King Lear.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:51.260
So, this idea of history
kind of mutating through,

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.350
and race is really important,

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.940
but there are some
other dimensions, also.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:05.790
And that is, the spirit,
the immigrant experience is,

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.570
has sort of infused the imagination
of a new generation of writers.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:14.150
It used to be that immigration
novels were all about, sort of,

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.720
you know, sort of Marjorie
Morningstar-ish kind

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:23.690
of getting acclimated and
accultured to assimilation,

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:27.820
but these are sort of,
almost anti-assimilation.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.890
Resistant to the idea
of assimilation.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:36.090
And I was, I was really happy
to be pleased to chair the jury

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:40.470
that advocated for this next book
that won the Pulitzer in 2007,

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.640
and I think it's really
important for many reasons.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.750
Have you all read "The Brief
and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao"?

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.050
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.350
&gt;&gt; Isn't it a great book?

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.650
A really great book.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.200
So, it's, it's just such a
reminder of how the American sort

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:01.950
of immigration novel has just
been sort of updated and made hip.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:07.110
And then, not assimilation,
acculturation, had sort of morphed

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.960
into a sort of uneasiness.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.840
And that, that sense that
immigrants are stranded

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.660 position:56%
between where they've been and where
they're going and they're sort of,

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:22.900
in sort of a no-place land
with no real allegiance.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:28.010
And that is a theme we'll see in
a log of immigrant literature.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:38.010
And also, in substance,
but also style matters.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:42.420
And style matters particularly
when it's central to the story.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.580
When it becomes so
essential to the telling that,

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.570
you couldn't imagine
the story without it.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.890
And these novels are
revolutionary in form.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:23:00.300
And three years after Junot
Diaz, and he, Junot Diaz borrows

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.700
from science fiction, you
know, a New Jersey teenager,

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.190 position:56%
so there's science fiction elements.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.510
He also is playing with structure.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.780
But in this book.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.400
Jennifer Egan, "A Visit
from the Goon Squad"...

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.700
&gt;&gt; It's a great one.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.000
&gt;&gt; Isn't it?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.300
Oh, love it.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.670
We have the same taste!

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.280
So, it's just, it's
just a dazzling book.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:27.570
And it's won the Pulitzer and
the National Book Critics Prize.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.700
It's full of heart and
complex characters.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.610
And in many ways, it's an
old fashioned social novel.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:38.170
But, it's brilliantly
and unusually structured.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.760
It's structured like an album,
but, I guess we're supposed to say

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.360
like a digital download now.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.700
I mean, but.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.610
So, it's begin with any
chapter of the novel.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.670
Or you can shuffle the chapters.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:53.180
And each, like, song
fits into the album.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.550
The chapters fit together.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.080
There's no beginning, no end.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.050
It's a beautiful loop with all
these characters intersecting.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.050
And it's also, in many
ways, it's about one of the,

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:11.800
it's about technology
and how we respond to it.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:17.440
So, it's, and I actually wrote
this a while ago, I prefer people

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.060
who don't quote themselves,
but, what can I say?

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:26.180
It was, I described it in the proof
polls as an inventive interrogation

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.000
of growing up and growing
old in the digital age.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.210
And it displays big
hearted curiosity

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.500 position:56%
about cultural change at warp speed.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.270
So, just, as you may
recall, you know,

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.350 position:56%
and this was written five years ago.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.530
Think of like, when she wrote this.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:47.200
Her baby shopping with
hand-held devices.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.740
That sounded weird.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:53.320
But now, we kind of see
that it could happen.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:25:00.780
And so, it's, we can see this
sort of trend of technology.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:07.350 position:56%
And it sort of, the dramas are, that
used to be kind of isolated mystery,

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:12.200
science fiction, are
all kind of going away.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.100
And one of the geniuses

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.540 position:56%
of the Jennifer Egan book is she has
one character, one chapter, rather,

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.710
in a PowerPoint presentation.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.040
Which is amazing.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:34.520 position:56%
So, an example of how novels and
fiction are defined kind of a genre,

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.470
and they're kind of mashing them up

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.590
and making something
new, there's a new novel.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:45.860
And this one, just a few weeks
ago, won the Pulitzer Prize.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.010
Oh, all right, good.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:49.490
But wait. Let me go back.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:57.340
That is the, from the
PowerPoint from Jennifer Egan's

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.640
"Visit from the Goon Squad".

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.470
You see how it's just like,
this is just one chapter.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.770
It doesn't overwhelm it.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:06.600
But it's, it's just a really
funny, fun way to tell it.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.040
So, "The Sympathizer".

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.030
So, this just won the
Pulitzer Prize.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.790
Now, have you read that?

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.090
Okay, well.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:19.610
I'm two for three.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.470
So, it's again.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:26.270
On first reading, it's sort
of a complex immigration tale

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.750
with this wonderful voice.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:34.870 position:56%
It's not unlike Junot Diaz in that
the narrator's wry and professional.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:40.740
The guy is a man who
lives a divided life.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.920
But stylistically,
"Sympathizer" does something else.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.080
Genres are merging.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:51.590
It's science fiction, spy story,

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:55.940
it's an old fashioned spy
story about, you know,

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.090
communist Vietnam,
divided loyalties.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.390
So, it's interesting.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.720
We go back to, sort of,
"Paco's Story", you know,

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:09.760 position:56%
won that National Book Award
instead of "Beloved", and so we see.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.060
But the, here we are,
still with Vietnam.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:19.960
It's still this persistent
idea in fiction.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:24.510
And it's, this is just a, it's
like an old fashioned spy novel.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.690 position:56%
And it's this hybrid, "Sympathizer".

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:28.990
It's a really beguiling book.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:34.710
And, but I want to return to a
little bit of an earlier idea.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.500
Which, is like the idea of
a critic in all of this.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:44.140
And the act of discovery and
the importance of being part

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.290
of a kind of, what I
think of as a flourishing

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.950
and robust sort of
literary eco system.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:57.070
And it exists beyond book stores,
book reviews and writing books.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:02.060
So, when Diaz and Egan landed
at my door, I was really,

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.680
I had been reading
their short stories.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.890
They had been in The New Yorker.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.260
They had previous books.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:14.470
But, it, when "The Sympathizer"
came out, I mean, here is,

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.730
he was a professor of
English and American Studies

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:20.280
in Diversity Studies at
University of Southern California.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:25.660
And he had written an academic
book in 2002, "Race and Resistance,

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.010
Literature and Politics
in Asian America".

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.480
It's published by Oxford
University Press.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.410
But, you know, a novel.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:37.630
This, kind of, hit
people like a surprise.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:39.130
So, it really dealt.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.670
This was real act discovery.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.890
But he didn't just
come out of the blue.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:49.000
I mean, people, we think, people
really are working at this.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.360
And so, about five
years ago, actually,

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.890
I called him because he had
submitted a story to something

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:03.540
that I'm involved with, the
Nelson Algren Short Story Contest.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.260
And this is what I think was
the great kind of eco system.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.170
That this contest really
supported this guy

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:15.330
as he is aspiring to
be a fiction writer.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:19.760
So, this contest was
founded in 1983.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.360
And by a couple that
really liked fiction.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.450
And they, among the earliest
winners, Stuart Dybeck,

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:32.660
and Lise Erdrich is
to win the big Library

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.850 position:56%
of Congress Prize, right, very soon.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.940
She astonishing.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:44.140
Judges were, have been Eudora
Welty, Jane Smiley, Chang Rae Lee,

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.380
Alexander Hammond are
two authors who sort

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.410
of updated this immigrant theme.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.500
Anyway, the contest
is entirely blind.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.320
No entry fee, no barred entry.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.620
Stories are all numbered.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:30:00.590 position:56%
We don't know whether, you know, if
they come from a city like Iowa City

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.280
or Brooklyn, which were the
big hot houses for fiction.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.480
Doesn't ma...you know,
we don't know.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.770
So, 3500 stories.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.880
Four rounds of judges.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.650
And so, this is an example.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.390
I think it's kind of rare.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.900
Where quality really does rise.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.480
It wasn't just a walk.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:25.850
And this, he was a winner of
the Nelson Algren Prize, so,

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.280
I have been, like, tracking him.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.500
But he, and it also gave him a
little bit of financial support.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.810
It gave him a publication in
one of his first publication,

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:38.420
published works of fiction.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.680
And I, I think it's just so
important to have these sort

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:48.380
of smaller places that will support
writers and be part of the sort

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.920
of the ground level, so
that writers can flourish.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:58.050
And I also mention this, to
provide, you know, we can help,

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:01.300 position:56%
it's a perspective on these writers.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.200 position:56%
We don't just, like, all of a sudden
open a box, and there's a book.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.830
We can, it's part of something.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.720
And I think as a critic
it's important

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:15.760
to understand what,
where a book comes from.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:22.650
And but over time, I've come
to believe that it's not only

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:27.380
about sort of what's on the page
that matters, and what we write

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.550
as critics in the books we select.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.940
Those are to write about
and our approaches.

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.760
That really is important.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.000
But I've also come to see that,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.290
I think that a critic's job
is also to be an activist.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:49.470
Not to be a champion or be
boosterish about particular books,

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:53.880
and not like to ride a hobby horse
of your best friend who, you know,

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.670
wrote that self-published novel.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.160
But, although, I wouldn't
have a best friend

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.410
who wrote a self-published novel.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:05.910
But, rather, think of ways to get
people into books in libraries.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:09.720
You know, to get people
to pick up books to read.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:16.770
And you know, so, with fewer
places to find books, and peoples,

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:19.640
I encourage everybody to sort of
do what they can, like a friend

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:23.840
and I have been bemoaning the
state of book reviews for years.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.600
And they've just been dwindling.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.350
At one point, there was a
campaign to save book reviews.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:36.440
So, we despaired the
evaporation of this way

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.560
to get the public into books.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.710
And we wanted to improvise and
kind of propel the conversation.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:47.100
So we just decided,
and this is possible.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.200
This is what tech,
how technology helps.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.020
We just decided to start a
book review, and we called it,

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.910
The National Book Review.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:58.940
So, instead of just decrying
online world, we just embraced it.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.820
And we want to give new
writers who are looking

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.350
to express themselves
an opportunity.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:14.510
So, I want to say that
criticism is a very public act.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:21.040
In that it's essential and it's
this discovery and this kind of,

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.460
the way we push books out in,
books worthy, worthy books,

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.740
into the public, is important.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.580
Because, fiction is
the radar picking

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.250
up what's happening in the world.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:36.170
And helps us sort of
understand how we feel

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:39.250
about what we don't yet know.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:44.200
Fiction helps readers look
behind and beyond the headlines.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.370
It makes us feel empathy.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:51.120
It challenges us to go places
that we might not go alone.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:55.890
It's like a lightbulb
and the world's dark.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.260
It's an emotional GPS.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:04.600
It lets us go on these uncharted
roads and yet feel safe.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:11.300
And fiction also can imagine a
world that doesn't yet exist.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.530
And because, in the end,
that's what we have.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:18.590
Our convictions, and we
have our imaginations.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:24.370
And before I close, I
just want to sort of,

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:28.630
last nod to the amazing Robert
Penn-Warren, who, again,

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:34.640
50 years ago, to, this,
almost to the day, he said,

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.670
"The novel may even
leave the printed page,

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:41.360
but it could still be a novel."

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.690
So, there's hope.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:45.490
Thank you.

00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:51.070
[ Applause ]

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:52.370
&gt;&gt; Thanks for that, Elizabeth.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:53.770
And I'm wondering if you
have any questions you'd

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.610
like to ask our critic today?

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.000
&gt;&gt; Such a small room,
I'm Shelly Meyers.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.300
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.790
&gt;&gt; Retired, thankfully,
so I can read much more.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:08.090
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:10.160
&gt;&gt; And I've been reading for
many, many years very voraciously.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.630
And I just am, I'm curious.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.930
One of the reasons I'm here today.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.470
I was particularly interested.

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:18.280
And I'm glad to hear that you
believe that this is a good novel.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.760 position:56%
Because, I always go right to the
Pulitzers of the year and read them.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.960
I have for the last fifty
years, for heaven's sakes.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:30.800 position:56%
But the Goldfinch and "All the
Light You Cannot See" and many other

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.000
of the popular literature in the
last three or two or three years,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.100
perhaps, I found so disappointing.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.700
Terribly disappointing.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.460
And, I just wonder if
you think, as a society,

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.780
we've become less demanding
of our fiction writers?

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.250
And so, I am tending now, to stay
away from the popular literature

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:53.630
and go to old books, and science
fiction books and memoirs,

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:58.690
because the popular literature is,
I just find it not substantive.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.020
Not daring.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.320
Not moving, if you.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.200
I just, it's sort of
a social commentary.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; No, it is an interesting, I mean,
our, I mean, do prizes always go

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.070
to the books that should?

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:14.560
Of course, I'm a little partial
to "All the Light We Cannot See"

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.060
because I did chair
the committee for that.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.630
But I do think it's, we'll
have to talk about it later.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.760
&gt;&gt; Is there literature
in that period

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.840
of history, is my point about that.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.140
&gt;&gt; Right. No, no, no, no.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.440
There's a lot.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.740
Yeah. I love the.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.040
I actually.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.340
I felt that, structurally,
it was like a prose.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.350
It was a set of prose poems.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.510
But, I, I liked it structurally.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:37.810
I thought it kind of worked.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:39.520
But, I can, yes.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:45.240 position:56%
But there, the thing is, about
awards and, I don't, is that they're

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.460
so many amazing, worthy books.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:53.640
There, we try to do, I mean,
for me, the question is, do.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.580 position:56%
I say to the committee I'm on, like,

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.580
will this book withstand
the test of time?

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.350
Will this book, you
know, last 50 years?

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:06.310
So, I don't, yeah.

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:12.330
But I'm, popular opinion,
it's tough.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:16.430
I mean, sometimes, I
think critics often tend

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:19.430
to do the, sort of the reverse.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:23.060
And dismiss a book because
the public likes it.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.560
I mean, that's more of a fear
of mine, that we'll say, "Wow,

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.380
if it's too popular, you
know, what do people know?"

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:35.520
Which, makes me despair.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:42.860
But, there are really
you know, worthy books.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.160
Prizes help.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.010
But they can't be the only thing.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:51.810
So, I'd say, also, when it
doubt, look at the finalists.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.110
They matter, too.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:54.410
No.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:55.710
&gt;&gt; And I do.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.010
&gt;&gt; Right, you know, so, you know.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.310
I mean, you know.

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:03.220
Yeah. And also, I'm also tilting.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:07.310
I should say, I've tilted
very American this talk.

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:12.930
Because, because, I
want to overlook that.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.360
That it, sort of diversity,

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.900
international voices,
is just astonishing.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.710 position:56%
I mean, Marlon James is astonishing.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:25.620
Americana is a fantastic novel.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:29.610
And I'm involved with another
set of prizes that's all about,

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:31.440
it's called the Heartland Prize.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.640
But I think of the Heartland
as a metaphorical place.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:38.440
So, you can think about, I
think she really redefines the

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.560
immigrant story.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.430
So, I hear you on the prizes.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:45.730
But...

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:47.990
&gt;&gt; Something else, it's
not just the prizes.

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:49.480
There's a lot else out there.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.780
A lot of other things.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.140
Like [inaudible] new
book and, I mean,

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.110
a lot of the literature
just don't seem.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:00.660
I don't know whether it's society
or me or [inaudible] fiction, or...

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:01.960
&gt;&gt; Well, well.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.890
But I think, and I think that
how do you hear about books?

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:09.000
&gt;&gt; I do a lot of just,
I just do my research.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.680
I read all the reviews
and I have friends and...

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.980
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.720
&gt;&gt; And I do a lot of research
before I read, because there's

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.020
so much I want to read...

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.340
&gt;&gt; Right, so, like, I think
that it's, it's, it's hard.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.850
Because, even when we
research, I mean, you know,

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:27.380
just through a simple
Google, it won't show.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.720
It'll show you the
most popular books.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:36.270 position:56%
It's really hard to do that deep
digging around to find that sort of,

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:39.180
what's about to pop
up and what hasn't,

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.690
you know, hasn't gotten lucky.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:43.690
I mean, that's what I was
trying to say about the Franzen.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:48.070
And, I actually liked "Purity"
as a book, more than most people.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:52.110
But, I felt like it
took a lot of air time.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:56.240
You know. So, like, those, that was
like, you know, a good six weeks

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.480
of books that you weren't
hearing about.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.780
I think.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:10.450
&gt;&gt; You mentioned a couple of things
about the timelessness of the books

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.230
and the context of books.

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:17.260
But what do you really look
for when you read a novel?

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:22.930
&gt;&gt; So, I look for,
it's a great question.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:27.450
And I'm always changing my mind.

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:33.040
I'll, so, because every book has
a different sort of calibration.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:39.050
I look for something
that feels special.

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:40.350
What's special?

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:47.750
I like, I personally like
a novel with a great voice.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:59.710
I personally privilege, I privilege
a messy, big, social novel.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:06.060
Rather than a sort of pristine,
carefully constructed sort

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.640
of compact littler novel.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:14.750
Yet, so, I work through that
to try to respect both and try

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:16.750
to judge them against each other.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.050
But, so, voice.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:20.480
I think language really matters.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:25.560
I, even those big messy
social novels, I like the,

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:30.470
I like to be really
beautifully written.

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:35.730 position:56%
I want to be surprised by how the
sentences get together and how they,

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:40.660 position:56%
the imagery that comes off the page.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:46.770
And I, more than probably, many of
my critics who are probably smarter

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:51.580
than I, like, I go for
a novel with heart.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:55.400
I, you know, I don't like.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.650
I want a novel to have heart.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.280
I don't want it to be cold.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:04.770
I don't want it to be sort
of excessively ironic.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:07.590
And, yeah.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:08.890
That means.

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:10.660
Is that helpful?

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.960
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.020
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.670
&gt;&gt; You spoke about,
I think you said,

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:24.250
you receive about 300 books a
year, at the [inaudible] fiction?

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:26.310
&gt;&gt; That was just the fiction, yeah.

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I was just amazed by that, and I,

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.780
I'm surprised that critics are
not always signing, you know?

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.080
&gt;&gt; We, we, we are, actually.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.980
But you know.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.280
Yeah. Yeah.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.890
The numbers are staggering.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:49.640
I mean, and, especially with, you
know, it's like, I did, at one.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:57.640
I did tell the story
that, I once did a kind

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.500
of a round table calling
famous people up and saying,

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.410
are serious books in trouble?

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:07.520
And, asked a variety of people.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.420
In fact, one was aforementioned
Jane Smiley.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.480
She's like, serious
books may be in trouble

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.400
but really funny books
are in trouble.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.700
It's kind of a good point.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:22.010 position:56%
There are not a lot of like comic
novels in the way there were in sort

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.980
of the 19th century, or like...

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.280
[inaudible].

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.160
And then, John Berendt, I remember,
he said he wrote in "Midnight

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.690
in the Garden of Good and
Evil", he is very smart.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:37.660
He said, you know, don't
confuse products with books.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:42.640
And I was like, there are
a lot of books out there

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.470
that are really products.

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:48.000
You know, these series books
that are made by book factories.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.450
I mean, I think there's a
place for James Patterson.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:53.420
But those are, like, they're like,

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.760
they're kind of an
assembly line kind of thing.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:02.340
Or some of the mystery writers
who do, you know, or genre writers

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.990
who do, kind of a formula
every six months

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.660
to just kind of feed the beast.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.510
And keep their name out there.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:12.370
So, I think.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:14.640
But books, books are, you know.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:19.160
We're always looking for the books
and to get push away the products.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.460
&gt;&gt; I hear that, of course.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:27.110
At the National Book Reviews,
are you finding new writers?

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's, yes, we are.

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:33.850
And it's hard, and I mean.

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:36.490
This is, it's kind of
amusing because, you know,

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.500
diversity, you have to work for it.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:47.830 position:56%
And it means, like, for the Nelson
Algren Prize, you know, I, you know,

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:52.480 position:56%
go to sort of not just a traditional
MFA programs, and it's the same

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.900
with National Book Review.

00:44:53.900 --> 00:45:03.550
But try to get people from sort of
collectives and other places that,

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:09.080
you know, can, are not part of
the book review establishment.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:13.690
So, we do, that is a priority.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:15.950
And we try.

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:17.960
&gt;&gt; How do you find the selections?

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.230
&gt;&gt; Oh, how do I find them?

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:27.530
Usually, well, first of
all, like, I ask my friends.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:31.370
And, like, like, a wonderful poet.

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:36.810
Rigoberto Gonzales, is on The
National Book Critics Circle.

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:44.300 position:56%
It's like he turned me on to a whole
set of, you know, sort of listservs

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.960
to find a new group of writers.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.550
So, you have to be.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.510
I mean, I was reported
for fifteen years.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.630
For because, talking a
desk job as an editor.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:46:01.460
So, I like sort of digging around
and finding those groups of,

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:07.850
you know, like of, like there's a
fab...I don't know if you remember,

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.300 position:56%
but there's the binders on Facebook.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.450
This is why technology
really can help.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.470
There's Binders of Women Writers.

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:15.770
And the Binders of the [inaudible].

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:20.590
There's like little groups of,
you know, binders of, you know,

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:24.570
short fiction writers, and it's
women but then they sub group

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:26.560 position:56%
and self-select into smaller groups.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.690
So, I, you kind of have to be
aggressive about finding them.

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:35.700
And I, that, that's how I, I do it.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.980 position:56%
There's not a sort of science to it.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:43.960
But once you start finding people,
they lead you to other people.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.680
That's, and, so the kind of web.

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:52.180
And, but, and diversity, it, isn't.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.460
It's always changing.

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:59.770
So, we're where used to be sort of
most you know, about gender, race,

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:04.960
now it's about sort of gender.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.260
It's more about gender.

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.750
Used to be just sort of
male-female, now it's about gender

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:13.690
and finding different
groups that are more fluid.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:17.920
So, really, kind of saying,
what's going on out there?

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.270
&gt;&gt; You talked about form
when it comes to fiction,

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:33.620
and was sort of changed with
art, with form in your examples.

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.340
Can you talk, I don't, maybe
because I'm not a fiction writer.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.000
I don't think about form
in relation to fiction.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.590
So, can you talk about the value
of form when it comes to fiction,

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:47.670
or changes or sort of in some
way, why it's important to think

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.200
about that in relation to fiction.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:56.420
I mean, I guess one way to think
of it is, I mean, like, form.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:03.860
A well, seems really simple
and elementary, as I say it.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:08.500
A well-formed book
is easier to read.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:16.560 position:56%
You know, that, that, it has like a
story, a structure, that may not be.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:21.170 position:56%
But the changes in it, for instance.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:25.080
I should have talked about it more.

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:32.080
But like, flash fiction or and very
short fiction that are almost like,

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.270
they're essentially
sort of like prose poems

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:39.070 position:56%
that are just like one or two pages.

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:41.790
There are, that's and some.

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:46.310
You can be, have a really
well-formed short story.

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:47.810
I should have mentioned this.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.900
One of the greatest
discoveries of the last year

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:55.150
for me was a woman
called Lucia Berlin.

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:58.950
Does anybody remember her?

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:03.410
And she, I can't think
of the title of the book.

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:07.560
But she had been writing
for like 30 years.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.250
She had died and then her
stories were collected.

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:13.270
"Manual for Cleaning Women".

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:14.920
That was one of her stories.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.320
That was the title story.

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.740
The title of the book and one of
the stories in her collection.

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.400
I mean, these stories
were astonishing.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.170
She had just lived on the
marsh and she had, you know,

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:28.140
had been in and out of rehab.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.550
She'd been a cleaning lady.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.430
She had done.

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:34.370
And these stories were
just a knockout.

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:36.410
But they're so well formed.

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:39.420
That's an example of
well-formed story.

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:46.100
So, this, you know, the
sort of it, so, you know,

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.260
the structure sort of matters.

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:50.740
But you don't want
to see the stitches?

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.040
Do you see what I mean?

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.040
Like, you don't want to,
shouldn't be apparent.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.340
That's my thing.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.480
Like, you should be easy.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.070
And it's you know, yeah.

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:05.000
It so, or should be.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.260 position:56%
Or another thing it parallels, like,

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:12.630
it should be all flying
at the same level.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:14.930
So.

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.340
&gt;&gt; I'm going to agree with you.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.810
I love "All the Light
We Cannot See",

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:24.820
structurally, characters,
everything.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.050
I read it back to back.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:31.570
Virtually within a week of Kate
Atkinson's "Life After Life".

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.410
What did you think of that?

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:34.710
&gt;&gt; I, yeah.

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:36.010
I...

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:37.310
&gt;&gt; I, I absolutely loved it.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:38.610
Loved it.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:39.910
&gt;&gt; Many friends of
mine have loved it.

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:41.210
I have not read that.

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:42.510
I read something earlier.

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:43.810
I read her earlier stuff.

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:45.110
I just have not read that one.

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:46.410
But...

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:47.710
&gt;&gt; It's very interesting
structurally.

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:50.610
I think maybe you can see
the seams, or maybe...

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:51.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but.

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:53.210
And sometimes...

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:55.810
&gt;&gt; The, you need.

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:57.460
Ah, like "Fates and Furies".

00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:03.640
You want to see the...she's written
it so that you can see that seam.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.660
That's integral to the story.

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.960
&gt;&gt; No doubt.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.260
That was great.

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:09.560
"Fates and Furies".

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.050
&gt;&gt; Yes. It was, very.

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:12.500
&gt;&gt; Breathtaking.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.800
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.380
It. All right, we agree.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.790
I well...

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:18.090
&gt;&gt; You can...

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:19.390
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:20.690
I know. Whew!

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:21.990
All right.

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:23.290
Yes.

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:24.590
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible]

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:25.890
&gt;&gt; I know.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:27.190
We all. I mean, I'm.

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:28.490
I'm still you know, that.

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:29.790
At the National Book
Critics Circle, you know,

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:31.090
remember nothing but the grudges.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:33.480
You know, remember nothing
but the books we disagreed on.

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.230
You know, I'm still,
like, you know, I yeah.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:37.970
I think I was the.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:42.070
I don't think "Underworld" won.

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:46.350
And I, I'm still upset about it.

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:47.650
You know, I'll bring it up.

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:51.190
Like, you know, the wording
is entirely different.

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:52.490
&gt;&gt; So, you did...

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:53.790
&gt;&gt; I loved it.

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:55.090
&gt;&gt; Me too.

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:56.390
Me too.

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:57.690
&gt;&gt; I loved it.

00:51:57.690 --> 00:51:58.990
And I just.

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:00.290
I think, but I think it didn't win.

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:01.590
So, you know.

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:02.890
So.

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:05.190
&gt;&gt; Other questions?

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:18.760
&gt;&gt; Since we're at the Library of
Congress, what role do you think

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:23.490
that libraries can play
in promoting fiction?

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.350
&gt;&gt; Great question.

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:26.650
And I'm so.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:30.790
I mean, I think it is really.

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:33.890
I was tracking at the eco
system and the critics.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:39.210
I think libraries are just
so important and you know,

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:43.260
you're so lucky to live here
with these flourishing resources.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.830
But so many libraries around the
country are really suffering.

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.400
But libraries are important.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.700
I mean, first of all.

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:52.700
One of the great examples
is Ferguson.

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.470
You know, that library stayed open.

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.620
It was like a refuge.

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:59.740
It was, it was just critical.

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:02.020
In that place.

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:07.130
I think libraries are morphing
now into community centers.

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:11.020
And where people come for the day.

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:12.360
For job hunting.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.660
To hang out.

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:18.440
I think the question is, you know,
people bring their little kids

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:22.070
to the library and the older
people come but the question is how

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:24.730
to get the sort of middle group.

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:29.350
Look, I was actually at a really
great library a few weeks ago.

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:35.750
And they asked, they, this
library, did not just one book

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:38.230
of the, one book one town.

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:44.160
They did "Nobody's Fool", which was
the Rick Russo, Richard Russo book.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.830
And then they did "Everybody's
Fool",

00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:48.950
which is the new book that's
coming out in a few weeks.

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:53.350
And so, and they're showing a film

00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:55.030
and they're having a
series of discussions.

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:58.790
And they're really trying
to bring people together.

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:03.750
And I think that is a great
example of sort of being inventive

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:07.710
and libraries sort of
reaching new audiences.

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:10.430
I think they are really important.

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:13.380
Especially in cities
that really need it.

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:17.480
Some of the suburban libraries
are really do a great job

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.120
and they have beautiful,
beautiful resources.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:25.510
But other libraries
are really struggle,

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:28.040
Chicago there's a fantastic
public library.

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.340
It's great.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.940
And it anchors communities.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.830
And people say that, you know, when
a neighborhood is in transition,

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:43.700
before it, you know, the,
it's really a bad situation.

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:47.700
They'll put in a police
station and put in a library.

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:52.190
And that'll sort of will indicate
that there's going to be stability.

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:55.990
And I think that libraries, you
know, can be really inventive.

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:59.020
One library in Chicago has, like,

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:02.350
the neighborhood library
has, like, an autism room.

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:04.370
So, where, like, people
have resources.

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:07.380
So I think it's really
important for libraries to,

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:11.190
if they have the resources,
to try to offer niches.

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:15.190
My kids and I used to go to a
neighborhood library to play chess.

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:23.430 position:56%
You know, I think, all those things
are beyond sort of taking out books.

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:24.730
So, you know.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:26.440
&gt;&gt; On that note...

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:30.100
&gt;&gt; I scheduled a visit...

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.700
Thank you.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:34.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the talk.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.300
Thanks for coming in.

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:36.600
[applause]

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.940
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
