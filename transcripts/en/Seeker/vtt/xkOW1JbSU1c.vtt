00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.990
This episode is about horny animals!

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.450
Also like peacocks and stuff.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.750
Hey domesticated wildlife, Trace here for
Dnews!

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.519
With Christmas around the corner, it’s time
to take a look at one of the most famous mythical

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.100
creatures in Christmas lore: no, not Yukon
Cornelius.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.940
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.470
Although it’s not Rudolph’s nose we’re
thinking about, but Rudolph’s antlers.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.119
Reindeer shed their antlers every year.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.140
They’re thought to do this because at a
certain size, the antlers become too cumbersome

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.140
to deal with.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.800
Sure, they’re useful for defense sometimes,
but antlers also slow them down, making them

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.040
more susceptible to being attacked, and keeping
them from running away.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.410
And it’s not just reindeer, and it’s not
just antlers.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.390
Plenty of animals have characteristics that
directly threaten their survival.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.399
Peacocks are another example; their enormous
bright plumage is basically a giant, “Hey,

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.550
here I am!

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.350
Eat me!” for animals like wild dogs, raccoons,
and even tigers!

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.960
According to various theories of natural selection,
that kind of trait -- called ornamentation

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.740
-- should be pretty quickly wiped out; if
you’re a peacock that doesn’t show off,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.520
you’re less likely to be eaten by a predator,
and more likely to procreate, thus passing

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.429
along your lack of plumage.

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.090
Even dung beetles have excessively sized horns
on their heads that work logically anyway

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.889
against their survival.

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:23.390
But despite going against natural selection,
this ornamentation actually favors something

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.429
called “sexual selection”.

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:31.200
These bright and flashy, or large and antler-y,
extras are thought to help males of the species

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.969
stand out and attract females.

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.109
And that’s pretty interesting, because if
females prefer mates with ornamentation, then

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.829
their offspring will likely also have both
ornamentation and a preference for it among

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.239
females, in an ongoing sort of “ feedback
loop”.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:48.909
This is called “Fisherian runaway” or
“runaway selection”, where the female’s

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.590
preference for a specific trait -- in this
case, ornamentation -- is strong enough that

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.570
it propagates itself through subsequent generations,
leading to a “runaway” of that particular

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.570
trait.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.279
This theory helps explain why a trait that
seems detrimental would stick around, when

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:06.169
natural selection would seemingly phase it
out..

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:10.379
But why would females prefer a mate that might
be more likely to be killed?

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.200
One theory, called “handicap principle,”
suggests that if your ornamentation doesn’t

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.950
get you killed by the time you’re sexually
mature, then you’re probably a strong member

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.950
of the species.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.940
For example, if you survive into adulthood
with your antlers intact, it shows you’re

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.700
more fit than those deer with antlers who
couldn’t run fast enough to escape death.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.549
But that’s still kind of a recipe for disaster.

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.530
What if your species doesn’t have a lot
of mates to choose from, and ALL the ornamented

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.879
males are killed, just because there was an
evolutionary imperative to show off?

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:40.879
Now you're extinct

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.159
Well, researchers from Northwestern University
found that many “ornamental” animals actually

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.680
end up splitting into two distinct subspecies
on the basis of how likely they are to survive

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.790
with their ornaments.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.819
Basically, in order to resolve the conflict
of sexual selection versus natural selection,

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.209
animals simply evolved in both directions.

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.110
Some subspecies follow this sexual model,
and have crazy big antlers or feathers or

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.110
horns, which are used to prove their fitness
to potential mates.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.590
Others develop tiny antlers, feathers, and
horns, and simply live long enough to procreate.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.790
And what’s fascinating, is that there’s
almost nothing in between.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.209
There are very few species with medium sized
ornaments.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.629
So to bring all this back to Rudolph.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.579
Unlike most species of deer, both male and
female reindeer grow antlers, and shed them

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.700
every year.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.900
But males usually shed them around wintertime,
whereas females shed around the summer, give

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.370
or take a few months for both.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.560
So if Rudolph had antlers around December
25th, then it’s most likely, Rudolph…

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.959
was a lady.

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.230
Keep that in mind while watching the TV special,
change your perspective.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.730
So now you know some fun facts about reindeer,
how much do you really know about mistletoe?

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.010
Check out this video of seven things you probably
didn’t know about it.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.010
What do you guys think?

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.500
Do you have any other Christmas myths you
want us to bust?
