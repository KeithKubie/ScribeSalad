00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.600
By now we all know that life doesn't usually turn out the way that you hope it will.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.740
Congratulations.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.660
Thank you! I'm waiting so long for this.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.460
Good luck finding a job out there. [sad sniff]

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.860
everyone's scared of us [emotional out burst]

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.620
Oh no! Here you go; here's a scarf.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:31.280
[crying goes on] [hilarious clown joke btw]

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.720
Lately I've had more and more days where I just don't feel okay. With all the news and entertainment

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.580
And politics and life in general I feel more depressed and anxious than ever and when I usually express these feelings

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.800
I met with the response "I know but you just have to think positively"

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.760
"I mean thoughts influence your mood, so.", "Just fake it till you make it, and then eventually you'll believe that you're happy"

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.500
"Oh, honey, all you have to do is say affirmations. That's what I do, like this:

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.280
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.600
YOU'RE SMART!

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.500
YOU'RE WORTHY OF LOVE!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.360
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK!

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.000
And though positivity and resilience has its place

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.339
It feels like this sentiment is coming from a discomfort with negative emotions rather than

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.480
Prioritizing the process of healing or working through them and to be honest: I'm just really tired of trying to mask my negative feelings

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.480
Hey Anna, can...

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.700
What's up Dude [sad voice]

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.260
Eh... [sad sniff from Anna] are you okay?

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Yeah, no... I'm totally fine. I'm just like "yeah I'm hanging out, working, living my best life" [sniff]

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.420
What can I do for you?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.860
Ah, I just want to know if I could borrow a highlighter?

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.180
Oh ya, you got it.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.580
I'll get you a highlighter

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.220
Here you go, Dude.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.140
Thanks for stopping by

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.120
Maybe we could get lunch later

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.720
Alright

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.020
Cool, cool, catch you later, Dude [voice cracking]

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.580
Every time I've run from my feelings or try to smile them away this buzzing

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.468
Feeling of my anxiety only worsens, and I don't want to live like that anymore

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:09.709
I've touched my therapist a lot and and he's suggested that you want to operate inside of your feelings and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.920
Successfully navigate them you want to be fully present with them

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.539
Then let them go.  It's much healthier to be okay with not being okay, then pretend everything is okay when it's not..make sense?

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.850
As I slowly approach the corner of being thirty years old. I've kind of started to realize that we're probably going to be

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.029
Not okay more than we are okay, and I have to learn to accept that and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.380
Live with it and just accept that suffering is part of being alive and of course there are things that we can do on a daily

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.869
basis for the long run that helps our mental health right like you can make sure you're getting enough sleep and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.800
exercising and

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.910
meditating and seeing your therapist regularly so many fun things and of course eating healthy cuz we all love food and

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.280
Speaking of eating healthy I do want to say today is sponsored by hellofresh. We're sponsored by food I

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.229
Got to try. Hello freshest vegetarian plan and since I do freelance work

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.530
You know I'm often ordering out and not eating as healthy as I want to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.139
But since they deliver on the days that I want I can customize it for my schedule and I can pause it for those weeks

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.839
When I'm out of town each recipe only takes about 30 minutes

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.229
