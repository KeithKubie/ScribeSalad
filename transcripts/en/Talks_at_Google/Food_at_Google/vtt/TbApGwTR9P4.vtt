LEE KEENER: Hi,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.130
I'm Lee Keener.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.210
I'm the general manager here
of the food team at Google

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.450
Chicago, and it's
my distinct pleasure

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.940
to introduce you
to someone who's

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.670
followed a very unorthodox
and fascinating journey to get

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.876
to us today.

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:19.390
What was once a scholarly
path as a political analyst

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.570
in Washington, DC,
where she hoped

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.080
to support her Mexican homeland
with stories of a culture

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.080
and food history,
but she couldn't

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.670
stop thinking of the food
that she had from her youth.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.360
I once read that you said food
means love, nurture, family,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.030
all things warm and
good in the world.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.970
Cooking is your way to show your
love of food and your devotion

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.489
to your loved ones.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.905
I hope that some of you guys
are as fortunate as-- there's

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:56.460
some people in the world
that the career chooses them,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.240
and then they never work
a day in their life.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.790
So this unorthodox path--
it led to her very own PBS

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.440
show specializing
in Mexican cuisine,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.270
and for that, she's been awarded
with a finalist for the James

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.480
Beard award, which we held
here in Chicago this year

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.260
in just a couple weeks
at the Lyric Opera House.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.860
Very exciting.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.526
Congratulations.

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:22.590
PATI JINICH: Thank you.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.020
LEE KEENER: And so as
the unofficial ambassador

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.080
of Mexican food, hers is
a story of her life's work

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.290
and her courage to pursue it.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.830
So ladies and
gentlemen, Pati Jinich.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.471
PATI JINICH: Thank you.

00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:40.370
Thank you, thank you so much.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.046
In Mexico, we have a saying.

00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:46.320
When somebody says
nice words about you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.000
or they give a
nice introduction,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.780
you say they've given
you a bouquet of flowers.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.460
That was a gorgeous bouquet.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.360
Thank you.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.306
LEE KEENER: Thank
you for coming.

00:01:55.306 --> 00:01:56.680
PATI JINICH:
Thrilled to be here.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.650
I know everybody in
Google is a foodie,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.620
because I know you're so lucky
to have such incredible food.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:11.870
And so yes, I think that the
food that I make has changed.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.510
So what I'm presenting of
late in this book that's

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.420
called "Mexican Today," and
it's funny-- you have to tell me

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.889
when to start cooking, because
I'll just start talking.

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.930
But so at some point, if
you want to see me cook,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.130
just say, Pati, cook, OK?

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.020
And I'll start cooking.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.490
So anyway, everything that's
in that book sort of, I think,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.240
represents what Mexico,
Mexicans, Mexican cuisine

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.980
represent today, like
where we are today.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.820
And I think we tend to
put cuisines in a box,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.610
and I think that happens
even more so with Mexico,

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.200
because we're such close
neighbors-- you know,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.620
the US and Mexico.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.170
We think we know each other
very well, and I for one

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.170
can tell you that I
know that it's not true,

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.470
because I am a Mexican, who
thought that I knew Mexico,

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.210
and I thought that
I knew the US.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.610
And as the years
go by, I realize

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.950
that I keep on
learning and learning

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.290
and still don't know much.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.060
So when I first got
to the US, I used

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.830
to think, oh, Mexican cuisine
is this bounty of centuries

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.260
and centuries of mother
cuisine that is so rich, so

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.480
rich in history and legends and
traditions, which is all true.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.900
But I used to think that the
food in the United States

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.530
was younger, that
there wasn't that

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.980
much of a regional
diversity or variety.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.590
And as I've been in the
US now for 18 years,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.600
and the more I'm
here, the more humbled

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.750
I am to see the food
that exists in the US,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.160
not only regional
American cuisine, but also

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.722
the way that Mexican food
is evolving in the US.

00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:55.330
And I'll get to the enchiladas.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.130
I promise I'll start.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.970
But what's happened to me
is the same thing in Mexico.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.610
Every time I go back to Mexico,
and I studied Mexican history

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.980
and politics for years.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.240
I did a thesis that was this
big, this big that took me

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.300
three years, and it was
about Mexican federalism

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.110
and-- I know-- the relationship
between independent governors

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.760
and the federal state or
the central government

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.580
from 1810 to 1996.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.460
And I traveled throughout
the Mexican republic looking

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.060
for that information,
and so I thought

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.675
I knew Mexico very well.

00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:42.470
And every time that I
go back to Mexico now,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.320
I realize that I
think I know a place,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.260
and I think I know a
region, but Mexican cuisine

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.670
is like a growing,
evolving animal.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.870
It keeps on evolving.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.830
It keeps on changing, and
the things that we thought

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.510
were traditional and would never
change keep on being updated.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.290
Traditional recipes,
luckily, stay, persevere,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.400
keep on being passed
on from generations,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.670
but new things, crazy
things are happening,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.220
which is very exciting,
because new air brings

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.080
space for breathing.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.400
So in this book-- and I'll get
to enchiladas-- in these book,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.630
I have a combination.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.290
I have what we call the
rediscovered recipes,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.320
where went and found
regional recipes that are not

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.550
that well-known in the US and
in some areas of Mexico as

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.690
well, but then some new things
that I've taken the liberty now

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.375
of making in my kitchen.

00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:37.500
So that takes us to the
enchiladas, and I'll start.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.750
LEE KEENER: We have
them going in the back.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.450
We're taking care of you guys.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.728
PATI JINICH: Yes.

00:05:42.728 --> 00:05:45.620
So the enchiladas that
we're making today

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.290
are shrimp enchiladas, which
also go by entomatadas.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.262
Are you familiar
with enchiladas?

00:05:52.262 --> 00:05:52.845
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:52.845 --> 00:05:53.250
PATI JINICH: Yeah.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.300
I'm in California, right?

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.800
No.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.370
I'm in Chicago, which is even
more-- So enchiladas go also

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.160
by the name of the sauce, so
here it's called entomatada,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.670
because it has a tomato sauce.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.720
And OK, I'll start making it,
and then we'll keep on talking.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.250
OK.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.532
So you know what enchilada
means, the word enchilada?

00:06:14.532 --> 00:06:15.365
LEE KEENER: I don't.

00:06:15.365 --> 00:06:16.031
PATI JINICH: OK.

00:06:16.031 --> 00:06:21.820
So enchilada-- I know I was
supposed to start cooking.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.541
OK.

00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:25.240
I'll start cooking, I promise.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.090
Enchilada is when you dip a
tortilla in a sauce that has

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.316
a chili in one way or another.

00:06:32.316 --> 00:06:33.940
So that's what we're
going to make now,

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.865
and the sauce that we're going
to make that has jalapenos,

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:38.610
has that chili.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.480
It's not spicy.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.090
So what we have--
see, I started.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:50.772
So what we have here,
what we have here is

00:06:50.772 --> 00:06:54.380
they helped me prep
with everything.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.690
So here, I'm just going to
add a little bit of oil.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.870
Help me.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.560
Oh, you [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.060
Hi.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.570
Come on in.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.090
It's been 20 minutes, but I
haven't started cooking yet.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.931
I'm kidding.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:12.430
OK.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.661
You guys had to have
the cool gadgets, right?

00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:16.660
LEE KEENER: We have some
pretty cool stuff here.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.326
PATI JINICH: OK.

00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:19.384
So we have the oil.

00:07:19.384 --> 00:07:21.370
I'm adding a little bit more.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.530
And what we have here is the
sauce that your team already

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.350
prepared, which was some
boiled ripe tomatoes,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.870
which you have here in Mexico.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.670
We tend to use the Roma tomatoes
for the sauce or very ripe

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.540
tomatoes like you have
there, because we want them

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.420
to be mushy and really
juicy and not firm

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.530
at all when we use
them for the sauce.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.970
And we boil--
well, they boiled--

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.860
like a pound of Roma
tomatoes or ripe tomatoes

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.770
and some garlic and a
jalapeno and serrano chili.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.270
I know here in Chicago,
everybody knows the differences

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.940
between for chilies, right?

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.190
You guys.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.970
We should just start eating.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.260
No, I'm kidding.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:03.780
OK.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.360
So they use, I assume,
serranos, which is what's here.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.320
And the serrano
chilies tend to be

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.480
spicier than-- oh, beautiful.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.090
And jalapenos.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.210
Yay.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.690
So you have the jalapenos
and the serranos.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.290
I'm on purpose letting
the oil heat a lot,

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.980
because what I'm
going to do now is

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.040
I'm going to season the sauce.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.160
So we have the
tomatoes, the garlic,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.370
and the chili that was
boiled for about 10 minutes

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.409
until very, very soft and
very mushy to the touch,

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.549
and then pureed in the blender.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:42.490
And then you add some scallions,
some salt, and some broth

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.694
from the shrimp tails.

00:08:43.694 --> 00:08:45.610
So I'm going to add it
here, and I'll tell you

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.568
about the shrimp broth.

00:08:51.556 --> 00:08:55.300
And that's exactly what's
supposed to happen.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.030
If you go into a Mexican
kitchen or a Mexican restaurant,

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:03.214
and you don't see
that-- fire hazard--

00:09:03.214 --> 00:09:10.270
if you don't see smoke
and sizzle and splatters,

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.390
don't eat the food.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.720
It's going to be terrible.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.070
Usually, that's what
Mexicans are about is

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.020
a lot of reactions and actions.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.310
So we have this, and it smells
like delicious shrimp broth

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.850
soup.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.740
So we want that reaction,
because-- and splashes--

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.140
because we want this sauce
to react with the oil

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.120
and, therefore, sort
of fry in the oil,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.350
and it's going to go-- I don't
know if you can see the color,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.300
but it had sort of
a pale boiled color

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.750
like spring/summer
looking, and now it's

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.540
going to change to
like a fall, autumnal--

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.660
if my kids were here, they would
help me with pronunciation.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.182
Autumnal?

00:09:53.182 --> 00:09:55.760
Autumnal color.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.810
So just deeper, it's going to
be richer, thicker, darker,

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.110
and you can see it changing.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.860
And then we also added
in here shrimp broth,

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.460
which was made with the
tails of the shrimp.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.080
You guys, when you
buy shrimp, get it--

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.747
and this is beautiful shrimp
that you all got today.

00:10:13.747 --> 00:10:16.080
LEE KEENER: This is gorgeous
shrimp from the Gulf Coast.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.730
PATI JINICH: Tell me about it.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.430
LEE KEENER: It's off the Texas
coast in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.330
I was six years in New Orleans,
so I'm a snob about shrimp.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.360
I love the Gulf Coast.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.557
I think it's the best
shrimp that you can find.

00:10:26.557 --> 00:10:28.890
So that's what we have here
today with the shells on it.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.090
I think what you were
just about to say

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.570
was make sure that you get
it with the shells on--

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.020
PATI JINICH: Yes.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.820
Tell them why.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.015
You tell them.

00:10:34.015 --> 00:10:36.390
LEE KEENER: This is OK, the
stuff that you eat every day.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.640
Shrimp is delicious.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.829
These shells-- these
are God's gift.

00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:40.870
This is an amazing thing.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.530
Don't get them already peeled.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.190
Peel them, and then
learn how to use them.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.742
You get a beautiful rich
red color to everything.

00:10:49.742 --> 00:10:51.080
You get the smell.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.182
It's a beautiful,
salty, briny smell.

00:10:54.182 --> 00:10:55.307
PATI JINICH: True.

00:10:55.307 --> 00:10:57.390
LEE KEENER: You get your
hands dirty a little bit.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.098
PATI JINICH: Yes.

00:10:58.098 --> 00:11:00.400
And then the best
thing about it is

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.380
that you have-- when you buy
the shrimp tail and shell on,

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.610
it's going to be--
it's going to get

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.610
to your table in better shape.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.160
It's going to sort of survive
the transitions with much

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.780
more dignity, and then
it's going to be plumpier,

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.900
it's going to be
crisper, and then

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.680
you make a broth-- it's
very simple-- a shrimp

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.800
or seafood broth
either with the tails,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.560
or if you were using fish, you
could make these with fish too.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.650
Then just take the
head and the tail,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.140
tell the fish monger to
not give you fillets,

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.690
to filet it if you don't
want to filet the fish.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.190
But tell him to
give you the bones.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.898
You're going to have
some gorgeous stock,

00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:41.860
and then what happens is that
the filling of the enchilada,

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.950
which is going to be
these cooked shrimp--

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.520
do you want to help me on the
other side cooking shrimp?

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:46.870
LEE KEENER: Sure.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.536
PATI JINICH: OK.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.890
So you're going to
have an enchilada that

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.360
totally makes sense.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.010
You're going to have
an enchilada where

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.890
the filling and the
sauce have been really

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.960
married or inter-married,
because the sauce is going

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.542
to have-- it's not
going to taste separate

00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:07.250
from the filling.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.860
Has that happened
to you when you

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.612
have something in the sauce like
doesn't connect to the filling?

00:12:12.612 --> 00:12:13.320
LEE KEENER: Yeah.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.060
It's not all together.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.393
It's like when you take pasta,
and then you wash it off,

00:12:16.393 --> 00:12:17.980
and you add it to
your sauce instead

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.950
of cooking it all together.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:19.350
Absolutely.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.735
PATI JINICH: Yes.

00:12:19.735 --> 00:12:20.120
Exactly.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:20.620
OK.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.991
So here, let me borrow--

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.240
LEE KEENER: I'm making a mess.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:23.906
PATI JINICH: OK.

00:12:23.906 --> 00:12:30.560
So I make a mess, I know, and
this is such a beautiful table.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.660
Here you go, for the shrimp.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.830
And then what I'm going
to add to the sauce,

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.260
so what we have
here to sort of sum

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.940
it up was some boiled
tomatoes with boiled garlic

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.880
and a boiled
jalapeno and serrano,

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.250
and then always remember
to cook more chilies

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.660
than you think you want.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.540
And then when you
puree the sauce,

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.910
add less chilies than
you think you want.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.920
So say you boiled two
or three jalapenos.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.950
When you puree the
sauce-- the tomatoes

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.200
with the garlic
and the chili-- add

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.450
one chili first in the
salt, and then you taste it.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.130
If you feel like you need
more heat, add half a chili,

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.319
or-- is this like
too 101 for you guys?

00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:11.860
AUDIENCE: No.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.526
PATI JINICH: No?

00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:13.560
OK.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.670
Everybody's here so
expert in food in Chicago.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.921
I've been amazed.

00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:18.420
Tell them.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.530
Since yesterday, we got
here, I've done nothing

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.370
but eat my way through Chicago,
and everybody seems like so

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.270
incredible and knowledgeable.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:30.120
Anyway, I was saying about
the chilies, add one.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.410
Taste for heat.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.100
See if you want
more [INAUDIBLE],

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.260
and then add half more,
and then add half more,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.120
because you can never take
the spice or the heat away,

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.310
but you can always add.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.720
And you already did your
sauce and your shrimp broth,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.574
and then it's too spicy.

00:13:46.574 --> 00:13:47.490
It's sort of a bummer.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.265
You have to make the recipe
again without chilies

00:13:50.265 --> 00:13:53.360
and combine it for the
heat to be turned down.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.720
So we have the tomatoes, the
chilies, the garlic, and then

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.370
we added some of that
shrimp broth, which

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.150
had the tails and the
shells of the shrimp.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.530
Very easy.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.110
You put it in a saucepan,
cover it with water,

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.250
and then I like
to add bay leaves,

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:13.420
parsley, some garlic, salt,
let it simmer for nothing.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.040
I mean 15, 20 minutes.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.030
Let it cool down, and strain it.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.320
You can put it in the freezer,
use it for a ton of things,

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.200
or use it for this.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.900
You can add any
other herbs that you

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.900
like if you don't like parsley,
and then it was mixed here.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.712
And now I'm going to
add some Mexican crema.

00:14:31.712 --> 00:14:34.070
It looks so pretty.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.216
Do you want the salt?

00:14:36.216 --> 00:14:39.679
Tell them any tricks
for cooking the shrimp.

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.220
LEE KEENER: Don't
let it go too long.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.506
Don't be afraid of
it being underdone.

00:14:43.506 --> 00:14:45.920
Shrimp is one of those things
that I never order out.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.810
I do it myself, because
everybody always overcooks it.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.610
So many people are afraid
to eat undercooked items,

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:55.302
but everything goes up
the flavor mountain,

00:14:55.302 --> 00:14:56.760
and if you cook it
too long, you're

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.150
going down the other side.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.709
So I would-- just like you can--

00:14:59.709 --> 00:15:01.250
PATI JINICH: That's
a great metaphor.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.166
LEE KEENER: Thank you.

00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:03.570
You can always take chilies out.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.001
Same thing-- you can
always cook it more.

00:15:06.001 --> 00:15:07.250
I'm the same way with chicken.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.916
PATI JINICH: But you
can't take it back.

00:15:08.916 --> 00:15:12.180
Once they're overdone
and rubbery, and then

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.310
even if you had like super fresh
shrimp, if you overcook them,

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.680
they're going to smell.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.200
So you want them plump.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.180
You want them crunchy.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.040
I agree.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.685
They're going to
lose all their charm.

00:15:22.685 --> 00:15:25.060
LEE KEENER: I got the butter
just as it started to brown.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.600
And I put the shrimp in.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.530
You can see how all the
colors started on it.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.670
And I flipped them over, and
I just turned the fire off.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.461
I'm letting it sit.

00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:35.439
You can still hear it sizzling,
so it is still cooking.

00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:37.230
PATI JINICH: So you
want it over high heat,

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.410
but a short amount of time,
so it'll brown on the outside,

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.770
but it will stay crisp
and plump on the inside.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.960
And even when you
remove them, they'll

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.960
still be hot from
the sear, and they'll

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.510
continue to cook a little.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.440
So I agree.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.460
And if you have
fresh shrimp, nothing

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.530
happens if you eat
them a little raw.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.182
And they won't be raw
if you give them--

00:15:59.182 --> 00:16:01.640
even if you give them
20 seconds on each side,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.354
they'll be good enough.

00:16:03.354 --> 00:16:04.520
LEE KEENER: These are ready.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.644
PATI JINICH: They're ready.

00:16:05.644 --> 00:16:09.651
Should we put-- in here?

00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:10.150
Yes.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.890
Oh, that's perfect.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.210
So here we have the sauce,
and what I'm going to add now

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.060
is I'm going to add
nutmeg, and I'll tell you.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.750
So this is salsa roja
or tomato-based sauce.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.970
I've told you the ingredients
like 30 times, right?

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.584
Can I quiz you?

00:16:26.584 --> 00:16:29.020
No, I'm not going to repeat
the ingredients again.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.790
I was about to do it.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.020
But aside from adding
the Mexican crema-- oh,

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.230
we didn't tell them
about the Mexican cream.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.490
I know here everybody in
Chicago is an expert when

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.780
it comes to Mexican
ingredients, but are you

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.950
all familiar with Mexican crema?

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:44.530
Yay.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.205
I can say something new.

00:16:47.205 --> 00:16:52.020
Mexican crema is a
very fresh, thick,

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:57.140
salty-- I mean teasingly
salty, very tangy

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:02.540
kind of a cream that's like a
cousin of the creme fraiche.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:08.490
It is, I think, thinner than the
sour cream and not as acidic,

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.310
but it has a lot
more personality

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.300
than the heavy cream,
which doesn't have

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.190
that tang and that saltiness.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.510
Was that too complicated?

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:22.106
Mexican crema is just
its own ingredient.

00:17:22.106 --> 00:17:25.010
You can find it everywhere,
especially here in Chicago.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.640
It really makes a
difference if you use it.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.960
If you can't find
it, you can use, OK,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.460
fine, fresh creme, or if you
can't find it, instead of sour

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.210
cream, I would use heavy cream.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.370
And then I'm adding
the nutmeg, which

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.820
I think is an ingredient--
I don't know if you agree--

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.360
that tends to be overlooked.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.105
LEE KEENER: And typically,
it's already ground,

00:17:50.105 --> 00:17:52.650
and ground spices are another
thing I'm kind of a snob about,

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.080
because they've been
sitting too long.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:54.705
They get dusty.

00:17:54.705 --> 00:17:57.110
They get that dusty flavor.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.580
For instance, you mentioned
the fresh bay leaf.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.860
This here is fresh bay.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.960
I was so glad to see
the chef found this,

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.480
because I've been on him for
months buying fresh bay leaves,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.521
because it makes all the
difference in the world.

00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:10.550
You know what's on
your shelf at home.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:14.170
That dry, pale green, dusty--
the flavor comes through.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.567
The oils are still alive.

00:18:15.567 --> 00:18:16.066
Smell it.

00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:16.720
Go ahead.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.110
Pass around my bay leaves.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.040
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.560
Give it a little squeeze.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.900
Smell it in your hand.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.537
Pass it around.

00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:25.620
You'll see the difference.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.820
You'll smell like bay
the rest of the day,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:26.960
and you'll thank me.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.310
PATI JINICH: You know what?

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.290
I think you should pass
around your nutmeg,

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.295
because it smells incredible.

00:18:31.295 --> 00:18:35.070
And the nutmeg is also adorable.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.160
I mean, just look at it.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.140
It is like a marvel of nature.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.660
It's an adorable ingredient.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.840
It smells incredible.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.840
It tends to be used for
dessert and for pastries,

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.050
and as you say,
usually comes ground,

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.990
and it really
tastes like nothing.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.550
But when you grate
it-- and it's also fun.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.830
I think that for many people,
cooking-- and of course,

00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.570
it has to happen.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.370
I have to have
dinner in my kitchen

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.800
for my three boys every
day at 6:00 or 7:00 PM,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.420
and we all get thinking that
cooking is this task that we're

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.650
going to have to wash dishes.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.160
What am I going to cook today?

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.150
But when you have these
tools like how cool is this?

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.500
And it's probably
like $6 or $7, and you

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.340
can grate your own nutmeg.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.380
It's like you start bringing
meaning and technique

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.310
and information into your
kitchen, and so your kitchen,

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.090
instead of being this place,
where you, oh, I'm a foodie.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.720
I will really want
to eat, but I don't

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.150
want to clean up this mess.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.670
When you start getting these
things into your kitchen,

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.320
your kitchen transforms into
this like alchemist's lab,

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.973
where you have these
tools and spices and yeah.

00:19:44.973 --> 00:19:46.360
Yeah, that's what I think.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.890
LEE KEENER: That's what I meant
by getting your hands dirty.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.450
You said it a little
more eloquently,

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.380
but you get connected
with what you're doing.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.490
It's not just a chore.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.680
It's not just a way to eat.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.892
It's a way to live.

00:19:57.892 --> 00:19:59.100
PATI JINICH: I agree exactly.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.470
And then also, it's
very interesting

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.930
when you start
sort of adopting--

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.650
I'm going to add some salt, and
if you want to add some pepper,

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.060
but we don't need pepper,
because we have the nutmeg.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.094
I take it back.

00:20:12.094 --> 00:20:16.490
So I'm adding some
salt to the sauce now.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.570
You can make the
sauce ahead of time.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.870
What you can't do ahead of
time is cook the shrimp.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.540
Like you really want to do right
when you're going to do it.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.304
Or you can eat them cold,
but don't reheat them again,

00:20:30.304 --> 00:20:32.720
because they're not going to
be ready for your enchiladas.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.990
They're going to be
ready for Halloween.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.730
So we have the sauce.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.880
I'm going to let it season a
little bit, and then what we do

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.280
is you're all familiar
with preparing the corn

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.331
tortillas for enchiladas.

00:20:47.331 --> 00:20:47.830
No?

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.510
I'll tell you.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.010
OK.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.120
This is going to
make-- and you guys

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.510
have gorgeous tortillas here.

00:20:58.146 --> 00:21:00.650
There's a technique
that has been passed on

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:04.260
through generations and
generations, and it's very.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.680
Simple you have
the corn tortilla,

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:12.220
and all you need to do in order
to fill it, roll it, and then

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:16.420
sauce it, is to, what we say,
prepare the corn tortilla

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.130
to be dressed.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.560
So because I really think
that the enchiladas are

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.510
like Mexico's most fanciest
way to dress and honor

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.590
our tortillas, because
tacos-- we all love tacos.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.820
Everybody knows tacos.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.370
there's tacos of all kinds,
and they're fascinating,

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.100
but enchiladas is like
when somebody tells you

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.830
you're coming home
for enchiladas.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.115
Aren't you like, wow?

00:21:40.115 --> 00:21:41.490
LEE KEENER: They're
running home.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.739
PATI JINICH: I mean, it's
like it's something special.

00:21:43.739 --> 00:21:45.670
It sounds like an
occasion, and you're

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.260
going to garnish
them and dress them,

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.160
and it's just a little bit
more fancy, even though it's

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.080
a simple, unpretentious dish.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.890
It sounds-- so you
can serve enchiladas

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.080
where the tortilla has been
prepped, because if I roll it,

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.010
see what happens.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.890
So I always say--
but I don't know

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:08.150
how you guys feel about this--
that for enchiladas, you really

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.000
need to use corn tortillas
and not flour tortillas.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.770
What do you think?

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.096
LEE KEENER: What do I think?

00:22:14.096 --> 00:22:15.720
To get more flavor
and texture into it?

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.590
PATI JINICH: No, like
are you giving them

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.679
permission-- I'm kidding.

00:22:18.679 --> 00:22:19.970
Not that I can give permission.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.275
But are they allowed to use
flour tortillas for enchiladas?

00:22:24.275 --> 00:22:25.400
LEE KEENER: For enchiladas.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.280
PATI JINICH: I say
corn tortillas.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.196
LEE KEENER: Yeah, corn
tortilla for enchilada.

00:22:28.196 --> 00:22:30.855
Flour tortilla typically
for fajita, tacos.

00:22:30.855 --> 00:22:31.730
PATI JINICH: Exactly.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.303
Flour tortillas are great
for tacos, great for fajitas,

00:22:34.303 --> 00:22:35.502
great for quesadillas.

00:22:35.502 --> 00:22:37.168
LEE KEENER: But if
it's good, it's good.

00:22:37.168 --> 00:22:38.960
PATI JINICH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.890
But I say no flour,
so we're just

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.930
going to heat them
straight over the fire.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.930
You can use a
comal or a skillet,

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:50.120
or you can pass them through
really, really hot oi.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.424
You can do it straight over the
fire, or you had a comal too.

00:22:53.424 --> 00:22:55.090
LEE KEENER: Yeah, you
can use that tray.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.256
PATI JINICH: Let's use-- OK.

00:22:56.256 --> 00:22:57.560
Like that, here.

00:23:01.616 --> 00:23:07.320
The flour tortillas-- there's
a deep reason why you shouldn't

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.310
use flour tortillas
for the enchiladas,

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:13.090
because they're sweet,
because the flavor changes,

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.970
because they get really
soggy, because they're not

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:19.140
made to withhold or
withstand the sauce,

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.570
and they just lose
all their charm

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.940
when you sauce them
and then let them sit.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.160
The corn tortillas
are resilient.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.180
They also have--
their flavor profile

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.710
is much more nuanced,
because it's not that sweet.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.530
And then see?

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.470
After chef heated
them, you roll them,

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:40.980
they're not going to break.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.680
So I think we can toast
them a little more,

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.850
because the tortillas
are so fresh.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.030
Anyway, so you
prep the tortillas,

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.080
and then we're going to
soak them in the sauce,

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.780
cover them entirely
in the sauce,

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.550
and then you fill
them with the shrimp,

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:58.310
and then we garnish them.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.530
You can make the
sauce ahead of time,

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.550
and then when you're ready
to eat, you just reheat it,

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.080
and you stuff your enchiladas.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.900
And you have an entire meal.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.920
Let's prep one here.

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:18.500
There's also a basic
trick to making--

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.090
and then you can make
cute, adorable enchiladas

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.960
with the tiny tortillas
that you guys have here,

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.260
which the rest of
the US doesn't have.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.780
Do you guys know how lucky
you are to be in Chicago?

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.984
It's like, yes.

00:24:30.984 --> 00:24:33.410
Yes.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:33.910
OK.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.680
We can make some
cute small ones.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.550
So we're just going to cover the
tortilla entirely in the sauce,

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:47.050
and you do that so that every
single bite of the enchilada

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.430
is worth your time.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:52.260
You don't want a piece of the
enchilada, not a single bite

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.082
that doesn't have the sauce.

00:24:54.082 --> 00:24:54.582
Oops.

00:24:57.498 --> 00:24:59.380
I'm going to do it quicker.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.020
Yeah, that helps.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:02.941
Thank you.

00:25:02.941 --> 00:25:03.440
OK.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.951
Let's forget about
these ones, OK?

00:25:05.951 --> 00:25:08.800
If that happens,
just add some cheese.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:14.720
Add some crema, and eat it up.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.400
OK?

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.830
Then we're going
to add the shrimp.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:24.860
You can do it whole if
you want to look fancy.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.150
When I want to make
my kids feel special,

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.440
I add the whole shrimp.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.890
It looks like a fancier meal.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.420
And then you fill the enchilada.

00:25:37.842 --> 00:25:41.440
If you're like me, you make
the enchiladas way too chubby,

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:47.105
and then add more sauce on top.

00:25:47.105 --> 00:25:48.530
I know you have spoons.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.695
I keep using the tools
that I shouldn't.

00:25:51.695 --> 00:25:54.650
Add more sauce, and
then you garnish,

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:59.010
so you use the white part of
the scallions to make the sauce.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.660
So people say that
the French are

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.680
very frugal in their
cooking, but I think

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.300
that Mexicans are even more.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:13.110
And then you garnish
with the green parts

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:18.480
of the scallions and some
queso fresco or queso feta.

00:26:23.946 --> 00:26:26.300
You can add more crema.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.030
That's not in the recipe,
but you can add more.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.430
And then some
super ripe avocado.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.430
LEE KEENER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.740
PATI JINICH: Oh.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.940
I'm going to come for
dinner every night here.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.000
You have everything prepped.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.010
LEE KEENER: We just got
these in, these little

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.410
beeswax sheets, so
you're going to see these

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.540
in the microkitchens
for the sliced avocados

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.415
that you guys eat half
of them and then can't

00:26:47.415 --> 00:26:48.290
use the rest of them.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:49.914
I think we finally
figured out a trick,

00:26:49.914 --> 00:26:51.402
so we're going to
start using this.

00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:52.110
PATI JINICH: Wow.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.609
OK.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:56.390
What's the paper?

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:57.130
I've never seen it before.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.171
LEE KEENER: It's beeswax.

00:26:58.171 --> 00:27:00.350
It's a beeswax
sheet, and you can

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.730
wash it and reuse
it, and rather than

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.330
continue to use plastic wrap.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.540
PATI JINICH: There you go.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.420
So that's the enchilada.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.430
So just like that,
I mean there's

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.640
like countless enchiladas.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.820
I think in the chapter,
I have maybe like

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.520
15 different kinds
of enchilada, but I

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.890
think that's nothing
from what you can find.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.600
So not only looks pretty, no?

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.192
Looks pretty?

00:27:27.192 --> 00:27:29.530
You can find south
of the border.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.240
You can find
countless enchiladas.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.880
You can find-- I'll
give you examples.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.310
So that's the entomatada
with the tomato

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.280
sauce with cream and nutmeg.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:44.050
I have in there an
enchilada with mole verde.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.290
You all know mole verde.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:49.110
It's a mole made with pumpkin
seeds and lettuce and parsley

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.582
and cilantro and
tomatillos, delicious,

00:27:51.582 --> 00:27:53.980
stuffed with pork tenderloin.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.290
I have another one with
asparagus and mushroom

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.560
and thyme and goat cheese
covered in a pine nut mole

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.390
sauce.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:05.130
There's one stuffed with crab
meat and peas and tarragon

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.570
and a sauce of jocoque,
which is hard to find here,

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.530
but you can make it similar
with buttermilk sauce.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.360
So those are just
some-- so people--

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.420
LEE KEENER: Don't
get them hungry.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:14.630
Look at them.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.890
They're hungry.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:17.350
PATI JINICH: --don't think
of just the Tex-Mex enchilada

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:18.735
or the salsa verde enchilada.

00:28:18.735 --> 00:28:20.240
There's so many.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.240
I have one-- oh, this
is my kids favorite.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.664
But no, this is my kids' number
one enchilada, the number

00:28:26.664 --> 00:28:27.830
one that they love the most.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.190
The second one is the
pork with the mole verde

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.760
sauce and pickled radishes,
and the pickled radishes

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.536
take like five minutes to make.

00:28:35.536 --> 00:28:38.720
And I was saying
what was my favorite

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.880
for my kids-- black
bean enchilada.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:46.420
I have some enchiladas that I
call the big brunch enchiladas.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.620
They're stuffed
with scrambled eggs,

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:52.220
and then they're baked
with a black bean sauce--

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.410
super rich-- seasoned
with chipotle [INAUDIBLE],

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.970
and then you garnish
with pickled jalapenos.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.400
I'm a fan of pickled jalapenos.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.500
Are you a fan of
pickled jalapenos here?

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.000
Yes.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.060
You can use the ones
you can find here

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.430
in Chicago too, the ones that I
just tried in the Chicago style

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.940
hot dog.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.790
You can use those too.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.850
You guys, those
were good hot dogs.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.760
Anyway, and then
avocado, and then

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.430
I also fry and crumble
Mexican chorizo,

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.020
and then I add that on top.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.750
So you can have breakfast,
lunch, brunch, dinner

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.341
enchiladas.

00:29:25.341 --> 00:29:29.260
Just don't use flour
tortillas, and that's it

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.727
for the enchiladas.

00:29:30.727 --> 00:29:32.560
LEE KEENER: And we have
some coming for you.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.090
Is that where [INAUDIBLE]
just go to get them?

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.130
So we're going to be putting
out some things for you to try.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.171
In the meantime, does
anybody have any questions?

00:29:38.171 --> 00:29:40.170
PATI JINICH: Any questions?

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.660
My kids aren't here, so I
can talk about anything,

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.600
because they're
usually embarrassed

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:50.630
about one, my accent, and two,
the responses that I give, so.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.570
AUDIENCE: Have you
always liked cooking,

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.460
or is this something where
it evolved over time,

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.955
and you developed that love?

00:29:56.955 --> 00:29:57.705
PATI JINICH: Yeah.

00:29:57.705 --> 00:30:00.780
I mean, it is something
that has really changed

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.590
over the course of my life.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.940
I used-- I'm a very
opinionated person,

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.440
and I used to be a very yes,
no, always, never, love, hate,

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.380
black, white, and
with time, I've

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.140
realized that things mostly
fall kind of a gray thing

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.550
that one day you may be
really good at something,

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.760
but in five years,
you realize that you

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.410
were good at something else.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:25.880
I always loved eating, always.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.670
I am the biggest eater.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.790
It's a prob-- like,
isn't a problem?

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:35.320
It's a problem, and
we just met yesterday.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.480
I mean I just-- I'm
obsessed with food.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.940
Like that's how I experience
the world, you know.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.070
And so I've always
loved eating, but I come

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:47.172
from a family of four girls.

00:30:47.172 --> 00:30:50.020
I was sort of the
tomboy growing up.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.620
We always loved eating,
and my three sisters

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.100
got into the food
world-- I'm giving you

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.410
the longest answer possible.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.520
My three older sisters
got in the cooking world

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.020
very early on.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.350
My oldest sister
became a caterer.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:08.050
My second sister became a
pastry chef, French trained.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.150
She's like-- they're
all incredible.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.440
The next one became
vegetarian, then vegan,

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.420
and now is also into
fashion, so she writes about

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.080
like healthy,
fashionable lifestyle.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.930
I was like the
intellectual sort of,

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:26.360
and I wanted to be an academic.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.470
I trained as a
political scientist.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.676
I worked in a think tank.

00:31:30.676 --> 00:31:36.270
I kept accidentally bumping
into food-related things,

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.510
and I absolutely loved them.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:43.060
But I always yanked myself
back thinking your expectations

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.600
and people's expectations.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:49.030
If I already invested
this undergraduate degree

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:52.080
and this graduate degree, I
need to go in that direction

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.270
until one day, I had two kids.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.910
I had my third on
the way, and I really

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.755
didn't like my job at a think
tank, which is a great think

00:32:00.755 --> 00:32:02.410
tank in Washington, DC.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:05.210
But this is how I
changed careers.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:11.870
My boss asked me if I could
write a policy analysis

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:17.240
paper comparing the transition
to democracy in two countries--

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:22.130
Mexico and Peru, like both
really complicated topics.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.800
And I was researching
those, and I

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.460
had a colleague
who was Peruvian,

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.850
and he kept telling me that
his Peruvian ceviche is

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:30.670
so incredible.

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:34.420
And I was like, no, Mexican
ceviche is so incredible.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.520
And he was like,
no, we had it first.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.730
I was like, no, no, no, no.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:38.860
We had it first.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.350
So instead of researching
on the troublesome path

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:44.620
to democracy in
both countries, I

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.770
started researching who
got to ceviche first.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.320
And I was like--
it was like a week

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.550
that I was deep into research,
and when the Spanish arrived

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:54.950
to where, and when
the Portuguese

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.040
arrived where, because
everybody was eating raw fish.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.910
But the question was,
who added citrus first?

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.110
And there was no citrus
in Latin America.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:06.230
So I was like so fascinated,
and after a week,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:09.099
I went to my boss, who's
now a really good friend.

00:33:09.099 --> 00:33:10.640
He wasn't very happy
when I resigned,

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.590
but we're really
good friends now.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.940
And I was even more
guilty, because there

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.190
wasn't a job position in
that think tank for me when

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.660
I applied, but I really thought
that that was my dream job,

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.290
so they made a position for me.

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:27.140
And after like a year
and a half there, I

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.440
felt I've been here so long.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.920
They made this position for me.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.177
I can't just go, so like
for nights and nights,

00:33:34.177 --> 00:33:36.510
like for a year and a half,
I was like, I could do this,

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:42.096
I could do this, until
finally, I resigned.

00:33:42.096 --> 00:33:46.760
And I went into cooking
school in Washington, DC,

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.810
thinking I would do
not political analysis,

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:54.680
but sort of gastropolitical,
gastrohistorical analysis,

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.570
and that was that.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:00.020
So whenever people
ask me, like I

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.990
get a lot of emails
and questions,

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:06.640
especially from women like
mid-age like me, who tell me,

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.610
how did you switch?

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:08.500
Why did you switch?

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.500
Should I switch?

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.110
And they feel like
there's so much risk.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.780
I always say like,
do it yesterday,

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:19.050
because you think you may
not want to do something

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.000
that you don't
know anything about

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.179
but that you're
really attracted to,

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.689
and just the fact that
you're really attracted to it

00:34:25.689 --> 00:34:27.230
and you can't stop
thinking about it,

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:30.420
and you're sacrificing
a path that you already

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.800
took for going in that, is
going to make you give it all

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.300
you've got.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.770
And you're going to come
from a different perspective.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.639
Like if I had started
cooking when I was 18,

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:44.850
I wouldn't be talking
about legends and histories

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:48.520
and traditions and sort of
the political nerve of where

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.770
the recipes come from.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:53.675
And so I think-- but
you didn't ask me that.

00:34:53.675 --> 00:34:55.600
You asked me when I
went into cooking,

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.630
so then I went into cooking,
and then I went into cooking.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.250
And my cooking has
really changed.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:02.980
LEE KEENER: We have another
question over there.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:03.688
PATI JINICH: Yes.

00:35:03.688 --> 00:35:05.060
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.380
Thank you so much
for coming to Google.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.180
I remember as a
kid in Michoacan,

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.079
my grandmother--
meat wasn't always

00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:14.620
something that was
readily available,

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.360
so she was very
inventive with vegetables

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.700
and especially trying to
get kids to eat vegetables.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.650
What are some of the
vegetarian options

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.175
for enchiladas that
you recommend--

00:35:24.175 --> 00:35:25.592
healthier, vegetarian stuff?

00:35:25.592 --> 00:35:26.300
PATI JINICH: Yes.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.880
I love that question.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.820
I have a very good friend in
Washington, Joe Yonan, who

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:35.120
is the Washington Post
food and travel editor,

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:40.590
and he became a
vegetarian very recently.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:43.450
And he had a really,
really funny article

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:45.790
in the Washington
Post saying how

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:47.770
it was harder for
him to come out

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.180
as a vegetarian
being a food writer

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:54.320
than when he came
out as being gay.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.300
And it was an
incredible article.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.600
And because being a
food writer, people

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.610
will question, well,
how can you review this,

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.670
or how can you review
that if you're not?

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.380
So anyway, I've had these
conversations with him,

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.480
because we sometimes
cook together,

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.850
and I'm always telling
him, and this with meat,

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:15.110
and this with chicken,
and this with chorizo.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:18.700
And I did a detox-- I know
you asked me something,

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.790
and I'm getting there.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:23.150
I did a detox like two
years ago with my husband.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.750
I eat absolutely everything.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.732
And like two years
ago, we did a detox,

00:36:27.732 --> 00:36:29.940
just because to see-- because
everybody was doing it.

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.065
Some friends were doing it.

00:36:31.065 --> 00:36:34.710
Just to feel how our body
would react like for two weeks,

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.000
and it was two weeks
of, you know, nothing.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.040
I mean no meat, no poultry, no
lactose, no wine, no coffee,

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.240
no-- just grains,
vegetables, fruits.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.780
And for three days, I
was really mean, really

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.250
mean, because I drink
a lot of coffee.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:52.380
But then I felt fabulous.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.580
I felt great.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.650
And then slowly, we
started adding food groups

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:58.940
into our diet, and
it's like my system

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.800
got completely recalibrated.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.950
And I now hunger much more
the vegetables, the fruits,

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:11.180
the grains, the vegetarian
options, and the funny thing

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.080
is that Mexican cuisine
has naturally always

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.660
been very vegetarian.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:21.230
Before the Spanish
arrived a long time ago,

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:25.130
there was mainly vegetables,
fruit, grains, seeds.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.640
If there was any animal
protein, it was fish

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:33.940
or it was wild turkey like
the pig, the beef, the lamb,

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.534
the cheese, the milk, like
all the lard, all of that

00:37:37.534 --> 00:37:38.450
came with the Spanish.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:43.340
So if you go into Mexico's
countryside, most of the diet

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.440
that you find is vegetarian--
the moles, the stews,

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.410
the soups, the
enchiladas, everything

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:53.150
are heavily based
on ingredients.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:56.730
And as I was telling
Joe, because he just

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:01.020
wrote an article about the
vegetarian options in my book,

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:06.280
and I was telling him, the funny
thing is in Mexico and the US,

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.740
things are experienced so
differently in that here, it's

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.330
been very trendy, you
know, the vegetarian

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:16.950
and vegan and organic
and from farm to table

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:20.330
and all those concepts and
artisanal are like so new--

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:23.430
well, maybe not so
new-- but recent.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:26.880
In Mexico, we've had
farm to table always.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.630
The farmers' markets
are the markets.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.790
The farmers are
the markets always,

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.630
and it's not the exclusive
or fancy thing to do.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:38.120
It's the cheapest, more
affordable thing to do.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:44.690
And Mexico has naturally been
very veggie and grain-based,

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.970
but we haven't called them that.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:49.510
So now that it's gotten
to be very trendy,

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.140
it's like many of our
recipes and dishes

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:56.220
we're starting to put them in
that box just in that concept.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.330
I'm going to answer.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:02.080
I have-- like there, one
of my favorite things

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:08.540
is refried bean and plantain
taco, and the plantains

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.850
you just stick in the
oven with the whole peel

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:15.210
until they come out,
and they caramelize,

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:16.360
and they're super soft.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.410
And they contrast with the
very earthy refried bean

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.540
and the plantains, which
are sweet and caramelized.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.164
It's delicious.

00:39:22.164 --> 00:39:26.450
And then I top it with
like walnut seed crunch

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.940
like walnut, pumpkin seeds,
sunflower seeds, scallions,

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.490
jalapenos just cooked
like for two minutes.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:34.550
It's so incredible.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:36.591
I'm going to show you the
photo after we're done.

00:39:36.591 --> 00:39:38.760
But the funny thing
is I didn't start--

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.730
in talking about how I've
evolved in my cooking-- it's

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.130
like in the last
three years, I've

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.980
cooked a lot more vegetarian.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.170
So there's like Swiss
chard and potato enchiladas

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.870
with Hatch chili sauce.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.640
There's like asparagus and
mushroom enchiladas a pine nut

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.020
mole sauce.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.180
There's like a
vegetarian posole verde.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.560
I mean, you can practically
make the entire book vegetarian.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.200
If in the soups, instead
of using chicken broth,

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.140
you use vegetable broth, there's
a hearts of palm soup in there

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.276
to die for.

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:14.820
I know, because I made it.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.864
Anyway, tons of options.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.470
AUDIENCE: Any other questions?

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.460
PATI JINICH: Because now they
know if they ask me something,

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.918
I'm going to answer
something else.

00:40:29.601 --> 00:40:30.100
Nothing?

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.020
No?

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.950
AUDIENCE: How did
you get on PBS?

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.616
PATI JINICH: Oh,
that's a good question,

00:40:34.616 --> 00:40:37.381
but that's a long
question again.

00:40:37.381 --> 00:40:39.380
I was pitched to
the Food Network

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.060
many years ago like
seven or eight years ago,

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:46.320
when I started with the culinary
program at the Mexican Cultural

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.685
Institute with
something like this,

00:40:48.685 --> 00:40:50.930
but I focus more on
what I say, because I'm

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:55.410
more familiar with the
place, like eight years ago.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:57.940
And a lot of people
started coming,

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.150
and word started
spreading a little

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.230
about the classes
and the content,

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:05.140
and I started to get
invited like to some radio

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.660
things or local TV
things, and word spread.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.740
And somebody did a pilot and
pitched me to the Food Network.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.920
And they said, yay, we love it.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.620
Let's buy a season of
this, but your hair

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.800
could be a little bit more red.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.570
Maybe you can get a dog.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:29.246
Maybe instead of buying Mexican
food, you do Latin food.

00:41:29.246 --> 00:41:31.310
And most of all.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:33.460
Let's get rid of your accent.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:39.160
And so I thought, well, if
instead of doing Mexican, which

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:44.690
is what I know, I do Latin, and
if I get rid of my accent, then

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.330
who will I become?

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.240
Like after I do a few seasons
here or something, which

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.260
would have been
great, of course,

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.450
but then I think you do sort
of a sense of who you are

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:55.820
and what you do.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:00.000
So some people from
the local PBS station

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.490
had come to my classes,
and they said, you know,

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:08.257
it would be really great to
have a Mexican do Mexican food.

00:42:08.257 --> 00:42:09.090
We like your accent.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:15.170
We love your content, because
you had a lot of history

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:19.660
and a lot of backbone
to it, and it'd

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.500
be great to have a
Mexican do Mexican food,

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.880
and that's what prompted it.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.710
And then it took a
few years, of course,

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.990
and then we're going
to our fifth season

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:33.097
now, which will be
out in September.

00:42:33.097 --> 00:42:34.180
AUDIENCE: Congratulations.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:34.970
PATI JINICH: Thank you.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:35.490
Thank you.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.440
Oh, I think the
enchiladas are there.

00:42:40.704 --> 00:42:42.370
LEE KEENER: Dante,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:42:46.181 --> 00:42:47.930
AUDIENCE: Pati, I have
a question for you.

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:49.330
PATI JINICH: Yes, anything.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:54.510
AUDIENCE: So to address the
tortilla, which I was really

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:55.900
excited to see you make this.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.870
I've been making
enchiladas for awhile now.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:59.630
Whenever I've done
it, and you mentioned

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.670
that you can have the
option of flash frying it,

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.084
and then putting
it in the sauce.

00:43:04.084 --> 00:43:05.500
Is there a method
that you prefer?

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.226
I've never actually seen
anyone do it this way.

00:43:08.226 --> 00:43:09.876
PATI JINICH: With the oil?

00:43:09.876 --> 00:43:11.737
AUDIENCE: No, with
just burning it.

00:43:11.737 --> 00:43:12.820
PATI JINICH: Just heat it.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:13.670
You know what?

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.930
It's really alternative methods.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:18.460
They both work.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.390
They taste a little
bit different.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:22.810
What you're doing
is you're making

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:25.980
the tortilla be
resilient, because when

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.020
you pass the tortilla
through very, very hot oil

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.050
just for like a
few Mississippis,

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:36.150
you're giving it like a nutty--
first, you're adding flavor.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.540
You're giving it a
nutty layer, and you're

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.500
making it a little bit crisp.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.270
And then you can roll it.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:47.330
You've seen that method.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:49.930
So for people that don't
want to fry the tortillas

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:51.700
or pass the tortilla
through oil,

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.820
you just need to either put them
over the fire or a hot comal

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.940
or skillet, and you just wait
until the tortilla slightly

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.370
browns and becomes malleable.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:05.160
What happens is that the
tortilla, just like the pita

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.240
pocket or the pita
bread, when you heat it,

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.930
the space between the two
layers of the tortilla

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.180
will fluff a little.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.430
And that's what makes the
tortillas not break or crumble.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:19.850
And also, I don't know
how to explain it,

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:24.750
but it wakes up-- it makes the
flavors of the ingredients sort

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:25.970
of come alive.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:30.140
And so you can use either
method-- through the oil,

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.740
or heat it over
the fire or comal.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.500
Don't use the microwave.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.770
Do one by one.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:37.690
It doesn't take long.

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.850
You can use a big
surface, and then just

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:41.500
heat many tortilla
at the same time,

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.655
and then you can pack them
up in a kitchen towel,

00:44:44.655 --> 00:44:46.850
and they become
resilient for you.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:51.500
But if you put them all together
from the bag in aluminum

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.030
foil, in the oven,
or in the microwave,

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.547
you've destroyed
those tortillas.

00:44:56.547 --> 00:44:58.630
I mean they're just going
to stick to one another.

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:02.120
They're going to become
muggy and moist and humid.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.082
And it's going to be
hard to separate them,

00:45:04.082 --> 00:45:05.790
and they're not going
to roll, and you're

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.748
going to hate me for
trying to make enchiladas.

00:45:11.606 --> 00:45:13.650
Of course.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.305
Anybody?

00:45:15.305 --> 00:45:15.804
Anything?

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.950
AUDIENCE: So now I
have the curiosity

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:24.850
of who got the ceviche
first-- Peru or Mexico?

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:25.990
PATI JINICH: You know what?

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.330
Just like the-- that's
a great question.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:29.956
Yeah.

00:45:29.956 --> 00:45:32.470
Talk about a question that made
someone change their career.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.840
It is so funny, and I
still laugh to the day

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.700
with Michael, who's the
president of the think tank.

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.600
You know, when I resigned,
he wasn't thrilled at all,

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.000
but we're very close friends.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.420
But every time somebody asked
me about my change of career,

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.570
and I say that I wasn't
happy at the think tank,

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:55.300
he keeps telling me, thank
you for saying that my think

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.620
tank made you miserable, and
it's a horrible dreadful place.

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.060
It's a wonderful place.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.840
Just like the tres
leches cake, the ceviche

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.310
is sort of regional.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.700
It belongs to all
of Latin America.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:13.410
When did the first
person eat raw fish?

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:17.580
So it's about the same time one
could assume that people were

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.770
eating raw fish and
adding ground chilies

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:23.780
or salt to preserve them
or to give them taste

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.100
or because humans--
we've always needed salt.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:29.776
And then when it really
turned them into ceviche

00:46:29.776 --> 00:46:32.490
was when that citrus was added.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:37.850
And when the boats got here with
Spanish and Portuguese people

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:39.990
and the Moors that had
the citrus, I mean,

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:46.760
I guess-- I think Mexico, but
I think the ceviches from Peru

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.197
are really extraordinary too.

00:46:49.197 --> 00:46:50.030
I'll give them that.

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:51.010
I'll give them that.

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:53.250
LEE KEENER: They get the credit.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:54.500
PATI JINICH: Are you Peruvian?

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.000
LEE KEENER: It's
just what you hear.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.120
Most people think-- but
to answer your question--

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.050
I know you asked her and
not me, but your question

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.133
about the vegetarian food.

00:47:01.133 --> 00:47:02.920
The cuisine is the land.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.120
It's what is from there, and
when we're researching menus,

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.574
everything we find is that
there's such an amalgam

00:47:10.574 --> 00:47:11.740
of so many different things.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.330
Everywhere is a melting pot.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:16.060
It depends how far back you go.

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.790
So what is traditional
Mexican food?

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:21.325
It's what is in front of you
is in the ingredients that

00:47:21.325 --> 00:47:21.950
are from there.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:24.180
So you can change,
you can experiment,

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.926
you can make it your own.

00:47:25.926 --> 00:47:27.800
It's not always about
just removing the meats

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.502
and adding in beans or grain
or something like that.

00:47:31.502 --> 00:47:32.500
PATI JINICH: I agree.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.790
And also the question of
authentic and traditional-- I

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:38.840
know nobody asked, but
going to that topic--

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.250
I think just like
artisanal, you know,

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:43.100
now you go to McDonald's,
and they tell you

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.410
that the bread is artisanal.

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:48.140
I think those concepts
have unfortunately

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:52.560
been so overused
in what's authentic

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.420
and what's traditional.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:58.050
I think everything, if not
mostly everything that's

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:02.690
considered traditional
Mexican food, was once fusion,

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.390
because in Mexico,
there was no rice.

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:06.260
There was no pasta.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.160
There was no onion.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.930
There was no garlic.

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:11.670
So even though it's
a recent concept,

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:16.220
I think the strong
cuisines have the power

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.410
to embrace new
ingredients and have

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.950
their own strong interpretation.

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:26.310
But I agree with you that
you can drive through Mexico,

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.720
and I think now that
Mexican cuisine has really

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.180
become borderless, because
I think you can find just

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.120
as extraordinary Mexican
food here in Chicago

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.226
as in Michoacan.

00:48:37.226 --> 00:48:40.200
And it's just different
spins and different regional

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:45.070
takes that have to do with what
Mexican communities find here

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:45.960
in Chicago.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.170
So they come with
their techniques

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:50.300
and their ingredients
and their know-how

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.760
that they love, and they
know-- like your abuela.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.920
I know you were telling me.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.220
But then you move to Chicago,
and you have all of these,

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.770
and then you learn
to love the things

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:02.290
that you find in your new home.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:05.140
And you sort of weave
them into what you know.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.550
Is that Mexican?

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:08.650
I say 100%.

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:12.450
But there's a good
debate, though.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:13.950
LEE KEENER: Pati,
thank you so much.

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:15.500
We really appreciate
you being here.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:15.890
PATI JINICH: Thank you.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:17.210
Thank you for having me here.

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:17.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:19.764
Thank you, guys.
