If you recall, when we were discussing
Sudo, we mentioned that it's

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.360
a common pattern to disable
the ability to log in as root, and

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.650
to only log in as a different user
that has the ability to use Sudo.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.060
This is a security measure,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.800
since every bad guy out there knows
every Linux box has a user named root.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.750
By disabling this
account from remote log,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.820
in we remove a very easy attack vector.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.830
Now vagrant took care of this for us.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.510
They created a user name vagrant and

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.190
we just type vagrant ssh from our
terminal to automatically connect.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.910
But not every hosting provider is going
to set something like this up for you.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.960
So let's do this ourselves.
