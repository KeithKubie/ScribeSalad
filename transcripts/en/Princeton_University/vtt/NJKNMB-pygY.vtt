I want to thank everyone who is part of Princeton
football.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.410
This is a great tradition.
And this year, this team gave us a game that

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.410
will go down in the history books.
For all of you who were foolish enough to

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:33.259
leave at halftime, you will never live it
down.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.550
It is one of the games for the ages.
So Princeton, enjoy this moment.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.269
Again, thanks to these young men who made
it possible.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:57.269
So let us join together in a locomotive for
our special honoree this evening: bonfire!

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.930
One Princeton Locomotive for Bonfire!
One Princeton Locomotive for Bonfire!

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:12.340
...while we shall live, three cheers for old
Nassau!
