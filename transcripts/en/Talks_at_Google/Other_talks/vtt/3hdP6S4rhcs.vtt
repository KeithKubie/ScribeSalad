00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.500
WILLIAM: It's my honor
to welcome Zia Ahmed.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.780
Zia is a Lyft driver and the
compiler of "Lyft Me Up San

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.980
Francisco."

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.959
So Zia, in your own words, what
is "Lyft Me Up San Francisco"?

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:15.500
ZIA AHMED: Well, to
start with, thank

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.420
you very much for having me.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.830
A big shout out to William, who
not only set this entire thing

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.924
up, invited all of
you and everything,

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.340
I think it's been
super well done.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.700
So thank you for having me.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.575
Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:31.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.500
So thank you.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.040
So yeah, the
interesting little story

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.430
is that I'm a Lyft
driver, and as I

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.990
drive around San
Francisco, I like

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.810
to ask my current
passengers to leave

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.160
my next passenger a message.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.860
I took those messages, which
I was compiling in this book,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.250
I put them in another
book, and I published it.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.750
Would you like to
hear some of them?

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.084
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:59.084 --> 00:00:59.750
ZIA AHMED: Yeah.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.250
Excellent.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.395
Because if you didn't, then I
don't know what we would do.

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:07.020
So a couple interesting
messages that I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.860
want to jump into really
quickly and also share

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.650
some stories of the different
type of things that happen

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.710
while you're kind of
driving, when you're seeing

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.520
the city, when you're out
there contracting with people

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.410
and just what happens when you
have a little conversation--

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.420
some funny things-- or just
some very touching things

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.730
that I've learned
or seen as well.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.540
So someone once
wrote, "in May 2012

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.520
my apartment and everything
I own burned down.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.050
Yesterday I moved back
with the same roommates.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.900
Everyone survived,
life went on, and we've

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.330
made every day count since."

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.300
So I think that's a
pretty interesting message

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.610
that a person would
actually leave in a book

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.720
where they're anonymously
asked to write something down.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.980
What do you think?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.990
WILLIAM: Yeah, agree.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.790
Just so you guys
know, Zia happens

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.005
to have a near photographic
memory of all of passengers.

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:05.260
So I'm curious who left
it, what was the ride like?

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.160
Maybe not the
to-from, but tell me

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.277
a little bit about the
context behind that message.

00:02:10.277 --> 00:02:11.360
ZIA AHMED: Yeah, for sure.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.990
I think it was a
Sunday afternoon.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.410
We were driving
towards-- we were

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.010
crossing Zeitgeist, If you're
familiar with San Francisco,

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.560
yeah?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.060
Zeitgeist.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.510
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.025
WILLIAM: Some nods in there.

00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:24.030
ZIA AHMED: There it is.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.800
So that's like around
14th and Valencia,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.420
and the building that's being
referred to here that burned

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.280
down in 2012 was the building
right opposite to that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.670
with that little grocery store.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.400
So kind of an interesting
story that this person came

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.710
and dropped, and
that's most of what

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.230
I can remember from that day.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.810
WILLIAM: Well, that's
already quite a bit.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.100
So do you have another maybe
less serious, more serious,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.660
less insightful,
more insightful?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.810
ZIA AHMED: Absolutely.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.570
There are plenty of them,
plenty of interesting stories.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.590
Let me actually
put this down here.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.660
Plenty of interesting
stories, but some

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.120
of the ones that
really meant something

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.460
to me, some of them
that really touched

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.284
for some reason or the
other, are the ones

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:09.450
that I really want to share.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.950
So this is an interesting one.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.670
Now, the story is that I read
this-- when the book came out

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.510
in early September, I was trying
to get the word out and share

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.750
it with the rides that I had.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.790
I didn't exactly know
how, so I was just

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.550
kind of putting these
little markers on it

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.260
and having random
people read it.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.730
So this message says,
"Giant sequoias need fire

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.740
in order to reproduce at all.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.220
Although a field of
burning trees after a fire

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.130
may look tragic, it's
actually hopeful.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.780
If you've had a fire
in your life recently,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.210
breathe and embrace it.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.700
The seedlings will come soon."

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.210
And when that person read
that, he actually broke down,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.730
started crying.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.240
And this guy was
visiting from Tahoe.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.010
He's visiting his
significant other

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.620
who lives in Outer Mission.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.160
He starts crying in my car.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.270
Now, I didn't want
that to happen.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.230
That's not exactly what I was
hoping the reaction would be,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.910
but it meant something
to him so much,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.160
and it deeply touched him,
that he bought two books

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.170
and paid me $60 for it instead
of the actual average price.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.740
So I feel like it's a very
impactful kind of story that

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.420
happened, and it showed
me the meaning of what

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.930
this type of connection, whether
it's writing it down or reading

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.532
it from somebody else,
could be really meaningful.

00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:31.650
WILLIAM: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:39.267
And do you have maybe a
particularly funny one?

00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:40.850
Obviously humor
depends on the person,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.391
but do you have something that
you look at that kind of makes

00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:45.170
you chuckle every
time you read it?

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.240
ZIA AHMED: That's a very
good question actually,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.100
and I'm glad you
did point that out.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.030
This I want to say it was
probably a week night,

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.360
and a Wednesday, Thursday
I was driving a couple

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.860
from the Mission to
the Fillmore District.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.550
And what happened was
the guy gets up front

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.890
and the girl gets in the back,
and they wrote a message,

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.710
and the situation is
going to add a little bit

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.030
more fascinating context, right?

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.690
So is says over here, "put
yourself out of your comfort

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.350
zone, like butt stuff,
and remember you win some

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.900
and you lose some."

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.750
And what happens is
that they actually

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.030
forgot a bag in the car, and
that bag is lying right there.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.150
You want to go check it
out and see what's in it?

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.950
WILLIAM: I have no
idea what is in this.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.347
Let me see what.

00:05:41.347 --> 00:05:43.430
I feel like I'm about to
get in trouble with this.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.250
Oh, good.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.350
Oh, goodness.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.530
We've got some toys here.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.474
We have--

00:05:48.474 --> 00:05:50.390
ZIA AHMED: Some fascinating
toys such as this.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.070
WILLIAM: Not returned.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.910
ZIA AHMED: And the idea
is that it's really

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.320
like-- what happened
after that is what

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.260
I wanted to kind
of also highlight,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.330
is that they left
that in the car.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.382
I didn't know it.

00:06:03.382 --> 00:06:04.840
So the next person
gets in the car,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.881
and she's like, oh, dude
there's a bag over here.

00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:08.080
I'm like, oh no.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.750
I have to return this
to whoever it is,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.030
because these are valuables.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.446
They're going to
probably call me,

00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:15.795
email me, something like that.

00:06:15.795 --> 00:06:17.920
And she reaches in the bag,
and she pulls that out.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.773
And she's like, you
staged this, didn't you?

00:06:20.773 --> 00:06:22.390
I'm like, what?

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.820
How did you even-- that is the
last thing that was on my mind,

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.900
but thank you for highlighting
that that would've

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.240
been an interesting story.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.740
WILLIAM: So you
never returned that?

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.750
It never made its way back.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.416
ZIA AHMED: Yeah.

00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:36.680
I was also thinking-- so nobody
ever called back to get it.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.900
Nobody left an email,
because those are generally

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.480
the ways in the app that
you can get something back.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.130
Plenty of cell phones have been
left, plenty of wallets, keys,

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.860
like you name it, but nobody
called to get this back.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.940
And I'm wondering
what would they say?

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.870
What would they say?

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.745
WILLIAM: That's true.

00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:57.897
ZIA AHMED: So kind of
fascinating stories like that.

00:06:57.897 --> 00:06:59.730
Those are the kind of
stories and situations

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.771
that have been happening.

00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:03.740
And some of these messages can
get really interesting as well,

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.294
really touching stories
about individuals

00:07:06.294 --> 00:07:07.960
and just what's
happening in their life.

00:07:11.307 --> 00:07:13.390
Another example that I
always really like telling,

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.760
because people get really
insightful about their lives,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.300
is that "we met at a dive bar,
like a really terrible one,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.050
and we're getting
married next year.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.550
Just proves that any
shit can happen."

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.420
And it's fascinating
that when they

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.672
have an opportunity or
an outlet like this,

00:07:30.672 --> 00:07:32.630
that they just drop
something about their life,

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.250
and it was a super cute couple.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.520
They were really excited.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.890
I think I was driving them
around SoMa or mid-market,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.480
some area like that.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.990
And they kind of shared
that with us in the book.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.257
So I think it was a
really nice passage.

00:07:45.257 --> 00:07:46.090
WILLIAM: Absolutely.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.350
So a wide variety of
stories, of passengers--

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.720
ZIA AHMED: An entire range--

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.261
WILLIAM: --cross-section
of the city.

00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:55.640
ZIA AHMED: --an entire
range of profound,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.390
profanity, all sorts of humor.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.880
And I also think that not
only is it the message,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.200
but I feel like people
love being part of this

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.117
and participating in it as well.

00:08:06.117 --> 00:08:08.200
So they feel like they're
either part of something

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.960
a little bit bigger, or
they're getting an opportunity

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.510
to share something
to, in their opinion,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.850
make life perhaps a little
bit better for someone.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:18.870
You know what I mean?

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.745
WILLIAM: Interesting.

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:20.510
Interesting.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.640
So we've heard a
bit about the book,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.182
but I'm curious to learn about
the man behind the book--

00:08:26.182 --> 00:08:26.890
ZIA AHMED: Uh-oh.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.860
WILLIAM: --the man behind
the steering wheel.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.240
So can you tell us a
little about your life

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.380
and how you wound
up in San Francisco?

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.530
ZIA AHMED: Sure, for sure.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.929
So I have a background
in tech, and I

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:50.870
have a background in
marketing, media, broadcasting,

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.520
technology, advertising,
all sorts of weird things--

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.120
completely unrelated
all of them--

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.410
and I was an account
manager basically

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.310
at an advertising
company, and then

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.060
I started working
in a tech company

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.490
when I came to San Francisco.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.072
And I came with
the entire dream.

00:09:06.072 --> 00:09:06.905
I drank the Koolaid.

00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:08.890
It was wonderful.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.430
And I started working at a
start up called CrowdFlower.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.950
I do have a couple of my friends
over here from there today.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.940
There they are.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:21.710
And after a few months
of me working over there,

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.060
not only did I
feel a little like,

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.260
OK, there's something not
right, I don't know what it is,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.570
but I'm not feeling it,
and the balance statement,

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.380
the balance sheet of the
company, felt the same way.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.780
It was an interesting
time for the company

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.570
as well, because we were
scaling up really fast,

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.372
and it didn't really work out.

00:09:42.372 --> 00:09:44.080
So there was a massive
layoff over there,

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.420
and I was one of them.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.137
That's kind of the story
before the story starts.

00:09:50.137 --> 00:09:50.720
WILLIAM: Sure.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.500
Absolutely.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.125
And I know that you have,
not only that surprise,

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:57.000
but another surprise
coming for our audience.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.240
Do you want to talk about that?

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.156
ZIA AHMED: Absolutely.

00:09:59.156 --> 00:10:01.790
So the interesting
thing is that one

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.496
of the reasons why I feel
this worked with so many

00:10:05.496 --> 00:10:07.370
and resonated with
so many people

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.300
is that there was an element
of surprise over here.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.060
And I wanted to recreate
that surprise with you

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.276
folks over here right now.

00:10:16.276 --> 00:10:18.900
So what I want you to do-- what
I want Will to actually do over

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.660
here-- if you could quickly hand
out one of those to everybody.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.840
And what I've done is
for the past two weeks

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.580
or three weeks since I was
trying to sort this out

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.280
with William, is I was
asking my passengers

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.230
to leave a message for
somebody at Google.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.370
Absolutely.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.820
So go ahead and open it up.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.704
Read the message that's
written, and I have no idea

00:10:47.704 --> 00:10:48.870
what's in there, by the way.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.990
WILLIAM: And I didn't
screen this, so if it's--

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.455
AUDIENCE: No anthrax, I hope.

00:10:52.455 --> 00:10:52.955
WILLIAM: No.

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:58.630
ZIA AHMED: So I think
if we grab the mic,

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.760
I want to listen to some of
the ones that people left.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.060
WILLIAM: Yeah.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.080
Let's read them out.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.370
Let's read them out.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.640
I think the mic is on now.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.681
We can get rid of "National
Geographic" behind us

00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:06.754
at the same time.

00:11:06.754 --> 00:11:07.670
ZIA AHMED: Is this on?

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.045
WILLIAM: Yes, I
do believe it is.

00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:12.100
ZIA AHMED: So a little
bit more about it,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.920
this is kind of
similar to the paper

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.510
that I was using
in the actual book

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.330
where I was gathering
these messages,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:22.280
and it's a handmade
paper, with one side

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.650
is a message from what
my passenger wrote,

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.440
and the other side is
a message that I wrote.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.800
You'll obviously be able
to tell which one's which.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.130
But if we can have
a volunteer, please.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.250
Anybody want to?

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.420
All right.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.510
AUDIENCE: "Thanks
Google for making my job

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.220
easier with all your
marketing platforms.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.974
Smiley face."

00:11:42.974 --> 00:11:44.390
ZIA AHMED: The
marketing platform.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.446
People love that.

00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:46.320
What do we have here?

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.377
AUDIENCE: We have a
political one here.

00:11:48.377 --> 00:11:49.960
"Hey, Google, I feel
like as a company

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.230
you have very similar
characteristics

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.180
to those of the Middle
East, Iran in particular.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.160
Are you trying to
take over the world?

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.360
Why the robots?

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.010
Are you sending them to war?

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.030
Sincerely, Cheri."

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.027
ZIA AHMED: What
was the last one?

00:12:04.027 --> 00:12:05.610
AUDIENCE: Are you
sending them to war?

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.360
Why the robots?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.650
Are you sending them to war?

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.690
ZIA AHMED: That
actually is something

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:09.856
you may want to think about.

00:12:09.856 --> 00:12:11.694
AUDIENCE: That's a good idea.

00:12:11.694 --> 00:12:12.892
ZIA AHMED: Of course it is.

00:12:12.892 --> 00:12:13.600
Sorry, who is it?

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.186
Was it Tyler?

00:12:14.186 --> 00:12:14.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.050
I got a good one.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.730
It says, "Google
Docs is the shit.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.920
Has saved my schooling
and some cash."

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.970
And then he also writes, "turn
it back to the old logo."

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.930
Old logo.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.869
ZIA AHMED: I feel that
happened a few times.

00:12:30.869 --> 00:12:31.410
Anybody else?

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.094
Would you like to
share what you got?

00:12:34.094 --> 00:12:35.760
AUDIENCE: "Google, I
love Google Wallet.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.250
I use it for work.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.500
Every day gives this
guy what he wants."

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.910
ZIA AHMED: Interesting.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.540
Some other?

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.040
One more?

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.636
There you go.

00:12:44.636 --> 00:12:45.760
AUDIENCE: I'm a contractor.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.667
So I feel OK saying this.

00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:49.000
I also disagree with the person.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.730
"I called this Lyft this morning
because Google Maps, combined

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.370
with public
transportation, is trying

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.350
to make my life as
complicated as possible.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.950
You should work on that."

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:58.820
I love Google Maps.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.515
I just want to point out.

00:13:00.515 --> 00:13:01.390
ZIA AHMED: Thank you.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.432
Very cool.

00:13:02.432 --> 00:13:03.640
I want to do one or two more.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.220
Has anybody-- all
right, we got one.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.600
Then you, because I'll
come across the room.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.650
AUDIENCE: I got, "I use
Google Docs to stash my nudies

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.790
and drug orders.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:19.570
I've never thought about Google
so long and hard before."

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.140
ZIA AHMED: Right?

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.250
So broadly speaking--

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:22.930
WILLIAM: Standard use case.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.388
ZIA AHMED: --just
so you know, this

00:13:24.388 --> 00:13:28.899
is what to expect from the book,
on a broad San Francisco level.

00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:30.690
AUDIENCE: "Dear Google,
don't get me wrong.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.360
You have a great
product, but aside

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.001
from feeding your employees
good quality organic foods,

00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:37.250
please consider feeding the
poor and homeless at least

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.310
a few times a month.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.530
I know you are good for it.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.430
Go humanity.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:41.720
Love, SF native."

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.100
ZIA AHMED: I love it.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.210
So a couple of examples.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.170
Anybody else, or do
you want to-- OK.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.020
Sweet.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.525
So that's kind of what
the experience was

00:13:53.525 --> 00:13:57.580
of receiving something
completely out of the blue,

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.360
not expecting it.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.030
We've all done it
thousands of times,

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.450
but this time was slightly
a little different.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.435
WILLIAM: So you're
living in San Francisco,

00:14:06.435 --> 00:14:10.460
and you're working in tech, and
then you mentioned this layoff.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.630
So where did this
project sprout from?

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.370
ZIA AHMED: Right, for sure.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.650
So for me, not
only have I always

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.840
wanted to have an
entrepreneurial kind

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.160
of experience,
but the idea was I

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.910
wanted to stay in San Francisco.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.520
The big idea was that after
the story-- kind of the plot

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.170
thickened, and the
company didn't work out--

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.130
what I wanted to do was I wanted
to figure out what I should do,

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.880
what I would enjoy
doing and stay longer.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.380
I started driving
for Lyft because I

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.340
was meeting a lot of
fascinating people,

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.590
a lot of really
interesting stories

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.700
were happening, getting to meet
a range of different people

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.801
throughout the city,
some fun experiences.

00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:50.050
And I really didn't know
where this was going to lead,

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:54.770
but what I always felt was
that, as much as people enjoyed

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.970
talking about the sense of
community, after that one ride,

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.630
it really was over, and I
wanted to somehow capture that.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.890
I wanted to not
only capture that,

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.850
but I also wanted to
connect with the person.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.670
Like what could I ask him
or what could I tell him

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.980
that would allow this
to be a little bit more

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.789
than just a ride from
point A to point B,

00:15:15.789 --> 00:15:18.080
which is when I started asking
them to write this down.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.010
Does that makes sense?

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.046
WILLIAM: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:22.670
And I know this is
something that we've

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.880
talked about in the past, and I
think that it's so natural, so

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.430
easy for someone to say, oh,
you've met thousands of people,

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.810
that you've read through
thousands of notes, which are

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.540
your favorite passages and why?

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.520
ZIA AHMED: That's an
interesting point.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.130
So I've been
collecting actually I

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.900
want to say on the range of
about 3,000 to 4,000 messages

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.910
over the past one year.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.510
And the ones that
I put in this book

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.200
actually meant
something to me somehow.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.370
Now, either it was sharing
something insightful

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.630
about the person
themselves or it

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.860
was talking about
somewhere fascinating to go

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.220
in the city, some experience
that I should have

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.660
which I haven't had previously.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.790
Quite literally, anything
that spoke to me.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.640
Either it was something
about themselves,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.720
something that spoke
to me, something

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.850
I could learn from what
they were talking about,

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.020
and if the person
was good looking.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.110
So that was also an
important factor.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.318
WILLIAM: Factor in the specs.

00:16:20.318 --> 00:16:23.150
It factors in to what
makes it into the book.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.880
So what are some, I guess,
takeaway themes from the book?

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.120
There are a lot of topics.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.080
So we have sex, we have
technology, we have culture,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.960
we have love.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.710
But what are some of the themes
that really unify and tie

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.300
together, not only the
snippets that made it

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.920
into the compilation, but that
made it into the leather-bound

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.815
notebooks--

00:16:45.815 --> 00:16:46.440
ZIA AHMED: Yeah

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.120
WILLIAM: --all together.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.400
ZIA AHMED: So I was kind
of actually asking people,

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.990
like I wanted to
broadly ask them

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:57.120
to leave something which would
reveal a little something

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.590
about themselves.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.500
I'm trying to guide them to be
able to speak about something

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.740
that they wanted to
share with somebody else.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.540
It could be something
completely anonymous,

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.450
something could be a secret, it
could be something fascinating.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:13.950
And I felt that a
lot of people were

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:20.045
giving certain thoughts, like
there were many cliches that I

00:17:20.045 --> 00:17:22.859
got, but I also felt like
one of the interesting themes

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.190
that I noted, or
lack of themes, was

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.580
a lack of theme of the
spirituality element

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.920
or the idea of being
connected to something,

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.470
an element of that.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.694
I felt that that was kind of
fascinating that I noticed.

00:17:37.694 --> 00:17:39.110
WILLIAM: So as a
spiritual person,

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.240
that kind of surprises me.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.406
Why do you think that is?

00:17:41.406 --> 00:17:42.780
Why do you think
there was a lack

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.625
of spiritual or religious
overtones in the messages?

00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:49.000
ZIA AHMED: You know, it could've
been one of the reasons,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.800
because I was kind
of controlling

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.150
the flow of the
conversation in that car.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.230
But broadly speaking,
I'm not really sure

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.530
why that wasn't there, but it is
something that I thought about.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.240
WILLIAM: Sure.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.140
Sure.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.590
And related to
that point, I think

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:09.090
that the difficulty in compiling
a book, not that I've ever

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.150
compiled anything
that I know of,

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.980
is that you run
the risk of losing

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.260
your voice in the process.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:21.890
So how do you maintain
artistic creativity and control

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.040
and find your voice
and leave your message

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.400
when you are
interacting and working

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.700
with messages of others?

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.210
ZIA AHMED: That part
of it, I was thinking

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:42.360
that I wanted to focus on not
only things that were happening

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.360
throughout what we were exposed
to in the form of the media

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.570
or anywhere else, but
whatever was going

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.160
on in the present at that time.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.060
For example, when
the Pope was visiting

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.590
or when Donald Trump
was in the news.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:58.240
These were conversations that
I was having with these people,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.950
and that's what the
result was coming to.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.600
So I was trying to
influence them to write

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.020
something a little fascinating.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.940
That's also one of
the interesting things

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.350
that we're working for the
future of this project as well.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.650
WILLIAM: So how do
you coach passengers?

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.140
So I rode with Zia
many months ago,

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.797
and I don't really remember the
exact way that you-- I think it

00:19:19.797 --> 00:19:22.380
was something about a surprise
in the glove compartment, which

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.812
had me a bit worried.

00:19:23.812 --> 00:19:24.770
ZIA AHMED: So from my--

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.829
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:26.829 --> 00:19:28.870
WILLIAM: This is supposed
to be surprising first,

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.362
and so how do you guide that?

00:19:30.362 --> 00:19:32.320
How do you let them know,
how do you guide them

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.230
through this process?

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:38.350
ZIA AHMED: So to start with, I
like to qualify my passenger.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.160
I like to have a
conversation with them,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.590
and I want to see what's up.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:46.510
Like do I want this person
to be part of my project,

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.115
because it's all about me.

00:19:48.115 --> 00:19:49.823
WILLIAM: So what you
do to the person who

00:19:49.823 --> 00:19:51.698
sits in the backseat,
puts on the headphones,

00:19:51.698 --> 00:19:52.550
takes the phone out.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.040
ZIA AHMED: So first of all,
I try to get their attention,

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.707
because this is just an
approach to get their attention,

00:19:56.707 --> 00:19:59.040
get them out of their phone,
get them out of that space.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.664
Everyone's on their
phone all the time,

00:20:00.664 --> 00:20:03.260
and I wanted to make a
social situation where

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.610
we're sitting in a car for 10
minutes, 12 minutes, and let's

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.740
interact with each other.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.760
So from there, I would just
try and get their attention.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.602
If I get their
attention, well and good.

00:20:13.602 --> 00:20:15.560
Then that means we can
go a little bit further.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.210
If not, then you
have to let it go.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.000
But the idea is that
if they're fascinating,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.790
if they have something that
kind of captures my imagination,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.040
then I ask them go ahead and
open up the glove compartment,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.200
because I have something
a little fascinating.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.081
And that's how I shared it
with you too, I believe?

00:20:34.081 --> 00:20:34.830
WILLIAM: Yes, yes.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.520
So they open the
glove compartment,

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.480
and then I think
at that point, you

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.600
have a lot of
influence and control

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.690
over what they put down.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.435
The next sentences
will really dictate

00:20:43.435 --> 00:20:45.810
what they think about and then
what they commit to paper.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.560
So do you try to introduce
a little bit of bias,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.205
or do you really
say, hey, it's yours.

00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:51.080
Do whatever you want.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.980
ZIA AHMED: I like to
call them guidelines,

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.690
and those guidelines
are very broad.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.840
They're very open
ended, but I also

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.210
feel that a lot of people,
that for some reason,

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.970
it adds pressure or it
starts to trouble people

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.875
when I introduce these
broad guidelines.

00:21:05.875 --> 00:21:07.520
And the guidelines
are very simple.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.510
No lyrics, no
quotes, no cliches,

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.310
because cliches are useless
and lyrics I can't publish.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.428
Right?

00:21:15.428 --> 00:21:16.700
WILLIAM: True, right.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.000
ZIA AHMED: And the idea
is to leave something

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.250
to the next person
about who you are

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.380
or a little something
that you'd like to share,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.790
broadly speaking.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.490
After that, it's just a matter
of limiting the amount space

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.660
that you use, because those
diaries are beautiful,

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.990
and I hate wastage.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.431
So I don't want
people to waste space,

00:21:40.431 --> 00:21:42.930
and that's basically-- those
are the broad guidelines that I

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.110
give.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.180
And from there, what they
write might be influenced

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.106
by the conversation I had prior
to sharing the diary with them.

00:21:52.106 --> 00:21:52.980
Does that make sense?

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.450
WILLIAM: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.590
So for those in the audience
considering starting a company,

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.750
myself included, what was it
like to be simultaneously kind

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.620
of the entrepreneur/CEO of
your Camry and this project?

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.940
ZIA AHMED: I'm glad put
it in the same category

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.590
as entrepreneurship, but I
did self publish the book,

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.800
so it's been actually a
very fascinating journey

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.440
from that angle as well.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.430
So it's not only a
matter of the content

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:24.100
that I was trying to
influence and gather

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.560
but the self publishing route
is also a very fascinating one,

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.940
which I feel that I
speak to a lot of people,

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.850
and they're always
telling me, hey dude,

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.107
I want to publish a book too.

00:22:34.107 --> 00:22:35.440
I want to self publish the book.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.460
What's the process?

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.050
What's the route?

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.900
And really, for
me, it was I wanted

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.940
to do what I feel a lot of
people do, which is the agent,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.500
the publisher, figuring
out, taking that route.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.770
That route is a complete
myth, and it doesn't work, OK?

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:56.850
At least, in my humble opinion.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.070
What I did was for the first
quarter of this project,

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.640
I was looking for an agent.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.210
That didn't work out, so I was
going to publishers directly,

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:09.920
and they were giving me
feedback like find an agent,

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.800
or they're telling me things
like the amount of time

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:20.380
it takes to get from us to a
bookshelf is about three years.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.880
And that's just
something that would

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.420
make the information outdated.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.570
It wouldn't be a
fascinating project.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:28.890
There were so many reasons
for me not to do that.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.740
So I basically went on
Thumbtack and Craigslist,

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.430
found a team of
people, figured out

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.310
how we could break down
every single process.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.770
I found people to be
part of that-- an art

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.790
director, a production
manager, an editor, all

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:48.600
of those elements, they're
all listed over here as well,

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.670
the My Team.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.560
So I actually wanted to
take this opportunity

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.800
to give a shout out to them.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.580
So Sam James Levine,
the Creative Director.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.350
The editor was Marc Capobianco.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.310
The Production Manager was
Hillary Savage, and the person

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.340
who is currently running
the social media,

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:09.140
if you guys do go on Facebook,
Twitter, any of these things,

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.610
Ashley Ryon is who's running
the social media wing of it.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.980
And a buddy of mine,
funder, and childhood friend

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.747
who kind of supported the
project, Hasan [? Sufi. ?]

00:24:18.747 --> 00:24:20.330
None of those guys
are here right now,

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.380
but they were all
part of this project,

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.690
and they played a pretty vital
role somehow or the other.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.967
WILLIAM: What obstacles
did you overcome going down

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.050
the self publishing track?

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.580
ZIA AHMED: For sure.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.920
It was figuring out--
managing a team.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.910
Because I wasn't just
sending the right amount

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.930
of instructions to
the right person,

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.620
working with them
collaboratively,

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.380
and then kind of coming
out with a product which

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.190
suits my requirements, which I
wanted to put my name behind,

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.546
and something that I
feel is a work of art.

00:24:51.546 --> 00:24:54.045
It's something that I feel a
lot of other people appreciate,

00:24:54.045 --> 00:24:57.740
and I hope you guys do.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:01.150
And also to kind of
start something, not just

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:04.070
start a company--
which I technically

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.910
had to register a company
to self publish it--

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:10.760
but also to try and
start a movement.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.720
I feel that over the past
six, eight months when

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.370
this project got a little bit
of visibility in the media,

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.295
a lot of other drivers
from across the country

00:25:18.295 --> 00:25:21.350
have actually come
out to me and wanted

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:24.140
to reach out for either
doing something similar

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.650
or reaching out
about other ideas

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.690
that we could potentially
collaborate on.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:33.120
In fact, we have one right now
in the crowd too, so Grant.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.630
Yeah, he is another
one of the Lyft drivers

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.220
who is running a very
fascinating documentary

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.190
project as well.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:44.575
So if this creates enough
excitement for other people

00:25:44.575 --> 00:25:45.950
to start doing
their own thing, I

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.420
think that's a
pretty good start.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.420
WILLIAM: Yeah, so it ties
into my next question.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.510
Where is this project headed?

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.100
What's next?

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.560
ZIA AHMED: So there are
different elements and angles

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.270
that I want to take
in this project.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:03.360
So not only is it the
natural progression

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.970
of making a Volume 2 or finding
other drivers to get it--

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.235
and if you are a driver,
please do reach out.

00:26:11.235 --> 00:26:13.310
The project is, again,
of course called

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.960
"Lyft Me Up San
Francisco," and I'm

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.380
looking for other
people who would

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.322
be interested in
compiling these messages.

00:26:20.322 --> 00:26:21.780
Because one of the
fun things would

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:27.040
be to see what responses
people would leave if they were

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.950
influenced by somebody else.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.500
So still leave it
broad and open,

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.476
but if there was another
influence behind this,

00:26:33.476 --> 00:26:34.600
perhaps it'll be different.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.649
And I want to see what
that would look like.

00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:38.940
So that's one of the directions
that I do want to take.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.789
So potentially in the
form of a Volume 2.

00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:44.330
I don't know when
that's going to be.

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.260
That's probably going to be
after a lot of people buy this.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.930
So please buy it, OK?

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:55.460
That's very important for a
very tiny, very small, start up.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.990
So please be part
of the project.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.247
It would be great
if you supported it.

00:26:59.247 --> 00:27:01.080
Even if it's just telling
somebody about it,

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.810
not just getting it,
but Facebook, Twitter,

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.066
all those things actually work.

00:27:06.066 --> 00:27:08.065
WILLIAM: So Volume 2 will
be the Google edition.

00:27:08.065 --> 00:27:09.390
Is that fair to say?

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.348
ZIA AHMED: I'm so down.

00:27:10.348 --> 00:27:11.631
Like let's talk about that.

00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:12.630
Bring them to the table.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.690
I'd love to get more
feedback for you guys.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:20.280
And what's also interesting
is that-- I've been doing this

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.300
for about a year now, and when
the word started getting out

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.830
and people started to know that
somebody was doing something

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.163
like this, a lot of people
would get in the car and say,

00:27:28.163 --> 00:27:29.397
hey, I've heard about this.

00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:30.980
So they would also
come with something

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.896
in the back their mind,
thinking that, oh, I'm

00:27:32.896 --> 00:27:34.317
going to write so and so.

00:27:34.317 --> 00:27:36.400
They would have actually
already thought about it.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.290
If they had seen
their friend, if they

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:40.190
would have heard their
friend talk about it,

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.820
or they would come into the
car and they would be like,

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.830
oh I know this.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.570
I'm going to write
something potentially

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.440
a little bit different.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.550
WILLIAM: In the book--

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.120
ZIA AHMED: Yes, in the book.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.270
WILLIAM: --knowing that
their friends may--

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:51.770
ZIA AHMED: Yes.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:52.279
WILLIAM: OK.

00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:53.070
ZIA AHMED: Exactly.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.945
WILLIAM: Interesting.

00:27:53.945 --> 00:27:56.385
ZIA AHMED: And this way, if
we could get more people,

00:27:56.385 --> 00:27:58.760
maybe that'll be an interesting
thing to observe as well.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.740
WILLIAM: Sure.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.770
ZIA AHMED: But I would
love to have a whole Google

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.160
kind of project.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.670
Anybody else out
there as well, that

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.440
would be really fun to work
on, and we can find out

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.474
whatever your objectives,
criteria, requirements are,

00:28:12.474 --> 00:28:13.640
and then we can sort it out.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.840
WILLIAM: Yeah, the
voice of the people.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.340
ZIA AHMED: Absolutely.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.610
WILLIAM: So at this point
when someone gets in your car,

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:18.440
and I know I
actually met someone

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.047
at a party a couple weeks
ago who had ridden with you,

00:28:20.047 --> 00:28:21.755
and I thought it was
a small world thing,

00:28:21.755 --> 00:28:23.747
but do people kind of know now?

00:28:23.747 --> 00:28:25.330
Oh, you're the--
I've heard about you.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:25.720
You're the--

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.000
ZIA AHMED: It doesn't
happen that often.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.958
WILLIAM: --Lyft driver.

00:28:27.958 --> 00:28:29.760
ZIA AHMED: It
happens probably, I

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:36.772
want to say once-- let's
say twice or thrice a month.

00:28:36.772 --> 00:28:41.490
So that's still better
than not, right?

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.586
I like that.

00:28:42.586 --> 00:28:43.190
It's kind of--

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.273
WILLIAM: It's catching on.

00:28:44.273 --> 00:28:46.490
ZIA AHMED: It is.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.940
I want to go back to like
the future of the project

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.720
and where we're
going to take this.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.780
So not only do I want
to go ahead and work

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.770
on potentially a
second volume of this,

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.700
but I want to expand
it in other directions

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.720
as well in the form
of a mini web series.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.180
I think that every
decade has had

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:08.770
a very popular and successful
television show about this,

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.340
and I wanted to start
at least from the web

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.810
and create a tiny web series
about these little stories.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.690
And it's not just these
stories, but there

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.750
are stories from across
the country and thousands

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.650
of drivers and millions of
rides that we can actually

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:25.230
take, put them
together and start

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.340
a tiny little kind
of sharing thing

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.000
to build community, to develop
empathy, understand each other,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.810
and film that.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.510
It would kind of interesting.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:38.130
So that's one of the angles that
I want to do for the future.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:44.530
Another very interesting angle
is the whole app version of it.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.470
We were thinking about
gamifying this process or kind

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.560
of thinking about how we
could take this from this

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.010
to a process in your phone.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.590
We don't have the
solution for these things

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.454
yet to capture everything,
but that is something

00:29:59.454 --> 00:30:00.370
that we're working on.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.578
One of my team members is
over here right now as well

00:30:02.578 --> 00:30:04.180
that hopefully will work on.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.010
WILLIAM: Perfect.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:05.600
Great.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.970
And I know, speaking
of the web series,

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:08.165
I know that you had a video.

00:30:08.165 --> 00:30:09.360
ZIA AHMED: Yeah.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.280
WILLIAM: Would you
like to share it now?

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.100
ZIA AHMED: Absolutely.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.350
WILLIAM: I'm going to do that.

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:14.710
ZIA AHMED: So one of the
interesting things in the book,

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:16.470
kind of a little
world, is that people

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.680
are making book trailers.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.196
So recently we shot a
book trailer as well,

00:30:22.196 --> 00:30:23.945
and we're trying to
get the word out there

00:30:23.945 --> 00:30:27.180
and trying to get other people
to understand the project

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.910
and get this idea
out there as well.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.197
That's what we're going to
hopefully show right now.

00:30:31.197 --> 00:30:32.171
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.590
-I love my boyfriend,
but he sucks at sex.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.650
-Don't cook bacon naked.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.860
-Have as many one-night
stands as possible.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.110
Never get brunch the next day.

-San Francisco is like James

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.670
You're always like WTF?

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.160
-In May 2012, my apartment and
everything I owned burned down.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.620
Everyone survived.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.770
Life went on, and we have
made every day count since.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.210
Be thankful for life.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.600
-I hit a guy with a car when
I was 16, and I didn't stop.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.197
I think about it every day.

00:31:20.197 --> 00:31:21.530
-I look at vaginas for a living.

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:22.250

-Today someone told me, you made
me smile, you made me laugh,

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.810
you made dream.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.920
I think that was the best
compliment I've ever received.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.380
This journal made me
laugh, smile, and dream.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:38.760
Thank you.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.590
My name is Zia, and I
started this project,

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.839
"Lyft Me Up San Francisco,"
and that kind of gives you

00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:44.205
the idea of what it's about.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.330
WILLIAM: All right, thank you.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.288
ZIA AHMED: That was it.

00:31:53.288 --> 00:31:55.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.390
So a quick minute
and a half, I want

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.900
to say, of-- under a
minute and a half trailer.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.995
This is something that
we're working on as well,

00:32:03.995 --> 00:32:07.090
and that's kind of where I'm
taking this-- the direction

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:07.840
that we're taking.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.548
WILLIAM: Perfect.

00:32:08.548 --> 00:32:09.160
Great.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:14.320
And I know that as part
of launching a book,

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.300
you have to build
this, build the buzz,

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.200
so where did you start,
and what kind of led you

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.760
to where you are now?

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.350
How did you get
the ball rolling?

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.590
ZIA AHMED: I think from a
visibility and awareness

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.840
point of view?

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.673
WILLIAM: Sure, yeah.

00:32:25.673 --> 00:32:27.940
ZIA AHMED: So a lot
of people-- it's

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.820
been pretty fascinating
that a lot of people

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:36.760
during my ride who were either
writers for other publications,

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.219
I met a lot of them, and
that's where they're like, hey,

00:32:40.219 --> 00:32:41.010
this a great story.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:41.634
Let's cover it.

00:32:41.634 --> 00:32:44.360
So I've had several people--
I've had the "Huffington Post"

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:44.870
cover it.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.460
They were the first people
that actually got in the car,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.576
and the guy loved it.

00:32:48.576 --> 00:32:50.450
Andrew his name was,
and he totally loved it,

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:52.130
and he's like, all right,
we're going to cover this.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:53.880
The next day, there
was a story out there.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.600
I'm like, this is great.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.267
We also had a lot
of-- KCBS covered it.

00:32:58.267 --> 00:32:59.850
There's some neat
coverage over there.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.308
And it's just been really people
who are getting in the car

00:33:02.308 --> 00:33:04.410
and really liking it,
such as yourself as well.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:06.952
So a big shout out and thank
you again to everybody who's

00:33:06.952 --> 00:33:08.160
been supporting this project.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.440
It's been super helpful,
and there was no other way.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.940
It's been a very organic
growth kind of a process

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.720
that people who are
experiencing it,

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.130
they like it so much
that they're actually

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.360
word of mouth pushing it
forward, which is always

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.767
the best way to cover something
or gain movement and traction.

00:33:23.767 --> 00:33:24.350
WILLIAM: Yeah.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:25.470
Absolutely.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.550
And with this web
series, I know that there

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.800
was a show you were telling
me about in the '90s which

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.640
had a taxicab confessional
or something, which

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.990
had a taxi driver and a camera
and just passengers caught

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.900
in a candid moment.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.710
So what do you kind of foresee
your potential web series

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.510
looking like, and what
would the format be?

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.426
ZIA AHMED: Absolutely.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.750
Every decade has had
an interesting kind

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.210
of transportation
show, and this is

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:51.611
the natural logical
progression of that.

00:33:51.611 --> 00:33:54.110
And that's what we're trying
to do as well through capturing

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:56.240
these little stories
and creating characters

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.150
out of them.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.880
So what I want to do and what
we're looking for right now

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.560
is people who can help
develop these characters.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.457
And I want to create a mini web
series like "High Maintenance."

00:34:06.457 --> 00:34:07.790
Are you guys familiar with that?

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.081
Have you guys ever heard of it?

00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:12.510
So it was this interesting
show about a weed delivery

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:14.109
guy in Brooklyn.

00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:15.734
The show was called
"High Maintenance."

00:34:15.734 --> 00:34:16.817
It was actually brilliant.

00:34:16.817 --> 00:34:20.290
It started like 2000--
seriously-- 2011,

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:24.210
and what it was about it
was it was about the story

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:27.949
was actually building
characters around the people

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:30.010
that the weed delivery
guy was interacting with.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.340
So it wasn't about him.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.480
It wasn't about his story.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.021
It was about all
the other characters

00:34:34.021 --> 00:34:35.080
that you come across.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.100
They were tied together
by the delivery guy,

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.880
and that's kind of
the story of that,

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.500
and I want to build on that as
well but from a transportation

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.600
point of view, although
that's a very raw idea.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.880
We're still trying to
find and fine tune that.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.940
So there will probably
be several experiments

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.920
that we do before we
find the right one.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:00.190
But that's, again, when you
launch any product or any start

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:01.790
up or any company
like that, you have

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.560
to kind of see what
the project looks like,

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.447
what resonates well with people,
and then build on that too.

00:35:07.447 --> 00:35:08.280
WILLIAM: Absolutely.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.490
And this is an
unrelated question to,

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:11.990
but I'm curious to
get your insight,

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.970
because you mentioned seeing
this cross-section of society.

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.190
Do you agree that San
Francisco is changing,

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.680
and where do you
think it's headed,

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.560
and are you excited about
that direction overall,

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.260
based on just the wide variety
of people that you interact

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.410
with and meet on a daily basis?

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.726
ZIA AHMED: So it's
definitely changing.

00:35:32.726 --> 00:35:34.850
I think that there could
be a few-- because there's

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:39.710
a lot of the reality is that
a lot of people are unhappy,

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.930
and that is slightly
unfortunate, especially

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:46.030
because of the diversity,
the disparity perhaps,

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:48.092
and that we all
know about and see.

00:35:48.092 --> 00:35:49.550
And I think somebody
pointed it out

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:51.610
as well in one of
their messages.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:57.090
But I do feel that
there is more that

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:58.899
can be done from
everybody's side,

00:35:58.899 --> 00:36:00.940
even if it's a little
project such as this, which

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:04.640
is to build community,
develop empathy,

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.200
capture these different ideas
from across town, and then

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.710
showcase that, it becomes
like the voice of the people.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:15.160
And that's kind of what I'm
trying to achieve with this

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:19.080
and not just get one particular
person's point of view

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:23.652
or opinion but a broad range
of different types of people.

00:36:23.652 --> 00:36:24.360
WILLIAM: Perfect.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.625
I think that's a
great note to end on.

00:36:26.625 --> 00:36:28.250
So if there are any
audience questions,

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.829
I think we could
entertain those now.

00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:31.370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:32.080
Thanks for coming.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:32.955
ZIA AHMED: Thank you.

00:36:32.955 --> 00:36:34.260
Thank you for having me.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.180
AUDIENCE: We haven't talked
about the company at all.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.154
Does the company know
about this project?

00:36:39.154 --> 00:36:40.570
What is the company
doing with it?

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.720
I like it.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.970
WILLIAM: Somewhat intentional.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:43.594
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:43.594 --> 00:36:46.264
So probably intentional,
but can we talk about it?

00:36:46.264 --> 00:36:46.930
ZIA AHMED: Yeah.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:47.900
Let's talk about it.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.310
What do you want to know?

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.760
So they find the idea
kind of fascinating.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.362
They are interested,
and I have been

00:36:54.362 --> 00:36:55.820
trying to reach
out to them, trying

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.980
to get-- I have gotten
their attention,

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:03.430
but I feel that it's still very
young for not only them to come

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.610
on board and work with me
the way I want them to,

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.380
but I do feel that
this is something

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.840
that we will eventually
reach in the future.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.640
And they've got
some other-- they're

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.680
working on some incredible
other branding strategies.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.010
For example,
billboards and wrapping

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:19.800
buses in their corporate colors.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.394
So let's see when they decide
that this is a good idea.

00:37:22.394 --> 00:37:24.060
AUDIENCE: So have you
taken any measures

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.240
to make sure people
aren't copying your idea?

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:32.140
Because I can imagine
other drivers, specifically

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:35.468
people from the other
company that's not Lyft--

00:37:35.468 --> 00:37:36.968
WILLIAM: What company
would that be?

00:37:36.968 --> 00:37:38.420
Sidecar.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.721
Sidecar is the company.

00:37:40.721 --> 00:37:42.720
AUDIENCE: --could think
this is a great idea too

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.140
and maybe want to copy you?

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.100
ZIA AHMED: Yeah.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.000
I'm totally down for other
people doing this as well.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.070
I want other people to
come on board in all forms.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:52.380
Why do we need to limit this?

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.330
I don't want this just
to be about myself.

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:55.730
I want everybody to do it.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:38:00.010
I want you to create
whatever version of this

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.380
you want it to be.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.380
It'll be fun to see the other
directions that people take.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.800
I don't want it to
just be about myself.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.940
But I'm more than happy
to work with whoever

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:12.090
wants to, whether
it's the other company

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.192
or it's the other one
or whoever or wherever.

00:38:14.192 --> 00:38:16.400
We can always work together
on fascinating solutions,

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.992
but I don't want to
limit this to just me.

00:38:19.992 --> 00:38:21.700
And I want other people
to be part of it,

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.440
from capturing a
message point of view,

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.860
from whether they want
to do, I don't know,

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.115
however they see it.

00:38:28.115 --> 00:38:29.490
AUDIENCE: I just
have a question.

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.360
Did you get only
text or also drawings

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.480
and if you had drawing as
well, did the message differ

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.780
from the text?

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.790
Like are they more
oriented toward something

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.612
special, that they maybe
were more funny or whatever?

00:38:44.612 --> 00:38:45.570
ZIA AHMED: Interesting.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.650
So that's actually a
really good question.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.100
Thank you for pointing that out.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.590
What I've done in
the book was when

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:53.520
we had things hand
written in it,

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.014
so not only did I kind of scan
those and bring those over

00:38:56.014 --> 00:38:58.430
and to replicate in here, but
there are plenty of drawings

00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.950
as well.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:03.760
A lot of people have drawn
little sketches of people,

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.070
things that somebody drew.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.990
Once somebody drew
pictures of things

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:11.590
that they saw outside the
window as we were driving,

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.300
where we were at that time.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.250
Somebody actually
drew emojis, and we've

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.680
got plenty of those things.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.866
So I think, again,
that's a total range

00:39:21.866 --> 00:39:25.180
of different people's
thoughts and where

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.160
they were at that moment.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.840
WILLIAM: We have
"The Scream" as well,

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.190
if you're familiar with that--

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.090
ZIA AHMED: "The
Scream" is in there.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.480
WILLIAM: --masterpiece.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.900
The drawings are actually
some of the-- they're not only

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.830
the most eye-catching things,
because as you're flipping

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:37.371
through that's what
you see the most,

00:39:37.371 --> 00:39:39.250
but I think that they
are some of the most

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.280
poignant and fascinating
messages in the book.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.780
And it's incredible
how much you can

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.579
convey with just a
few lines on a page

00:39:46.579 --> 00:39:47.620
versus a whole paragraph.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.510
ZIA AHMED: For sure.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.560
And we're also very lucky
to be in San Francisco

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.806
where there is such a large
art community as well.

00:39:52.806 --> 00:39:53.930
There are so many students.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:55.380
I give rides to these too.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.830
It's amazing to talk to
these people as well.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:00.600
It's not just about
any particular things.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.270
There are so many fascinating
different ideas and things

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.700
that the first thing that
comes to somebody's mind,

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.211
seeing that depicted
is kind of awesome.

00:40:08.211 --> 00:40:09.710
AUDIENCE: So how
did you decide when

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:11.376
you were editing what
to put in the book

00:40:11.376 --> 00:40:13.704
and what not to put in the book?

00:40:13.704 --> 00:40:15.370
ZIA AHMED: That's
another good question,

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:20.920
and I was just thinking of
something that spoke to me,

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.380
something that either made
me understand something

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.930
about the person who was writing
it, know a little bit more

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:30.594
about them, learn something
about the city perhaps,

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.260
a little bit of
history, quite literally

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.600
anything that actually
spoke to me, apart

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.240
from the lyrics, the
quotes, and the cliches,

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.620
and we got tons of cliches.

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.550
I should just come out
with the book of cliches.

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.144
And there are so many.

00:40:44.144 --> 00:40:45.560
WILLIAM: Like mine
probably, yeah.

00:40:47.819 --> 00:40:49.360
ZIA AHMED: Shall we
talk about yours?

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.818
WILLIAM: Well,
after the questions,

00:40:50.818 --> 00:40:54.284
yeah, we can dive into whatever
nonsense I put in there, yeah.

00:40:54.284 --> 00:40:55.700
ZIA AHMED: But
that was the thing.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.950
Whatever spoke to me is what
I was really looking for,

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:01.160
something that could
help understand something

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.910
about the person, the
moment they were in,

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.660
or something about the city.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.160
But another really
interesting thing

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.390
that I do kind of
recommend or emphasize on

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:13.430
is that if you do read
the book, and if you

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.716
do, there are so many
things you'll see in this

00:41:15.716 --> 00:41:17.090
that you will
definitely not have

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:20.705
heard about-- little places to
go, things to see, some ideas.

00:41:20.705 --> 00:41:22.910
And whenever you do
come across that idea,

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.320
I always found it fascinating
to figure it out, Google

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.770
that-- you should totally
Google it-- and figure that out.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.970
Perhaps put it on your list of
places to go next in the city.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:33.910
Hit it up.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:37.220
AUDIENCE: So you say you wrote
it for the next rider, right?

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.010
Does the reaction of
the next rider also

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:41.410
have an impact on what
you decided to publish?

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:42.660
ZIA AHMED: Oh, yeah, for sure.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:43.890
That a great question.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:46.030
That's the reason
why I kept doing it,

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:50.910
because of the fact that
it's so entertaining.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:52.920
It's entertaining,
like doing this, just

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:58.610
seeing people's reactions,
just not only about, hey,

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.720
I have something in my glove
compartment from a stranger,

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.280
but also the things
that they were reading

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.950
in it, the presentation
of the diary,

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:10.680
just watching that was
really thrilling for me.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.387
AUDIENCE: And no
one got offended?

00:42:12.387 --> 00:42:13.970
ZIA AHMED: You know,
it's fascinating.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:18.160
I think out of about
4,000 or 5,000 people,

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.845
I didn't offend
anybody from the book.

00:42:20.845 --> 00:42:22.220
I'm sure there
are other reasons,

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.660
but not through the book.

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:30.050
and I think that it did
kind of-- after I qualified

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.320
the passenger-- if I
did share it with them,

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.660
they all cooperated very
nicely, and they let

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.344
something kind of interesting.

00:42:38.344 --> 00:42:40.010
AUDIENCE: So I have
a question just kind

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.180
of going off of your point.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.719
Have you ever
thought about, and I

00:42:43.719 --> 00:42:45.760
know you were sort of
talking about this earlier,

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.110
have ever thought about asking
someone a direct question?

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.360
For example, you were
saying how lot of people

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.200
put in their favorite place
to go in San Francisco,

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.160
and you can discover a
lot of things that way.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.700
Have you ever thought
about just like one day

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.620
you ask every passenger, hey,
where is your favorite place

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.260
to go when you need like alone
time in San Francisco or sort

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.700
of compiling
questions like that,

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.015
or do you like to keep it open
ended and like why or why not?

00:43:13.015 --> 00:43:14.390
ZIA AHMED: No, I
think that's one

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:18.780
of the interesting future
side tracks that we can do,

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:23.550
but at this point I feel
like leaving it open as well

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.786
pressurizes a lot of people.

00:43:24.786 --> 00:43:26.410
They're like, this
is so much pressure.

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:28.362
I'm just asking you
to write a few lines,

00:43:28.362 --> 00:43:29.820
but that's an
interesting direction

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.570
that we might actually
take in the future.

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:33.740
I'm just not sure at this point.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.320
And how long we can do that,
how quickly we can come out

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.550
with something,
show some results.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.720
So perhaps that'll be
something we do later on.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.320
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that you kind of decide

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:49.610
whether or not you want to
offer your book to people.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:53.700
Do you think that some
people are, by definition,

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.280
more interesting than others?

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.454
Do you feel like maybe you
missed out on something?

00:43:57.454 --> 00:43:58.370
ZIA AHMED: You got me.

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:04.070
Yeah, I do think
that sometimes there

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:06.720
are some things that are--
I'm fascinated by technology,

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.820
I'm fascinated by the arts,
I'm fascinated by these things.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.140
So if somebody mentions
some of these buzzwords,

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.640
then I'm definitely listening.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.160
But the idea is
that this has also

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.952
been a learning phase for
me that I want everybody

00:44:23.952 --> 00:44:24.660
to be part of it.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.840
I look for as little
of a reason to ask them

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.402
to do this as possible,
but sometimes somebody

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.860
is just having a bad day and
you don't want to bother them,

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.180
and this is just a
reality of the situation.

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:39.260
And I don't mean to be intrusive
at all either, by the way.

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:43.910
Like I'm not just making
sure you do my thing.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:47.740
So I'm trying to assess
first, understand, and then

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.531
hopefully get some valuable
feedback from the person.

00:44:50.531 --> 00:44:52.530
AUDIENCE: Because I think
also that if someone's

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:54.050
having a bad day,
maybe that could

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:55.787
be the most impactful
if they look at it

00:44:55.787 --> 00:44:57.120
or if they write something down.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.530
ZIA AHMED: 100%.

00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:59.030
Absolutely.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.300
That's happened so many
times, like it's actually

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.010
not just the reaction
that I get from people,

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:07.450
but the way people's day
actually turns around.

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:09.840
It's like you can see
their faces light up,

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.640
and that actually
means a lot to me.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.640
That's kind of why I'm
still doing this project,

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.240
and those are also
some of the reasons

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.950
why I feel that
continuing the project

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:20.490
is also kind of important,
because it does actually

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:22.390
help a lot of people.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:24.932
They've called it
therapeutic, yeah,

00:45:24.932 --> 00:45:26.640
that they got the
opportunity to do that.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.395
So you're totally right.

00:45:30.395 --> 00:45:31.895
AUDIENCE: What did
you leave behind?

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:32.300
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.450
I want to see that.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.050
WILLIAM: I have no--
I do not remember.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.860
You asked me this.

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.222
You remember mine more or less.

00:45:38.222 --> 00:45:40.430
I don't remember mine, and
someone else asked me what

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:41.694
I wrote, and I have no idea.

00:45:41.694 --> 00:45:42.860
ZIA AHMED: It's in the book.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.090
You have to buy it.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.590
WILLIAM: It's not in the book.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:47.610
I didn't make the cut.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:49.380
I didn't make the cut.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:52.365
If you could-- presumably it's
in one of those notebooks.

00:45:52.365 --> 00:45:54.450
I don't know if you
remember even the page.

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:55.450
ZIA AHMED: That's
going to be a trick.

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:57.116
It's going to be a
tall order for sure--

00:45:57.116 --> 00:45:57.736
WILLIAM: Yeah.

00:45:57.736 --> 00:45:59.860
ZIA AHMED: --to actually
find that specific message

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:00.530
at this point.

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:01.510
AUDIENCE: It was
something beautiful.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:02.385
ZIA AHMED: Wonderful.

00:46:02.385 --> 00:46:02.950
It was great.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:03.720
WILLIAM: It was very--

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.410
ZIA AHMED: But it
was interesting,

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:06.160
because I remember
when I got William,

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.930
the interesting
part was, there was

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.820
some-- which conference was it?

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.180
It was a Google-related thing?

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:16.239
WILLIAM: It was a mindfulness
conference near Yerba Buena.

00:46:16.239 --> 00:46:17.030
ZIA AHMED: Exactly.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:21.390
And he got a Lyft line, and
he was like five minutes late.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.012
WILLIAM: And more often
than I care to admit, yes.

00:46:24.012 --> 00:46:25.470
ZIA AHMED: But then
when he started

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:27.550
talking about this
mindfulness project and a lot

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:28.530
of interesting
things, that's kind

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.071
of exactly what I'm trying to
do with this project, where I'm

00:46:31.071 --> 00:46:34.490
trying to get people out of
that and be a little bit more

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:36.740
present with the fact that
there's a guy sitting right

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.490
next to you.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.070
Say hello, speak to him and
understand, like perhaps,

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:41.057
you know?

00:46:41.057 --> 00:46:43.390
And obviously those are things
that I'm fascinated with,

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.410
and I like those things,
I appreciate them,

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:49.360
which is when I shared
the project with William.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.340
And, again, we've been
in touch ever since.

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.760
He's also suggested
interesting directions,

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.010
and thank you once again
for setting this up.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:57.970
It was super great.

00:46:57.970 --> 00:46:58.660
WILLIAM: Well, thank
you Zia for coming.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.050
AUDIENCE: We've got
one more question too.

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.349
WILLIAM: Oh, and we have a--

00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:02.140
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.266
AUDIENCE: Just a question,
curious regarding

00:47:05.266 --> 00:47:06.390
your process of doing this.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.760
Do you read them
right after they

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.970
write them, or do you go home--

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:09.400
ZIA AHMED: No.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.180
AUDIENCE: --and
get a glass wine,

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.720
or do you wait like a month?

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.280
ZIA AHMED: That's a good idea.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.220
No, that's actually a
pretty good question.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.990
So the way the
process actually works

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.220
is when the next
person-- so when

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.390
the person writes in the book,
they don't tell me what it is.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:25.490
They quietly write it, they
put the pen back on the page,

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:27.530
they close it up,
they put it away.

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:31.510
And the next person who I ask to
read it, they read it out loud,

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.510
and that's when I even
here it for the first time.

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:39.890
So that anonymity allows people
to talk about really insightful

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:44.010
things, and not only from the
silly profanity and things

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:47.860
but also to lots of profound,
meaningful, personal things

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.010
that people have shared.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.635
WILLIAM: Great.

00:47:49.635 --> 00:47:51.840
Well, this is "Lyft Me
Up," available on Amazon

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.590
and in the trunk of Zia's Camry.

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:56.786
Thank you all for coming,
and the best of luck.

00:47:56.786 --> 00:47:57.660
ZIA AHMED: Thank you.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.690
Thank you for having me.

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:00.240
