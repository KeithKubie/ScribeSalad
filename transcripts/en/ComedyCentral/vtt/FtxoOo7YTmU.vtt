00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:03.596
(electronic music)

00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:13.379
(alarm clock buzzing)

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.426
- How y'all doin', we are the Lucas bros,

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:19.481
- Yeah man.

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:21.242
- He's one Lucas bro, I'm the other one.

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:23.749
This is the morning show for people

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.496
just waking up like us.

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:27.529
- These are our homies, I guess.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.030
- Yo, we had a wild night
yesterday man, it was crazy.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.452
We played some video
games, smoked some weed,

00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:34.160
it was a good time.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.486
Speaking of weed man, I think
we should be the first people

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:39.099
to bring an actual weed dealer on a show.

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:40.654
- Not a fake one, not an actor,

00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:42.609
this is a real drug dealer.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.618
Brought to you by Comedy Central.

00:00:44.618 --> 00:00:47.572
(harp music)

00:00:47.572 --> 00:00:48.405
- They gave us some money,

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:51.133
we figured let's bring
on a real drug dealer.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:51.966
Why not?

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:52.799
- That's what we gotta do.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.637
(fast violin music)

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:55.987
- We're trying to get a
drug dealer to come in,

00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:57.516
do you think you can give me the number

00:00:57.516 --> 00:00:58.728
to one of your drug dealers?

00:00:58.728 --> 00:00:59.635
(woman laughs)

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:00.998
- You need an actual weed dealer?

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:01.831
- Yeah.

00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:03.050
- Not in this neighborhood honey,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.940
I'm not gonna give my name.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.023
- We need a weed dealer man,

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.032
do you think you can get us a weed dealer?

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:06.865
- Dealer?!

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:08.209
(censored expletives)

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:09.042
For real?

00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:09.875
- Absolutely.

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:11.500
- That'll be my son, he don't care.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.031
- Alright, can you give us his number?

00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:17.384
(phone beeping)

00:01:17.384 --> 00:01:18.842
- There we go, we got it.

00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:20.514
- That's for real though.

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:23.392
(phone ringing)

00:01:23.392 --> 00:01:25.091
- [Phone Voice] Hello?

00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:26.029
- Yo, what's up man?

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:28.078
We just got your number,
we wanted to know if

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:31.410
we could have you come down
and deliver us some stuff.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.306
It's a really special request man.

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:36.054
(reggae music)

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:39.076
- We want to bring him out,
bring out Luigi the weed man,

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:40.355
the weed dealer.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:42.403
- Welcome to the show, how you doing?

00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:44.057

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.088
- First thing's first,
let's get this right out.

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:51.267
- What is your best selling product?

00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:54.668
- Weed wise, it's South
Alaskan Thunder Fuck.

00:01:54.668 --> 00:01:57.433
- What makes it so unique, the strain?

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.870
- Yeah, it just fucks you up real hard.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.992

00:02:00.992 --> 00:02:01.825
- Right away.

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:03.752
- How did you get into selling weed?

00:02:03.752 --> 00:02:04.669
- Smoking weed.

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:05.743

00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:07.218

00:02:07.218 --> 00:02:08.689
- So, we want to take some
questions from the audience

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.150
real quick, you know.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.364

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:12.784

00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:15.211

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:18.850
- Well we were gonna do that anyway.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.747
- We'll exchange numbers.

00:02:20.747 --> 00:02:22.169
- Yeah for sure.

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.312
- Luigi, thank you for
coming on the show man,

00:02:24.312 --> 00:02:25.253
we appreciate that you're-

00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:26.086
- No problem.

00:02:26.086 --> 00:02:27.261
- A drug dealer out there
in the streets hustling.

00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:28.896
We appreciate that.

00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:30.510

(harp music)

00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:37.281
- We're gonna roll a joint now.

00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:38.114

00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:39.046
- Thank you Viacom.

00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:41.046
