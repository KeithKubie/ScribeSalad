MATTHEW LIEBERMAN:
Well, thank you.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.850
It is great to be
with all of you today.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.790
Luke, thanks for introducing
me and also just inviting

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.292
me here to be with all of you.

00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:18.000
To those of you--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.170
I've heard there are
people streaming right now.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.390
That's what I look
like, but I can't

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.390
give a talk for 45 minutes
with myself behind me

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.270
the whole time.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.695
So apparently when this
goes up on YouTube,

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:33.570
they'll integrate it.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.241
And people there can watch
me and not just the slides.

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:37.740
But if you're
streaming, you're just

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.910
going to get the slides and
my voice from here on out.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.650
So I'm a social neuroscientist.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.450
I have been looking at
people's brains, mostly using

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.620
MRI scanners, for about 20 years
now, a little longer than 20

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.070
years.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.120
And at some point
around 10, 12 years ago,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.670
I started getting
invited to come

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.544
speak to different
business-related groups.

00:01:02.544 --> 00:01:03.960
And actually, a
bunch of the talks

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.460
were at Oracle early on and
other leadership organizations.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.820
And so it got me thinking
about, what on earth

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.090
does my work have to say
that's relevant to business,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.030
to thinking about how
the social brain is

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.830
doing its thing at work.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.240
And so part of what I
think about is how do we

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.450
promote well-being,
productivity, happiness--

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.350
all these things that you
want to see more of at work?

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.290
And to do this, you
basically need a good model,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.640
a good theory of what motivates
and drives human beings.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.434
And so I think that the
inherited wisdom we've had

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:44.100
for hundreds of years--
you can't really

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.860
do much better than Thomas
Hobbes, who summed it up

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.820
in a single sentence.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.660
"Man has no other end,
in all his actions,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.110
than his private self-interest."

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.380
So we get as much good stuff
as we can for as little

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.630
work, as little
pain as possible.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.550
And if you want to see
evidence of this, one easy way

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.870
to see this is to go to a game
that economists developed,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.710
I think, back in the late '80s--
maybe it was the early '90s.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.640
No, it was earlier.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.840
It was the '80s. --called
the prisoner's dilemma.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.770
And I'm sure some of you are
familiar with the prisoner's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.460
dilemma.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.890
I won't describe all
the details of it.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.780
The key things you
need to know is

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.240
that typically two
people are playing

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.500
with or against each other.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.470
They never meet each
other, and they are never

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.710
going to meet each other.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.800
They typically play
one round of the game,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.340
so there's no concern
with reputation.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.040
And the key thing about
the way you play the game

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.770
is that your outcomes
are interdependent.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.310
So the way you play affects
both your outcomes and the other

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.090
person's.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.610
And the same is true
for them as well.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.890
And so there's two ways
you can play the game.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.470
You can play the
game selfishly, where

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.150
you try to maximize
the amount of money

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.780
you'll take for yourself.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.930
And it is definitively
going to come

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.380
at the expense of less
money for the other person.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.270
And the other option is to play
in a more communal sort of way,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.310
where you try to maximize
the amount of money

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.250
that you and the other person
are going to earn jointly.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.280
But that will definitely
come at the expense of you

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.170
getting less money personally.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.120
These are the two options.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.370
And in line with
economists' predictions,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.670
the vast majority of people
play this game selfishly.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.000
They go and say, I'll take
the most money for myself,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.320
thank you very much.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.090
And so games like this give
rise to the view of human nature

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.900
as being something
like Homo economicus,

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.820
something like that,
where we're basically

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.100
rationally
self-interested creatures,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.230
where we're
fundamentally selfish,

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.240
we try not to exert
too much effort,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.750
we can be reasonably
rational in some contexts,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.960
and we pursue wealth and other
material gains for ourselves.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.930
And that's what's
been shown in hundreds

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.470
and hundreds of iterations
of this game, the prisoner's

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.280
dilemma.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.380
But there's a
version of this game

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.560
that you are probably not
familiar with that I think

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.510
is an interesting contrast.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.562
So actually, it's
the exact same game.

00:04:12.562 --> 00:04:14.020
So in this version
of the game, you

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.640
have the exact same
rules described

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.010
to you word for word the same.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.769
And you play the game
exactly the same way.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.530
But at the start of the game
when they're introducing

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.270
the rules, instead of
describing or defining

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.330
the game one way or another,
in this particular version

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.220
of the game, they
say, today you're

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.740
going to be playing
the community game.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.440
And then they explain
the exact same rules

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.020
as what is normally taking
place in the prisoner's dilemma.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.960
And when you do
this, the percentage

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.260
of people who play selfishly
drops precipitously.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.840
And suddenly now,
almost everybody-- well,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.580
3/4 of people--

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.830
suddenly now play
communally and try

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.600
to do what's best for the group.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.910
And so in addition to
suggesting that human beings are

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.090
exquisitely sensitive to context
and situational pressures

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.750
and so on, what it
also may suggest

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.020
is that we are more than
just Homo economicus.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.310
We are also Homo socialis--

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.010
that we may have these
intrinsic social concerns

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.260
and that what we're
looking for is

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.020
when we're supposed to
demonstrate these motives

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.990
and when we're supposed to
demonstrate those motives

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.370
and that we have both of
these and we use both.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.000
I'm not trying to suggest
we're not selfish creatures.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.600
We are.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.060
But we are not only
selfish creatures

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.740
is part of what I'll argue.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.360
So for the time I
have with you, I'm

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.620
going to try to do three things.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.224
The first thing I'm going to
try to do is present to you

00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:44.890
some of the neuroscience
data that we've

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.310
collected in an
attempt to prove to you

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.340
that our ability and our
skills at being social

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.830
is not just another
program we learn like how

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.900
to play chess or algebra.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.490
Those are things
that we can learn

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.615
because we have this great
prefrontal cortex that's

00:05:59.615 --> 00:06:03.760
super flexible and can learn
any new rule-based kind of thing

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.910
if it's useful for
us to learn it.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.710
But instead, what
I'm going to suggest

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.320
is that our social
operating system

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.930
is part of the basic
components of who

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.990
we are as mammals, that all
mammals actually share this

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.470
and we have plenty
of it as well.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.450
If I convince you of
that-- hopefully I will--

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.370
I'll spend some
time, then, trying

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.120
to tell you some
things about why

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.180
paying more attention
to our social nature

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.600
is really important for thinking
about happiness, well-being,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.190
and productivity
in the workplace.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.210
And then I assume
I will have time

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.340
because I set a timer
for myself to make

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.120
sure I get to this last piece.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.720
Because that's the piece I'm
actually most excited about.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.845
That's about where
our work is going

00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:52.050
and where it's now really
directly relevant to thinking

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.020
about neuroscience-- and social
neuroscience, specifically--

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.710
in the workplace and how we
can use it there in a way

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.480
that it, I think, really
hasn't been used in the past.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.510
But let's start at
the beginning, trying

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.440
to convince you that some of
the social aspects of ourself

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.140
are really, really a
basic part of who we are.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.300
So let's start with the
concept social pain.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.060
So we came up with the
concept of social pain back

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.380
in the early 2000s.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.510
And because we came up with
it, we got to define it.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.900
And so our definition--
there's various ones

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.240
we've used-- but it's
the pain associated

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.030
with actual or potential threats
to one's social connections.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.580
And if we want to
be extra wordy,

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.880
it can be actual or
potential threats

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.240
to one's actual or potential
or imagined social connections.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.050
So it's a pretty
flexible concept.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.540
But when most people
see this definition,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.030
what you're likely to
think is, oh I get it.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.650
So people are bothered when
they're socially rejected,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.360
so you're using social pain.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.710
But that's just a metaphor.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.720
Social pain is
metaphorical language.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.254
It's poetic license.

00:07:59.254 --> 00:08:01.170
And so what I want to
take a few minutes to do

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.990
is to think about what it
would take to persuade you

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.550
that social pain is every bit
as much of a real kind of pain

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.360
as when you stub your toe
or when you have a headache,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.800
that from the
brain's perspective

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.950
and from an evolutionary
perspective, social pain

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.214
is very much a
real kind of pain.

00:08:19.214 --> 00:08:21.130
It just manifests in a
slightly different way.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.570
But all physical pains
manifest in different ways.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.400
So the first thing
that's worth noting

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.690
is that while this may be a
metaphor for social pain--

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.230
and in English, we use language
like "you hurt my feelings"

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.700
and "she broke my heart."

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.980
So we use the language
of physical pain

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.809
to talk about social pain.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.240
And it turns out it's
not just in English.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.625
There was a paper published
years ago-- not by my group--

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:51.000
showing that in languages all
around the world, including

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.250
lots of non-romance languages,
the language of social pain

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.860
is based in the language
of physical pain.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.214
At least, I assume it is.

00:09:00.214 --> 00:09:02.130
Every once in a while
now, when I get up here,

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.710
I realize I can't
translate most of these.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.080
But I assume the authors
who wrote this paper could,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.500
and someone would have made them
retract the paper by this point

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.460
if they were inaccurate
in their translations.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.190
So we are neuroimaging folks.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.210
We're neuroscientists.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.800
And so our approach
is not to look

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.260
at how the language is
common around the world,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.460
although I think that's
super interesting.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.980
But instead, we
tend to put people

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.460
in these giant
coffin-like donuts

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.290
where you hear
really loud noises.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.290
It's not a terribly pleasant
place to be-- unless you're me.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.750
I tend to fall asleep in
scanners when people put me in.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.620
It's a little bit like being
in the womb, or it's terrible.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.570
It's one or the other
for most people.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.160
And we bring folks in.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.250
And this was back in 2001, 2002.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.200
We brought folks
in, and we had them

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.260
play this silly little ball
tossing game called Cyberball.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.057
And in Cyberball, you're
controlling this hand

00:09:56.057 --> 00:09:56.640
at the bottom.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.230
If you're the subject
in our scanner,

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.760
you're controlling this hand.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.250
And you believe you're playing
with two other real people

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.210
over the internet who are also
laying in scanners right now.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.900
Of course, we are
social psychologists,

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.050
so we lie to people
all the time about what

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.670
they're doing in the studies.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.550
And after a few minutes,
the game changes.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.350
And some of you
may now start to be

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.810
able to realize how
the game changes.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.960
The other two people, who
are really just code--

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.940
they're not people at all--

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.700
they stop throwing the
ball to the real subject.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.030
And this goes on
for a few minutes.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.040
Subjects get out of the scanner,
and they're usually either kind

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.670
of depressed or angry.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.210
But they definitely tend to
have a significant emotional

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.930
response to this.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.470
And so what we
were interested in

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.120
is what was happening
in the brain

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.380
while people were being rejected
or excluded from the game

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.897
compared to the earlier period
when they had been included.

00:10:49.897 --> 00:10:52.230
These are the brain regions
associated with the distress

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.640
of physical pain.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.690
So the more bothered you are
by any painful experience

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.640
that you have, the
more activity you're

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.825
going to see in
these two regions.

00:11:01.825 --> 00:11:03.450
And when we looked
in the brain at what

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.480
was different between
the people's responses

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.820
when they were being excluded
compared to when they were

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.130
included, these were
the only two regions

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.990
of the brain that were more
active during rejection

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.095
than when folks were included.

00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:17.970
Moreover, when people
got out of the scanner,

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.760
we asked them to tell
us how painful it

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.830
was to be rejected
while they were

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.450
playing this very boring game.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.450
And the more they
told us they felt

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.100
that it was a
painful experience,

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.780
the more these two regions
showed increasing responses.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.050
And so this persuades
a fair number of people

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.840
that social pain is
a real kind of pain.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.260
But if it doesn't persuade you,
perhaps the follow-up study

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:43.920
will.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.800
It turns out that if
you give people Tylenol,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.070
all these effects go away.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.130
So the same pain killer that
you take for your headaches

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.650
actually works in some
sense for your heartaches,

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.290
for your sense of being
rejected or excluded.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.540
It works for that as well.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.750
Important caveat here--
do not try this at home.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.710
Tylenol is super toxic.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.150
500 people a year die
from Tylenol overdoses.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.860
And so while there are
clinical trials going on

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.480
and we did this, this was done
in a very proper, appropriate

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.620
lab-based way.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.380
Don't do this at home, OK?

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.730
There, I told you not to.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.170
If you do, that's on you now.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:27.390
All right, so we have this,
I think, very basic, inborn

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.170
sensitivity to social
rejection that manifests itself

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.160
in the form of pain.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.350
And it turns out
it's not just humans.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.260
All mammals show this
kind of response,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.720
and they tend to show it in
the same regions of the brain.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.050
So you can look at rats,
you can look at monkeys--

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.466
there are other animals that
have been looked at as well--

00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:47.610
and they tend to show
this same response.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.000
We have it because
for humans, who

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.440
are born incapable of
taking care of themselves

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.660
when they're infants, you
need a way to stay connected.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.680
And this makes the
infant and the caregiver

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.219
feel connected and are
very sensitive to distress

00:13:02.219 --> 00:13:02.760
in the other.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.480
Especially the caregiver is very
sensitive to the social pain

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.610
distress calls
given by the infants

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.510
of pretty much any mammals.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.810
And so the upshot of
this is that social pain

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.330
is one of the things that
motivates us to stay connected,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.680
to stay together.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.650
And that allows us to do all
sorts of extraordinary things

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.200
like build buildings
with air conditioning

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.720
and roofs and things like
that that, pretty much,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.360
if you were on your own and
weren't feeling any motivation

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.390
to connect with other people,
we might never have developed

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.530
these sorts of things.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.070
Now, on the flip
side of social pain,

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.600
we have social
pleasures, which are

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.790
nicer to think about and
talk about and so on.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.680
And it turns out that the
same pretty primitive brain

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.850
system that we share with
reptiles and most other animals

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.810
that can walk, the ventral
striatum, the region

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.820
shown in fire here--

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.350
this is a region
that we've known

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.950
for years and years responds
when people in the scanner

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.950
win money, when they
get to eat something

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.880
that's delicious, when they look
at pictures of pretty people.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.590
All those things
activate this system.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.890
But it also turns out
we've known for a few years

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.440
now that being liked,
loved, respected,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.620
or even just feeling
understood are all things that

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.910
activate this same system.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.274
So this is a system
that seems to be just as

00:14:23.274 --> 00:14:24.690
sensitive-- some
evidence suggests

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.380
it's more sensitive to social
rewards than these other kinds

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.750
of rewards that we
tend to think of when

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.970
we think of rewards in general.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.600
All right, "It's better
to give than to receive."

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.270
You've all heard this
presumably at some point.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.950
Usually it's
associated with someone

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:45.840
getting a pretty bad gift
around Christmas or Hanukkah.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.940
Does anyone know who
first said "It's better

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.570
to give than to receive?"

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.860
I'll tell you-- your brain.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.550
Your brain first said
this because all humans

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.230
are built with this wired in.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.960
Remember, we started with
the prisoner's dilemma,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.160
where you can decide to play
selfishly or for the group.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.950
And if you have any strong
views that we are rationally

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.280
self-interest going for the
money kinds of creatures,

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.250
you might imagine that there'd
be social norms suggesting

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.720
that there are
times when we think

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.930
we're supposed to give money to
the group, to work communally.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.060
You could say that
community condition was just

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.120
people being sensitive to
norms and being afraid of what

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.490
the experimenter would think.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.710
But if that's the
case, you would still

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:31.090
expect that the brain's reward
system to respond most strongly

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:34.060
when people chose to play
the game in the way that

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.720
would, by definition,
maximize their own earnings.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.380
But that is not what happens
in the prisoner's dilemma.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.000
In the prisoner's dilemma,
you get the most activity

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.540
in the ventral striatum
when you play communally.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.701
So this is a case--

00:15:47.701 --> 00:15:49.450
this is a different
kind of social reward.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.210
The first kind I told you about
is when people tell you they

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.190
like, love, respect you.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.890
This kind of social reward
is when you do for others.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.740
And it turns out
that we're built such

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.550
that doing for others is
also a rewarding, pleasurable

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.680
experience, one
that we don't always

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.420
have a very good theory of.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.630
But it definitely is true.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:15.310
Adam Grant, who's at the Wharton
School in Pennsylvania, UPenn--

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.950
he wrote a wonderful
book on the benefits

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.940
of being a giver at
work instead of a taker.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:29.060
If you are going to buy one
book this year, well, buy mine.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.490
But if you're going to buy
two, I would highly, highly

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.689
recommend his book.

00:16:33.689 --> 00:16:35.480
And one of the things
he found in this book

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.688
is that if you go take folks
who are doing relatively

00:16:37.688 --> 00:16:41.030
menial, thankless work, like
working a phone bank trying

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.240
to raise money for scholarships
for the university, where

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.190
everybody is hanging up
and trying to get off

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.650
the phone with you,
and you bring someone

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.720
in who won one of
their scholarships

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.810
that they're raising money
for who then tells some

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:57.470
of these phone bank folks about
how the work they're doing

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.340
actually tangibly
benefits someone,

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.984
the productivity of these
folks goes through the roof.

00:17:03.984 --> 00:17:05.650
And when I say it
goes through the roof,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.192
I don't mean that
day or the next day

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:09.775
where you would expect them to
be like, oh, that was so great.

00:17:09.775 --> 00:17:11.839
That was fun that we heard
from that 20-year-old

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:14.635
telling us what this
award meant for them.

00:17:14.635 --> 00:17:16.760
It's a month later that
they come back and measure.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.650
And a month later,
the productivity

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.540
of the folks who got
this intervention

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.650
is dramatically higher.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.450
And this has been
replicated several times

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.180
in different contexts, so
I think it's really legit.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.410
So humans are sensitive to
social pain, social pleasure.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.780
You would think that if these
are things that can really

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.790
move around our
well-being, we might

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.980
have a system in
our brain that helps

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.410
us navigate the social
world so that we

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.270
can maximize our
social pleasures

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.550
and minimize the social pains.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.740
For some time, people
thought that it

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.400
was the basic analytical
system in the brain, which

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.620
is shown here in green--

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.582
loosely shown here in green.

00:17:54.582 --> 00:17:56.040
These are systems
that are involved

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.070
in math and logical reasoning
and accounting and working

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.340
memory, holding things
temporarily in mind.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.140
But it turns out
that there really

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.660
is a completely
separate network that's

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.660
involved in our social
thinking that doesn't really

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.202
overlap with the network for
analytical thinking at all.

00:18:13.202 --> 00:18:14.910
And we've learned some
interesting things

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:15.930
about this network.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.610
One of the things
we've learned is

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.680
that these two networks--
the social thinking

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.200
and analytical thinking
networks-- kind of operate

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.520
like a neural seesaw, where
activity in one going up

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.190
tends to be associated with
activity in the other going

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.840
down and vise versa.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.960
They seem to trade
off of each other.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.740
And we can think
immediately about how

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.590
that might be relevant
in the workplace, right?

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.960
I assume Google,
like most companies,

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.800
really prioritizes people being
highly analytically skilled

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.560
many, many hours of the day.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.920
And the goal is to
just emphasize that

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.760
without necessarily detracting
from other capacities

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.841
that we might have.

00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:56.340
But there's some
evidence to suggest

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.215
that if you're putting
the pedal to the metal

00:18:58.215 --> 00:19:01.410
on the analytical side, that may
come at a real cost of actually

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.760
dampening down some
of our social skills

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.130
and our ability to
detect certain things

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.010
socially in others in
our social environment.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.220
Another thing we've learned
is sort of a funny result,

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.320
and I'll show it
to you this way.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.360
So let's say I brought
you into my scanner.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.200
It's not my scanner.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.570
It's UCLA's scanner.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.990
I brought you in, and I told
you that what you're going to do

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.920
is lay in the scanner.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.790
And you're going to
do math for a minute,

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.520
and then you're going to
lay there and rest and do

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.040
nothing for a minute, and then
math for a minute and rest.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.210
And the math is super easy.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.950
It's like 3 plus 4 type math.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.510
And the rest is nothing.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.760
And this time, even though
I'm a social psychologist,

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.780
I'm not lying to you.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.460
This is exactly what
you do while you're

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.940
laying in the scanner.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.110
And so we can go look at these
analytical parts of the brain,

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.780
and they will do just what
we would expect them to do.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.110
They'll do something like this.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.260
This is idealized, but
something like this.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.140
When you're doing math, the
analytical parts light up.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.420
And when you're
resting, they quiet down

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.180
because you don't need
them to rest and do nothing

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.050
while you're laying
in the scanner.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.352
Now, we can look at
the same exact task

00:20:04.352 --> 00:20:06.060
and what's happening
in the social brain,

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.100
in the social thinking network.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.530
Well, what we would
expect to see is this--

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.030
not much at all.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.209
Because you don't need your
social brain to do math.

00:20:14.209 --> 00:20:16.500
In fact, if you activate your
social brain while you're

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.320
doing math, it interferes.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.120
And you don't need your
social brain during rest.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.920
So that's what
we'd expect to see.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.470
But what you
actually see is this.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.570
So the social brain comes on
incredibly reliably any time

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.400
there is a break in the action.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.130
And it comes on within a
few hundred milliseconds

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.577
of finishing any sort of
cognitive, goal-directed task.

00:20:38.577 --> 00:20:41.160
So there are folks who have done
things with depth electrodes.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.951
They put them right in
the right positions,

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.390
and they can tell within
300 milliseconds--

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.670
it's actually a guy
at Stanford nearby--

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.130
that within 300 milliseconds,
the social brain

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:54.190
pops back on whenever there's
a break in the action.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.880
And so we can ask ourselves,
well, why would that happen?

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:03.270
And while I'm not going to
spend lots of time in my lecture

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:08.950
today going over
why that happens,

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.330
what I can tell you is that the
summary result from our studies

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.420
is that to the extent that
you spontaneously activate

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.270
this network in short
periods of downtime

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.990
in between more significant
events in your life,

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:26.040
if the next thing you have to
do involves social thinking,

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.320
you're better prepared for it.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.930
You actually perform
better on social tasks

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.430
where you have to
think about what's

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.400
going on in the minds of
other folks to the extent

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.030
that this network has
spontaneously activated itself.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.820
And what that suggests is
that evolution has essentially

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.860
made a bet that the
best thing to do

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.890
with our spare
cycles in our brain

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.240
as we have downtime is to get
ready for thinking socially,

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.140
that that is really
evolutionarily significant.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.640
Because this is pretty much the
only thing in the brain that

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.340
has this sort of pattern, where
every time there's a break

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.270
and we can reset, it resets
towards the social domain.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.330
We actually have a lot of
data that speaks to that now.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.944
And so in essence,
what that does for us--

00:22:08.944 --> 00:22:10.860
and I think this is
really, really important--

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.330
is that when we look
out into the world,

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.980
we could see all of this
just as physical objects

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.370
in physical motion.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.870
We could describe it all in
terms of physics and mechanics

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:22.900
and so on.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.199
But most people-- the
vast majority of people--

00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:26.740
when they look at
this, what they see

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.360
has psychological meaning.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.570
They see people having thoughts,
feelings, interactions,

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.440
intentions.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.490
And this tendency to
turn on this network

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.010
as we walk into
each new experience

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.530
is something that
prepares us to see

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.170
the world in a
psychological fashion

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:48.670
rather than in a physics-based,
mechanical fashion.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:53.470
So that's a very short course
on some of the evidence that

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:57.790
suggests that we really do
have some basic social features

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.340
to us and that we are not
purely self-interested.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.010
We are not just Homo economicus.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.590
We are that but not just that.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.780
Of course, I could have
skipped those 20 minutes

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.110
and just showed you the quote
from Albert Einstein where

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.090
he says, "Man owes his
strength in the struggle

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:16.720
for existence to the fact
that he is a social animal."

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.200
But, you know, then I would
have no job being here at all.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.930
I could've just
showed you that slide.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.400
So I'm going to spend a
few minutes telling you now

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.590
about how some of these things
relate to business directly,

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.227
and then I'm going to turn
to what we're doing now

00:23:32.227 --> 00:23:34.060
with a different kind
of neuroscience that's

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:34.851
more work-relevant.

00:23:34.851 --> 00:23:37.720
And I'm pretty excited
to get to that.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.810
OK, so in any workplace,
in any business,

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.180
you're off trying to hire folks.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.010
And it's been a long
time, now, that we've

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.230
understood that the
goal of hiring folks

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.720
is to accrue the most talent.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.120
So any HR department
is out there

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:56.200
trying to find the individuals
who are A-plus people.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.060
And the A-plus
people are the people

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.270
with the highest IQs, the
most training and experience,

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.980
who went to the best schools.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.117
And norms about these
things change over time,

00:24:05.117 --> 00:24:06.700
but that's roughly
speaking describing

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.580
what's happened over the
last couple of decades

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.812
in terms of how we
try to acquire people.

00:24:11.812 --> 00:24:13.270
And the goal is to
make sure, then,

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.480
that your company has
the most human capital.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.465
It's almost like a sort
of role-playing game

00:24:18.465 --> 00:24:19.840
where you're trying
to get people

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.010
with the most intellectual and
academic skills for performing

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.500
the feats they will
need to do at work.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.130
Some economists looked
at this and discovered

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.960
that if you want to
see the relationship

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.350
between human capital and
the company's bottom line,

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.620
the vast majority
of that relationship

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.640
is actually explained by the
links between the individuals

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.811
in the company.

00:24:43.811 --> 00:24:45.310
And so here what
we're talking about

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.460
is not human capital but social
capital, the extent to which

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.900
a company makes the boundaries
between people and sections

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.780
of the company permeable so
that they can connect easily

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:56.770
with each other.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.300
And what's critical
about this is

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.120
you've got this A-plus person
down here with some special set

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.080
of skills.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.580
And if they're
siloed and they don't

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.690
feel really connected
to other folks,

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.330
well, that person
up there is never

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.880
going to benefit from their
skills when they could

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.700
and vise versa.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.420
This person is not going
to easily seek them out

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.300
because they don't have an easy
path to get access to them.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.650
So it's important to build this
kind of social capital purely

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.280
for economic reasons
at companies.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.030
Here's another version
of something similar.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:30.550
So this is a phone bank
company, I think, in Germany.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:33.580
And the company Humanyze, who
does the badge testing where

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.490
it tracks your every
movement throughout the day--

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.760
they did a study
with this company.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.310
And the way the company was
working when they showed up

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.070
is that there'd be five or six
people in a phone bank that

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.780
were in a pod together.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.570
And they would get their
15 minute breaks staggered,

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.450
so they all took their
breaks at different times.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.000
And Humanyze came in and said,
hey, why don't you give them

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.650
their breaks together?

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.780
Because if you give them
their breaks together,

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.700
they'll actually be
more socially connected

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.580
to one another and actually
feel like they're on a team.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.397
Now, this seems like a
really small difference.

00:26:07.397 --> 00:26:08.980
But it turned out
that this difference

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.560
had really significant
effects on the extent

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.990
to which people at the
company felt cohesive

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.880
with the other people
they worked with,

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.130
the productivity they had,
the stress levels they had.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.160
So these simple
changes where they're

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.790
being sensitive to enhancing
the social dynamics of the group

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:26.200
had really substantial effects.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.199
And they've done other
studies like this as well

00:26:28.199 --> 00:26:30.220
and tend to see something.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.030
If nobody is focusing on the
social aspects of a company,

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.620
that becomes low-hanging fruit.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.050
Because nobody's actually gone
after the low-hanging fruit

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:38.590
before.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.590
And this is, I think,
that sort of thing.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.060
We can think about
performance feedback.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.324
Everybody gets performance
feedback at most companies.

00:26:46.324 --> 00:26:48.490
There's a few companies
that have done away with it.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:49.780
It's hard to do away with it.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.270
You want your employees
to get feedback,

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:56.030
but nobody likes getting
performance feedback.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.850
And so for me, one of
the things I always

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.520
think about when I think
about performance feedback

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.650
is that for the person
giving the feedback,

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:04.360
they're just giving
constructive advice

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.060
for how you can go be more
efficient and effective.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.980
And for the person
receiving the feedback,

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.170
it's like somebody's
punching you in the face--

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.320
typically, unless you're
the golden child of whatever

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.760
company you're working at.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.620
And so we have a way
of understanding that.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.870
So we've talked
about social pain,

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.210
and the idea is that
if we think of this

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:24.910
as a genuinely painful
event for people

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.570
to be told information that
may make you feel less valued

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.130
and worthy at the company
that you're working at,

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.130
then it's weird to think
that those folks should

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.620
be able to just go back
to work and be effective.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.320
We wouldn't expect
someone to break their leg

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.400
and then go back to work.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.590
We'd say, go get
that taken care of

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:46.420
and come back to work when
it's all in a cast and feeling

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.320
better.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.890
There's work that shows
that after people have been

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:55.690
rejected, their IQs
go down significantly

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.490
and their performance
on standardized tests

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.610
like the GREs plummet--

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:06.110
68% if you've just been accepted
and made to feel good, 39%

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.170
if you've just been rejected.

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.790
So after you've
just been rejected,

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.410
don't go take the GREs.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:12.910
You will not do well.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.200
It's not a good solution.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.660
Eat some ice cream.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.510
We can think more
directly about happiness

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.360
and how to promote that.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.570
We know, of course, that two
of the major factors that drive

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.290
happiness are money and health.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:30.967
So let's start with health.

00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:32.800
So we all know smoking's
bad for you, right?

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.841
In California, almost
nobody ever smokes anymore.

00:28:34.841 --> 00:28:38.110
But in most of the world,
lots of people still smoke.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:42.040
You can look at the
morbidity statistics

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.350
for your likelihood
of essentially dying

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.800
from different
kinds of behaviors,

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.960
from not being physically
active, being obese,

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.250
having pneumonia.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:54.940
And smoking's like the
worst one from behaviors

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.190
that you can
personally engage in.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.399
Smoking's really, really bad.

00:28:58.399 --> 00:29:00.314
And that's one of the
reasons we spend about a

00:29:00.314 --> 00:29:02.500
half billion dollars a
year in the United States

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.130
to stop people from smoking and
to get people to stop smoking

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.960
once they have started.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.530
But what I haven't
shown you here,

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.190
which is the most interesting
part of the chart,

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.340
is that it actually turns
out that not cultivating

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.860
a meaningful social
group is actually

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.990
more dangerous to your
health than smoking

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.610
15 cigarettes a day.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.530
So while health is super
important for your well-being,

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.630
it turns out that being
socially connected

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:34.420
is also super important
for your well-being.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.700
We know people
value being wealthy.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.650
We know people value
material wealth.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.660
The percentage of
people who value it

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.630
has gone up and up
in the United States.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.690
And I value it too, so I'm not
really throwing stones at all.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.160
But what I will say is that this
seems largely to be a mistake.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.620
Because as wealth rises,
happiness typically

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.150
doesn't change at all.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.700
And you can cut the data
a million different ways.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.610
Unless you're moving
people from genuine poverty

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.050
to out of poverty--

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.750
then every dollar really
does change happiness

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.620
and well-being.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.420
But once you hit a
certain threshold,

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.750
you get very diminishing
returns for increasing money.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.457
So what makes people happier?

00:30:12.457 --> 00:30:14.290
Well, the people who
report being very happy

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.970
are the people who spend lots
of time with friends and family.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:24.040
Some economists looked
at this using money

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.900
as a sort of comparison point.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.950
And they said, OK, how much does
spending an extra hour a week

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.470
with someone you really like,
going to get coffee with them

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:33.620
or something like that--

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.650
how much does that
increase your happiness?

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.270
And they put it
in terms of money.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.280
They said, how much
money would you

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.630
have to make extra
in a given year

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.630
in order to get the same
amount of happiness you

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.680
get from spending an hour
a week with a good friend?

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.200
It turns out it's a
giant amount of money.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.870
You have to make an
extra $100,000 a year

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.670
to get the same increase
in your happiness

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.562
as spending an hour
with someone you like.

00:30:56.562 --> 00:30:58.270
You get to pick the
person you're talking

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.890
about here, someone you like.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.930
Which of these is
more fun, working

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.290
to make an extra hundred grand
or spending time with a friend?

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.944
And as we do this, we
have less time to do this.

00:31:08.944 --> 00:31:10.360
These are the
choices we all make.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.730
We move cross-country
for job opportunities

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:16.090
and leave our social
networks behind.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.790
We can think about this within
the workplace specifically,

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:22.580
not just having friends in life
but having friends at work.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.330
It turns out that
while people who

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.700
love the company
they work at often

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.490
say it's because they love the
interesting and challenging

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.010
work they do there,
they also often say

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.920
their number one reason for
loving the company they work at

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.640
is the co-workers that
they get to work with.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.150
And people who say, I have
a best friend at work--

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.820
people who answer yes to this--
the divisions of companies

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.450
they work in tend to have
customers who are happier,

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:55.010
they're more productive, and
they show greater profit.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.750
So the upshot of this-- and then
I'm going to turn to my last

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.710
piece--

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.800
is that in the
workplace, we tend

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.630
to think that this
is the primary way

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.034
to incentivize people.

00:32:07.034 --> 00:32:08.950
When you look at all the
incentive structures,

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.408
they almost always
either come down

00:32:10.408 --> 00:32:14.020
to current or future promised
money in one form or another.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.640
Health plans are
just money that are

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.370
being spent for you in a
certain other material way.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:22.840
And the point is that
we have some needs

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.480
that money are really,
really good at covering.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.250
So if you go to
Maslow's hierarchy--

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.050
and this is a simplified
form with physical, social,

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.330
and meaning needs--

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.160
physical needs are pretty
well handled with money.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.950
But the other two aren't at all.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.680
And so again, these
become low-hanging fruit.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.380
If nobody is
incentivizing anyone

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.540
with these other
approaches, then they

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.000
become a really
effective way for you

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.580
to make that kind of
difference in whatever group

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.780
you're working in.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.930
OK, so last chunk of what
I'm going to talk about

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.870
is what I think one of the
big parts of the future

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.730
of social neuroscience
is, and it's

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:01.000
going to have a big
connection to the workplace

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.180
and not just be in the ivory
tower where I tend to work.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.210
This kind of work
involves getting away

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:13.780
from giant, heavy MRI
scanners and getting

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.620
to lightweight, portable,
mobile neuroimaging technologies

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:22.240
like functional near-infrared
spectroscopy, or fNIRS.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.260
MRIs depend on differences
in the magnetic properties

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.430
of oxygenated and
deoxygenated hemoglobin.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:31.840
fNIRS is kind of
the same, except it

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.060
depends on the light
absorption properties that

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.460
differ between those
two types of blood.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.310
It's basically just the same
thing as the pulse oximeter

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.190
you wear on your finger
when you go to the doctors,

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.410
except it's all over your brain.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.900
And it's super
portable and mobile.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.480
So you can put--

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.090
you're basically putting
a very small computer

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.850
and a sizable battery in a
backpack, which you can either

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:57.280
wear or put on the table
behind the subject.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.200
It doesn't have to
actually be on your back.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.810
But it allows you to
be flexible in where

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:04.374
you do your research
and the kind of research

00:34:04.374 --> 00:34:06.040
that you can now do
that you could never

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.900
do with an MRI scanner.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.230
And it has downsides as well.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.219
There's no question.

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.880
It doesn't have the same
spatial resolution as MRI.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.310
And currently, it doesn't
penetrate very deep

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:16.040
into the brain.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.949
So it gets you the
cortical surface.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:20.420
But I think in the next
five to seven years,

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.050
that's probably going to
change a fair bit as well.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.440
So the first thing we did
when we decided to test out

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.210
this equipment was
we wanted to go

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:31.429
replicate something we had done
in our lab over and over again.

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:33.802
So there's this paradigm
that Emily Falk,

00:34:33.802 --> 00:34:35.260
one of my former
graduate students,

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.560
and I developed, where we try
to persuade people while they're

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.639
laying in the scanner.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:43.000
And then we ask them
later and track them

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.150
in various ways using wrist
trackers and other things

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:49.719
to see how much they've actually
changed their behavior in line

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:52.030
with whatever we were
trying to persuade them of--

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.679
to use sunscreen
more, to stop smoking,

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:57.580
to get more physical
exercise, to sleep more.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.920
We do lots of public health
types of things like that.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.040
And it turns out that
when you see activity

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.200
in this medial prefrontal
region here that's

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.580
shown in yellow there--

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.070
when that goes up when people
are seeing the messages,

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:11.230
people tend to then
change their behavior

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:13.036
in message-consistent ways.

00:35:13.036 --> 00:35:14.410
We think this has
something to do

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.750
with basically adopting
and integrating

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.942
the message into your identity.

00:35:18.942 --> 00:35:20.650
Because this is a
region that's very much

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:24.220
associated with
self-processes and valuation.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.450
So we think-- but we
don't know for sure--

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.000
that that seems to be part
of what's going on there.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.380
On the flip side, when people
are resistant to a persuasive

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.630
message and they're internally
counter-arguing saying,

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.370
this is stupid because--

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:39.400
you see more activity in the
right dorsolateral prefrontal

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.310
cortex, and you'll see less
behavior change over time.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:47.530
So we did the same thing in
our first study with fNIRS,

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.420
and we basically found
the exact same result.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.340
We were actually pretty
shocked that we found this.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.506
We thought maybe we'd get
a little bit of something,

00:35:53.506 --> 00:35:54.410
but there it is.

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:56.140
So this is showing--

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.370
to us, at least--

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:01.480
that we can do something
analogous with fNIRS

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.700
that we've been doing for
years and years with fMRI

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.510
and we had a lot
of confidence in.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.710
But fNIRS has the ability
to do so much more

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.474
than just replicate
what we've been

00:36:10.474 --> 00:36:11.890
able to do while
people are laying

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.060
on their back in the scanner.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.710
And this often
involves an approach

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.072
called neural synchrony.

00:36:19.072 --> 00:36:20.530
There's other names
for it as well,

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:22.070
but I call it neural synchrony.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.150
And the basic idea is you
go to the same spot in two

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.610
different people's brains as
they're experiencing something,

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:33.140
and you look at how the activity
there fluctuates over time.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.860
And to the extent that two
people in the same spot

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.730
in their brains are watching a
video or having a conversation

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:43.030
and they're fluctuations
are fluctuating together,

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:44.450
that's neural synchrony.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.030
And if they're doing
random different things,

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.130
there is no synchrony
in that case.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.700
And it turns out-- and I'll
show you data to back this up

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.590
in a minute--

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.940
that what this really
tends to get at

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.940
is whether two people
aren't literally just

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.880
being exposed to the same
thing but are sharing

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.170
the same experience of it.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:03.970
They're experiencing
it and having

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.790
the same kind of
understanding and perspective

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.284
on what's going on.

00:37:08.284 --> 00:37:09.700
But first, I want
to show you what

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.380
neural synchrony looks like.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.900
So these are the
results of two people--

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.430
these are their brains--

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:20.570
watching a fighter pilot video.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:21.820
They didn't watch it together.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.640
They're just time-locked
to be shown together.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:29.500
And let's see, to orient
you, the more red and orange

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.360
you can see on the
color bar over there,

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.100
the more activity
that's occurring

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.460
in that part of the brain.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.970
And the more green and
blue, the less activity.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.970
And so I think you'll be
able to hear the sound.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:40.750
We'll just watch this.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.340
It's a 20-second video,
but hopefully you

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.560
can see the synchrony
occurring with your own eyes.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.226

[END PLAYBACK]

00:38:08.454 --> 00:38:10.078
MATTHEW LIEBERMAN:
OK, so hopefully you

00:38:10.078 --> 00:38:11.090
could sort of see it.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:13.570
If not, this is each
of the two brains

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.070
at different points in time.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.860
And you can see that the
brains are more like each other

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:21.170
than they are their own brain
at other points in time.

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:24.670
Now, here's the same video shown
again, this time without sound.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.250
But this time, this
person on the right

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.260
is internally doing math.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.290
So their eyes are on the video.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.210
If you're looking
at them, you can't

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.970
tell that they're experiencing
it any differently

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.120
than this person.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.720
But as soon as you see
their brains, it's obvious.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.270
They are not experiencing
the same thing right now.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.970
They are not responding
at all the same way

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.750
to what they're taking in.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:49.690
And so this is really,
really cool-- at least,

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:51.130
I think it's really
cool-- that we

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.860
can tell this without
asking people,

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.910
how distracted were you?

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.700
Imagine at a
conference room meeting

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.830
and you're going to ask
everyone, so how distracted

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:00.996
were you during the meeting?

00:39:00.996 --> 00:39:02.950
Nobody's going to
say, I was distracted.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.116
They're all going to say,
oh, I was totally present.

00:39:05.116 --> 00:39:07.750
And man, I'm having great
ideas after that meeting.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.859
But we all know that
we've been that person,

00:39:09.859 --> 00:39:12.400
and there's other people who
are being that person right now.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.801
Some of you have no idea what
I'm talking about right now

00:39:14.801 --> 00:39:17.300
because you're being that person
right now, and that's fine.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.040
I have no problem with that.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.415
Because if I was
in the audience,

00:39:19.415 --> 00:39:20.954
I might be that person.

00:39:20.954 --> 00:39:22.870
But I think that's a
really interesting thing,

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:27.960
to be able to detect that, I
think, in a pretty robust way.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.310
So let me tell you
about something

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.320
that we've done
with this where we

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.090
can show it's really about
people sharing perspective.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:39.890
So we take the equipment.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:42.750
We put it in our
carry-on luggage.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.010
This is Google Earth, so thank
you, Google, for making this.

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.260
This impresses people at
every other talk I give,

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:53.120
but I assume it would be
like, ugh, that again, here.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.790
So we go halfway around
the world to Amman, Jordan.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.550
And for the last
three summers, we've

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.130
set up pop-up mobile
neuroscience labs,

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:03.350
ran the first ever
social neuroscience

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:08.000
studies run anywhere in
the country or the region.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.170
And what we were doing
in this particular study

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.450
that I'm going to
tell you about is

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:17.300
we found participants
over there who

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.780
were either pro-choice
or pro-life with respect

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.420
to abortion.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.600
Now, there is an important
debate over there

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.830
that's pro-life, pro-choice.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:27.320
It's not the same as our debate.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.680
There's a general belief
that abortion is wrong.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.690
But there is a debate
over whether or not

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:35.270
there should be an exception
in the case of rape.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.640
So that's what this
particular debate is about,

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.530
and there's lots of
people on both sides.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.770
It's about a 50/50 split, which
is what we were looking for.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:50.030
And then we had videos made
of local individuals arguing

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:53.720
basically for the pro-choice
side or the pro-life side.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.080
So we have videos,
native-language videos,

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.870
where people are arguing for
these two different sides.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:05.112
And both groups saw both
videos while wearing fNIRS.

00:41:05.112 --> 00:41:07.070
So then I'll take you
through what we looked at

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.180
and how this works.

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.180
So both groups watched
this pro-choice video.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.330
So let's say we pull
out one of the people

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:16.130
from the pro-choice side.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:18.380
So conceptually,
they're down here now.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.640
Pretend they're not
up there anymore.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.280
And so what we can
do is we can look

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.760
at the extent to which
this individual is showing

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.030
a synchronous response
with the average of all

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.787
the pro-choice folks up there.

00:41:31.787 --> 00:41:33.620
And you can do this
iteratively, so then you

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.745
pull out a different subject
and put this one back.

00:41:35.745 --> 00:41:37.670
And you do it for
everyone so that you

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.380
see how each person
is correlated

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.850
with the rest of the group
in the pro-choice group.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.614
And when you do
this, what you see

00:41:43.614 --> 00:41:45.030
is that there's
lots of synchrony.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:48.680
So red on the scale
is up at the high end,

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.480
and then yellow is also
pretty high as well.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.162
So we see lots of
synchrony there.

00:41:53.162 --> 00:41:54.620
But when we do the
same thing where

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:58.010
we take someone who's pro-choice
and see how their brain

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.350
responses correlate with
the folks who are pro-life,

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:04.040
it's basically zero correlations
throughout the brain,

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.890
throughout the frontal
cortex where we were looking.

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:10.070
So they're seeing
the exact same video.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:12.170
The same photons are
hitting their eyes.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.120
The same sound waves
are hitting their ears.

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.690
But they experience it like
them and not like them,

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:20.300
and that's what's
coming out here.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.720
And we can reverse it.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.710
So now you pull someone out
from the pro-life group,

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.060
and they'll show synchrony
with the pro-life group

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.590
but not with the pro-choice
group-- just for complete sake.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.230
And so once we started
getting results like this,

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.090
we started thinking
that there were

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.460
a wide range of applications.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.960
And so one of the other people
in my department prodded me,

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.700
and so we went and
started a company

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.680
so that we could do
this in other places

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.600
where we wouldn't ordinarily
study this inside UCLA.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.600
And so the idea
here is that as long

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.540
as we have two different kinds
of reference groups getting

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:59.600
at a particular kind
of way of experiencing

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.680
a piece of the world, we
can now basically figure out

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.962
what a new case is actually
seeing and experiencing

00:43:06.962 --> 00:43:09.170
when they're looking at
something because we can look

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.711
at the extent to which they look
like more of a match for one

00:43:11.711 --> 00:43:13.410
group or another.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:16.760
And this lets us basically
and broadly speaking

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.900
study the science
of compatibility.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:22.270
And it's in a very broad
kind of definition.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:24.470
And so the idea here is if
you experience something

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:27.980
in similar ways as
another person or group,

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.200
then you'll show greater
synchrony with that person

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.990
or group under the proper
stimulus conditions.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:37.010
So the pro-choice person
watching a pro-choice video--

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.670
not watching the Super Bowl, but
watching the pro-choice video--

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.430
then they're experiencing
something in the same way

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:45.690
or similar way to those folks.

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.730
And so then you can
see that sort of thing.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:50.370
So imagine instead
of looking at this,

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:52.640
we were trying to figure
out who in a company

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.250
is experiencing
burnout right now.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:57.020
Some people in
this room right now

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.147
are feeling burned out working.

00:43:59.147 --> 00:44:00.230
It's a fact of the matter.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:02.030
There's a decent
percentage of people

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.120
that are feeling burned
out, and it's a big problem.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.860
People who are burned out leave.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.290
Before they leave, their
productivity goes way down.

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.100
Burnout is contagious.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.700
It's something that anyone
running a company or somewhere

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.094
up in management really,
really wants to avoid.

00:44:16.094 --> 00:44:17.510
But you can't go
to your employees

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:20.300
and say, tell me, on a scale
from 1 to 10, how burned out

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.590
are you feeling?

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.725
Because people are typically
not going to tell you.

00:44:23.725 --> 00:44:25.100
That's not one of
those things we

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:29.330
reveal in interviews and
performance reviews and things

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:30.660
like that.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.300
But we could do the
same kind of thing

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.466
we did with the
pro-choice, pro-life.

00:44:35.466 --> 00:44:37.740
But now, instead of looking
at pro-choice, pro-life,

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:41.340
we're looking at videos
of CEOs and executives

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.272
talking about feeling really
engaged or feeling burned out.

00:44:45.272 --> 00:44:46.980
And then we have people
that have already

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.070
told us that they are feeling
engaged or burned out,

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:53.430
and we can see how they respond
when they watch these videos

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:56.894
and look at how that relates
to individuals in this way.

00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:59.310
So to get at this-- it's hard
to get a bunch of executives

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:01.280
and CEOs in a room.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.280
They don't like to all
show up at the same time,

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.040
so we went to them.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.980
A few months ago, we went
to this event, Summit LA.

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:12.120
It's an ideas fest for
basically really wealthy CEOs

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.260
and executives.

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.360
I could never afford
to go to this event

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.420
unless I was invited,
which I was, thankfully.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:22.240
And so once we were there,
people say yes to everything.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.240
And so we were super
excited that a bunch

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.000
of CEOs and executives were
happy to come in and get

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.740
their brains scanned together.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.620
This is literally the first
time four people have ever

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.750
been scanned while
having a conversation.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:36.220
That's never
happened in any form.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.400
So we thought that was
pretty cool in and of itself.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.380
And they did interesting
things while they

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.820
were having conversations.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.100
I'm not going to tell you
about that data today.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.360
But another thing they
did is at one point--

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.550
there's a TV here--

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:50.190
they all turned and
looked at the TV,

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:52.350
and they watched
videos like these.

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:54.540
So they saw some people
talking about how

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.964
engaged and excited they
are at work, like this guy.

00:45:56.964 --> 00:45:57.630
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.520
- What's really exciting
to me personally

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.270
is the ability to make an impact
for millions if not billions

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:07.320
of people, having a commercially
successful product that

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.780
is driven by technology
but ultimately making

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.990
the human experience better.

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:13.180
We get a lot of messages
saying, thank you,

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.750
Ivy-- which is our hotel
concierge that we created.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.310
By texting you, I
was able to get it

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:20.040
in two minutes at my door
and that really, you're

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.180
a lifesaver.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:21.764
[END PLAYBACK]

00:46:21.764 --> 00:46:23.846
MATTHEW LIEBERMAN: So
you've got people like that.

00:46:23.846 --> 00:46:25.620
And then you've also
got-- and to be fair,

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.750
he talked about both
the good and bad side.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.250
And this next guy talked
about the good and bad side.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:33.370
So it's not like this next
guy is super burned out.

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:36.120
We asked everyone to talk
about both aspects of their job

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.637
at different times.

00:46:37.637 --> 00:46:39.720
This is someone talking
about feeling stressed out

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.250
about being a CEO.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.030
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.810
- You know, it's a very
stressful environment.

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:45.310
It's sort of
high-risk, high-reward.

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:47.412
You've got a lot riding
on pulling it off,

00:46:47.412 --> 00:46:49.245
and that falls on the
CEO and on management.

00:46:49.245 --> 00:46:51.900
And you've got your
investors relying on you.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.410
You've got your employees who--

00:46:55.632 --> 00:46:57.840
that's their job, and they're
feeding their families,

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:58.900
and they're living.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:02.697
And so a lot of times, it
gets very close to the flame.

00:47:02.697 --> 00:47:03.280
[END PLAYBACK]

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.446
MATTHEW LIEBERMAN: OK, so
imagine that you're either

00:47:05.446 --> 00:47:06.960
feeling super jazzed
about the work

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.490
you're doing-- you're
right where you should be--

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:09.796
or you're feeling burned out.

00:47:09.796 --> 00:47:11.670
You're probably going
to experience these two

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:14.550
kinds of videos
differently based

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.264
on what's going on with
you in your life right now.

00:47:17.264 --> 00:47:18.930
And so that's what
we wanted to look at.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:21.630
So basically, everything
I'm going to show you

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.700
is from this same
medial prefrontal spot

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.500
that I've shown you in some of
the previous studies before.

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.130
It seems to be
associated with identity

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:32.670
and integrating things and
identifying with something

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:34.180
that you're taking in.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:38.430
And so what we see is that when
people are watching the what

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:42.000
do you love about what you do
types of videos, what we see

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.630
is that the engaged
CEOs and executives--

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:48.600
they show a fair amount of
synchrony with one another

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.260
in that condition.

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.050
But the folks who are
feeling burned out

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.700
don't really show
any synchrony when

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.430
they're watching these
folks talk about how excited

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:57.747
and engaged they are.

00:47:57.747 --> 00:48:00.330
When you see the folks talking
about being stressed and burned

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:02.850
out, now instead,
you see the burned

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:06.600
out folks who are sort
of stressed and feeling

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.960
the pressure-- these folks are
showing more synchrony with one

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.920
another than the
executives who are engaged

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.040
and thriving and so on.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.550
So putting that together,
what you essentially

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:21.570
see is that the engaged
CEOs show a lot more

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:24.960
synchrony for the engaged
videos, and the folks who

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.770
are feeling more burned out show
more synchrony with the burnout

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.870
videos, the stress videos.

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:33.690
And we were actually,
using very simple machine

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:38.010
learning classification,
able to classify about 85%

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:42.900
of the folks who were feeling
burned out as being burned out

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.010
based on their brain data.

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:47.760
And so I think that's
a promising thing

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.120
because doing this, you don't
actually have to go ask folks.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.520
We knew because we were
running that kind of study.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.020
But in the future,
it could be used

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:58.590
in an application where you
don't know in advance who's

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.240
feeling one way or the other.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.150
I'll just mention a couple of
the other applications of this

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:05.510
before I stop.

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:06.830
Dana Landis isn't here, right?

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:07.460
Is that right?

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.250
No, OK.

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:11.370
So Dana Landis is at
Google, but she's also

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:13.020
on our advisory board.

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:17.580
And so we've talked with her
about working towards solutions

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:18.840
for the diversity pipeline.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.190
I know you guys have it in tech.

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.840
We have it in academia.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.030
It's a genuine,
real issue that's

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:25.890
really, really hard to solve.

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:27.780
And one of the things
that we've talked

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:32.310
about is that you can go to
folks who aren't necessarily

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:34.836
getting exposed to
the best training

00:49:34.836 --> 00:49:36.960
and they're not getting it
in an environment-- say,

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:41.950
in an inner-city school
environment, elementary school,

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:44.820
middle school, and so on, where
not only are you not getting

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.220
it, but there's not a lot
of emphasis in the family

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.380
or among friends
to really cultivate

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.200
an attitude towards what
I should spend my time

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.121
and energy on is learning how
to do algebra or something

00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:55.620
like that.

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.300
It's just not
necessarily especially

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.790
valued, for understandable
reasons, in that context.

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:02.940
But if you can go
in and actually look

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.190
at who shows brain
responses when

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:07.740
they look at certain
mathematical or other types

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:11.160
of STEM concepts that even
look a bit more like folks who

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.230
have excelled in that
region, could you

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:16.500
identify aptitude in folks
who aren't going to show it

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:17.580
on traditional tests.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.800
And there's some reasons
to think that you actually

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.300
can do this.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.466
And so this is something
where if you could identify

00:50:22.466 --> 00:50:24.000
those folks when
they're young, you

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.790
could bring them over
summers to summer institutes

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:31.380
where they get some of the kinds
of exposure and norm setting

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.470
that would lead people to
get to a place like Google

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:36.630
where they probably
wouldn't otherwise.

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:39.300
And probably the idea that
I'm most excited about

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.520
is that if we can get data
from the other work we're

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.390
doing on what thriving,
engaged brains look

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:48.192
like in a bunch of
different careers,

00:50:48.192 --> 00:50:49.650
then you could
develop what we call

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:51.540
the neural guidance counselor,
where you could take

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.910
a 17-year-old who has no idea
what to do with their life--

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:55.620
and if you go to a regular
guidance counselor,

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:57.578
you're not going to get
any better idea of what

00:50:57.578 --> 00:50:58.542
to do with your life.

00:50:58.542 --> 00:51:00.750
I don't know that anyone's
ever had a good experience

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:02.010
with a guidance counselor.

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:04.680
They're either
neutral or creepy.

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.790
Like, those are the two options.

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:09.150
But what if you could
basically go find out,

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:12.690
OK, well, these are the things
where you, as a 17-year-old,

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:15.720
you look at certain things in
a way that's at least a bit

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.180
similar to people in
certain professions

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:21.990
who are both productive,
successful, and really happy

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:25.194
doing that job?

00:51:25.194 --> 00:51:27.360
There's lots of other things
to think about in terms

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.380
of team construction.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:30.810
So we had these
groups at Summit,

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.332
and they were having
conversations with each other.

00:51:33.332 --> 00:51:35.040
And there's lots of
interesting dynamics,

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.160
like we varied the gender
composition of the groups

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.312
across the sessions.

00:51:39.312 --> 00:51:41.020
And we don't have that
data analyzed yet,

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.020
but we're really,
really interested to see

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.940
how synchrony
profiles change when

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:48.187
it's zero women, one woman,
two women, three women, so on.

00:51:48.187 --> 00:51:49.770
That's going to be
really interesting.

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:53.550
Also, some of these people are
the same people who told us

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:55.200
they were feeling burned out.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.020
It turns out the people who
are feeling burned out also

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.900
reported being the least
interested and engaged

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.610
in what anyone else
had to say when

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:04.110
they were at these sessions.

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:07.620
So here's a way in which the
burnout feature is actually

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:10.864
having a genuine impact on the
way they interact with others.

00:52:10.864 --> 00:52:12.780
And when the folks who
were feeling burned out

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:16.770
was asked who was the most
interesting, engaging person

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:19.830
at the table, they were
much more likely than anyone

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:22.030
else to say, me.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:24.510
Most other people pointed to
someone else at the table--

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:25.530
I mean, in writing--

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:27.600
and said, oh, that person
was really interesting.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.600
But the folks who were
feeling burned out-- they

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.740
said, I guess I was the
only interesting person

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.210
at the table.

00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:37.692
Last thing is that there's
the obvious application

00:52:37.692 --> 00:52:39.150
that this actually
directly applies

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:42.450
to regular old matchmaking.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.880
And we've thought
about this a fair bit,

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.730
but we think that this gets
at a kind of compatibility

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:51.990
where when you use
Tinder or whatever else,

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:55.860
there's no measurement of
compatibility on match.com

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.260
or eharmony, who
even used to pretend

00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.430
that they did compatibility.

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:00.907
It turns out it wasn't.

00:53:00.907 --> 00:53:02.490
There's interesting
stories about that

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:04.140
that I won't go into.

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:07.020
But you can actually
measure compatibility

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.000
in a meaningful sort of way.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.950
You want to find people--

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:13.610
the person that you want to
find and spend your life with

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:15.750
is probably going
to be someone that

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:19.350
actually in meaningful ways
sees the world similarly

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:22.710
to the way you see it-- not
visually, but conceptually.

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:24.640
And this is a way
to get at that.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.750
And there is data that suggests
that this, in fact, can predict

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:29.880
who will become friends.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.190
And there's no reason to
think it couldn't predict

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:35.284
who would become friends
that are more than friends

00:53:35.284 --> 00:53:37.200
if you take into account
attraction and things

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.830
like that.

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:41.940
So I think that's a really
interesting feature of this

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:42.720
as well.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:48.300
So I know that at this
point, I have gone long.

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.413
And so I will stop
there and say thank you.

00:53:51.413 --> 00:53:53.621
And I'm happy to take any
questions if there are any.

00:53:53.621 --> 00:53:54.120
Thanks.

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:58.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:58.700
Yeah?

00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:01.690
AUDIENCE: So is there any sense
of what types of companies

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:03.080
increase social interactions?

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.790
What are the variables
that are relevant?

00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:06.230
One of the ones that
we talk about often

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:07.790
is the open workspace
environment.

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:10.250
There's a big study that
came out about it recently.

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:11.990
Are there other
things like that that

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:14.790
are useful when it comes to
increasing social interaction

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:15.440
in a good way?

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.706
MATTHEW LIEBERMAN: Yeah, sure.

00:54:17.706 --> 00:54:19.400
And I've given
talks for companies

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:23.300
about creating agile workspaces
where nobody has their own desk

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.770
or anything like that.

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:28.152
It kind of seems like a disaster
to do that for lots of reasons.

00:54:28.152 --> 00:54:30.110
I think anyone who works
in one of those spaces

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:33.440
knows you get a roomful of
people wearing headphones.

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.360
But people also
feel a bit better

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:36.800
if they have some
space ownership.

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.900
It turns out a lot
of the motivation

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.540
for making those kinds of
spaces is that the company can

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:42.890
lease a lot less space.

00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:44.723
Because when you're not
there, somebody else

00:54:44.723 --> 00:54:46.490
can sit at the same desk, right?

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:49.310
Now, there is
evidence that suggests

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:53.420
that putting people in
proximity to each other

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.450
is really important.

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:57.320
So Humanyze-- who did the
thing with the water cooler,

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:58.602
15-minute breaks, and so on--

00:54:58.602 --> 00:55:00.810
one of the other studies
they did is they looked at--

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:03.654
I think this was with
Deutsche Bank or some bank.

00:55:03.654 --> 00:55:04.820
It may not be Deutsche Bank.

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:07.430
I may just have that
on the brain lately.

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:11.540
But they had different banks
where in some of the banks,

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:16.130
everyone who worked in a certain
division was on the same floor.

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.500
And in some companies,
they were just

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.720
on slightly different
floors, like one floor

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:24.410
apart with a stairwell
internal to it connecting them.

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:25.910
And there were
dramatic differences.

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:29.870
They managed to convince
them to switch one of these

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:32.940
to one of these, and the
productivity went way up.

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:34.580
And that seems to
be due to the fact

00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:38.480
that now you've created a better
case for social permeability

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.130
so that people can connect
more easily and so on.

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:45.800
I think the other thing is that
we tend to just not think about

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:46.910
it very much.

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:48.170
And so it's easy to do.

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.800
I run a lab.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:53.780
It's easy for me to forget that,
in some sense, part of my job

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:57.290
is providing for and creating
the right social atmosphere.

00:55:57.290 --> 00:56:00.500
We think, well, I provide
my students with resources.

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:04.170
And I try to give them good
advice and wisdom and so on.

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:05.810
But this is also
where they're living

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:08.120
part of their social
life for several years.

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.450
We spend so many hours at work.

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:13.070
That has to have some
of the same features

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:15.080
that we look for
outside of work.

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.514
And I think that
companies sort of

00:56:16.514 --> 00:56:17.930
think, well, I
don't want to spend

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:19.680
extra money on those things.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.490
But it turns out you're not
because it reduces burnout.

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:25.100
It reduces-- so it's a
good play for the company,

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:29.190
but it's also really good for
the people who work there.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:32.570
AUDIENCE: fNIRS--
yeah, so I'm just

00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:35.660
thinking whether it could be
useful for personal, emotional

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.200
development.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.570
How much does it cost, and
have you thought about that?

00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:41.570
MATTHEW LIEBERMAN: Sure.

00:56:44.147 --> 00:56:45.980
OK, so there is a couple
of answers to this.

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:49.670
One is there's a lot of
fly-by-night equipment

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:53.150
out on the market right now,
and the vast majority of it

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:54.710
is junk.

00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:57.890
So there's a bunch of
portable EEG things

00:56:57.890 --> 00:57:00.740
where you get a single lead
that doesn't actually connect

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.750
the right way to the scalp.

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:05.180
You're supposed to use
certain kinds of leads

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.875
that those don't because
they're messy and expensive.

00:57:07.875 --> 00:57:09.500
And so there's a lot
of stuff out there

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.900
that's junk that
people are using that--

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.700
I'm sure there's some
signal, but it's also

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:16.260
a signal swamped by noise.

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.820
fNIRS, like anything, has
some signal, some noise.

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:22.070
But I've been convinced
that the signal

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:25.430
is meaningful at this
point, although we're still

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:27.170
testing those things.

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:30.690
In terms of using
them for personal use,

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:35.570
I do think that that is a
plausible longer time horizon

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:36.110
scenario.

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:39.472
Right now they are a
bit clunky to set up.

00:57:39.472 --> 00:57:41.180
You need a technician
there to set it up.

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:42.805
I don't know that
you could effectively

00:57:42.805 --> 00:57:45.170
set up your own right now.

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:48.470
But we are working with hardware
companies about engineering

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:50.810
plans for how to make this
more consumer-friendly

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:52.312
at some point down the road.

00:57:52.312 --> 00:57:54.770
So I think maybe in five years
we might be looking at that.

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:59.180
If you wanted to buy
one for yourself,

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:01.550
the lowest-end one
that I would think

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:06.390
is really worth using is
probably about $100,000.

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:08.630
There's toy ones that
you can get for $50,000,

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:11.840
but I really do think they
are toys and very, very

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.460
limited in what they can do.

00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:16.880
$100,000 would basically
get you with pretty good

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.650
signal your prefrontal
cortex, and then it

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:21.090
doubles and triples
and so on from there.

00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:23.780
And then in terms of the
other part of the question,

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:27.230
could you use it for personal
emotional development,

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:29.600
it would take something
really rigorous, I think,

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.390
set up by some kind of
company to make that work.

00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:36.410
I don't think you could just sit
there and stare at your signal

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:38.960
and say, OK, I'm going to
work these parts in my brain,

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.985
and have that be
terribly meaningful.

00:58:40.985 --> 00:58:41.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.690
MATTHEW LIEBERMAN: Yeah,
so we actually right now

00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:47.210
are starting our collaboration
with a clinical psychologist

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:49.580
at UCLA, Michelle
Craske, where we're

00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:54.050
going to have both the therapist
and the client wear fNIRS

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:54.860
during--

00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:58.200
they do, like, 12 sessions,
12 weeks of sessions.

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.050
And so they're going
to do it in week 1,

00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:03.440
I think, week 3, 6, 9, and 12.

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.450
And so we're very
interested in how

00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:07.910
the dynamics both
within the individuals

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:10.760
and across the individuals
change over time

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:13.730
and how that predicts
who feels like they've

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:15.980
gotten the most out of it
and also who sticks with it.

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:17.521
Because most people
actually drop out

00:59:17.521 --> 00:59:19.250
before they get to
what therapists say

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:22.410
should be the natural
stopping point.

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:25.890
AUDIENCE: I also have
a question about fNIRS.

00:59:25.890 --> 00:59:27.750
So the first thing
that popped in my head

00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:30.208
when you mentioned that it
could be used to measure burnout

00:59:30.208 --> 00:59:32.150
when people don't actually
actively report it

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:34.800
is something like
"Black Mirror."

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.060
Not to bias you,
but I was wondering,

00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:38.880
what do you see as
practically a way

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:43.292
to get people to get
their burnout measured

00:59:43.292 --> 00:59:44.500
or something similar to that?

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:45.600
And what are the
ethical implications

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.710
of being able to do that?

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:49.080
MATTHEW LIEBERMAN: Right,
so that's a good question.

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:53.562
We get the burnout, the "Black
Mirror" comment very regularly.

00:59:53.562 --> 00:59:55.020
We actually, at
some point, thought

00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.105
about naming the
company something that

00:59:57.105 --> 00:59:58.980
would be an inside joke
about "Black Mirror",

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.870
like something from one
of the episodes just

01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:05.280
to be really like, yep,
that's where we live.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.480
And I think that
really depends on how

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.030
a company wants to
pitch what they're

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:14.610
doing to their employees.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:17.790
So if finding out
folks are burned out

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:20.500
is then used in some
threatening way,

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.530
then that's not really
good for anyone.

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:25.770
But if it's used in a way
to direct more resources

01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:29.520
and to help folks who are
vulnerable for leaving

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.070
the company or who might
benefit from certain types

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:34.860
of interventions, then
that's something that I think

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.210
is probably more positive.

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:38.029
But I totally agree
that there's some uses

01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:40.320
of what we're doing, like
the neural guidance counselor

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.251
thing--

01:00:41.251 --> 01:00:43.500
that's a pure benefit for
anyone who goes and does it.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.320
If you're 17 and you go
and do this, you get told,

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.470
you're a 90% match with this
and a 30% match with that

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:50.900
and do with that what you want.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.650
But you might not have
known these things.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:54.360
A lot of us grow
up thinking, well,

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.920
I should do what my parents
did, or something like that.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.370
Or we get into a random
internship after college

01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:02.440
and suddenly, that's our
career 20 years later.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.620
This is a way to sort
of try out things

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.240
that you could never
go try out on your own.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.290
So I think that there's a range
of different applications.

01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:14.250
And some of them, I think that
folks who want to use this

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:16.560
will have to think about,
well, what are the benefits

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.490
that a person gets?

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:19.290
And there are lots of
potential benefits.

01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:21.555
So you could get
information yourself

01:01:21.555 --> 01:01:23.430
that relates not
necessarily just to burnout.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.530
If you're feeling burned
out, you probably know that.

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:26.904
But there's a lot
of other things

01:01:26.904 --> 01:01:29.670
about the extent to which you
show certain kinds of skills

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:31.530
and aptitudes and so on.

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:33.780
People love things
like the Myers-Briggs,

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.380
even though it's complete junk.

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.650
It doesn't actually tell
you anything meaningfully.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:42.554
Any psychometrician will say,
don't ever, ever use that.

01:01:42.554 --> 01:01:44.220
But people are really,
really interested

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:47.389
because they want to get this
kind of standardized feedback.

01:01:47.389 --> 01:01:48.930
And I think that is
one of the things

01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:50.520
that this could be used to do.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.270
We haven't done
that specifically,

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:54.930
but I think it could be used
in some of those domains.

01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:57.450
And it could be
used to see if you

01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:59.891
qualify to get certain kinds
of trainings or promotions

01:01:59.891 --> 01:02:00.390
or whatever.

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:02.207
So you could have
your brain scan-- so

01:02:02.207 --> 01:02:03.790
imagine the neural
guidance counselor,

01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:06.210
and it says, you're a
great match for this.

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:08.460
But you don't test well
and things like that.

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:11.460
This could become, in
part, a partial substitute,

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.440
where you say, well,
I don't test well,

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.510
but I'll probably do
the actual thing well.

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:17.130
Because my brain
looks like the people

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:18.900
who do the actual thing well.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.710
That's an interesting
possibility.

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:23.490
LUKE: And on behalf of Google,
I would like to thank Matt.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:26.000
I would also like to say
UCLA's very lucky to have you,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.230
and we are very lucky to
have you for this hour.

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:29.140
MATTHEW LIEBERMAN:
Thank you, Luke.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:29.700
LUKE: Thank you so much.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.000
MATTHEW LIEBERMAN: All right.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.958
LUKE: Thanks, everyone.

01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:34.250
[APPLAUSE]
