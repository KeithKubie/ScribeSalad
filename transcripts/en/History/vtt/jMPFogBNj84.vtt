00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.200
NARRATOR: Although completely
invisible to the naked eye,

00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:08.141
a virtual universe of
electromagnetic waves

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:11.611
permeates our entire world.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.147
And this vast
network of impulses

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.649
carries within it
information and data

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:19.519
that we have come to depend
on in our digital age.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.155
[music playing]

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.557
It is the backbone of
what is otherwise referred

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.660
to as the cloud,
which remotely stores

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:30.763
billions of gigabytes of data.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.232
When we think about the cloud
what we're really talking about

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:37.170
is data transfer,
information transfer.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.706
You're sending bits of
information through the air,

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.144
wirelessly, up to satellites
down to servers, back again,

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:46.412
into your computer,
into your phone.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:49.549
And there's close
to 7 billion people

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.318
using cloud computing now.

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:55.455
So you can imagine that pretty
much anywhere on the planet

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.190
that has internet
access, you're going

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:01.194
to find these hidden, sort
of, secret patterns and codes

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.328
that are floating around us.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:05.731
[music playing]

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:08.167
NARRATOR: According
to historians,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.604
the concept of an
Intergalactic Computer Network

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:18.144
was first proposed by scientist,
J.C.R Licklider, in the 1960s.

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:20.613
However, ancient
astronaut theorists

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:25.218
suggest that the idea may
actually trace all the way back

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.820
to our ancient past.

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:30.690

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:35.895
NARRATOR: Korva
island, Raichur, India.

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:38.764
Religious pilgrims
seeking enlightened wisdom

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:41.200
travel here to a
temple dedicated

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:45.171
to the celestial sage, Narada.

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.473
According to the
Hindu scriptures,

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.876
Narada had the
supernatural ability

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.478
to gain access to
a hidden domain

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:55.748
that most humans are
completely unaware of,

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:57.783
the realm of cosmic knowledge.

00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:00.286
[music playing]

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:04.524
Tales about Narada appear
in the Mahabharata, in

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:07.627
the Ramayana, in the Puranas.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.397
Tradition has it that Narada
transcendent consciousness

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.536
to gather his stories and give
teachings of great wisdom.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.473
DEEPAK SHIMKHADA: Narada
is called Narada Rishi.

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:25.745
Rishis are like sages
in Western concept.

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:29.382
So they have gained
this ability to be

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.418
able to tap into the
knowledge, access

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.420
that knowledge directly
from the cosmos.

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:36.389
[music playing]

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:40.927
Narada is interesting
specifically that he clearly

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.434
had access to an essential
knowledge that is at the fabric

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:49.969
of the divine cosmic order.

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.739
[music playing]

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.511
NARRATOR: This idea of an
otherworldly repository

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:01.714
of cosmic information is
most commonly referred

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:06.252
to today as the Akashic record.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:11.324
The term was coined in 1883
by author Alfred Percy Sinnett

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:15.461
in his book,
"Esoteric Buddhism."

00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:18.331
In it, he describes how
according to Eastern

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:21.334
philosophy, universal
records physically

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.836
exist in the ever
pervasive realm known

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.339
as the Akasa, which
can be accessed

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.740
by enlightened individuals.

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:29.842
[music playing]

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.846
DEEPAK SHIMKHADA: Akashic
is a Sanskrit word.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.581
It means the sky.

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:40.453
So Akashic records can be
considered as cosmic knowledge.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:43.623
So it is belonging
to the cosmos.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:44.991
Everything is
written in the sky.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:48.628
It's not belonging
to human beings.

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:53.366
You simply cannot go and
bring it in a tangible form.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:57.003
It's something that can be
accessed through your mind,

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:58.704
through your brain
power, through

00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:00.306
your spiritual wavelength.

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.509
[music playing]

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:07.713
The Akashic feel it's the
immeasurable potential of all

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:09.812
that was, is, and will ever be.
