00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.750
Well, guess I should stop looking for my smart gene.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.620
&gt;&gt; Oh, Lauren, I wouldn't give up completely. I mean,

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.990
intelligence is complex. But, if you determine heritability first, and then

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.100
perform a genetic association study, you might have some luck

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.990
at determining multiple genetic factors that are associated with the trait.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.730
&gt;&gt; I'm assuming this works with other complex

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.410
traits such as schizophrenia, anorexia, or even obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.430
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, in theory.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.580
Although we focused on the traits of risk for breast

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.280
cancer, height, and bipolar disorder, it should be understood that

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.580
the conclusions drawn and the methods used here would apply

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.810
to a whole host of other complex traits as well.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.390
&gt;&gt; Well in that case, I think I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.600
need to start my own genome-wide association study.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.890
&gt;&gt; Oh, and what are you interested in searching for?

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.600
&gt;&gt; Why some people prefer beer. Why some people prefer wine.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.400
&gt;&gt; Oh, I think you're definitely going to enjoy our next lesson then.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.880
In the next lession, we're going to determine why and how differences

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.790
in our genomes can result in our various responses to particular drugs.
