00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.590
So now let's actually
look at translation,

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.330
something I had ignored before.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.440
This is the way, the best way,
I can actually translate an image or

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.600
pixel points on an image.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.100
Right?
Take any x and y value, and

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.220
actually have to give a translation,
tx and ty.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.990
This simple addition would actually give
me newer x and ys, x prime, y prime.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.890
Notice that this matrix representation
does not allow me to reconstruct this.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.480
Right?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.680
Because in this matrix representation,
shown by this, when I do a multi,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.270
a matrix multiply becomes ax plus by for
x prime.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.760
X prime would basically
become ax plus by.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.900
And similarly,
y prime would become cx plus dy.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.850
Notice almost impossible in this linear
combination formulation that we've

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.680
looked at that we can generate
an equation that matches this.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.910
In essence, these terms are additive.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.340
As opposed,
these are linear combinations.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.380
So then, question to all of you,
how do we resolve this?

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.180
How do we come up with a way,
in this form of a matrix representation,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.630
that will allow us to encode
things like translation?
