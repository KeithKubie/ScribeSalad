Next up, Tweet the Press.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.273
It looks like angrier Lorax,
Donald Trump,

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:09.009
-might be the first president...
-(laughter)

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.411
-JAMES: Oh, God. -of the
great-again States of America

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.614
to avoid the media
by holding press conferences

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:14.948
solely on social media.

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:17.117
It's like his own weekly
<i>Tweet the Press.</i>

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.819
He even explained why he tweets

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.054
in a tweet he tweeted yesterday
on Twitter.

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.357
"If the press would cover me
accurately and honorably,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.026
I would have far less reason
to 'tweet.'" Quote, unquote.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.428
"Sadly, I don't know
if that will ever happen!"

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.764
Wha...? Meow!

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.733
Take that, the press!

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.069
So, comedians, I want to know
what Donald Trump will say

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:37.938
on the next <i>Tweet the Press.</i>

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.574
-(bird tweeting)
-(news show music playing)

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:47.114
Eh, that was... that was all
the rest of our year's budget.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.382
(laughter)

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.018
-Mike Lawrence.
-Does anyone know how to run

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.153
the world's
most powerful government?

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:53.253
-Asking for a friend.
-Yeah, all right.
