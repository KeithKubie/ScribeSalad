MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for
being here everybody.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.230
We're very lucky today to have
David Kilcullen as our guest.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.709
And by the way,
before I forget, I

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.500
want to give a special
shout out to the men

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.480
of the 23rd marine regiment
who are here as our guests.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.630
Thank you for your service.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.750
David Kilcullen is a
counter insurgency expert.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.620
He first, at least,
came to my attention

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.630
as part of the surge
in Iraq in 2007,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.750
but his resume goes
much deeper than that.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.430
Today, he's going to talk
about what he's doing nowadays,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.300
which involves some work with
Google, actually, on Syria.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.650
He's been adviser to General
David Petraeus and Condoleezza

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.440
Rice and is now operating a
consulting service in Virginia

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.970
where he deals with all sorts
of interesting stuff, which

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.909
he'll be happy to
tell you about.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.950
So please give a warm
welcome to David Kilcullen.

00:00:58.815 --> 00:00:59.940
DAVID KILCULLEN: Thank you.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.340
It's actually great to be here
on such a beautiful day in San

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.940
Francisco.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.356
I was talking to
a guy last night.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:07.142
He said the problem with San
Francisco is it makes you lazy.

00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:08.350
I was like, what do you mean?

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.027
He was like well,
yesterday I woke up,

00:01:10.027 --> 00:01:12.110
and I had all this work
to do, but then I thought,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.318
I think I'm just going to
go for a hike with my wife.

00:01:14.318 --> 00:01:16.350
And I blew off the
whole-- and I'm like,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.480
I can totally see that.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.590
Every time I get off
the plane in California,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.390
I'm like, why don't
we live here again?

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.580
So thank you for spending an
hour of a beautiful day inside

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.005
with me when you could be out
doing a bunch of other stuff.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.380
Obviously, I just wrote this
book, which is why I'm here.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.490
But I thought what I
would do is just hit up

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.190
some of the main
ideas in the book

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.410
rather than try to give
you a full download,

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.280
and then maybe in Q&amp;A we can
kick those around, and discuss

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.460
some of the main stuff
that comes out of it,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.990
and see what you guys are most
interested in talking about.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.510
I began writing the book
in September of 2009

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.501
after getting ambushed
in Afghanistan.

00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:59.000
It's not the first, or in fact,
the last time that I've been

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.180
ambushed in Afghanistan,
but this particular one

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.260
was interesting.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.060
It was the classic late
afternoon ambush scenario

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.479
that you get in Afghanistan,
because most of Eastern

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.930
Afghanistan has a very, very
narrow set of valleys that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.740
have settlement patterns
of-- basically people live

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.160
in the bottom of the valleys.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.350
Nobody lives on the
mountains themselves,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.127
and there's usually only
one road running down

00:02:22.127 --> 00:02:23.210
the middle of each valley.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.002
So if you go up that
valley in the morning,

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:26.835
essentially everyone
in that whole community

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:29.022
knows exactly where you're
going to be at 4 o'clock

00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:29.730
in the afternoon.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.720
You're going to be
driving down the valley.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.150
And in fact, Afghan
families have ambush spots

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.230
like families in
the Chesapeake Bay

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.250
have fishing spots
or families out here.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.440
They don't have to go through
the full complex planning

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.630
process that an
infantry small unit does

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.420
when it decides to do an ambush.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.750
They basically say hey, Abdul.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.810
Get to the ambush spot.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.268
Because they have three or four
of them already picked out.

00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:57.280
In fact, I was in another
ambush earlier in my career

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.280
in Afghanistan where we actually
found old 303 ammunition

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.870
from British rifles
that went out

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.262
of service in the 19th century
up in these firing positions

00:03:06.262 --> 00:03:08.220
on either side of the
road, so they'd obviously

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.771
been using this ambush site
for some considerable time.

00:03:12.771 --> 00:03:15.270
But I'm in the middle of this
ambush, and I think to myself,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.840
this is a pretty bad ambush.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.582
I've become a bit of an
involuntary connoisseur

00:03:20.582 --> 00:03:22.040
over the years,
and I actually used

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.630
to teach ambushing
at the tactics school

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.190
when I was captain.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.750
So I'm like, if these were my
students on the battle course,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.570
I would have failed them
for their ambush plan.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.100
It was just very
badly put together.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.220
It didn't come-- it
just didn't work.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.030
Anyway, we get to the
bottom of the valley,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.670
and I'm talking to my
driver of my Amrep, which

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.805
is like a big
armored garbage truck

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:45.910
that we drive around
in Afghanistan.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.010
And the driver says
to gunner, hey,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.287
how many Taliban guys
do you reckon we killed?

00:03:50.287 --> 00:03:52.620
And I was like, well, how do
you know they were Taliban?

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.020
And they were like, dude,
they were shooting at us.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.270
And it took me a little while.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.110
I was actually on the
helicopter ride back afterwards.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.222
But I began to think maybe this
attack had actually nothing

00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:03.180
to do with the Taliban.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.013
And when I started to
think about what we've

00:04:05.013 --> 00:04:07.940
been doing in that valley for
the preceding two or three

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.640
years, and the way that we
laid down a series of projects

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.090
to help the community, and how
that had actually dis-empowered

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.140
other people in the
community and created

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.600
a big imbalance of resources
going into some villages

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.210
and into others, I started to
realize that actually there's

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.040
a lot more that meets the
eye in a place like Eastern

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.300
Afghanistan around
stuff like contracting,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.080
and around denial of
access to services,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.550
and the way that people
interact with this giant tsunami

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.150
of contracting and aid money
that comes into Afghanistan.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.800
About 14 times the size of the
total Afghan government budget

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.690
is our aid programming
in Afghanistan.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.320
And I began to write
this book, trying

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.852
to think beyond the paradigm
of counter insurgency,

00:04:56.852 --> 00:04:59.060
and for those people that
are in the military, that's

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.110
like anathema.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.610
Like, what?

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.580
Dave Kilcullen?

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.940
Didn't you write a book
on counter insurgency?

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.990
Yes, but it's just a book,
and we have this paradigm

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.440
that we built, because it helped
us to win a conflict in Iraq,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.410
and it helped us
to win a variety

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.987
of smaller fights
in other places.

00:05:17.987 --> 00:05:19.570
But that doesn't
mean that it's dogma,

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.910
and that's the answer forever.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.910
Like any other human
model or mental picture

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.990
of an environment, all it is is
a systematic oversimplification

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.540
of very complex reality.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.230
And over time, when
you start to see

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.070
data that don't fit
with your model,

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.490
it's time to update the model.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.190
And so what I've been doing over
the past three or four years

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.230
is thinking beyond
that and actually

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.230
reaching back into some
work that I previously

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.960
did when I was in the
Australian military looking

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.489
at urbanized
environments, and I'm

00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:52.280
going to talk about
that a lot in a minute,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.870
but I just want to
set the context.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.340
Ever since 9/11, the military
in particular, but also

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.800
aid agencies,
diplomatic services,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.110
a variety of other
organizations have

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.540
gotten really good
at the kind of stuff

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.240
that I was doing in
Eastern Afghanistan when

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.430
I got shot up in 2009.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.100
Remote environments,
tribal communities,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.950
landlocked countries
like Afghanistan,

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.320
the work that we do in little
remote frontier outposts

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.270
has become, I think,
dramatically better quality

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.270
than it was a decade ago.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.870
But if you look
at the environment

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.520
that we've been operating
in, its very specific.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.860
Afghanistan's a very
diffuse conflict.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.220
The conflict mostly happens
in rural environments,

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.640
not in the cities.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.950
It happens in this land
locked, mountainous arid, not

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.560
very heavily
populated environment.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.970
And most importantly,
it's a very low bandwidth,

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.600
low conductivity environment.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.710
Most people don't
have the ability

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.914
to tap into an extensive
cellphone network, or access

00:06:55.914 --> 00:06:57.830
to the internet, or any
of the sorts of things

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.926
that we take for granted
in the modern urban world.

00:07:02.926 --> 00:07:04.300
So as I was
researching the book,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.170
I started to think
to myself, what's

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.030
going to happen
after Afghanistan?

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.674
Now, it's become fashionable
in the politics world

00:07:11.674 --> 00:07:13.090
and the foreign
policy discussions

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.750
in Washington to act like
the war in Afghanistan

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.380
is already over, like
we don't currently

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.685
have all these troops out
there fighting and dying

00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:23.060
on the ground, or diplomats
doing the work they're doing,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.710
or aid agencies or
other people doing

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.700
the hard work in Afghanistan,
like that's all finished.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.519
Actually, our friends
are still out there doing

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:33.060
this stuff on the
ground, and I think

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.802
it's really important
to not forget that.

00:07:35.802 --> 00:07:37.770
That said, it's pretty
clear that the conflict

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.400
is going to start winding
down in the next year or two,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.280
and it's worth
asking yourself what

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.990
does the future
environment look like?

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.980
Does it look like
Afghanistan, or does it

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.460
look like something else?

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:54.110
And a lot of the book is my
exploration of that question.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.660
When I look at the future
environment, what I see

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.540
is a very high
degree of what you

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.070
might call operational
continuity.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.780
The stuff that we
do, we will keep

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.170
on doing mostly
that kind of stuff

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.870
in the future environment.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.329
As an example of that, if you
go back in US military history

00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:14.620
to about the middle of the
19th century around the time

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.160
of the Mexican War, and
you start a timeline then,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.170
and you run it
forward to now, you

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.020
find a really, really consistent
pattern in US military history

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:28.290
where we do a large scale or
long duration irregular warfare

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.890
campaign about once
every 20 to 25 years,

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.654
and we do small ones on a
scale of Kosovo, or East Timor,

00:08:35.654 --> 00:08:39.780
or Sierra Leone about once
every 5 to 10 years in between.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.480
And that patent is not
only very consistent

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.490
and appears to be totally
unaffected by policymakers'

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.640
preferences.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.090
So beginning of last
year, President Obama

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.420
gave direction to
the US military

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.920
where he said we're
going to get out

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.770
of the business of doing
large scale, long duration

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.069
stabilization operations
or counter insurgencies.

00:08:58.069 --> 00:09:00.360
He said we're not going to
structure the force for that

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.780
anymore.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.160
Turns out President Clinton
said basically the same thing

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.240
in 1992.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.920
Candidate George W. Bush
said the same thing in 2000.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.300
President Johnson said
the same thing in 1964.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.920
You can run this
back, and you'll

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.874
find about seven presidents in
the 20th century alone making

00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:19.290
basically the same
comment, and it

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.970
has zero effect on
how often we get

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.000
into these kinds of conflicts.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.410
Across the planet since the
end of the Napoleonic Wars,

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:32.020
roughly 80% of all conflict
has been intrastate--

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.700
that is within communities,
within one country-- or it's

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.940
involved a non-state armed group
like pirates, or insurgents,

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:45.350
or some other kind of combatant
that is not a nation state.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.390
So that is in fact-- that's
the typical environment that we

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.410
operate or the stereotypical
type of work that we do.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.906
But the environment that
we've operated in the past

00:09:55.906 --> 00:09:58.030
is not the environment that
we're going to look at.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:02.750
So operational continuity
but a strong environmental

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.180
discontinuity
between what's coming

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.410
and what we've been
doing in the last decade,

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.080
this landlocked remote
rural environment.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.550
Now, American forces,
particularly the army

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.420
and the Marine Corps were
very heavily involved

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.370
in urban fighting in Iraq.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.080
So talking to an
American audience,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.980
it's easy to think that actually
we have a lot of experience

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.150
globally in urban operations.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.920
That's actually not true.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.350
There were 50 countries in
Iraq, 51 in Afghanistan,

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.480
but only one of those
that it was involved

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.600
in any significant
urban fighting

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.470
was the American
military in Baghdad.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.830
When I deployed to
Baghdad in-- I'm

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.010
sorry-- and Ramadi and
all the other areas

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.880
around that in the
American sector.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.880
When I deployed to Baghdad in
February of 2007, at that time,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.010
more than 50% of total combat
action in the war in Iraq

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.850
was happening inside
Baghdad city limits,

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.840
which is a purely US theater.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.570
Everybody else engaged
in the conflict

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.550
was out in more remote
rural environments,

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.800
where frankly there was a
lot less violence going on.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.210
So for most of the 50
countries that we're in Iraq,

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.370
normal is not urban.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:13.840
Normal is farms, little
villages, rural districts,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.970
not a lot of fighting, more like
peacekeeping and stabilization.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.400
And for everybody that
went to Afghanistan,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.800
you're dealing with this
rural diffuse environment.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.530
But looking forward,
I see four big trends

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.230
that are actually
changing the environment

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.080
and will shape how we operate or
where we operate in the future,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.540
and those trends are population,
urbanization, littoralization--

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.850
which is just the tendency
for things to cluster

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:47.140
on coastlines-- and then
most importantly electronic

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.800
network connectivity.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.480
Now, those first
three trends are old.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.090
They've been around for at least
200 years since the beginning

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.420
of the European
Industrial Revolution.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.520
They're also very
well understood

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.771
in the military in particular.

00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:01.603
Let me just talk about
them briefly before I

00:12:01.603 --> 00:12:03.610
go to what I think is
the more important one,

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.960
which is connectivity.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.260
So, population growth, at the
beginning of the US Industrial

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.618
Revolution in 17-- sorry,
the European Industrial

00:12:11.618 --> 00:12:15.670
Revolution in 1750, the total
population of the planet

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.460
was about 750 million people.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.600
It took 150 years
for that population

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.630
to double through
the first century

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.110
and a half of industrialization
and the invention of things

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.990
like new ways to think
about irrigation, new ways

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.730
to think about crops,
concentration of population

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.220
in urban environments,
improvements in public health.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.450
All those sorts of things led to
this population growth process

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.390
that began in the middle
of the 18th century.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.830
By 1900, we were at
1.5 billion people,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.910
so we doubled the population of
the planet in about 150 years.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:57.480
We then doubled that population
again in only 60 years by 1960,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.920
so we get to 3 billion
people on the planet in 1960.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.590
And it's worth noting that
that second doubling happened

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.780
during the same time
frame as both world wars

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.270
and a major influenza pandemic
across the entire planet, which

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.880
between them killed
about 150 million, mainly

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.170
young and healthy people.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.580
So despite that, we saw this
doubling by 1960 to 3 billion.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.390
The population then doubled
again by the year 2000

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.170
to 6 billion, and in just
the dozen years since then,

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.290
we've added slightly more
than a billion people.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.020
So today, were looking at
around about 7 billion people

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.130
on the planet.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.000
Projecting that forward is not
a matter of simple prediction,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.400
it's a matter of looking at
the demographic bell curve,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.840
and where people are right now,
and where the population growth

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.140
is likely to take us.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.314
But the Bureau of Economic
and Social Affairs at the UN

00:13:47.314 --> 00:13:48.730
and a bunch of
other organizations

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.742
that look at the stuff
project that by the middle

00:13:51.742 --> 00:13:53.450
of the century we're
looking at something

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.920
like 9.5 billion
people on the planet,

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.659
so about another 2.5 billion
people between now and 2050.

00:14:01.659 --> 00:14:03.450
There is a projection
that the population's

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.710
going to top out at
around that level

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.700
and stay at essentially
9.5 billion by 2050.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.400
That's based on
certain assumptions

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.140
about what happens to birth
rate when GDP increases,

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.820
and they may not
actually play out.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.680
So we're looking at least
2 1/2 billion more people

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.870
on the planet in our generation.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.920
The second factor,
though, is urbanization.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.920
So if you go back again to the
beginning of the Industrial

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.940
Revolution and you think
about the population

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.520
of the planet at
that time, roughly 2%

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.370
of people on the
earth in 1800 lived

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.490
in a city of a million or more.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.150
By 1900, it was 10%.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.610
By 1960, it was 25%.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.450
By April of 2008, it was 50%.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.140
We're currently
sitting somewhere north

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.640
of 50% urbanization
on the planet,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.350
so roughly half the
people on the planet

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.440
live in a city of
a million or more.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.690
Again, the same projections
suggest that by 2050 we'll

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.990
be looking at somewhere between
65% and 75% urbanization.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.390
So somewhere around the current
population of the planet--

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.190
7 billion people-- will
be living in a large city

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.580
by the middle of the century.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.490
Interestingly, that
urbanization process

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.260
is not only going to account
for all the gross population

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.244
growth on the planet.

00:15:21.244 --> 00:15:23.160
It's also going to account
for a lot of people

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.410
leaving rural
environments and moving

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.220
to the cities between now and
the middle of the century.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.120
So actually the
urban environment

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.600
is going to grow by roughly
3 billion people between now

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.110
and the middle of the century.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.800
Roughly 1 1/2 million people
per week migrate from a country

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.940
area to a city, so roughly the
same number of people that it

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.610
took all of human history
until 1960 to generate across

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.070
the entire planet are going to
move to cities within the next

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.780
30 years.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.870
Edgar Peters, who's the
head of the Africa City

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.900
Center in Cape Town
in South Africa,

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.690
says we're looking at dramatic
disruptive change in just one

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.950
generation because of that
urbanization and population

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.520
growth.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.362
That's not all, though.

00:16:08.362 --> 00:16:10.010
Those urban
environments will not

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.400
be evenly distributed across
the surface of the earth.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.500
They'll be almost entirely
in the developing world

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.710
in low and middle
income countries.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.730
This is not a
phenomenon that we see

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.290
in Europe and the United States.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.910
It's a phenomenon of sub-Saharan
Africa, that Mediterranean

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.650
basin, South Asia, Latin
America, and the Caribbean.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.900
It's not evenly distributed.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.680
It's developing world cities.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.380
And those cities
are overwhelmingly

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.350
located on coastlines for
reasons of basic physics.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.400
When you want to move
heavy large stuff around,

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.570
for all of you in
history and still now,

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.460
it's been a hell of a lot easier
to move that around by water

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.540
than on land.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.210
So cities have tended to cluster
against large bodies of water

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.290
on rivers, on major
river deltas, lakes,

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.570
or on coastlines.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.280
Already today, 80% of
people on the planet

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.312
live within 50 miles of the sea.

00:17:02.312 --> 00:17:05.369
And of course, we're dealing
with what systems theorists

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.710
would call sensitivity to
initial conditions here.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.160
So as urbanization
takes place, it's

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.660
not happening against
the background

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.490
of an evenly distributed
human population.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.380
Cities are already
on coastlines,

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.460
so as people move
to existing cities,

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.730
they're going to be
moving to coastlines.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.480
So we're going to see
a population that's

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.450
incredibly clustered in urban
environments in third world

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:29.760
cities on coastlines.

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:34.110
Obviously, that
changes the environment

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.282
in which we operate, but
actually the military well

00:17:36.282 --> 00:17:37.740
understood this
stuff 25 years ago.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.990
So a marine general
called Krulak

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:43.170
wrote about a thing called a
three block war in the 1990s,

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.955
and he had guys like Ralph
Peters and Robert Scales--

00:17:45.955 --> 00:17:47.455
and these are all
military theorists

00:17:47.455 --> 00:17:50.990
that I'm mentioning-- who really
focused on the problems of what

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.090
we call the urban littoral
back in the 1990s.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.340
And I read some stuff on this.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.882
It was pretty well understood
in the community at that point.

00:17:58.882 --> 00:18:00.340
But what's happened
is the military

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:04.190
since 9/11 has been dragged off
into this other environment.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.360
Now, I wouldn't call Afghanistan
a geographical fluke.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.960
There are deserts, and
mountains, and jungles

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.650
where conflict is going
to occur in the future,

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.490
but because conflict
tends to happen where

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.090
people live and the
general parameters

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.760
of human civilization shape
the parameters within which

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.400
conflict happens, the majority
of conflict on the planet,

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.590
like the majority of
everything on the planet,

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.570
is going to happen
in third world

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.379
coastal cities by the
middle of the century.

00:18:31.379 --> 00:18:33.045
And I can talk more
in detail in the Q&amp;A

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:36.101
if you like about the
data that supports that.

00:18:36.101 --> 00:18:38.600
But what's really interesting
to me is not these old trends.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.760
They've been around
for a long time,

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.926
and they're well understood.

00:18:40.926 --> 00:18:43.930
What's interesting is the new
trend, which is connectivity.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.930
Now, I'm talking to a
bunch of people at Google,

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.500
so I probably don't need to
go into the level of detail

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.590
on this that I have with
some of the other folks

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.660
that I've spoken to, but
just a couple of data points.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:58.400
In the year 2000, there were
30,000 cellphones in Nigeria.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.970
Today, there are 113 million.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.860
Last year, I spent some time
walking around Mogadishu

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.300
engaging with the
community there

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.970
on some work we were
doing, and Mogadishu

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.100
is a city that
survived for 20 years

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.420
without a government
or a central state.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.230
24% of people that
live in Mogadishu

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.530
own and use a cell phone.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.650
There are four major
cellphone companies.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.830
Internet access from Mogadishu
is actually a lot easier

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.700
than from parts of
the United States

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.400
if you want to talk to people,
because you're very closely

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.010
geographically connected to the
international undersea cable

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.450
network.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:38.762
There's a market in the middle
of Mogadishu called the Bakaara

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.720
Market, which was the
scene of a big gun battle

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.070
about 20 years ago.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.820
On the ground floor
of that market

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.430
is a currency trading
exchange where

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.990
people are on the internet
and on their cell phones,

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.180
and they're trading the
Somali Shilling, which

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.180
is the currency again
that survived for 20 years

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.350
without a central bank.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.650
It floats on international
exchange rates.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.790
It gets updated
five times a day,

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:04.190
and the traders on that floor
punch out a SMS text message

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.170
to everybody that trades
in the city five times

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.810
a day with the
current exchange rate.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:09.930
And so you have
all these traders

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.679
out there on their
cellphones all the time

00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:14.644
tapping into a global
patent of commerce.

00:20:14.644 --> 00:20:16.060
And one of the
things we're seeing

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.040
is that access to the
international networks

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.620
of trade, things like
remittance flows,

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.630
arbitrage, the
movement of currency

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.620
or the movement of
goods around the planet

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.010
has overtaken
agricultural surplus

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.500
as a major driver
of city growth.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.540
So Mogadishu is
not a city that can

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.510
be sustained by the rest
of the Somali economy.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.940
The reason that it's there
and it's that big is it's

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.120
a trading city.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.230
It's always been
there, but now it's

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.765
not just a trading city that
sends charcoal to Yemen,

00:20:46.765 --> 00:20:49.490
or sends cart around
the rest of the country,

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.010
and engages in basic
commodities trading.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.340
It's also a trading city
that's international,

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:59.000
because you have 800,000 Somalis
in the international diaspora,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.620
and they're connected to the 7
1/2 million Somalis that live

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.520
in the country in a way that
just never was possible before.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.620
Another example, we
mentioned Syria earlier.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:15.000
Until 2000, there was virtually
no internet, no satellite,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.670
television, and no cell
phone access in Syria.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.020
Hafez al-Assad, the president
of Syria from the 1970s,

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.120
came from peasant stock.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.203
He was a bit of a Luddite.

00:21:24.203 --> 00:21:26.850
He wasn't that interested in
allowing Syrians to connect

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.370
to the rest of the world for
a variety of obvious reasons,

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.620
and he essentially denied
access to all this connectivity

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.380
until his death in 2000.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.580
His son, though,
Bashar al-Assad,

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.570
was a bit more of
a computer nerd.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.810
He was the president of
the Syrian Computer Society

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.370
before becoming president.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:49.520
He was a bit of a AV
club guy at college.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.360
He was quite interested in
this issue of connectivity.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.550
Ironically, under
their previous regime,

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.865
you could get a satellite
dish, but you did that

00:21:57.865 --> 00:21:59.240
by getting it on
the black market

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.720
from the Syrian military who
would happily sell you one

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.950
and then track all your usage of
that satellite dish thereafter.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.980
But after 2000, there was this
period known as the Damascus

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.640
Spring when Bashar al-Assad
through open electronic

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.070
connectivity, and we
saw this massive surge

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.960
in cell phone usage,
in internet access,

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.570
in access to
satellite television.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.030
And actually if you
look at the other cities

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.040
and other countries
involved in the Arab Spring,

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.610
you see a very,
very similar pattern

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:30.150
of this explosion of
connectivity after 2000.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.540
When the uprising came in
2011, that fundamentally

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.040
changed the way that the
conflict developed in Syria.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.850
Unlike the 1980s
when the regime was

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.340
able to crush one city at a time
because people didn't know what

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.820
was going on, this
time people were

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.990
able to talk to each other.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.860
And the uprising spread across
about half a dozen cities

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.330
on the first day, and
it reached 20 cities

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.700
in the first two weeks.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.090
And so the regime was not
able to get ahead of the curve

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.694
this time.

00:22:56.694 --> 00:22:58.360
The other critical
difference that we've

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.090
seen in all the Arab
Spring conflicts

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:05.130
is the way that a tech savvy
connected population that

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.750
is able to access technical
instructions but also

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.330
physical manufacturing
facilities

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.680
can rapidly generate
weaponry and capabilities

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.290
that just weren't available
even a decade ago.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.290
And we can talk in more detail
in Q&amp;A if you like about that.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:23.660
But I'll just give
you one example.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.720
In the Aleppo area-- which
is in northern Syria--

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.910
last year, a bunch of guys
in the Syrian free army

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.132
downloaded a bunch of
instructions off the internet

00:23:34.132 --> 00:23:36.340
and started producing their
own mortar systems, which

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.030
they used Google Android
phones to control.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:44.940
They used the compass app and
a variety of calculation tables

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.990
to decide where they're
going to fire those mortars.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.420
They look at Google Earth
as a way of targeting,

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.840
and they'll use
access to the internet

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.770
to basically pass messages
back and forth on Twitter

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:02.070
to control the fall of shot.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.450
But also they
downloaded instructions

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.160
that enabled them to build
their own army vehicles,

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.682
so in a backyard
factory in Aleppo

00:24:10.682 --> 00:24:13.140
last year, a bunch of guys made
this thing called al-Shams,

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:18.350
which is their lightweight tank
that has many mono chassis.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.490
It's about 6 feet long
and about 3 1/2 feet wide.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.190
It's controlled with a Game
Boy console from inside,

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.070
and you look at a flat
screen television.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.861
It doesn't have a
turret, which is actually

00:24:27.861 --> 00:24:30.550
the most complicated piece of
an armored vehicle to build.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.300
Instead, it has a remote
control weapon station

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.940
where they basically a
robot electric motor that

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.360
controls the 7.62
millimeter machine

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.890
gun that sits
outside the turret.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.640
And you've got a series
of armored video cameras

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.740
that can be replaced
if they get broken that

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:50.050
allow the thing to basically
run through a Go Pro

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.000
to a Game Boy
controller, and the guy

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.860
drives it around the
streets of Aleppo

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.410
using basically home
consumer entertainment

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.350
technology to control it.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.750
When I showed it to a bunch of
army guys earlier this year,

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:07.374
they said to me, well, why would
you take all that technology

00:25:07.374 --> 00:25:09.540
and put it into this tiny
little army vehicle that's

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.330
only 3 feet wide and 6 feet
long and it can't fight

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.710
another tank, because it
only has a machine gun?

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.350
Well, the reason is because
tanks can't get down

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.510
streets in a place like Aleppo.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.410
A Bradley armored fighting
vehicle is about 16 feet wide,

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.679
so is an Abrams tank.

00:25:23.679 --> 00:25:24.720
They're not getting that.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.330
They're not going to get
into that environment,

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:28.730
and it doesn't need a big gun.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.110
It needs a small machine
gun for fighting infantry,

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.610
because it's not
going to be dealing

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.420
with large armored vehicles.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.050
So this is actually a very
smart technical adaptation

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.850
of consumer electronics with
basically well understood

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.500
internal combustion engine
and the application of fire

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.500
in an urban environment.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.900
But what's interesting about
this is not the technology

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.592
itself.

00:25:50.592 --> 00:25:52.550
It's the way that all
these people concentrated

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.730
in an urban environment with
a high degree of connectivity

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.680
have actually democratized
military technology

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.410
on the ground.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.330
And the way these
conflicts have developed

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.290
is very different from how
previous irregular warfare

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:06.850
conflicts developed.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.780
I have case studies in
the book on that stuff

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.520
and on things like
the Mumbai attack

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.220
where the Lashkar-e-Taiba
terrorists from Pakistan

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.480
used Twitter as
their control feed

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.610
to actually control the attack
and used downloads of Google

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:23.719
Earth to understand the flow of
the city and how to attack it.

00:26:23.719 --> 00:26:25.260
I have a bunch of
other case studies.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.850
Probably the most
interesting to me

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:31.000
is actually the way that
Jamaican drug gangs in Kingston

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.200
have used urban planning
decisions made in the 1960s

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.330
to create these Garrison
districts around the outside

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.720
of the city and control
international drug

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.980
trade from slum areas around
the capital city of Jamaica.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.840
But let me finish by
talking about I think what's

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.250
more germane to this discussion,
which is how do we model

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.130
and understand
cities under stress.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:57.010
Because if I'm right
about the future,

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:58.510
then the future
environment is going

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:00.580
to be one of cities
that are experiencing

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.870
this tsunami of inflow of
population, and information,

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.190
and money, and drugs,
and weapons that

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.781
come about through
rapid urbanization.

00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:12.280
And it's worth thinking about
how do we model and understand

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.800
those and how do we think
about resiliencies to address

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.850
those problems going forward.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.610
So briefly on that, in
looking at this in the book,

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.630
I go back to Karl
Marx, weirdly enough.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.060
So Marx-- whatever
else he may have been--

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.680
was a social scientist who's
looking at European cities

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.920
100 years after the beginning
of that Industrial Revolution

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.740
process that I was
talking about earlier.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.360
So in the 1850s, Marx is
looking at Paris, and Berlin,

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.070
and London, and he's saying what
is it about these cities that

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:44.000
gives rise to the
environment of urban squalor

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.230
that is famously
written about by people

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.500
like Victor Hugo
and Charles Dickens.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.420
What is it that
gives rise to that?

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.630
And he talks about what
he calls a metabolic rift.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:55.570
So that people that
are used to living

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.980
in a rural environment, where
most of the people that you

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.000
rely on for day-to-day survival
are people that you're either

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.250
related to or you
know personally.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.420
And you're in this
organic structure,

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.120
you then find yourself in
a large urban environment

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.930
where everything's
depersonalized,

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:15.680
and you now rely on these large
institutionalized distanciated

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.855
systems that are essentially
lots of moving parts

00:28:18.855 --> 00:28:21.840
that all have to work together,
or the whole thing falls over.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.640
And he talks about how that
creates this social rift

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.430
in the way that people
look at each other,

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:32.220
but it disassociates them
from the means of survival.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.720
This idea sits fallow in urban
planning for about 100 years,

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.630
and then a guy called
Abel Wolman picks it up

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.004
in the 1960s, who
was an urban planner,

00:28:40.004 --> 00:28:41.670
and he writes an
article that's actually

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.030
very seminal in
urban ecology where

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.690
he talks about the
metabolism of cities.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.620
And Wolman's argument is
pretty straightforward.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.360
It's like if you
imagine your body

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.280
as a system with various inputs
and intakes of water, fuel,

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.390
food, and so on that
come into your body,

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.580
and there are
transformative processes

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.950
that result in energy
and biomass and so on.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.155
But they also result
in toxins that

00:29:05.155 --> 00:29:07.340
have to be metabolized
and dealt with.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.470
And if your body doesn't
have the carrying capacity,

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:14.110
the metabolic systems in place
to deal with those toxins,

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.370
then you're going to get sick.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.000
He says you can apply
the same idea to a city.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.515
It has various
inputs and inflows

00:29:19.515 --> 00:29:22.170
and has various
transformative processes,

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.085
and if the inflows overwhelm
the carrying capacity

00:29:25.085 --> 00:29:28.450
of the system, then you're going
to see the emergence of toxins

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:33.020
that are going to result in
stuff like pollution-- air

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.835
pollution, water
pollution, and so on.

00:29:34.835 --> 00:29:38.070
Now, this idea is
very common now

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.430
in urban ecology in the
physical sense, carbon, water,

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.050
air, how these things flow
through an urban system.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.010
And there are
models that we use,

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.820
and there are material
flow analysis systems

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.710
that we apply to
understand that.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.610
What I've done and what
a lot of other people

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.780
have done in looking at cities
in the last 10 or 20 years

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.830
is to do what I would call a
non-material flow analysis.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.930
So instead of looking
at water or carbon,

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:05.080
we'll look at information, and
money, and people, and weapons,

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.400
and drugs, and say does the
city have the carrying capacity

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.510
to deal with those flows, or is
it in fact getting overwhelmed.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.330
And when you apply
those kinds of models

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.620
to cities under
stress, it turns out

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.060
you can start looking at
them in a very different way,

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.270
and I can give you again some
examples in Q&amp;A from places

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.740
we've worked in Africa and
Latin America to understand

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.830
how a city can be
seen as essentially

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.790
a patent of intersecting
flows rather than just

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.040
a piece of organized terrain.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.630
Modeling that, we
have found what

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:43.680
relies on a combination of
big data, remote observation

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.870
of honest signals from the urban
environment with field teams

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.420
that can understand
what's beneath that data.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.480
So we did a lot of work
initially in Afghanistan,

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.480
and then subsequently in Syria,
and in much of other places

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.800
in looking at environments
that are under stress

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.910
and trying to understand
what was going on

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.940
by remote observation.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.210
After a while, we realized
that that doesn't actually

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.360
give you the answer
you're looking for.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.090
It's like looking at a
jungle canopy from above.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.690
You can see the trees, but you
don't know what's underneath.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.565
And it turns out that
you have to put a field

00:31:16.565 --> 00:31:18.930
team on the ground
to figure out what

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:21.920
is the delta between
the observed data

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.690
and what you can
see on the ground

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.270
before you can start to make
predictive analysis about what

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:27.020
you're looking at.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.440
So I'll give you one example,
and unfortunately, Google

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.648
doesn't come into this story,
because you guys charge

00:31:31.648 --> 00:31:33.380
for use of Google Earth data.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.140
But we used Open
Street Map, which

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.930
is the Wiki version
of Google Earth

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.910
to work with a series
of communities, mainly

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:45.010
women's groups and a
violence observatory

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.190
in a large African city
on a coastline that

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.610
has a number of slums
that are experiencing

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.310
a really high
degree of violence.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.935
Now, why women?

00:31:53.935 --> 00:31:55.310
One of the reasons
that women are

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:56.972
really important in
this environment--

00:31:56.972 --> 00:31:58.180
there's actually two reasons.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.140
One is because they
are consistently

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.270
excluded from the analysis.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.800
So when you go and start looking
at environments on the ground,

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.610
typically you end up
speaking with elite class

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:12.500
urban males that
speak English, which

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.531
is a pretty small subset
of the environment

00:32:14.531 --> 00:32:16.030
actually when you
want to understand

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.280
what's really going on.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.540
But much more
importantly in my view

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.590
is that something
like 80% of the people

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.950
that own businesses and
employ people in slums

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.990
are actually women,
and the reason for that

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.800
is pretty obvious.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.290
A lot of these slums
don't have a lot of jobs.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:32.970
Like if you live
in la Rocinha which

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.070
is a favela outside
of Rio, you aren't

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.760
going to work in la Rocinha.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.810
You're going to work downtown
where the rich people need you

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:45.100
to sweep streets, and run
the airport traffic, baggage

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.090
handling system, or drive taxis.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.170
That's where the work is if
you're a guy in la Rocinha.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.049
If you want to
work in the favela,

00:32:52.049 --> 00:32:54.590
and you want to run a business,
so you want to employ people,

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.540
then you're probably
part of this network

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.680
of women small business
owners that are actually

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.517
pretty common in
these environments.

00:33:01.517 --> 00:33:03.100
So we worked with
these women's groups

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.812
to understand threat
and risk in their slum.

00:33:06.812 --> 00:33:08.270
And if you think
about it, when you

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.920
walk through an
urban environment,

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.230
you don't know if you're
going to be mugged,

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.080
but you do know if it
is going to happen,

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.487
it'll probably be over there.

00:33:14.487 --> 00:33:16.320
There's just something
about the environment

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.890
that tells you that it's risky.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:21.350
And we built a map which
essentially reflected

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:24.090
the community's
perception of risk

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:27.130
in different specific
areas within a slum.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.820
And it's interesting when you
compare that to the police data

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.342
that the police have-- which
is again remote observation--

00:33:32.342 --> 00:33:33.800
you would think
that the government

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.508
of a large African
city would know what's

00:33:35.508 --> 00:33:36.930
going on in its environment.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:37.999
Mostly they don't.

00:33:37.999 --> 00:33:39.540
You can look at
these things, and you

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.790
can identify any building
off of Google Earth,

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.790
but if you talk to somebody
from the government,

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.790
it's pretty rare for them
to be able to tell you

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.070
what that building is.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.820
Even if they know
what the building is,

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.134
most of these streets
don't have street names.

00:33:51.134 --> 00:33:52.800
There are no house
addresses, so there's

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.840
no way to record
that information.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.070
So we built these
special models of where

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.720
the community felt unsafe,
and we began looking at them.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.584
We realized that actually these
places have a visual signature.

00:34:03.584 --> 00:34:05.500
There's something about
them that's different,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.950
the size of houses, the
number of bins in a given

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.230
distance of road,
how wide the streets

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.276
are, the density
of urban lighting.

00:34:12.276 --> 00:34:13.650
There's a whole
variety of things

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:15.250
that make these
areas look different,

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.980
and often humans can't tell
that, but machines can.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.550
And when you back up to a lot
of scale model or large scale

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.780
picture, just a satellite
image of a city,

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.122
you can start to pick these
environments off the map,

00:34:26.122 --> 00:34:27.830
because you know what
you're looking for,

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.699
because you've done
the field work.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.340
So just the big
data is not enough,

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.040
and just the field
work is not enough.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.620
The magic happens
at the connectivity

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.280
between field teams that
understand the environment who

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.320
are almost always entirely
indigenous local inhabitants

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.190
of that environment and
people sitting remotely

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.070
who can understand the
bigger large end perspective.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:52.270
And so a lot of what we do
now in places in Africa,

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:54.409
and Latin America,
and the Middle East

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:57.910
is founded on an idea
that we co-ed design

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:01.680
where we bring a small external
team with certain kinds

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.450
of technical or
functional knowledge

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.950
into an environment
where they work closely

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.850
under the direction of
the local community.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.570
And I'm going to take
this back to warfare.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:15.060
I really first
experienced that in Iraq

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:17.400
when we finally
began to turn around

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.640
what we'd been doing in Iraq.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.040
And I'm going to
end with this story,

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.748
and then I'll throw
it open to questions.

00:35:21.748 --> 00:35:25.410
When I first went into Iraq
in 2006, we were in free fall.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.505
3,000 civilians were getting
killed in just Baghdad city

00:35:28.505 --> 00:35:30.020
alone e every week.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.530
That's a 9/11 every week.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.490
By September of 2007,
we'd reduced that

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.800
to the point where a few people
getting killed was a bad night.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.000
100 was a terrible week.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.280
95% reduction in
violence in just

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.450
a seven month period in Iraq.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:48.764
How did we do that?

00:35:48.764 --> 00:35:51.180
It wasn't because we had this
great new counter insurgency

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.340
manual.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.480
That helped.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.230
I wasn't because we had a
president who was very engaged.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:58.750
Although, we wouldn't have been
able to do it without that.

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.390
But actually it was because
we finally did something

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.030
that we never
really done before,

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.820
which is to actually start
talking to the Iraqis

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.520
about how to defend
their neighborhoods.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.559
So before that, we
had typically gone

00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:13.100
into an Iraqi neighborhood, and
we would swept the locals out

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.670
of the way, and we'd
say sit down, shut up.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.300
We have the answer
to your problem.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.510
We're going to back up
this democracy truck.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.470
We're going to
unpack the solution,

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:23.900
and you guys will be very
happy with the result.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.472
And what had happened
was not that.

00:36:25.472 --> 00:36:27.930
What had happened was a city
that had basically torn itself

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:32.450
apart for those 12 to 18
months before the surge began.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:35.010
And in that time,
interestingly the period

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:39.450
when we backed off from
Baghdad, a lot of local security

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.380
councils had emerged,
and people had

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.200
started to create these
little security groups that

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.592
decided we're
going to figure out

00:36:45.592 --> 00:36:47.800
how to defend our own
community and they had actually

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.180
gone out and put in place
a whole series of systems,

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.380
not just physical systems,
but reporting systems,

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.540
and information
management systems,

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:57.960
and ways of understanding
their environment,

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.130
which they had used to
survive through most of 2006.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:06.410
So when we finally went
back in the spring of 2007

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:08.390
and began to reengage
with Baghdad,

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:10.100
this time we sat
down with people,

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:13.780
and we said tell us what you've
been doing for the last year,

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.810
and what's worked, and
what hasn't worked,

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.190
and what you need some
additional help on,

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.180
and what we should
just not touch,

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.860
and you give us
this design brief

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.920
of what we should
build to support

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.810
your security in
your environment.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.950
And initially they
were like, what?

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.540
Because I actually had a meeting
with some guys in a place

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.559
called Sadr City where
they were like, what?

00:37:33.559 --> 00:37:34.850
You want to know what we think?

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:35.910
They were like, dude,
we've been working

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:37.470
with the Coalition
for four years.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:39.570
You're the first person
that's ever asked us

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.890
what we think about how
to secure our district.

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:43.590
And they were very,
very suspicious.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.214
When we finally began to do this
stuff-- and it wasn't just me,

00:37:46.214 --> 00:37:49.180
it was people all over
Iraq-- they got religion.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.400
Because they saw that
we really were serious.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.910
We were really going to listen
to what they wanted to do,

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:55.326
and we're going
to work with them.

00:37:55.326 --> 00:37:57.490
And we engaged in this
process of co-design,

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.400
and we actually
designed stuff together

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.380
to build a solution that
would work for them.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.070
Now, there's companies here
in San Francisco like IDEO,

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:06.550
for example, that
have this idea down

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.930
in terms of participatory
development and urbanization,

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.760
and they understand stuff
like human centered design

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.740
as a way of engaging
with communities

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.420
that are under stress to try
to build a better solution.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.310
My challenge to them and
what our company's been doing

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.060
has been trying to
figure out how do you

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.790
do that when people
are shooting at you.

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:28.430
How do you do that when it's
so violent that you can't just

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:30.806
sit down with people and say
hey man, what should we do?

00:38:30.806 --> 00:38:32.180
What are the ways
you can observe

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.110
that environment
remotely, and how can you

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.630
have field teams
working the ground

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:38.250
to try to build-- what
for want of a better term

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:41.380
I would call-- peace and
resilience in environments that

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.570
are just not stable
by definition.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:48.660
These cities are growing at such
a rate that our traditional way

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.790
of thinking about the problem,
which is to bring stability,

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.712
to stabilize-- as
the IMF has it ,

00:38:53.712 --> 00:38:57.030
or to bring stability operations
as the military talks about is

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.520
just not going to work.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.000
If you were born
in Daka in 1950,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.580
you would have been born in
a city of 400,000 people.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.320
Today that city's 12 million.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.350
It's going to be 25 million
by the middle of the century.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:10.080
It's not a stable system.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.240
Stability is a systems
characteristic.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.380
Resiliency is a characteristic
who's act is in the system.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:19.750
Rather than trying to hold back
the tide of rapid urbanization,

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.270
we need to be focusing on
how to teach people to swim,

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.220
and that's a lot of
what most people that

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.260
are working in this
environment are now doing.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.270
So US Aid and a lot of
the other aid agencies

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.740
have now a resiliency
agenda for how

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.330
they're going to bring
the kind of systems

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.380
to communities that
allow them to be

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.870
resilient in the
face of rapid change.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:42.220
And I think circling back to
that Afghan ambush, that's

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.210
what we need to be
looking at going forward,

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:48.400
not remote rural mountainous
environments where you don't

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.000
have a lot of
connectivity, and you

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.040
don't have a high
population density.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.960
We've become really,
really good at operating

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.720
in that environment
in the last decade,

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.720
but the future
environment is not that.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.070
It's big cities on
coastlines in the developing

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.910
world with an enormous
degree of connectivity,

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.490
and there's a massive
upside set of opportunities

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.290
to lift people out of poverty,
to bring all kinds of benefits

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.610
to communities that
don't have them now,

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:16.470
to actually generate peace
as this thing from just

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:18.770
the absence of conflict.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.870
That opportunity is there
alongside a huge set

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.560
of risks that will confront
us if we don't deal

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.600
with this massive population
tsunami that's bearing down

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.780
on coastal cities in
the next generation.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.487
So let me stop
there and summarize

00:40:33.487 --> 00:40:35.820
by saying we need to get our
heads out of the mountains,

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.480
and start thinking about this
future urban environment.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.940
And I'm going to throw the
floor open to questions,

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.440
so I don't know how
you want to run.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.200
If you guys want to nominate,
and we'll go from there.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.080
AUDIENCE: When we
were speaking earlier,

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.449
you had talked about inoculating
cities with some resiliency

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:54.240
as they're going through
this rapid growth.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.365
Could you talk a little
bit more about that please?

00:40:56.365 --> 00:40:58.575
DAVID KILCULLEN: So
great point, Chris.

00:40:58.575 --> 00:41:03.290
So, we're not just talking
about cities that are there now.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:05.780
One projection by
the Indian Institute

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.230
for Human Settlements-- which is
like their heart organization--

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.590
is that the entire
west coast of India

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:15.560
is going to be one single
giant conurbation by 2040.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.820
So large slums will fill in
the currently existing space

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.190
between existing cities.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:23.660
There's a guy called
Mike Davis out in Hawaii

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.260
who's written a number of
really good books, one which

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.920
is called "Planet of Slums"
where he projects that we're

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.010
going to see this
giant slum spoil fill

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.150
in the space between
existing cities.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.204
So there's paradoxes that a lot
of the problems of urbanization

00:41:39.204 --> 00:41:41.120
that we're going to see
in the next generation

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.374
are going to happen in
cities that aren't there yet,

00:41:44.374 --> 00:41:45.790
because they haven't
happened yet.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.190
And so part of this is about
getting ahead of the curve

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:51.950
and thinking about what do
these kinds of environments

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:55.230
need to channel them into a
pathway of urban development

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.330
that's going to result
in a different future.

00:41:57.330 --> 00:42:01.260
And I'm trying in the book not
to predict a dystopian view.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.370
If you want that,
go read "Snow Crash"

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:05.680
by Neal Stephenson,
which is 15 years old,

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.570
but it's all there
in California.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:12.750
So this stuff's been figured out
as a dystopian vision already.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.180
What I'm doing is
making a projection

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.840
based on current
data and saying it

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.310
doesn't have to be that future.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:20.800
It can actually be different.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.690
And I think it's about thinking
about where will cities grow to

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:27.400
and what happens when rapid
unchecked urban growth acretes

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.910
around an existing city.

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:31.960
So you get this donut shaped
or horseshoe shaped ring

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.490
of terrain that clusters
around an existing city,

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.970
but it didn't used
to be empty terrain.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.860
That's where the
city grew its food.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.637
It's where the water
catchment area was.

00:42:41.637 --> 00:42:43.470
It's where a lot of the
transportation roots

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:44.370
come through.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:46.120
So you have this
ring of slums that

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.240
emerge around a
city that separates

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.400
the city from the sources of
all those critical commodities,

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.610
the inflows of the metabolism
that it needs to survive.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.350
And these are areas
where you don't

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:57.857
have a lot of
government presence.

00:42:57.857 --> 00:42:59.690
You don't have a lot
of government services.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.480
And so non-state
armed groups often

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.340
emerge and end up controlling
these environments,

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.770
and they don't
just smuggle drugs.

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:11.430
They actually provide governance
services in these environments.

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:15.060
And it's typical of governments
to look at these as a threat.

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.530
I don't see them
that way at all.

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:18.280
These are people who
are engaging in stuff

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.988
that the government
either can't or won't

00:43:19.988 --> 00:43:21.760
do that the population needs.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.150
They're actually fulfilling
a central function

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:25.900
to the existence of
the city, but what

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.662
it means if you're an
urban politician downtown

00:43:28.662 --> 00:43:30.370
is there's now a ring
of territory that's

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:33.380
like a gauntlet around the
city, and all the supplies

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:34.960
that the city needs
to survive have

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.070
to run that gauntlet
every day, and there's

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:40.180
a non-state armed group, a
malitia, or a communitarian

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.599
group that's sitting
astride that.

00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:43.640
And you're going to have
to deal with that group,

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.320
because if you don't, they
can shut the city down.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.230
So I think it's stuff like that.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:53.040
It's understanding how
do we enable urban growth

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.980
in a way that isn't
going to generate

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.580
the kind of urban exclusion,
and marginalization,

00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.370
and political disposition
of these people

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:04.350
that then creates the ground
in which all this stuff takes

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:04.900
place.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.200
And for the military
guys, how are we

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.460
going to operate in giant
cities like this which

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.880
could absorb a marine regiment
or an army division and not

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.340
even notice?

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.470
It's going to have to be
different from the traditional

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:19.600
way that we've thought
about operational maneuver

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.690
from the sea or
maneuver operational

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.090
in a littoral environment,
because it's just so big now

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.049
that you're looking at
a whole different space.

00:44:26.049 --> 00:44:27.423
A lot more to talk
about on that,

00:44:27.423 --> 00:44:29.050
but I think getting
ahead of the curve

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:31.100
is about predicting where
the problem is going

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.410
to be in cities that
haven't even happened yet

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:37.370
and how do you understand
the resiliences that prevent

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:40.210
this kind of symptoms
from developing

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.790
and to stop them
in their tracks.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:44.640
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.220
Let's see.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.750
Max Boot spoke here recently.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.150
He's the author of the
book on guerrilla warfare.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.720
And at one point
he said-- I think

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.280
I'm quoting him right--
that urban areas were not

00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:00.650
very friendly for
guerrillas, and his reason

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:04.550
was that it's too exposed.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:06.160
You can't have
meetings and organize.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.440
You can't do rifle practice.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.365
Clearly you disagree.

00:45:10.365 --> 00:45:12.240
Do you think that's a
factor, or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.031
DAVID KILCULLEN: Well,
I think Max was just

00:45:14.031 --> 00:45:15.840
a great book in his
latest book, and I

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.673
have a lot of respect
for his point of view.

00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:20.094
And I think if you look at
the big sweep of history

00:45:20.094 --> 00:45:22.260
of guerrillas, which is
what he's doing in the book,

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.180
he's right that traditionally
guerrillas don't operate

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.870
in cities and haven't had
a great degree of success

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:28.649
in cities.

00:45:28.649 --> 00:45:30.190
And the reason for
that is guerrillas

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.310
go to where the cover is.

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:33.770
They go to where they can hide.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:35.311
And for most of
human history, that's

00:45:35.311 --> 00:45:37.311
been mountains and
jungles, but today we

00:45:37.311 --> 00:45:39.810
have foliage penetrating radar
that can see through jungles.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:42.630
And we've got drones that can
sit on top of a mountain range

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:45.390
24 hours a day and tell
you where the bad guys are.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:49.010
There's not a lot of cover in
the rural environment anymore.

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:50.475
The cover is in the cities.

00:45:50.475 --> 00:45:51.850
And there's another
key idea that

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.120
comes in here, which is
the idea of legibility.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.190
So there's a great
guy up at Yale

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.860
called James C. Scott
who's a professor.

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.070
I don't think you can be
a professor of [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:03.320
studies, but that's
basically what he is.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.870
And he wrote an
awesome book called

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:08.010
"Seeing Like a State"
where he talks about how

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.670
what governments
try to do is they

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:11.590
try to make
environments legible,

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.790
so they can read and interpret.

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:15.900
And if you work in
Google, you basically work

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:17.720
in a giant legibility
project, trying

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.670
to make the entire planet
legible so the people can

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.910
understand that and
do things with it.

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:27.710
There are huge parts of the
planet that are not legible,

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:30.150
and most of those places
now are in cities.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:33.020
They're not in well developed
well designed cities.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.054
They're in these
clusters of slums

00:46:35.054 --> 00:46:36.470
where there's no
street addresses,

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.880
and there's no house numbers,
and you can spot a building

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.770
from space, but you
don't know what's there,

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:42.910
and there's no way to
understand who lives there.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:46.100
Now that we have things like
GDELT-- the global database

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.780
of events, language,
and tone-- which

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.790
has been built for
about 15 years or so,

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:53.180
and we have Twitter feeds
that we can geolocate.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.500
There's things that are emerging
that allow us to make cities

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.700
more legible than
they'd been in the past.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.780
But I believe the
balance has shifted

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.590
so that the urban
environment is now

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:06.810
the safer environment for
irregular operators compared

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:08.710
to the countryside.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.609
That doesn't mean we won't
see conflict in the mountains

00:47:11.609 --> 00:47:12.400
and in the jungles.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.940
We most definitely will.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:17.379
But irregular conflict tends
to happen where people live.

00:47:17.379 --> 00:47:18.920
The vast majority
of people are going

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.850
to be in urban environments,
and the city now

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:23.290
is the area where
you've got more

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:25.340
cover than the
rural environment.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.990
So I think Max is right as a
historical statement about what

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:30.930
the history of irregular
conflict has been,

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:34.730
but I think we're at a watershed
where going forward we're

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:38.420
going to see increasing
preponderance of this kind

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:41.160
of conflict happening
not in downtown cities,

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.400
but in slums and in this ring
of uncontrolled illegible

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.106
territory around the outside.

00:47:46.106 --> 00:47:47.480
AUDIENCE: So you
talk about where

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.940
you think the slums are going
to grow and try to get ahead

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:53.530
of it, but it seems like any
service you do in that area

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:55.460
before the slums is
just going to draw

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.510
the people there and
bring the slum sooner.

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.240
If you put schools
and parks, you're

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.050
just going to end up with
slums at the schools and parks.

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.110
How do you get ahead of it?

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.670
The real problem is
just too much people

00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:09.180
with not enough jobs.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.100
DAVID KILCULLEN: Right,
that's a great point.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.240
In fact, there's a woman
called Sheela Patel who

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.140
runs an organization
called SPARC in Mumbai who

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:15.940
makes this point.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.780
She says the government has
decided not to provide services

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.820
to people in slums,
because they think

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.570
it's going to attract
people to the slums.

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.780
One of the great examples
of that is sanitation.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:29.500
So the Indian government
says that an acceptable level

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.830
of sanitation is one
toilet per 50 people.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.470
Right now it's one
toilet per 600 people

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:37.430
in many of the slums in Mumbai.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.830
And she says as if
people moved to slums

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:42.350
just because they want
access to a toilet.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:44.800
There's plenty of places
to crap in the woods.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.670
Actually people are
moving to cities

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:48.680
because of economic opportunity.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.590
And I also think--
and we see this

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.060
in a number of places--
because of the connectivity

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.250
differential between
rural environments

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.420
and the urban
environment, if now

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:00.610
the way that you make
your money is by access

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:03.230
to a globalized economy
and you need connectivity

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:05.587
to do that and there's a
connectivity differential

00:49:05.587 --> 00:49:07.670
between the rural environment
where you don't have

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.760
that connectivity and the
urban environment when you do,

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:13.379
then one of the major reasons
why people are moving to cities

00:49:13.379 --> 00:49:14.920
is because that's
where the Wi-Fi is.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.280
That's where the internet is.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.238
That's where the density
of cell phone coverage

00:49:18.238 --> 00:49:20.880
is that allows you to tap
into that environment.

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.390
So I think that
tells you that there

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.470
are three ways to
really address this.

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.760
One is to attack
the supply side,

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.460
to do things in the
rural environment that

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.160
make it better for people that
are there so that they don't

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.600
decide we're going to pick up
and move to urban environments

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.670
at quite the same rate.

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:42.490
So more rural Wi-Fi, better
access to cell phones

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:47.340
in the countryside, water,
sanitation, education, conflict

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.940
resolution in the
kinds of conflicts

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:50.690
we were talking about
here that will still

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:54.840
happen in the rural
environment, there's

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.630
a supply side problem
of how do you address

00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:00.320
people deciding to
move to the city.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.930
Then in the city itself,
there are all these resiliency

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:05.810
interventions that you
can undertake in order

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:09.120
to make it hard of a
conflict to break out,

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.120
to create ways to resolve
that conflict quicker,

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.100
and to bring in the kinds of
services that prevent conflicts

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.790
from developing in
the first place.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:19.160
So they're the demand
side, or how do you

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.810
increase the carrying capacity
of an urban system in such

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:24.274
a way that it can
handle the flow?

00:50:24.274 --> 00:50:25.440
But then ultimately, though,

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.340
AUDIENCE: I think
nothing we can do

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:32.040
is going to stop the giant
tendency of populations

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.590
to move to urban environments.

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:36.882
It's more about helping
people cope better

00:50:36.882 --> 00:50:38.590
with the environment
they find themselves

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:42.312
in than about
turning off the tap.

00:50:42.312 --> 00:50:44.770
AUDIENCE: I just have trouble
seeing how to grow resiliency

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:48.270
when it means a slum is stronger
because more people live there.

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.820
I mean, that's resiliency
in the anti-fragile sense.

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.736
You get stronger because
more people come.

00:50:53.736 --> 00:50:54.860
I don't see how to do that.

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:55.770
DAVID KILCULLEN:
There's actually-- well,

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:57.730
you should buy my book
then, because there's

00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:59.090
a lot of case studies in there.

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:02.280
In the last chapter, I look
at several examples of things

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:06.300
that I think suggest
ways to think about this.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.990
I would just say
I'm not suggesting

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:09.240
that I have the answer.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.609
What I'm doing is
pointing to two things.

00:51:11.609 --> 00:51:13.400
One is there's this
problem out there which

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.084
we need to be
thinking about, and I

00:51:15.084 --> 00:51:16.750
think that actually
in the urban studies

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:19.480
environment and actually a lot
of people in the data science

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.190
community, people are
already thinking about that.

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.180
But the military's
been sidetracked

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.740
into this other environment
for the last decade,

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.840
and as we come back out
of that environment,

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.270
I think we have to put that
conversation back together

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:35.350
again and have people that
really understand military,

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:37.500
and law enforcement,
and all those kinds

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.820
of other kinds of operations
in the environment,

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:41.620
reengage with a
debate that's actually

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.020
moved on a lot in
the last 12 years

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:46.802
while we've been
busy in Afghanistan.

00:51:46.802 --> 00:51:49.010
And the other thing that I
think it is to reemphasize

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.150
is you have littoral,
because being on a coastline

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:55.360
is different from being
in a city elsewhere.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.220
Just one example
of that, last year

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.830
for the first time
in history, there

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:02.290
was a simultaneous outbreak of
cholera in four West African

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:04.700
countries during
the monsoon season,

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.480
and the reason
for that is people

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.910
have moved to slums on the
outskirts of these cities.

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:12.220
A lot of those slums are
built on stilts over the sea.

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.790
They don't have sanitation.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:17.660
There was a tidal storm surge
that pushed a lot of sewage

00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:21.630
from these slums into the inland
water system and infected lots

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:24.670
of people with cholera,
but all these cities

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:27.700
are connected with each other
through coastal shipping

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.030
and air transportation so that
the infection spread nearly

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:32.060
simultaneously.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.226
There's a very interesting
study by the World Health

00:52:34.226 --> 00:52:37.770
Organization where they look
at how air travel in particular

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:40.850
completely invalidates our
traditional way of handling

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:41.930
infectious disease.

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:45.830
If you have the right
incubation period

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:51.080
and you posit the idea of a
continued air traffic system,

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.180
it can be around
the entire system

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.150
before the first
patient gets sick.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:58.700
So instead of having breakout
in one country and you then

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.250
contain that, you can
have simultaneous outbreak

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:03.870
in basically every continent
except Antarctica because

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:06.220
of the way the air
transportation system works.

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:09.080
Who runs baggage handling
systems in most of the world?

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.160
Who is the workforce
in most airports?

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.820
It's people that don't live in
the rich districts downtown.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.180
It's people that live in the
slums around the outside.

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.650
So I think this is the
sort of stuff where

00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:21.855
we need to be really engaging to
think about how do we get ahead

00:53:21.855 --> 00:53:23.490
of the curve, and maybe we can.

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:24.820
Maybe you're right.

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:27.180
I hope that's not true,
but it's at least worth

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.390
thinking about it I think.

00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:30.260
AUDIENCE: Hey,
thanks for coming.

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:33.640
I wanted to ask about if we
have this large population

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.320
growth over the next 30 years,
have all these people moving

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.080
into cities and
then simultaneously

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.120
from other people, particularly
like futurists like Peter

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.670
Diamandis and such who have
these ideas that talk about

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:46.600
well, we'll have more
and more technology.

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.390
We'll have to stop worrying
about low level agriculture

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:54.060
so much as more of that's--
we'll just say-- automated.

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:58.070
So I was wondering if you had
any thoughts on what the job

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:00.980
or what the working situation
looks like for people

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:04.090
in these cities as we get
these giant populations.

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:06.224
DAVID KILCULLEN:
Yeah, I've looked

00:54:06.224 --> 00:54:07.640
at that in a little
bit of detail,

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.700
but not actually as
much as I would like to.

00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.650
I think there's a whole
additional study here

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:17.950
that's not only
focused on employment,

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:21.010
but it's focus on the
intersection of various things

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:24.030
that the aid and development
community takes for granted.

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:26.130
So, I had an interesting
discussing with the Gates

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:30.470
Foundation last year about
maternal health and infant

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:31.620
mortality.

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.630
And of course, if you're
running a private philanthropic

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:37.210
organization, you have to
define what your field of action

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.760
is going to be, and if that's
your field of action, that's

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.020
where you're going to focus.

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:43.760
But the fact is if you come up
with effective maternal health

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.205
and infant mortality
programs now,

00:54:46.205 --> 00:54:48.247
you better have an education
plan for five or six

00:54:48.247 --> 00:54:50.288
years from now, and you
better have an employment

00:54:50.288 --> 00:54:51.840
plan for 18 years
from now, or you're

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.530
going end up with what
happened to the Libyans

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:57.280
where the Libyans did a great
job in the '70s and '80s

00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.160
improving public health,
which resulted in a youth

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:03.830
bulge, which resulted in a lot
of people hitting college age.

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:06.050
And the Libyan education
system was well

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:08.340
developed for making
people literate,

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.380
giving them skills in English,
and helping them become very

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:14.555
politically aware, but it was
really bad at generating people

00:55:14.555 --> 00:55:17.590
that had skills that were
relevant to the Libyan economy,

00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:19.380
which is basically oil and gas.

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:23.050
So you had this massive number
of expats doing those jobs,

00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:25.350
and a lot of people coming
out of Libyan colleges

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:28.010
ended up working for
the civil service,

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:29.580
because basically
they just created

00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:31.180
this giant public
service in order

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.769
to absorb all these people
that didn't have usable skills.

00:55:33.769 --> 00:55:36.310
Then you had these government
departments that were basically

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:38.520
just jobs programs
and didn't exist

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:40.205
to provide any service
to the community,

00:55:40.205 --> 00:55:42.580
so you had this breakdown of
trust between the government

00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:46.120
and the population and
this giant underemployment

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.189
challenge.

00:55:47.189 --> 00:55:48.980
And that was the
recruiting pool from which

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:53.340
people sprung in 2011 against
the regime when they began

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.090
seeing places like
Dubai and Kuwait

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:59.762
on the television, which they'd
never had access to until 2003.

00:55:59.762 --> 00:56:01.220
And they're like,
hang on a second,

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.928
how come those guys
are living like that,

00:56:02.928 --> 00:56:04.070
and we're living like this?

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:08.340
So I think that issue
is critically important,

00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:11.880
figuring out the intersections
of all these different programs

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.382
and how they work together.

00:56:13.382 --> 00:56:14.840
I think-- and this
is just my point

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.560
of view based on not
a huge amount of data,

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:20.110
but just based on observing
a lot of these cities--

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.100
there's a lot of
jobs out there that

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:25.760
are emerging through
self-synchronization

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.120
at the local level.

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:31.490
So if you want to go on
your Google mapping app,

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:36.540
and you live in Lagos, and
you want to check the traffic,

00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.899
it's useless, because
it's red all the time.

00:56:39.899 --> 00:56:41.440
Lagos seems to have
words for traffic

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.814
like Eskimos have
words for snow.

00:56:42.814 --> 00:56:44.770
There's so many people there.

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:46.760
It's the infrastructure
of a medium

00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:51.090
sized town with a population
the size of Australia basically.

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:53.890
And it's always red.

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:56.580
But, there are about 25
different local level radio

00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:59.640
stations that only
broadcast for a few blocks

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.820
where people call in
and tell the radio

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:04.310
DJ what's going on
with traffic, and you

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:06.560
don't go on Google
to find out traffic.

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.897
You just change--
people have written up

00:57:08.897 --> 00:57:11.480
on their window the frequencies
of these local radio stations,

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.063
and they just change from one
to another as they move through.

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:16.070
And they've basically
self-synchronized

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:19.440
their own traffic
information system

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.390
based on totally analog
means in that environment.

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:24.140
So there's a lot of
those kinds of things.

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.340
And there's also
a cognitive elite,

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:27.690
which is not the machine.

00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:30.160
It's the marriage
of machine and human

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.730
that's actually
driving forward a lot

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:34.951
of the economic development
in places that we see.

00:57:34.951 --> 00:57:36.700
I can talk about that
offline if you want,

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:38.680
because it's a whole
other discussion.

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.990
But then there's a lot of people
that are basically dispossessed

00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:45.860
because of this change, and
what happens to those people

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:49.097
will drive a lot of what happens
in these environments I think.

00:57:49.097 --> 00:57:49.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:51.887 --> 00:57:53.220
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for coming.

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.011
Let's have a warm hand
for David Kilcullen.

00:57:55.011 --> 00:57:57.160
DAVID KILCULLEN: Hey,
thank you for having me.
