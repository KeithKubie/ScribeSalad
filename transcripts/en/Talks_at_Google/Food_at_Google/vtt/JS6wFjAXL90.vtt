00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.300
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Hi everybody.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.890
We are joined today by Chef Marcus Samuelsson;
he is the chef and owner of Red Rooster in

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.330
Harlem in
New York City, the winner of Top Chef Masters,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.990
and the author of "Yes, Chef," a memoir chronicling
his extraordinary journey from

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.570
Ethiopia to Sweden to Harlem, with many stops
along the way including the White House.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.109
There is a line from "Yes, Chef"--
&gt;&gt;Marcus: And the Google office.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.880
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And the Google office most
importantly.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.880
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yes.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.140
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: On 14th Street.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.800
There's a line in "Yes, Chef" that struck
me that I wanted to read: "Who’s going to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.440
make the
people realize that food dismissed as ‘ethnic’

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.399
by the fine-dining world could be produced
at the same level as their sacred

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.289
bouillabaisses and veloutés?” and I have
to say, after reading "Yes, Chef" the answer

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.460
is Chef Marcus Samuelsson.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.309
So please me in
welcoming to Google New York, Marcus Samuelsson.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.309
[Applause]

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:49.309
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Thank you.

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.309
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Glad you're here.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.309
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Thank you.

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.920
I'm happy to be back.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.570
I've been here twice, one time for the launch
of the African book, "The Soul of a New

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.780
Cuisine," and one time with Martha Stewart
for a Christmas thing you guys were doing.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.860
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And this is the best time--third
time's the best, right?

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.400
&gt;&gt;Marcus: It is, by far.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.400
By far.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
[Laughter]

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.680
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So I have to admit I read your
book and reading it made me feel like possibly

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.070
the laziest human being on the planet
because you have done everything and worked

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.990
so hard throughout your career--your quite
long career at this point because you

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.500
started quite young.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.380
And I can't even imagine--you're only forty-one
now--which is very young by my standards because

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.180
I'm not quite
forty yet--but I can't even imagine what you're

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.410
going to do in the next ten or twenty years--so
what made this moment the right

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.730
moment to write a memoir?

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:45.520
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I think that there's an evolution
right, as a self and as a chef and I always

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.200
actually envisioned to be a good chef by
forty-two or something like that because I

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.630
think that's a perfect age in terms of you
know who you are and being a chef, so

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.190
much about it is knowing who you are, and
you can express that through food.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.440
But also where I was in my life, you know,
married; I

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.570
knew about my Ethiopian side; I also knew
where in the DNA, in terms of my restaurant,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.030
where do I need to be?

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.440
Where was it important
for me to be, beside just having a store?

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.200
And all of that takes time; it takes time
to become a good chef, not that many become

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.180
good chefs, you have to find the conscious
of finding yourself; and then, where do you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.780
need to operate from?

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.830
You know, I became
chef very early--maybe too early--but then

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.030
also hadn't asked myself those questions of
"Is there something larger?

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.870
Can I be part of
changing the footprint in this city?

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.790
What's going on in the food chasm in this
specific city, in this country?

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.850
What are my
responsibilities?"

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.910
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That's great.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.730
Well, you know, the book is so beautifully
written and, just starting with the first

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.280
chapter I have
to admit it actually almost brought me to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.010
tears reading about--the story about your
mother and how you've never seen a picture

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.950
of
your birth mother and that vignette was really

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.600
a very powerful story--

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yeah.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.069
&gt;&gt;Interviewer:--And one that I think a lot
of people didn't know about you, if they know

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.050
some parts of your life.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.100
Was--when you
read the final manuscript--was there a story

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.960
or an event that struck you as particularly
poignant and important to write about?

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.470
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Well, I think I want to keep a book
that has the pace of myself.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.650
I mean the chapters are pretty short, so there's
a fast

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.030
good pace, it's a quick read.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.460
If you're an immigrant like me, it might take
two weeks, but someone like you who's been

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.540
here longer
maybe two days.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.849
[claps hands together] It's a quick, I wanted
to keep a quick read, and also have people

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.540
from all walks of life
share it at a dinner table.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.450
If you were seventeen and wanted to--was into
cooking--you could read this book and relate

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.450
to it.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.590
If you were the parent, you could sort of
like see yourself in your journey and your

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.080
struggles; and if you were the grandparent,
there was this sort of "Oh, that's what we

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.200
do with our kids.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200
We inspire them to cook."

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.410
So keeping the pace but also keeping it an
entry level to all people.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.680
You know for me it's important to explain
the journey in terms of profession, specifically,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.039
cheffing is
so different today than it was when I came

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.039
in, right?

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.300
It was one way, you worked in a French restaurant,
and you worked yourself,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.169
you know, as hard as possible, and the only
way to respond was "yes, chef."

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.059
But, just as much as your business evolved,
ours too.

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:37.159
So now people might know cooking through Top
Chef or through an online recipe.

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.159
What happened?

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.159
What was the difference?

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.159
I wanted to
explain that sort of--that journey and also

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:49.229
explain for people from all colors a window
in to how a black laborer's journey is,

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.759
because it is different.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.259
Just like a woman's journey is different.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.210
And guys can always say like, "No no it doesn't
matter, there's no

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.210
difference.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.210
We're all open."

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.210
It is different.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.981
And it's not about an [author] conversation
about race that wasn't polarizing.

00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:06.020
It's
like "You know what, I've never thought about

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.639
that" and from all sides of it say like "You
know what, that's uh, hmm.

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:12.650
I've never thought about that journey."

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.289
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Let's talk a little bit about
that because you do talk a lot about race

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.159
in the book and it's a really fascinating
perspective being one of--really the only--executive

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.039
chefs of color in the city, I mean maybe {Chef
Cardo Stenza} there's maybe a handful

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.060
in sort of the fine dining arena--

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.060
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Mmm

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.589
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: But you've really made a mark
for yourself and you write a lot about the

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.189
racism that you've faced along the way in
your career,

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:38.789
some of the really off color remarks that
were made to you by quite prominent chefs

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.879
that were really disturbing to me and made
me

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.719
not want to watch certain programs ever again,
it just--there've been a lot of challenges

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.659
that you've faced and what about those
experiences sort of influenced the way you

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:50.659
run your business now?

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.719
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I think that I've been lucky enough
to work in really great restaurants and that

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.529
taught me what to do, but also taught me
what not to do more than anything.

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:04.129
If I walked into any great French restaurant
that I worked in, there was no women, zero.

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.080
It
was--the narrative of the black chef didn't

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.229
exist to the point where you had to explain
for them that you were there working in the

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.970
kitchen many, many, many times and even when
I got the job, they didn't have the job because

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.560
it was a black chef, so that does two
things--that either makes you sharper or quit.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.650
And a lot of people quit and that's their
life answer why you don't have

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.710
more diverse entry level in the work force.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.129
And cooking is just one thing, you can say
the same in the tech world, you can say the

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:37.779
same in--I mean, the book is a mirror up--
to look introvert yourself-- to look into

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:39.099
yourself, "You know what?

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.740
How does that reflect
MY environment?"

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.770
You know?

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.080
And I mean the fact that there's not enough
women in the cooking world is just nonsense

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.479
because the
most influential people in cooking have always

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.479
been women.

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:52.479
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Sure.

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:56.069
&gt;&gt;Marcus: You can look at it from just eating
around the world, but you can also look at

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.199
it from in this country who changed the
game?

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.610
Alice Waters and Julia Childs.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.639
We wouldn't have Food TV without Julia.

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:08.199
We wouldn't think--we have fifty-four farmer's
markets in

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.589
New York City.

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:14.159
Without Alice asking those questions, maybe
we'd have two.

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:17.289
On the larger scale, who are the biggest game
changers?

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:18.460
Women.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.270
And just that cooking in terms of a restaurant,
in terms of fine dining, which is one segment

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.529
of this conversation, could be
argued that it's more suitable for a guy.

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:35.779
It's almost like an Olympic--you run really
really fast but that does not explain what,

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:39.659
who contribute our community and changes how
we eat.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:44.080
Fine dining cooking is the minority in this
pyramid that we call food--food

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.379
community.

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:51.330
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Well talking about your journey
some more you've had--excuse me, I think I

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.509
alluded to this in the introduction--many
many along

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:58.649
this journey and I would love to hear more
about that journey including your time almost

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:03.020
becoming a professional soccer player to
cooking for the White House and some of the

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.490
key moments that stand out for you.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.289
If you can just tell us a little bit about
them.

00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:10.830
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Well for me one of the key moments
ever was when I was allowed to work for free

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.449
for a year.

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:14.059
When I got the chance to work in France.

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:19.800
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: We would hire you for that
for a year, if you wanted to work for free

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.800
here.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.800
[laughter]

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.800
Just kind of ignoring me--we would pay--

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.839
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Well, you know--it would be a good
education for both, I'll tell you that.

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:27.020
We'd be closing the gap on the food chasm,
I'll

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.469
tell you that.

00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:32.180
I would ask a lot of questions and you guys
are smarter than me so you would fix it.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.180
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: We'd just Google it.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.180
[laughter] And find the answer.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.180
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:42.659
No but that chance to work in the three star
Michelin Restaurant in France was for me a

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.750
big success because
I sent out thirty-five letters.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.960
Me and my mother went to the local library
to send out a lot of letters and we got just

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.800
like a--I
think that the undertone in the book should

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.800
be about rejection--how do you deal with rejection?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.630
All of us here have been rejected
and how do you deal with that?

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:05.360
It's in the personal life, it is--it happens
in work place and what you do with that?

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.900
And for me it
was actually the perfect time.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:15.269
You know, I started writing to three star
Michelin Restaurants when I was eighteen-nineteen-twenty

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:16.839
but I didn't get there until I was twenty-three.

00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:21.779
But it actually turned out to be better for
me because I was a better cook.

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:25.100
Although each one of those answers back were
painful.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.250
But in the meantime I taught myself French
and I was a better cook.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.040
So the
rejection does not always have to be that

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.450
you have to get off your journey, you know,
I went to Switzerland instead of France, and

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.510
they spoke French in Switzerland and German
so now I got yelled at in Swedish, German

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.620
and French, which was a good advantage
because before I went to France, I need to

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.120
know some of that.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.459
So it's being committed to the craft, being
completely in love with

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.560
your craft.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.770
If there was anyway I doubted that, there
was no way I would have taken that abuse,

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.379
or those things.

00:10:02.379 --> 00:10:05.899
I'm also now
thinking about is there a way to create incredible

00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:07.020
food without abuse?

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.140
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: What's the answer?

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.959
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Well, we're searching.

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:17.300
[laughter] Because there is a commitment inside
that you can't doubt that has to happen and

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.410
I
think, you know, I think Red Rooster's asked

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.950
me a lot of questions and I have to answer
them.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:29.899
I always trust my work and I seek new
questions in my work.

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:35.110
And you know, I've been lucky enough on the
book tour to travel to some of the best restaurants

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.839
in the ci--in
the country and I ask--you know I get a window

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:43.050
in to what's going on in American food and
it's a better plate today.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.250
It's more
diverse whether you eat in Chinese, Muslim

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:58.930
restaurant in San Francisco or you eat at
a good TexMex restaurant in Austin, or you

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:04.759
eat
in a really cool, great fun environment in

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:13.949
Miami, or you eat in Copa in Boston--the kitchens
are more diverse they are--the evolution

00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:17.410
is completely different now--I'm so happy
that that's happening.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.670
And I think America is one of the few places
that can create that.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.850
Because the entry
levels to work in a kitchen is still pretty

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.240
low but you're curiosity level is very high
so people come from all walks of life which

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.240
is great.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.769
I worked in the tech world but now I want
to become a chef.

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:35.230
Look at what Nate's doing in Seattle.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.310
Look at what modern
cuisine is happening there.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:44.060
That will answer a lot of questions--not just
on the modern American cuisine today--but

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:49.060
those guys are
so bright so they'll probably figure out--maybe

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:55.149
how, maybe they have the question to end famine?

00:11:55.149 --> 00:12:00.019
You know because that's how that
modern cuisine is part of what they're working

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:03.889
on and they're also working on these other
things and that's so great where cooks

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:08.260
are coming into this industry not just on
the --the way I got in--that's one way--but

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.399
it's so great to have people like Nate and
other people in the conversation because they're

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:17.680
going to ask themselves questions: "How can
we figure out better against diabetes?

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.149
Allergies?" and these big questions that we
have that I've find it is important as a chef--we

00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:24.160
have to.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.930
Filling restaurants, that's
part of our job and we should be doing this

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:30.630
especially if you have a big platform, you
should be doing that.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.742
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: But driving the larger conversation
about food and how things--

00:12:34.742 --> 00:12:35.742
&gt;&gt;Marcus: The larger conversation, absolutely.

00:12:35.742 --> 00:12:38.790
And that's what we do, I --my company--I'm
committed to that and that is why we have

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:43.790
community arm that is very strong and we do
cooking classes for free in the community.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.139
That's why we have a tech side that is very
strong.

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:47.620
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Tell us about the tech side.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.620
What are you doing?

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:56.680
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Well I just felt with MS.com and
FoodRepublic.com--I wanted--what I saw online

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.379
didn't sort of match with--the food
conversation I saw online didn't necessarily

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:05.720
match with how-why I got into the industry.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.230
I got into the industry about curiosity
and I went to learn.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.660
So I thought what an opportunity.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:16.860
What if Food Republic was focused on making
a food platform that was geared

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.779
towards men--so it's about forty-five/fifty
five percent men/women--that is women friendly

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:27.460
but that you learned something and we
celebrate each other as chefs so that was

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.810
a space that was open so we built a platform
around it.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.100
On MS.com its about
seventy-thirty women to men and there we might

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:40.490
focus on--it's very community oriented to
Harlem--its sort of a map into Harlem but

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:46.630
also what food healthy after yoga or after
you've been working out.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:54.379
So this adding something to the web space
was about learning and

00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:58.569
feeding people's curiosity and become better
cooks and become smarter shoppers in today's

00:13:58.569 --> 00:13:59.569
food space.

00:13:59.569 --> 00:14:00.569
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah.

00:14:00.569 --> 00:14:02.689
Well it's interesting that you're using the
platform that you've been given or that you've

00:14:02.689 --> 00:14:06.629
really created for
yourself between things like Top Chef and

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:10.589
your James Beard Awards and all the rest of
it to really become an activist in the food

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:14.790
movement and maybe people don't know that
much about that, so it's interesting that

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.240
you're--I mean it's great that you're doing
that.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.459
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I mean you have to I mean like these
wonderful platforms that you guys are part

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:24.649
of creating--evolving are there for us
as consumers right, so when I opened Red Rooster

00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:29.870
and I had doubts I went to Twitter right away
and I was like "Should I have

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:34.149
vintage plates or new plates?" and right away-shoosh-
vintage comes in right?

00:14:34.149 --> 00:14:38.680
"Should I do my Jamaican oxtail or Grandma's
oxtail?"

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.680
--whoosh--right away.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:45.649
[interviewer laughs] It's a fun way of engaging
and allowing people all over the world to

00:14:45.649 --> 00:14:51.069
participate and
feeling close to this narrative--this conversation.

00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:56.060
It's not about self-promotion, that's getting
tired, so I use Twitter as a--I

00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:03.019
curate carefully about the food conversation
I want to have and what I see because I'm

00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:10.329
lucky to be in Austin one day and Harlem the
next week and then maybe at a food market

00:15:10.329 --> 00:15:11.360
somewhere else right?

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.561
But I know that the people there hang out
with me online, they want

00:15:14.561 --> 00:15:18.249
to be part of that, so I think have to curate--I
can't just post anything, you know?

00:15:18.249 --> 00:15:19.249
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Observation--

00:15:19.249 --> 00:15:24.910
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Observation, sifting and making
a yummy, sticky space for the people that

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.050
want to engage.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.850
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: It's interesting how you've
used social media to influence the evolution

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:31.850
of Red Rooster.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.470
I think that's very
unusual, because I think chefs come in and

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:37.720
they have such a clear idea of what they want
to do and the personalities of the chefs

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:43.360
that I have met tend to be very controlling
for the most part, not in a bad way, so it's

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.199
amazing that you've been able to engage in
that dialog and actually have it influence

00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:48.889
your menu and influence the choices that you're
making in a really--

00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:52.069
&gt;&gt;Marcus: For me it was Red Rooster and I
didn't grow up in Harlem so I can't say that

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:55.810
I grew up there, but I wanted to create a
restaurant that was a mirror image food wise

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.350
of that community.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.589
And some people, depending on where you live,
where you grew up,

00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:07.170
know more or less about that community, it's
mystique, it's an old neighborhood, but maybe

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:11.139
everyone doesn't know about what it
really is and I thought, "Well, I've lived

00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:15.990
there for ten years, I want to map that out
on a menu.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.110
I want you to taste Harlem."

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:26.399
Well there's obviously a center of African-American
heritage there that we should honor.

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:31.309
There's also el barrio and on top of el
barrio there's a new Mexican community, therefore

00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:33.220
the tacquitos.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:38.029
There's also the Italian corridor, like it's
been there forever,

00:16:38.029 --> 00:16:44.550
and then you have this new West African because--yes,
there are Black African Americans, but the

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:49.990
West Africans has another new
ingredient that we might not know about so

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.920
that's why we have shrimp powder on the restaurant,
on the menu.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.509
So when you read the
menu of Red Rooster, it's curated and crafted

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:02.540
based on seasonality, but also based on Harlem.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.650
You see Harlem and that's our job
there.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.930
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That's amazing.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.990
In the--getting back to the book quickly,
you were pretty much an open book through

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:17.240
out the process
and really went raw and told a lot of details,

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.540
very personal, deeply personal things.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.070
I think if you're going to right a book like
that obviously you need to be prepared to

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:22.070
do that.

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.830
Was there anything you wish you had left out,
or a story that you actually wish

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:25.980
you had included?

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:31.550
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I mean, the process of writing this
book was over five years, three days a week,

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:36.590
I just woke up really early and wrote to
my editor and co-writer, Veronica.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.220
And I mean, we had to narrow it down to three
hundred something pages, from like fifteen

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.660
hundred pages--something like that.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:48.060
But, there's a lot of stories, a lot of moments
obviously that didn’t' get in there, but

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.590
you
know this book, like anything, was bad for

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.100
a long time before it got good.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.180
So there was a lot of stuff out there and
how does this stuff--you

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.240
know--that's where Andy came in and really
edited this well.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.310
And, how do I tell these stories?

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:06.510
I felt it like it was really about being
honest and not protecting--I knew when I walked

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.750
in I didn't want to do a victory lap.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.680
It's so male and so tired.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.370
[interviewer chuckles]
And I knew also that I wanted --if I'm going

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:20.680
to borrow time from the reader--borrow that
time--there's a lot of stuff they can

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.670
do--they needed to get to know me better.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:29.680
Like I've read books about known people that
you know less about them after spent, like

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.230
for me, two weeks, 'cause I read slow and
I'm pissed after that.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:38.070
[laughter]
You have to get to know me better than before,

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.070
right?

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.820
And also, learn something about yourself.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:45.740
I want this book to be a sense of a
mirror to yourself like "You know what, what

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.230
are we doing in that space?

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.110
Are we hiring from this community?"

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.020
Well there's a
project right across the street here, how

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.420
many of those people work for Google?

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.960
Like questions, questions, questions.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.110
What can we
do about that?

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.750
How can we engage in that community?

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.930
What responsibility do we have when we buy
these buildings?

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:06.930
Who that great for?

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.440
It's great for a lot of people, could be greater
for even more.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.590
What can we do to engage?

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.590
Questions.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.870
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: You know you're absolutely
right.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.500
You raised some good questions.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.500
I'd--

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.500
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Mmm hmm.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.500
That's why we should hang out and have a beer
together.[Marcus laughs]

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.060
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Let's hang out anytime you
want.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.060
I'm on it.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.060
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yeah.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.060
yeah.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.060
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I'll see you tomorrow.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.840
[laughter] One of the things that you talk
about in the book is the failure of Merkato

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.470
55
which I actually had the pleasure of dining

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.790
at before it opened; that makes me sound like
an insider--it was for an event that you

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:40.060
were doing and I had the honor of dining at
your restaurant before it closed and you kind

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.240
of highlighted that as one of your
biggest professional disappointments.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:49.180
It was quickly followed by, well in the book
it was quickly followed by Top Chef Masters,

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.620
cooking for the White House state dinner.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:57.060
I'm curious what that failure taught you,
what the failure of Merkato 55 brought

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.060
out of you?

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:02.750
&gt;&gt;Marcus: It taught me a lot, I mean, there's
no way Rooster would have been as delicious

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.830
and yummy without that failure, right?

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.110
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Why do you say that?

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.750
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Well, because you learn so much.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.000
You guys learn so much.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.250
You guys launch products all the time--

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.250
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That fail.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:20.310
&gt;&gt;Marcus: That fails miserably and these are
the smartest and the brightest, but I know

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.410
that you guys are sitting in war rooms and
saying "Why did it fail?

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.410
It can't fail.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.250
We gotta do better," and you come back at
it right?

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:35.810
And-- so I think for me I learned about
the conversation about African fine dining

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:36.810
is not wrong.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.110
That is not wrong.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.500
I should have learned more about the community.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.920
When
you're in the meat packing, there's nobody

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:49.660
would walk there on a Thursday at nine-thirty
that wants to have a Kumbaya African

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.660
experience.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:55.240
They want to stand on a table, do shots, and
have a good ass time.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.840
Well let them have it, but it should not be
African

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.780
good food, shouldn't be dragged down to that
misery.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:08.660
And shame on me for thinking that they were
even on the same conversation.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.060
I
think that is great that all that stuff is

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.200
there, and it has that incredible bridge and
tunnel feel,

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.851
[laughter]
which a bridge and tunnel should have, and

00:21:17.851 --> 00:21:19.131
that has nothing to do with {unintelligible}.

00:21:19.131 --> 00:21:23.080
I should have kept the two out of the way.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.630
So that's the quick answer right?

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:29.910
What else did it teach about myself?

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.030
You know it was 2006 when we signed the lease
and when

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:38.710
you're in this bubble of bigger, better, bigger,
better, you know that lease was, that rent

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.630
was about a hundred thousand dollars a month
for a

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.630
restaurant,

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:44.630
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Wow.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.120
&gt;&gt;Marcus: And we--I so wanted the deal I was
like "no problem, we'll just pack it."

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.820
You know and then you become chasing rent,
so

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.770
that informed my decision about doing something
that I would not be chasing--commit is still

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.150
to chase flavor, not to chasing rent.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.160
It taught me so many things.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.720
Again, the purity of the product wasn't wrong,
it was my head wasn't clear and I wanted to

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:08.620
do it too
bad so two things was good about it: we quit

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:16.760
before it got bad bad, and I learned on how
to listen and walk a neighborhood more.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.700
And
that's why I walked around Harlem before I

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.700
engaged.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:28.120
So hindsight, it all worked out, but it took
me a lot of self--sort of learning and so

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.890
it's like okay.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.480
And it's good, it's good.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:37.440
You get humbled and you listen and you get
better, or you don't and then there's another

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.920
path.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:47.200
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Well, in the book you bring
a lot of tastes so much to life, I'm wondering

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.730
if there's a cookbook in the works
for "Yes, Chef" like a journey of Chef Samuelsson?

00:22:51.730 --> 00:23:00.400
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yeah, I mean, a lot of people have
asked and actually---maybe it's called "No,

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.400
Chef" I don't know.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.400
[Marcus and audience laugh]

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.650
I don't know.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:10.100
We thought--I struggle with this a lot--but
I've never done anything where there wasn't

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.100
food.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.890
I'm like, I know this is a
memoir but how many recipes can we--are we

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:14.180
going to have?

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.920
And Andy's like, "None."

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.490
My editor said, "None."

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.450
I was like, "Whoa!"

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.500
I
was nervous about how to engage with an audience

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.231
without food, and not stand on it in anyway.

00:23:27.231 --> 00:23:29.860
Even when I speak, I always bring up
food terms.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:36.120
So that was a first for me, and I think--I
don't even think about what's next in terms

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.980
of writing things in terms of
"Yes, Chef" right now, because I feel like

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.110
we're in the middle of it.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:46.250
It's been a great run, and we have now, it's
sort of the

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.640
product of what comes out of it, I don't know.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.640
We'll see.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.640
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Okay.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.730
&gt;&gt;Marcus: But it's a interesting idea, yes--chef.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.400
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: All right, we'll take a percentage.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.250
So there was a great article just over the
weekend in The Times--

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.250
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yeah.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.463
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: --leading up to this event
I'm sure about [Marcus laughs] building--

00:24:01.463 --> 00:24:03.790
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I love that!

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:08.060
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: About building your brand and
sort of the empire that is Marcus Samuelsson.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.910
Can you talk to us a little bit about
the brand of Marcus Samuelsson and the pressure

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.690
of that and sort of how that's all going and
what's--

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:20.010
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Well I don't think any of it--I
get annoyed when you're a known person with

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:24.130
a platform and you talk about the pressure.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.480
Pressure is being outside looking in.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.950
Pressure is "How am I going to pay my rent?"

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:30.950
That's pressure.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.990
"How am I going to provide for
my family?"

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.620
Anyone with a platform and has an option on
what to do and how to curate a grade--lucky.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.100
You're lucky.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:43.070
And you're privileged and
that's what my sort of obsession with curation

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.250
for the audience is, right?

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.850
Because I know if we don't take care of that,
lights

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.850
out.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.020
Very quickly.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.280
So I wouldn't--I never look at it as pressure.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.630
I look at it as we have to be gooder than
the rest, there has to

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:09.190
be narrative because the people that take
time out and spend money with us deserve it.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:14.840
And I think about everything that we touch
on that level.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.490
And it has to be--it can never be a false
promise.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:23.020
And if we're a two dollar cornbread, it should
feel like a

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.300
twenty-eight dollar cornbread.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.800
And the reality is--

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.800
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: There's twenty-eight dollar
cornbread?

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.800
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Well--

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.800
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Where are you eating?

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.800
Where--

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.800
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Truffles, truffles.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.310
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [laughs] Fair enough.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:38.310
&gt;&gt;Marcus: The reality is that I live in a
community where most of those great, grand

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:42.770
experiences and amenities are south of that
community.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:44.880
And I resent that.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.610
And I'm not going to walk around angry, walking
around--"This is wrong, this is wrong."

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.090
That's not
gonna happen.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.760
I'm going to provide it in my community first.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.420
So when you do that trip, when you come with
that beautiful bag, that

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:02.640
changes your narrative of uptown and commercialism
is very fast.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.340
It's now changed real estate, it's now changed
job progression, so

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.540
it'll happen and it can be cornbread at a
time.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.440
If it's curated; if it's done really sticky,
yummy delicious.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.440
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And not twenty-eight dollars--

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.390
&gt;&gt;Marcus: And that's what I think about.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.730
You think about the brand, well that's the
brand, right?

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:26.370
It's aspirational; it's inclusive
versus exclusive; and of course it's easier

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:31.060
when you're a Swedopian living in Harlem to
think about those because I have

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:37.240
different--I think about my grandmother from
Sweden or my sisters and brothers in Africa,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.140
they're in my conversation.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.810
And I think
about the chef that I grew up with, you know,

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:49.150
because it's an encompassing inclusiveness
that others might or might not have been

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.680
exposed to.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.890
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I want to open it up for questions
in a couple of minutes because there's a lot

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:55.890
of--

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:56.890
&gt;&gt;Marcus: No you don't.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:57.890
You’re a good interviewer.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:58.890
This is all you.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:26:59.890
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Thank you!

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:00.890
An Indian Oprah up here.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.720
I just want to do a couple "finish this sentence
for me" and then we'll open it

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.720
up for questions.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.720
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Oh wow.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.060
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So people can get ready to
ask their questions at one of the two mics

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.710
because we are recording for YouTube that
would be great.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:12.710
So if you'll fin--are you ready?

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:13.710
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I'm ready.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.710
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: All right.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.030
Swedish food is?

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:20.280
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Salty, pickled, delicious.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.340
[laughter]

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.150
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Fusion cooking is?

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:30.990
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Can be confusion-confusing, but
is also eye opener because it's cross right,

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.990
it's essentially a cross.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:38.140
I think there's a
new word--I think we're going to look at Fusion

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.910
the way that we look at a fax machine or a
VCR.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.670
It was a moment but there's
definitely a better product coming out of

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:45.670
that.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.670
So--

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.340
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: What's a better word for it?

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:54.290
&gt;&gt;Marcus: You know, I don't know if I have
a good word for it, but I do think that it's

00:27:54.290 --> 00:28:00.260
sort of like, it encompasses ethnic
somewhere right?

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.920
And cross?

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:08.400
Fusion, it comes from using in jazz, and sometimes
a food word gotta come and be in and of the

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.030
foods, you
know?

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.900
That's why when you work with foods like food
desert, it doesn't work because there's not

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.310
a desert in those places.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.000
Like
it's got to come in and of--that's why I like--not

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.110
like but focus more on food chasm because
it's choices that we deliberately made

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:28.741
that certain people should be in on food and
good options and certain people should not.

00:28:28.741 --> 00:28:31.590
It's not a desert, it's a decision.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.460
&gt;&gt;Interview: Okay.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.300
Junk food is?

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.680
&gt;&gt;Marcus: When I was a kid, it was aspirational,
because I never got it.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.510
[laughter]
Never.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.250
So it's like this thing over here, right,
but still, as bad as it is, it also inspires

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:49.580
us a lot to do--like when a chef
when we are fun we think about something we

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:55.560
use words as we go there we think about fast
cash, we think about burger but we do our

00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:02.991
inspiration of it, we think about fries, but
we do our version, so it can be fast, it can

00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:06.480
be delicious, depends on who makes it,
right?

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.960
It's like the author, it's like the chef.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.960
So.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.890
I suck at this thing by the way.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.170
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: No, you're great at it.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:15.570
[laughter] Good.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.500
Food bloggers are?

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.910
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Hmm.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:25.440
Well, we are--we now--we hire and we work
with The Tribe.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.320
So, it took me a long time to understand that
whole thing.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.790
A long time.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.140
I like it now.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.960
Took me a long time.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.070
We joined.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.070
[laughter]

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.080
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: My favorite thing about Harlem
is?

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.330
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Oh, the people.

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:41.460
The people.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:45.940
It's the closest thing to Africa, it's the
best thing of life.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.150
Like I always say, it's like a
Polaroid picture.

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:52.190
Sh-sh-sh, oh there it is.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.940
It's very--it's imperfect, it's perfect, it's
great.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.940
Good.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.940
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Very Good.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.960
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Good part of town.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:58.960
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Reality--

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.600
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Maybe we should have an office.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.600
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: What's that?

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.880
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Where Google should have an office.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.440
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: All right, I'll tell them.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:10.840
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I'm a complete believer that tech
should be uptown.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:16.900
Young people, lot of space, open minded, and
it would completely

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.520
change north Manhattan.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.960
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: There's a lot of movement towards
sort of a tech center/entrepreneurial center

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.940
in the Bronx.[mumbles]

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.920
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Mmm Hmm.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.920
Great.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.000
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Reality chef competitions are?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.830
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Fun, exhausting, and I love the
fact that it gets the family involved.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.770
So many times when you have like kids and
parents

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.660
coming like "we--" --I'll tell you a funny
thing like I did a cooking class in the Harlem

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.900
and this kid come up to me and I was
doing the salad between the chicken and some

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:54.860
cheese, he said, "Chef, is that ricotta?"
and he was thirteen years old, and I was

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.000
like, "Yeah, how do you know that?"

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.850
He's like, "I'm watching Chop, you know?"

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:02.570
[laughter] And the window in, the fact that
"Whoa" I

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:07.830
had not idea the difference between Ricotta
or Brie at thirteen years old.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:12.520
So it can be that and if it is the window
into for us to eat better or

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.890
learn, have conversation about food--fantastic!

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:20.300
It can also be very similar to sports right?

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.490
We watch more sports, doesn't mean
that we are healthier.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:27.080
[laughter] So it really depends--it really
depends how you do it.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.201
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I think many American men watching
football on Saturday, or Sunday rather, would

00:31:31.201 --> 00:31:32.201
disagree with that.

00:31:32.201 --> 00:31:33.700
They think
they're very healthy.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.950
My husband being one of them, just watching
the football.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:36.950
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:40.300
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I told him he's not actually
on the team, but he doesn't agree with me

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.300
at all.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.430
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yeah, in his mind at that moment,
he is.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:44.660
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah, he's on the team.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.660
He's the coach.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.660
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yeah.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.660
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Home is?

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.660
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Harlem, uptown.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.660
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Awesome.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.660
Thank you.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.660
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Good.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.660
All right.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.660
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Any questions?

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.660
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yeah, we have to have questions.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.860
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: We have somebody waiting up
there?

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.050
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I like it.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:01.340
&gt;&gt;Male speaker #1: Before I get to my question,
may I add one thing to your "Do not ever say

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.380
again" list?

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.380
Tech is for young.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.450
&gt;&gt;Marcus: You're right.

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:05.450
You're right.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:06.470
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That's true.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:08.080
&gt;&gt;Marcus: That's is--you're right.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.290
Shame on me.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.290
[laughter]

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:11.310
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: You're being schooled.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:14.530
&gt;&gt;Marcus: I can't wait for the game though.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:16.910
&gt;&gt;Male speaker #1: Another learning.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:17.910
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yeah.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:23.430
&gt;&gt;Male speaker #1: I have a nephew whose been
enthusiastic about food since he was four,

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:30.300
I mean we gave him espresso cups as a
birthday present when he was four, and he

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.610
was already working on his knife skill thing--

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.180
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: What could possibly go wrong?

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.180
[laughter]

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:40.490
&gt;&gt;Male speaker #1: He's just finishing up
his first year at Johnson and Wales in Providence--

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:41.780
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Nice, good school.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.780
Good choice.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:50.370
&gt;&gt;Male speaker #1: But after a summer of doing
nothing but making Pico de Gallo, he's really

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:55.090
thinking seriously now about "Maybe I want
to be a food scientist working for a big corporation,

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:58.640
maybe this restaurant thing is not for me,"
I mean might he be on the right

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.120
track or might he be missing something.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.510
I mean it's an incredibly tough lifestyle,
it's incredibly tough life.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:08.280
Is he blowing it
off too soon or maybe being wise that it's

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.280
not for everybody?

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.560
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Well, I think the good thing with
him is he's asking himself important questions.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:21.590
And, you know, where he is in that
stage of "Who am I?" and "What do I want?"

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.670
right?

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:27.700
Today, in cooking, you can be an incredible
food scientist and Johnson and Wales

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.600
was a good part of that journey.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.450
When I was coming up, you could basically
chef.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:34.450
That was one area--to be chef, so there's
twenty

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:41.190
entry levels today about cooking, I think
him finding this out, he's on his own path

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:47.200
and journey, is the answer and the great thing
is that he can do that, and then when he's

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.230
twenty-five, twenty-six, maybe he wants to
try a restaurant again, and then maybe he

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:56.050
wants to solve how to make the best deep fried
chicken the healthiest in the world and guess,

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:59.830
he sits on the knowledge on both
sides then by then.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:05.030
The path that he's on, I think, is more of
what the common new chef is going to be like.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:08.879
It's not just one area
of the guy who didn't like to go to school,

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:09.879
became a chef.

00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:13.899
That was what my generation pretty much came
out of.

00:34:13.899 --> 00:34:16.010
The next one's
going to come in so many different levels

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.540
and he represents that.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.899
So, his journey's his journey.

00:34:19.899 --> 00:34:24.850
I would never put tough or
challenging around being a chef.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:31.550
I just don't think that's --. When you truly
--it's your craft--it picked you and

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:38.330
you picked--it's tougher to do something you
don't like.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:41.070
Because you'd rather work fifteen hours a
day with something that you

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:46.950
love, than twelve hours a day with something
that you hate, right?

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:49.130
That's really the math that you have to do.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.130
So, that's that.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:51.630
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker #1: Thank you very much.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.630
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Thank you.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.630
Yes?

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.630
&gt;&gt;Female speaker #1: Hi, so--

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.630
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Take that mic down a little bit,
come on.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.630
[laughter]

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:57.630
&gt;&gt;Female speaker #1: It was for a taller person.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.630
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yes.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:03.450
&gt;&gt;Female speaker #1: So going back to the
book, I read it, I thought it was so moving,

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:08.370
it's clearly such a distinctly you
story, but when it resonates with so many

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:09.450
people.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:15.520
I was so curious what it was like to work
with a writer on such a personal story,

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.270
what she brought to the party and--

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.270
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yeah.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.270
Yeah, a lot.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:20.440
&gt;&gt;Female speaker #1: How the process changed
because of it?

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.290
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Well, she brought spelling.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:27.330
[laughter]
How about that basic, you know after I've

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:32.690
lived in six countries, and I can't spell
in one language well.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:33.690
I can't.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:38.520
I mean, I keep
this sort of twelve year old sort of knowledge--actually

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:44.480
younger, nine year old sort of vocabulary
because I don't know how to

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:50.360
spell those words I want to say so--she brought
that, but I also had to be--you know I knew

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.070
Veronica, I knew Veronica for a long
time--and the trust was everything right?

00:35:55.070 --> 00:36:06.850
So Veronica--very thoughtful, and she knew
the story I needed and wanted and was

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.360
committed to tell.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:15.220
And I'm so privileged that Random House, and
it was three years in a row I'd have to go

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.640
Random House and say
"Hey, the book's not good, we got to wait

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.640
a year."

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.640
Three years.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.790
And they supported it.

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:26.220
And I was nervous taking that elevator up
because so many times they could have just

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.622
said "You know what, we're going to cancel
the whole thing."

00:36:28.622 --> 00:36:32.810
But they supported it because
they wanted--there was a good story in there.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:38.060
And I was very grateful for that and Veronica
and Andy, the editor, constantly kept

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.553
me, "It's got to be stories, it's got to be
good stories."

00:36:40.553 --> 00:36:42.740
When if it wasn't good, we eighty-sixed it.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.599
We didn't put it.

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:49.471
So working
with her specifically was about trust, and

00:36:49.471 --> 00:36:52.860
she spends way too much time with me for her
family.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.820
You know she came up and not with a
[unintelligible],

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:55.820
[Interviewer coughs]

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.280
I mean she made it work.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.800
She brought her daughter in the kitchen and
her husband came and I always had to constantly

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.490
pay them
with fried chicken.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:07.140
[laughter] But you know, we were committed,
we were in a band, you know.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:13.530
So much about doing this when you give
is you got to be in, in, and if you're not,

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:16.390
then you can't tell a story.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:17.390
So.

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:18.390
[Interviewer coughs]

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.130
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excuse me.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.000
Any other questions?

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.870
&gt;&gt; Marcus: Well, great.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:24.870
[laughter]

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.420
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I asked them all.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.420
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Yes.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.450
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Thank you so much--

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.450
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Thank you.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:30.540
It's always a privilege to get here.
