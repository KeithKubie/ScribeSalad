00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.492
- [Instructor] Divya received
the following problem.

00:00:03.492 --> 00:00:05.419
A particle moves in a
straight line with velocity

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.370
v of t is equal to the square root

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.622
of three t minus one meters per second,

00:00:09.622 --> 00:00:11.781
where t is time in seconds.

00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:13.082
At t equals two,

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:15.172
the particle's distance
from the starting point

00:00:15.172 --> 00:00:18.887
was eight meters in
the positive direction.

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:22.741
What is the particle's position
at t equals seven seconds?

00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:25.690
Which expression should Divya
use to solve the problem?

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.896
So pause this video and have a go at it.

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:30.659
Alright now let's do this together.

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.560
So we wanna know the particle's position

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.813
at t is equal to seven.

00:00:36.813 --> 00:00:38.020
So what we could do,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.898
they tell us what our
position is at t equals two,

00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:44.173
so what the position at

00:00:44.173 --> 00:00:46.101
t equals seven would be your position

00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:47.768
at t equals two plus

00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:50.501
your change

00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:53.008
in position

00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:56.968
from t equals two

00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:01.508
to t is equal to seven.

00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:04.909
And there's another word for this.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.045
You could also call this your displacement

00:01:07.045 --> 00:01:10.045
from t equals two to t equals seven.

00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:13.709
And we know how to think
about displacement.

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:17.889
Velocity is your rate of
change of displacement.

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:20.071
And so if you wanna figure
out your displacement,

00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:22.463
your between two times,

00:01:22.463 --> 00:01:24.785
you would integrate the velocity function.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.527
So this is going to be the integral

00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:29.290
from t equals two to t equals seven

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.167
of our velocity function, v of t, dt.

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:36.232
This would be our displacement
from time two to time seven.

00:01:36.232 --> 00:01:37.765
So if they said what is
our change in position

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:39.228
from time two to time seven,

00:01:39.228 --> 00:01:41.271
it would be just this expression.

00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:42.363
But they want us,

00:01:42.363 --> 00:01:43.361
they want us to figure out,

00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:44.731
or they want Divya to figure out,

00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:47.564
what is the particle's position
at t equals seven seconds.

00:01:47.564 --> 00:01:49.096
So what you'd wanna do is your position

00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:50.722
at t equals two,

00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:52.997
and we know what our
position at t equals two is.

00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:55.203
It was eight meters in
the positive direction,

00:01:55.203 --> 00:01:57.548
so we could just call that
positive eight meters.

00:01:57.548 --> 00:01:59.778
So it's going to be eight plus

00:01:59.778 --> 00:02:01.937
your change in position,

00:02:01.937 --> 00:02:03.655
which is going to be your displacement.

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:05.954
And let's see we can see this choice

00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:08.137
right over there,

00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:09.646
and that's what we would pick.

00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:10.853
This first option,

00:02:10.853 --> 00:02:13.222
v of seven, that just gives us our

00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:15.660
velocity at time seven,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.818
or at the exactly at seven seconds.

00:02:18.818 --> 00:02:22.951
Or another way, our rate
of change of displacement

00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:24.925
at seven seconds.

00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:26.341
So that's not what we want.

00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:27.572
This one right over here,

00:02:27.572 --> 00:02:29.731
you have your position

00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:31.612
at t equals two,

00:02:31.612 --> 00:02:33.191
but then you have your change in position

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:36.651
from t equals zero to t equals seven.

00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:39.042
So this doesn't seem, this isn't right.

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:42.224
And this is your position at time two

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:43.724
plus your v prime,

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:47.727
the derivative of velocity
is the acceleration,

00:02:47.727 --> 00:02:49.422
plus your acceleration at time seven,

00:02:49.422 --> 00:02:51.094
so that's definitely not gonna give you

00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:53.880
your the particle's position.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.958
So we like that second choice.
