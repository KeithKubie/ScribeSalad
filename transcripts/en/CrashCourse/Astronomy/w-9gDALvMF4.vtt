00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.000
The Earth is a planet.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.340
That’s a profound statement, and one that’s
not really all that obvious. For thousands

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.950
of years, planets were just bright lights
in the sky, one-dimensional points that wandered

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.330
among the fixed stars. How could the Earth
be one of them?

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.440
With the invention of the telescope those dots
became worlds, and with spacecraft they became

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.600
places. The Earth went from being our unique home
in the Universe to one of many such…well, planets.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.890
The Earth is the largest of the terrestrial
planets, the four smaller, denser, rocky worlds

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.350
orbiting close in to the Sun. It’s about
13,000 kilometers across, and has a single,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.840
large Moon which we’ll learn a lot more
about next week.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.850
Unlike the other three terrestrial planets,
Earth has something very important: Water.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.160
Or, more specifically, liquid water on its
surface, where it can flow around, evaporate,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.890
become clouds, rain down, and then mix up
chemicals so they can do interesting, complex

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.800
things—like support life.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.190
Earth’s ability to sustain life depends
on that water. It also depends on Earth’s

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.299
atmosphere, of course—breathing has its
advantages—and both, weirdly enough, depend

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.729
on Earth’s magnetic field to exist. And
that, in turn, depends on what’s going on

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.539
deep inside our planet. So, let’s take a
look.

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.389
Like the Sun, the Earth is a many-layered
thing. At its very center is the core, which

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:33.819
actually has two layers, the inner core and
the outer core.

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.279
The inner core is solid, and made mostly of
iron and nickel. These are heavy elements,

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:41.819
and sank to the center of the planet when
it was forming, leaving lighter elements like

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.349
oxygen, silicon, and nitrogen to rise to the
surface. The solid inner core is about 1200

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.319
kilometers in radius, or about 10% the radius
of the Earth.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.039
The outer core is also mostly iron and nickel,
but it’s liquid. The material in it can

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.069
flow. It’s about 2200 kilometers thick.

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.889
The temperature in the Earth’s core is tremendously
high, reaching 5500° C. The pressure is huge

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.770
as well, as you might expect with the weight
of an entire planet sitting on top of it.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.569
You might think at such a high temperature,
iron would be a liquid, but iron can stay

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.760
solid if the pressure is high enough. In the
inner core, the pressure is extremely high,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.930
and even though it’s hot, iron is solid.
In the outer core, where it’s still hot,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.530
but the pressure is a little bit lower, iron
is a liquid.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.540
Above the core is the mantle.It’s about
2900 kilometers thick. The consistency of

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.319
the mantle is weird; most people think it’s
like lava, but really it’s like very thick

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.989
hot plastic. It behaves more or less like
a solid, but over long periods of time, geologic

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.159
periods of time, it can flow. We’ll get
back to that in a sec.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.159
On top of the mantle is the crust, a solid
layer of rock. The overall density of the

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.599
rock in the crust is less than in the mantle,
so in a sense it floats on the mantle. There

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.900
are two types of crust on Earth: Oceanic crust,
which is about 5 kilometers thick, and continental

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:01.800
crust, which is a much beefier 30-50 kilometers thick.
Still, the crust is very thin compared to the other layers.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.439
The crust isn’t a solid piece, though; it’s
broken up into huge plates, and these can

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.979
move. What drives the movement of these plates
is the flow of the rock in the mantle, and

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.840
that, in turn, is powered by heat.

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.170
The core of the Earth heats the bottom of
the mantle. This causes convection; the warmer

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.100
material rises. It’s not exactly a speed demon,
though: The rate of flow is only a couple

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.600
of centimeters per year, so it takes about 50 or 60
thousand years for a blob to move a single kilometer.

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.340
The hot material rises toward the surface,
but it’s blocked by the crust. The magmatic

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.459
rock pushes on the plates, causing them to
slide around very slowly. Your fingernails

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.519
grow at about the same rate the continents
move. Over millions of years, though, this

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.090
adds up, changing the surface geography of
the Earth—where you see continents now is

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.469
not at all where they were millions of years ago.

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:56.010
In some places, generally where the plates come
together, the crust is weaker. Magma can push

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.730
its way through, erupting onto the surface,
forming volcanoes. Other volcanoes, like Hawaii

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.109
or the Canary Islands, are thought to be from
a plume of hotter material punching its way

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.170
right through the middle of a continental
plate. As the plate moves, the hot spot forms

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.110
a linear chain of volcanoes over millions
of years.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.120
Volcanoes create new land as material wells
out, but they also pump gas out of the Earth

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.310
too. A large part of Earth’s atmosphere
was supplied from volcanoes!

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.270
The interior of the Earth is hot; in the core,
it’s about as hot as the surface of the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.900
Sun! Where did that heat come from?

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.430
Most of it is leftover from the Earth’s
formation, more than 4.5 billion years ago.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.639
As rock and other junk accumulated to form
the proto-Earth, their collisions heated them

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.330
up. As the Earth grew that heat built up,
and it’s still toasty inside even today.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.210
Also, as the Earth formed and gained mass
it began to contract under its own gravity,

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.419
and this squeezing added heat to the material.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.500
Another source is elements like uranium deep
inside the Earth, which add heat as the atoms

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.810
radioactively decay. And a fourth source of
heat is from dense material like iron and

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.340
nickel sinking to the center of the Earth,
which warms things up due to friction.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.949
All of these things add up to a lot of heat,
which is why, after all these billions of

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.699
years, the Earth still has a fiery heart.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.120
The outer core of the Earth is liquid metal,
which conducts electricity. The liquid convects,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.520
and this motion generates magnetic fields,
similar to the way plasma in the Sun generates

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.960
magnetic fields. The Earth’s rotation helps
organize this motion into huge cylindrical

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.250
rolls that align with the Earth’s axis.
The overall effect generates a magnetic field

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.690
similar to a bar magnet, with a magnetic north
pole and south pole, which lie close to the

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.690
physical spin axis poles of the Earth.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.889
The loops of magnetism surround the Earth,
and play a very important role: They deflect

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.860
most of the charged particles from the solar
wind, and they trap some, too. Without the

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.430
geomagnetic field, that solar wind would hit
the Earth’s atmosphere directly. Over billions

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.440
of years, that would erode the Earth’s air
away, like a sand blaster stripping paint

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.539
off a wall. Mars, for example, doesn’t have
a strong magnetic field, and we think that’s

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.599
why its atmosphere is mostly gone today.

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.460
But we do have an atmosphere, and it’s more
than just air blowing around. Earth’s atmosphere

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.069
is the layer of gas above the crust. Because
it’s not solid, it doesn’t just stop,

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.289
it just sort of fades away with height. By accepted
definition—and by that I mean it’s not

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.009
really science, it’s more of a “Eh, let’s
just do it this way” kind of thing—the

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.699
line between Earth’s atmosphere and space
is set at 100 kilometers up. This is what’s

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:24.129
called the Kármán line, and if you get above
it, congratulations! You’re an astronaut.

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:31.860
The atmosphere is, by volume, about 78% nitrogen,
21% oxygen, 1% argon of all things, and then

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.480
an assortment of trace gases. There’s water
vapor, too, almost all of it below a height

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.139
of about 8-15 kilometers. This part of the
atmosphere is warmest at the bottom, which

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:45.639
means we get convection in the air, creating
currents of rising air, which carry water

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.280
with them, forming clouds, which in turn is
why we have weather.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.569
At a height of about 25 kilometers on average
is a layer of ozone, a molecule of oxygen

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:58.750
that’s good at absorbing solar ultraviolet
light. That kind of light can break apart

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.470
biological molecules, so the ozone
layer is critical for our protection.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.480
Incidentally, the Earth’s magnetic field
does more than trap solar wind particles;

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.650
it also channels some of them down into the
atmosphere, where they slam into air molecules

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.360
about 150 kilometers up. This energizes the
molecules, which respond by emitting light

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.919
in different colors: Nitrogen glows red and
blue, oxygen red and green. We call this glow

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:24.300
the aurora, and it happens near the geomagnetic
poles—far north and south. The lights can

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.889
form amazing ribbons and sheets, depending
on the shape of the magnetic field.

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:30.800
I’ve never seen an aurora. Some day.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.000
You may not be aware of the atmosphere unless
the wind is blowing, but it’s there. It

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.330
exerts a pressure on the surface of the Earth
of about a kilogram per square centimeter,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.220
or nearly ten tons per cubic meter! There’s
roughly ton of air pushing down on you right

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.280
now! You don’t feel it because it’s actually
pushing in all directions—down, to the sides,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.780
even up—and our bodies have an internal
pressure that balances that out.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.139
The Earth also has liquid water on its surface,
unique among the planets. The continental

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:59.990
crust is higher than oceanic crust, so water
flows down to fill those huge basins. The

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.360
Earth’s surface is about 70% covered in
water. Most likely, some of this water formed

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.439
when the Earth itself formed, and some may
have come from comet and asteroid impacts

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:13.500
billions of years ago. The exact proportion
of locally sourced versus extraterrestrial

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.219
water is still a topic of argument among scientists.

00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:20.689
Earlier, I mentioned trace molecules of gas
in the atmosphere. One of these is carbon

00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:26.699
dioxide, which only constitutes about 0.04%
of the lower atmosphere. But it’s critical.

00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:30.439
Sunlight heats the ground, which emits infrared
light. If this infrared light were allowed

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:34.909
to radiate into space, the Earth would cool.
But carbon dioxide traps that kind of light,

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.230
and the Earth doesn’t cool as efficiently.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.670
This so-called greenhouse effect warms the
Earth. Without it, the average temperature

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.660
on Earth would be below the freezing point
of water! We’d be an iceball.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.060
This is why climate scientists are concerned
about carbon dioxide. A little is a good thing,

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.050
but too much can be very dangerous. Since
the Industrial Revolution, we’ve added a

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:59.110
lot of the gas to our atmosphere, trapping
more heat. By every measure available, the

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.670
heat content of the Earth is increasing, upsetting
the balance. It’s melting glaciers in Antarctica

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.980
and Greenland, as well as sea ice at the north
pole. Sea levels are going up, and some of

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.580
the extra CO2 in the air is absorbed by the
oceans, acidifiying them.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.080
There's an old concept in science fiction called
terraforming: Going to uninhabitable alien

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.830
planet and engineering it to be more Earthlike.
I don’t know what the opposite process would

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.710
be called, but it’s what we’re doing to
Earth right now.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.630
The Earth is the only habitable planet in
the solar system. And you know what?

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.160
We should  keep it that way.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.320
Today you learned that the Earth is a planet,
with a hot core, a thick layer of molten rock

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.100
called the mantle, and a thin crust. The outer
core generates a strong magnetic field, which

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.220
protects the Earth’s atmosphere from the
onslaught of the solar wind. Motion in the

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.620
mantle creates volcanoes, and the surface
is mostly covered in water. The Earth’s

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.630
atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, and it’s
getting warmer due to human influence.
