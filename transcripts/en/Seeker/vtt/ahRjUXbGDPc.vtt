00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:11.440
Smoking is bad for the kids, but just how
far should we go with these smoking bans?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.160
Hey smoking hot peeps!

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.179
Yea that didn't work did it?

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.179
Hi I'm Trace.

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:17.970
Thanks for watching Dnews.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.140
Cigarettes are little paper-wrapped tobacco
sticks, but they're also full of death.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.980
If you've been anywhere near a classroom or
television in the last few decades, you've

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.730
likely seen ads advocating for quitting smoking.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.060
Forty of the United States have laws banning
smoking in public places in some capacity.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.140
In spite of the contentious debate over smoking
bans, studies in Europe have found no real

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.520
evidence of positive or negative impact on
people's subjective well-being under those

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.530
bans.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.550
So are they helpful?

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.330
Fifty years ago half of all American adults
smoke cigarettes.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.730
Today, it's only one in five.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.730
Sounds pretty good.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.970
Smokers who want to quit told researchers
in Europe public bans helped keep them from

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.970
smoking.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.630
Plus, there are over 250 chemical in secondhand
smoke and numerous studies showing the damage

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.100
it can cause.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Personally and subjectively, I love going
home after a night at the bar without having

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.850
everything I'm wearing smelling like smoke.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.870
That is nice.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.060
In a new national poll conducted by the University
of Michigan, 87 percent of adults polled are

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.320
in favor of going one step further from a
public smoking ban and actually banning smoking

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.600
in cars where there are children.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.650
Officially there are already some states that
ban smoking in cars with kids including Arkansas,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.790
Louisiana, California, and Maine.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.770
Is there a health benefit for the kids?

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.120
Very much so.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.310
There are numerous studies showing that children
exposed to environmental tobacco smoke experience

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.830
increased rates of lower respiratory illness,
middle ear effusion, asthma and even sudden

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.210
infant death syndrome or SIDS.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.659
But the cars man, was the cars that really
was a shocker for me.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.340
A study by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health states that secondhand smoke

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.159
is higher in cars than it ever was.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.850
In even smoky bars and restaurants prior to
those bans.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.350
To prove this, they sampled the air in cars
with smokers and non-smokers over a period

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.350
of 24 hours.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.080
In those where one to three cigarettes were
smoked, airborne concentrations of nicotine

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.580
were 72 times higher than in smoke-free cars.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.940
Study say the chemicals from smoke permeate
car upholstery causing third-hand smoke or

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.720
residual secondhand smoke.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.710
And statistically, people who smoke and drive
have a higher risk of car crashes resulting

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.840
in injury and death.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.290
This brings up an interesting conversation.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.510
As second hand smoke have no safe levels,
thats reiterated across many studies, when

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.860
do the laws stop?

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.150
As of now there are no national laws regulating
smoking in a confined space, like a car.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.160
Is this a step too far to start doing so?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.060
If we ban smoking in our own cars, what about
your house?

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.060
If there are kids around, is it going to be
banned there too?

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.060
Where's the line?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.410

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.410

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.640
Thanks, see ya.
