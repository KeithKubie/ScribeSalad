[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.914 --> 00:00:06.580
CHIP CONLEY: Hi.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.140
Let's start by saying I
apologize for a little bit

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.030
of a hoarse throat.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.800
Yeah, you go on a book
tour, and you lose

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.470
things, including your voice.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.280
So I'm going to start with
about a 10-minute talk

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.690
that I gave two weeks ago at
TED headquarters in New York,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.050
and it goes on the ted.com
website a week from today.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.730
So this is a 10-minute talk.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.784
Then I'll talk a
little bit more about,

00:00:30.784 --> 00:00:32.409
what does it mean to
be a modern elder?

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.520
What are the qualities of
a what a modern elder--

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.791
what are the qualities that
a modern elder exhibits?

00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:38.540
And then I'll talk a
little bit about what

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.690
I think companies can
do to actually foster

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.320
more intergenerational
collaboration and wisdom.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.370
Sound good?

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.000
And then we'll do a Q&amp;A.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.710
All right, so it
was my third day

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.390
on the job at a hot Silicon
Valley startup in early 2013.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.320
I was more than twice the
age of the dozen engineers

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.191
in the room.

00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:02.690
I had been brought
into the company,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.360
because I was a seasoned
expert in my field,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.020
but in that particular
room, I felt like a newbie

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.970
amongst the tech geniuses.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.760
So I did my best
to be invisible.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.050
And then the 25-year-old wizard,
who was leading the meeting,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.950
turned to me and asked,
if you shipped a feature,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.940
and no one used it,
did it really ship?

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.980
Ship a feature?

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.000
Whoa, oy vey.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.910
I realized Chip was in
deep shit, because I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.870
had no idea what he
was talking about.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.060
After an awkward
silence, he mercifully

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.140
moved on to someone else,
and I slid down in my chair,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.110
and I couldn't wait for
that meeting to end.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.420
That was my introduction to
Airbnb five and 1/2 years ago.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.330
I had been invited by the
three millennial co-founders

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.310
to join the company to help
them take this small tech

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.530
startup, fast-growing
tech startup,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.410
and turn it into a
global hospitality brand,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.669
but also to be the
in-house mentor for Brian

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.620
Chesky, the CEO.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.600
So all that sounded
good, because I'd

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.700
spent, from age 26 to 52, being
a boutique hotel entrepreneur,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.320
and I'd amassed a lot of
hospitality knowledge.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.900
But after my first
week at Airbnb,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.660
I realized that the
brave new home-sharing

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.160
world didn't need most of my old
school bricks and mortar hotel

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.080
insights.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.690
A stark reality rocked me.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.690
What do I have to offer
these young people?

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.650
I've never worked
in a tech company.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.040
I'm 52 years old, and I'd
never worked at a tech company

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.140
at that point.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.500
I was reporting to someone
21 years younger than me--

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.220
Brian.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.230
But I was also
supposed to mentor him.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.410
I was the head of global
hospitality and strategy.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.630
Five and 1/2 years
ago, I had never

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.980
heard of the sharing economy,
nor did I have an Uber or Lyft

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.630
app on my phone.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.410
This was not my natural habitat.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.400
But I could have gone
off and run for the hills

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.810
or made fun or cast judgment
on these young geniuses.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.040
But instead, I decided to
turn judgment into curiosity

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.800
and imagine how I could
match my wise eyes

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.060
with their fresh eyes.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.320
I sort of imagined myself a--

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.810
or fancied myself a
modern Margaret Mead

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.470
amongst the millennials, sort
of a cultural anthropologist.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.640
And I quickly learned that
I had as much to offer them

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.342
as they did to me.

00:03:40.342 --> 00:03:42.050
But the more I thought
about it, the more

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.640
I really noticed that we often--

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.670
the way we operate as
respective generations,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.420
we often operate almost
like isolated countries

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.160
on the same continent.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.800
Yes, we share borders,
but we don't necessarily

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.660
trust each other enough
to sometimes share

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.490
our respective wisdom.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.860
Looking at the modern
workplace, I've

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.850
come to believe that
creating a pipeline

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.510
or opening up a pipeline
of intergenerational wisdom

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.670
could be the trade agreement
of our time in the workplace.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.010
Almost 40% of us today have a
boss that's younger than us,

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.230
and that's only
growing as a number.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.750
Power is cascading, and I
feel silly actually saying

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.250
this part of the speech, because
you know it here at Google,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.110
but power is cascading to young
people faster than ever before.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.730
Why?

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.280
Because we are growing
in our reliance

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.180
on digital intelligence,
what's called DQ.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.000
We have young people starting
companies in their early 20s.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.390
They become global giants
by their 30th birthday.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.070
And yet somehow, we expect
these young, brilliant digital

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.870
leaders to miraculously embody
the relationship wisdoms

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.960
and leadership skills
we older workers

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.390
have had decades to learn.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.840
It's hard to microwave
your leadership skills

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.120
and emotional intelligence.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.930
We have ample evidence that
gender and ethnically diverse

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.540
teams are often more effective.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.810
But what about age?

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.770
It's a really
important question,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.010
and it's one of the
questions I posed

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.710
a lot to various companies,
because today, we

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.890
unintentionally have five
generations in the workplace

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.949
for the very first time.

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.740
So maybe it's time to
get a little bit more

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.100
intentional about
how we work together.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.630
A number of European
studies have

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.360
shown that age-diverse
teams can be more effective,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.620
and yet only 8% of companies
that have a diversity

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.140
and inclusion
program have expanded

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.300
that program or
strategy to include

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.630
age as just as important
of a demographic as, say,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.370
gender or race.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.260
Maybe they didn't get the memo.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.330
The world is getting older.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.020
One paradox of our time is
that baby boomers are healthier

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.620
longer, vibrant, and we're
in the workplace longer,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.110
and yet often feeling
less and less relevant.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.610
Some of us feel a little bit
like an old carton of milk

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.970
with an expiration date stamped
on our wrinkled foreheads.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.370
For many workers in midlife,
this isn't just a feeling.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.670
It's actually a harsh
reality, if you lose your job,

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.530
and the phone stops ringing.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.680
For many of us, we feel
like our experience

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.150
might be seen as a liability
more than an asset.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.580
Many of us have heard
the phrase, "60 is

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.347
the new 40," physically, right?

00:06:41.347 --> 00:06:42.930
Well, when it comes
to Silicon Valley,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.110
and it comes to
the digital world,

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.818
and when it comes,
frankly, more and more

00:06:45.818 --> 00:06:51.030
to the power in the workplace,
I believe 30 is the new 50.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.100
So if power is moving
10 years younger,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.220
and we're going to live 10
years longer, do the math.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.340
A new 20-year irrelevancy
gap has been created

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.440
for those of us in midlife.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.870
Midlife used to be
considered 45 to 65,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.470
but now it's really expanded,
I think, to 35 to 75,

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.910
because there's
people, especially

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.204
in the Valley, who start feeling
irrelevant in their mid 30s.

00:07:15.204 --> 00:07:17.370
And there's lots of people
who are going to work way

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.120
past the traditional
retirement age of 65,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.980
and they may work till
75, because if you're

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.140
going to live to 100, either
by choice or by necessity,

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.000
you may work longer.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.980
So that midlife marathon--

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.300
and by the way, as an aside,
the term, "midlife crisis,"

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.880
was created in
1965, but we haven't

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.600
done much in 53 years since
then to make it any better.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.450
OK, now it starts
getting better.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.320
That's all the depressing stuff.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.300
Here's the good stuff.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.370
Here's a bright spot.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.360
Why is it that as we age,
we become a little wiser

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.440
about our humanity?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.730
Our physical peak as
humans is probably our 20s,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.430
or as adults is our 20s.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.570
Our financial peak, salary-wise,
is 45 in Silicon Valley.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.680
For the general population,
it's about 50 to 52.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.220
But our emotional peak actually
happens in midlife and beyond,

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.860
because we start to
develop pattern recognition

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.465
about ourselves and others.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.207
So how do we actually-- oops--

00:08:22.207 --> 00:08:23.790
so the question is,
how do we actually

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.560
help companies tap into
that potential midlife

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.659
wisdom, while also nurturing
their young, brilliant digital

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.559
natives?

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.230
I think the most successful
companies today will figure out

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.159
how to create a powerful
alchemy between the two.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.830
Here's how the alchemy
worked for me at Airbnb.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.210
I was assigned a sharp
young partner, Laura Hughes,

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.900
to be my partner in creating
the hospitality department.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.960
I oversaw about eight
different teams at Airbnb.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.660
Hospitality was one, strategy
was another, et cetera,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.750
but I'll focus on
hospitality for now.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.570
Early on, Laura
Hughes, my partner,

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.440
saw that I was a little lost
when it came to technology,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.330
and so she often sat right
next to me at meetings.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
And when I heard words
that I didn't understand,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.840
I'd write her a note, and she
would be my tech translator.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.680
She spent four years here at
Google before a year and a half

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.630
at Airbnb when I
met her, and she was

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.610
27 years old when I met her.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.960
Like many of her
millennial cohorts,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.460
she had been elevated to a
role of being a manager way

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.670
before she ever had any
formal leadership training.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.240
I don't care if you're in
the B2B world, the B2C world,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.310
the C2c world, or the A2Z world.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.450
Business and organizations
are fundamentally H2H,

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.860
human to human.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.850
And yet, Laura's approach
to leadership and management

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.890
had been formed in the
technocratic world.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.580
It was all about accountability
charts and business roadmaps

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.010
and metrics and
metrics and metrics.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.020
And that's not bad.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.640
I could get shot if I say that
too loudly here at Google.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.592
Not bad, but it needed to be
dosed with something else.

00:10:04.592 --> 00:10:07.050
What she said to me about a
month into the job is like, oh,

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.700
my gosh, what I appreciate is
that you help us, as a team,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.220
create a compelling
vision, and then

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.890
that becomes the North
Star for how we operate.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.920
And she said, your
fact knowledge chip

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.440
isn't all that valuable here.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.060
How many rooms a maid cleans
in an eight-hour shift doesn't

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.130
matter in the
home-sharing world,

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.030
but your process knowledge
is really valuable,

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.460
process knowledge
being you know how

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.270
to get things done based upon
understanding the underlying

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.580
motivations of
everyone in the room.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.766
And your organizationally
savvy enough,

00:10:43.766 --> 00:10:45.390
because you've been
around for a while,

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.110
to know how to get things
done in an organization.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.410
So as I spent more
time at Airbnb,

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.090
I actually started to notice
that maybe a new kind of elder

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.760
was emerging in the workplace.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.190
No, not the elder
of the past, who

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.454
was regarded with reverence.

00:11:04.454 --> 00:11:06.120
There are only a few
places in the world

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.280
where that's still the case.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.240
No, this modern elder
actually was appreciated

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.500
for their relevance, their
ability to take timeless wisdom

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.350
and apply it to
modern day problems.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.020
Maybe it's time that we
actually start valuing wisdom

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.730
as much as we do disruption.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.300
And I absolutely think it's time
we reclaim the word, "elder,"

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.730
but give it a modern twist.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.310
The modern elder is
as much an intern

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.340
as they are a mentor, because
they realize in a world that

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.610
is changing as quickly
as it is today,

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.920
that it's important
that our beginner's

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.670
mind and catalytic curiosity
allows them to create almost

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.240
like a life-affirming elixir
for both themselves and everyone

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.130
else.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.370
We're very familiar
with intergen improv

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.340
in music and the arts.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.650
Think Tony Bennett and Lady
Gaga or Wynton Marsalis

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.590
and the Young Stars of Jazz.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.710
But in the business
world, we don't really

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.170
have a language for this,
this kind of riffing off

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.630
of each other with
different generations.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.980
But we might often call
it mutual mentorship,

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.970
and mutual mentorship
is, frankly--

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.350
in my case, I was
getting Millennial DQ,

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.180
digital intelligence,
and what I was

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:28.351
offering back was Boomer EQ, but
it could be Gen X EQ as well.

00:12:28.351 --> 00:12:32.290
At Airbnb, I actually had a
dose of this kind of intergen

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.320
reciprocity when
Laura and I took on,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.810
along with our stellar
data science team,

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.050
the process of completely
remaking the Airbnb

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.110
peer-to-peer review
system, based

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.260
upon Laura's analytical
mind and my sort of more

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.180
human-centered intuition.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.900
With this powerful alchemy of
algorithm and people wisdom,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.650
we were able to actually take
a relatively good program,

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.390
the peer-to-peer
review system, and make

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.660
it a great program that helped
our hosts better understand

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.940
the needs of our guests,
such that we actually

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.450
got Airbnb's guest satisfaction
level with our hosts

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.240
higher than the hotel
industry, substantially higher,

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.860
because we used the same
metric the hotel industry does.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.380
So this is a great example of
high tech meeting high touch.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.060
As a modern elder,
I also learned

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:25.086
that I needed to intern
publicly and mentor privately.

00:13:25.086 --> 00:13:26.710
What I mean by that
is, like, you know,

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.020
nobody wants me telling them
in the middle of the meeting

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.269
that they did something wrong.

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:31.330
I'm not their parent.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.980
That's what their
parent might do.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.460
But what they really
appreciated was this.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.890
And let me-- here's my
search engine [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.620
Search engines are great
for giving us answers,

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.630
and over time, you may
actually, at Google,

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.390
get better and better at
even posing questions to us.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.800
I don't know where that's going.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.520
I might ask Dan
in the back there.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.570
But the bottom line
is you're great.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.060
Google has all the
knowledge in the world,

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:59.680
and so answers come from
a place like Google.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.970
But a beautifully posed
question asked by a wise elder

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.940
can actually unlock
someone's mind and heart

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.870
to all kinds of other things.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.650
And so I actually do
believe that a wise elder,

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.640
a modern elder can actually
have that finally attuned heart

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.860
and mind that can
actually open up

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.800
the possibilities for
someone younger than them.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.560
Over time, to my
surprise, I had, actually,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.980
over 100 people in the
organization asking

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.630
me to mentor them.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.780
It was not my job, not even
in my scope of work at all.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.930
But every time somebody
asked, I said yes.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.970
It was nuts, to be
honest with you,

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.040
but I loved it,
because what happened

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.220
is I learned as much from
them as they did from me.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.720
And that was the beauty of it.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.840
In sum, Brian Chesky,
the CEO, asked

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.020
me to join Airbnb because
of my industry knowledge.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.600
But what I really offered
was my well-earned wisdom.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.520
Peter Drucker, the
management theorist,

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.800
created the phrase or the term,
"knowledge worker," in 1959.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.190
I think it's time we retire
the phrase, "knowledge worker,"

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.340
and replaced it with "wisdom
worker," because, really,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.300
that's what we offer
in our humanity.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.760
With five generations in the
workplace for the first time,

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.460
we can either operate
like separate isolationist

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:26.740
countries, or we can find
a way to build bridges

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.060
across those
generational borders,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.990
so we can learn from people
both older and younger than us

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.610
and delight in that.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.460
It's time, also, to switch up
our thinking about the physics

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.000
of wisdom, so it's not just
moving from old to young,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.190
but it's moving from
young to old as well.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.300
So in your life,
personally, who could you

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.920
reach out to to actually build a
mutual mentorship relationship?

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.070
And organizationally,
how do we create

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:59.710
the conditions to foster more
of an intergenerational flow

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.100
of wisdom?

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.230
This is the new sharing
economy, in my opinion.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.280
So that's my talk.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.555
There you go.

00:16:08.555 --> 00:16:09.055
So--

00:16:09.055 --> 00:16:09.815
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:09.815 --> 00:16:10.650
Yeah, thank you.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.730
So let me talk for
a few more minutes,

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.780
and then we'll open
up for questions.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.880
The idea of a
modern elder really

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.860
made me sick the
first time I heard it.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.140
Someone said, you're
like my elder.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.620
I was like, you know,
what did I do wrong?

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.930
Because "elder"
sounded like "elderly."

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:42.670
And of course, here's the
thing is 50 years ago,

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.710
"elder" was elderly.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.440
50 years ago, the average age
of when someone actually went

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.450
into a nursing home was 65.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.670
Today, it's almost 85.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:57.710
So we have actually created
a new period of life.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:03.340
Longevity in the US in the
year 1900 was 47 years old.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.369
By the year 2000,
it was 77 years old.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:09.819
We added three decades
to US average longevity

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:12.790
in one century, but
we have done zero

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.190
to actually define this
period of life that

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:19.940
is pre-elderly and midlife
and a little bit later.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.160
I'm 58 this month.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.176
I'm absolutely right
in the middle of it.

00:17:23.176 --> 00:17:24.550
But as I said
earlier, I actually

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.591
think there's a lot of
people in the middle of it

00:17:26.591 --> 00:17:28.810
in the sense that when
you have, especially

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.660
in Silicon Valley, a growing,
young population of people who

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.690
are very smart, being
able to figure out,

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:39.880
how do you match that smart,
young talent with people

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.450
older, who might be able to
actually offer something, is,

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.080
I think, one of the most
interesting HR and leadership

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:51.340
opportunities of the 21st
century in the workplace.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.830
What I'll say is that the book--

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.911
I think you're all
getting books, I guess.

00:17:54.911 --> 00:17:55.660
Yeah, yeah, maybe?

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.120
We've got a few copies left.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.020
CHIP CONLEY: OK, there's
a few copies left.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:58.547
OK.

00:17:58.547 --> 00:18:00.130
Hopefully, you're
going to get a book.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.936
And what you'll see is there
are four lessons in the book,

00:18:02.936 --> 00:18:04.810
and I'll just go through
this really quickly,

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.770
and then I'll finish with just
one organizational thought,

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.610
because I think
Google actually is

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.010
a role model for the
organizational thought.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.940
So the four lessons I learned
was, number one, evolve.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.260
If you're in midlife--

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.800
and I'm defining
midlife 35 to 75--

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.102
it's a wide definition--

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:23.560
the number one
thing you need to be

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.750
able to do to be able to
rewire yourself and reframe

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.600
your mastery is to evolve.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.150
And "evolve" basically
means you actually

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.240
need to be willing
to actually shed

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.750
part of your historic identity
and your historical knowledge.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.590
It doesn't mean it
goes away forever.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.650
It just means you don't
show up with that.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.980
I was the CEO of my own boutique
hotel company, as Karen said,

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.090
Joie de Vivre.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.350
And we created 52 boutique
hotels, a few of them

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.850
down here.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:56.110
Actually, we were the biggest
hotelier in Silicon Valley

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.530
and San Francisco
or the Bay Area.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:03.550
So I was a CEO for 24
years, took a company

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.710
from one to 3,500 employees.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:06.820
I sold it.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.440
I had a couple years
off, and then I

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.898
was like, OK, what
am I doing next?

00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:13.330
And then Brian
Chesky approached me.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:17.760
If I had gone into that job
thinking of myself as the CEO,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.090
it wouldn't have worked.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.100
Brian and I were lucky
enough, two nights ago,

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.520
to be on stage at the
Marines Memorial Theater

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.100
with 500 people in the
audience giving a talk,

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.980
together, Brian and me, to
saying, how did this work?

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.470
How did a millennial
and a modern elder

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.740
come together to help
create a business

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.690
plan that was able to flourish?

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:43.480
So part of it was me
being willing to say,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.860
I used to be the
sage on the stage,

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.710
and now I'm the
guide on the side.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.360
And what that meant is I
had to right size my ego.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.110
I needed to realize that
the last thing Brian needed,

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.110
as a leader 21 years
younger than me,

00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:01.600
was having me, in meetings,
say things that he

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.890
should be doing differently.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.730
Obviously, that needed to
be the mentoring privately.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.160
But more than anything,
I need to also evolve

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.250
my knowledge, which has brought
me to the second lesson, which

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:13.540
is to learn.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.795
So a lot of times, people
in midlife need to evolve,

00:20:15.795 --> 00:20:18.170
but then they actually have
to say, I'm willing to learn.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.628
I'm going to be a
lifelong learner.

00:20:19.628 --> 00:20:22.780
I'm going to learn more now in
my 50s than I did in my 40s.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.389
Now that breaks
conventional wisdom.

00:20:25.389 --> 00:20:27.680
There's an element that we
think, OK, as you get older,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.490
you just have less to learn,
partly because it's almost

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.630
thought that you have a
bottle , and it's full.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:35.820
I don't have anymore space.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.430
There's no more space to
put more knowledge in it,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.150
and that's--

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.960
in terms of how our brains
work, that's not how it works.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.170
So sometimes you have to pour
out a little bit also in order

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.090
to make some extra room.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.930
So learning is a really
key part of that,

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.770
and that's chapter
5 in the book.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.815
And the third lesson I
learned was collaboration.

00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:55.690
And one of the things
that's so interesting--

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.340
I love-- in the book, I do talk
about Project Aristotle, which

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.500
was the collaboration
project here,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.620
or the study of what
makes successful teams

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.270
and effective teams.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.520
Interesting thing just to
look at-- that collaboration

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.480
is so essential.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.330
And yet in-- when
I joined Airbnb,

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.260
one thing that was most
noticeable-- we were--

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.820
Karen and I were just talking
about meetings and studying

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.470
meetings, what works
and what doesn't.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.250
Oh, my gosh.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.130
The meetings at Airbnb
were really, really hard

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.500
to sit through, because they
weren't really well-organized,

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.660
and there was not a
collaborative spirit.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.200
There's a lot of evidence and
studies that's shown that,

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.990
frankly, put a couple
of women in the room,

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.180
and put a couple older
people in the room,

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.150
and it tends to lead
to-- not always--

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.340
to a more collaborative team.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.590
And it's partly because
there's a little more empathy.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.900
Oh, she's laughing.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.600
OK.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.230
Do you agree?

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.730
Yes?

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.770
And I think what we need to
know about that is collaboration

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.800
is essential for any company.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.860
And so one of the
things that I really

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.020
heartily recommend to
people who are in midlife

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.560
and remake themselves is to
really speak to, how are they--

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.510
how do they use their
EQ, which can grow

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:09.240
with time, in a way that
actually shows that they have

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.890
collaboration skills?

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.460
And then the fourth
lesson is counsel,

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.960
and that's actually the lesson
that most people go to first.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.340
You're older, and you
still feel like, well, I'm

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.400
here to advise people.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.920
I'm here to mentor people.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.750
And honestly, if that's what
you're going to lead with,

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.250
and you haven't done
the other three first,

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.000
people will maybe think
that you're either

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.570
their preacher or their
parent, because you're going

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.640
to actually maybe be lecturing.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.140
And there's a
beautiful old phrase--

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.930
"knowledge speaks,
and wisdom listens."

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.180
And one of the things that
a lot of people don't know,

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.770
and I only learned
two months ago,

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.340
is that the owl is
perceived as the wisest bird

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.020
or animal in the forest.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.800
Why?

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:48.460
Because it has the most finely
attuned sense of hearing.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.910
So wisdom is about
listening, and it's

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.630
about listening not just to
the story, but for the story.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.840
And the difference is for the
story gets beyond the literal.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.520
It allows you to
actually see, what

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.960
are the common threads that
you're hearing from the person?

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.460
In sum, because I started
writing this book,

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.886
and I started feeling like, wow.

00:23:09.886 --> 00:23:11.260
I started
interviewing-- my story

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.830
is unusual, because I was
asked by the founders at age 52

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:14.910
to join them.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.010
Most people at 52 are
not asked to join a tech

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.590
company if they've never
have been in a tech community

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.290
before.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.490
So I'm lucky.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.740
I went out, and I
interviewed 150 other people

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.350
and said, tell me
what your experience--

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.150
most of the people in
their 40s and 50s--

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.100
about being in midlife.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.530
And I heard a lot of
anxiety and bewilderment.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.600
And I had a lot of people
saying, you know what?

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.310
I don't know how to
get through this time.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.600
And I started thinking about
it, and I said, man, you

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.680
know what's interesting is we
as a society have historically

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.380
helped people through
transitional times

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.470
by creating rituals
or celebrations.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.145
Like with puberty,
it's bat mitzvah,

00:23:53.145 --> 00:23:55.180
bar mitzvah, quinceanera.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.932
You're going to go from
adolescence to adulthood-- you

00:23:57.932 --> 00:23:59.140
have a commencement ceremony.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.477
You graduate from something.

00:24:00.477 --> 00:24:02.060
You actually are
going to get married.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:02.710
You have a wedding.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:03.730
You're going to have a baby.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:04.720
You have a baby shower.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.553
You're going to die.

00:24:05.553 --> 00:24:06.370
You have a funeral.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:12.010
But between baby shower
and funeral, nada, nothing.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.500
And back when the
longevity was 47,

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.790
it didn't matter,
because midlife was 24.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.960
But midlife today is, who knows?

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.410
Somewhere around 50, 55 maybe.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.780
Who knows?

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.060
And we have nothing to
address the transitions that

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.440
happen in midlife.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.970
What are those transitions?

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.920
Well, you know, you
can lose a parent.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.270
You could lose a spouse.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.830
You could actually get divorced.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.750
You can change job or
career or location.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:42.430
You can actually go through
empty nester syndrome,

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:43.990
where the kids are gone.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:45.530
You go through menopause.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.260
Men, we go through andropause.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.680
You don't even
know what that is.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.555
I'm going through it.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.400
All these things
happen, and there's

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.110
no transitional support.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.100
So long story short is I created
something called the Modern

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.300
Elder Academy.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.102
I finally totally
embraced the word.

00:25:03.102 --> 00:25:04.810
Not only was it the
subtitle of the book,

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:05.893
but I said, you know what?

00:25:05.893 --> 00:25:07.570
Modern elder-- I'll
be one of those,

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.130
and let's create an academy.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:14.020
So we did in Baja,
California, so in Mexico,

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.590
just one hour north
of Cabo San Lucas.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.220
It's a three-acre
campus on the beach,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.640
and we have people coming
from all over the world.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.130
We did a beta program of it
the first half of the year.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.430
153 people went
through week-long

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.862
and two-week long programs
that went really well.

00:25:29.862 --> 00:25:31.570
And 50% of the people
are on scholarship,

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:32.736
so it's a social enterprise.

00:25:32.736 --> 00:25:33.790
It's not-- it's not--

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.830
the purpose of it is
not to make money.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.530
Last thought, before we
open up for questions--

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:42.160
organizationally,
what can we do to help

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.990
foster more intergenerational
collaboration or more

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.090
understanding of the
value of the modern elder?

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:53.560
Two thoughts-- number one is one
thought is to start with, OK,

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.290
if you have new hire
buddies in the company,

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.650
consider how you actually match
people who don't look much

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:00.650
alike--

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.910
not gender, race,
age, et cetera.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.100
How do you help to
foster that, even

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.590
in the early days of
someone joining a company?

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.600
But the bigger idea I
have that really speak--

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.766
and I have a bunch of ideas.

00:26:11.766 --> 00:26:14.560
Chapter 9 in the book
is full of 10 ideas

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.539
that companies actually
could incorporate.

00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:19.330
But the one that relates
to Google is this.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.730
I know you have
20% time, which was

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.560
supposed to be 80% plus 20%.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.440
It's really 100%
plus 20%, right?

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.880
So the idea was, at Google,
engineers, especially who

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.380
wanted to go out and
innovate, could actually

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.570
be given the opportunity to
work on innovation projects that

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:38.620
might serve the company.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.470
Great idea.

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:45.430
What if we actually got a
little bit more intentional

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:49.270
about asking questions on
employee surveys, questions

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.220
like the following--

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.100
other than your boss or
someone on your team,

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:59.150
who in the company do you look
to for advice or for wisdom?

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:02.000
What if we could actually
start identifying

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.120
not just the spaces of
innovation in the company,

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.350
but the spaces of wisdom and
who actually are perceived

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:10.910
as the role models for that?

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.700
And then what if we actually,
knowing that information,

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.590
started to develop
programs where

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.140
people who have institutional
wisdom and knowledge,

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.460
have been in the company for--

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.360
you pick the determining
amount of years.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.230
At Procter and Gamble,
there is a program

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.400
called the Mastery Program.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.170
It's 10 years.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:30.136
But at a tech company,
it might be five years.

00:27:30.136 --> 00:27:31.760
Once a person has
been there that long,

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.145
you have the ability,
if you choose to,

00:27:34.145 --> 00:27:38.910
to start moving into the modern
elder or the mastery program,

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.260
which allows you to actually
scope down a little bit what

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.964
you're working on and actually
allocate some of your time

00:27:44.964 --> 00:27:46.880
to things that would be
helpful to the company

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.620
around institutionalized wisdom.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.490
Could be in-house mentorship,
but in many cases,

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.390
it could be actually
sitting-- and the way

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.620
Procter and Gamble does it, you
actually go sit in on teams,

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.480
and you actually
get joint teams,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.414
because if you have
collaboration skills,

00:28:01.414 --> 00:28:03.080
and if you have
institutionalized wisdom

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.960
about how Procter and
Gamble has innovated,

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.370
you actually offer
that to the teams.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.330
So it's just an idea,
because I really think that--

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.330
frankly, if Brian said to me,
knowing that there were 100

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.790
people that I was
mentoring over the course--

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.460
not all at the same time, but
over the five and 1/2 years

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.620
I've been there--

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.620
if Brian knew how much
time that was taking,

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.720
and he knew I could
actually somehow scope down

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.450
my primary responsibilities
so that I could spend either

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:33.680
20% or maybe 50% my time
on just helping create

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.890
that invisible productivity,
which a modern elder can

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.720
provide, because there's
a lot of evidence

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.360
that if you are doing
this well, you're

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.620
not just productive yourself.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.220
You're making other people and
teams more productive as well.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.630
If I could have done that,
I probably wouldn't have,

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.870
on my four-year
anniversary, said,

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.390
Brian, I need to move to
a strategic advisor role,

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.160
because this is just too much.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.860
So with that, I'm now
going to open it up

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:05.160
to questions from
you or from Dory.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.330
And let's see what you have.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.380
Questions or comments.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.820
AUDIENCE: First off, thank
you, Chip, for coming.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:10.575
CHIP CONLEY: Yeah.

00:29:10.575 --> 00:29:12.700
AUDIENCE: I think that
everyone, regardless of age,

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.270
benefits a lot from hearing
about your experiences.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:21.160
So I'm curious if you're
willing or able to share some

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.430
of the advice that you gave
Brian Chesky, like some

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:28.055
of those private one-on-ones
or public meetings.

00:29:28.055 --> 00:29:30.680
CHIP CONLEY: Well, I mean that's
a big, general-- first of all,

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.020
Mike, thanks for the question.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.290
And that's a big question,
because it'd really

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:36.666
depend on context.

00:29:36.666 --> 00:29:38.290
I'd suggest-- I'll
answer the question,

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:40.040
but I'm going to suggest
something to you.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.380
Just this afternoon, the
Commonwealth Club put online--

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:49.150
I know it's online, because
I saw it on Twitter--

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:53.380
put online our Commonwealth
Club talk from two nights ago.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.470
Honestly, that
Commonwealth Club talk

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:00.660
was almost like being a fly
in the room of Chip and Brian.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.570
So Brian would come over to
my house almost every weekend,

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.250
and I have a cottage
in the backyard.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:07.937
And we would do
long meetings there,

00:30:07.937 --> 00:30:09.520
because during the
week, what we found

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.640
is it was really hard for us to
have substantial time together,

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.410
because both of us
were pulled in too

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.040
many different directions.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.980
So the Commonwealth
Club talk speaks

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.270
to all of that-- what
you're asking about.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.460
So let me say, some--

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.640
so if you really are
interested, watch it.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.540
It's an hour talk.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.610
I would say some of the advice
I gave him was the following.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.870
One piece was this.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.630
We spend the first half
of our life accumulating,

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.300
and we spend the second
half of our life editing.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.460
That's my point of view.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.180
And what I mean by
that is you often

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.760
see it with people
with their homes.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.325
The kids leave, and then,
OK, you want to downsize.

00:30:44.325 --> 00:30:46.450
You see it with people
sometimes with their friends

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:47.890
and their interests.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:50.380
They actually want to get more
focused on certain things,

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.284
because we have stuff,
and we have knowledge,

00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:55.450
and we have all of these
different responsibilities,

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:59.650
and then around 45 or 50,
we say, this is too much.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.240
I need to edit it down.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.800
That editing capability
is really valuable

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.430
when someone younger,
who has a lot of options,

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.479
is able to prioritize.

00:31:11.479 --> 00:31:13.270
One of the things I
think helped Brian with

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.660
was when I joined the
company in early 2013,

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.390
we had 30 strategic initiatives.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.910
No one in the company,
including Brian,

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:24.500
could recite the 30
strategic initiatives.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.790
So I led our off-sites.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.410
Whenever we did off-sites with
the senior leadership team,

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.950
I usually led those.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:36.280
And so our second one
that I led was in New York

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.120
in September of 2013.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.030
And we had 23
strategic initiatives

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.200
we were going to have for 2014.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.190
It was sort of nice.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:45.120
I said, OK, let's alph--

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.630
put a dozen on the
leadership team.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.467
Let's come together
and make the decision

00:31:48.467 --> 00:31:50.800
of what are the four that
we're going to actually bet on

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:51.444
for next year.

00:31:51.444 --> 00:31:53.110
And let's focus on
those, and let's make

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.770
sure everybody in the company
knows those are the four,

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:59.540
and then we have regular
opportunities for people

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.500
to understand how each
of the four are doing.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.077
It's so simple,
but honestly, when

00:32:03.077 --> 00:32:05.410
you're in the midst of a
company that's growing and more

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.120
than doubling in
size every year,

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.920
you end up doubling the
number of initiatives.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.270
So I think prioritization
and editing

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:16.120
were particularly essential
in my involvement with Brian.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.130
I think another one
was helping Brian

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:20.470
understand that the
level of stamina

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.690
that he has as a leader--

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.580
he's a big-- he's just--

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.220
he's a short but stout
and very muscular

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.070
guy who sort of
powers through things.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:34.196
And not everyone's like Brian.

00:32:34.196 --> 00:32:35.570
And I think-- I'll
never forget--

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:37.111
I think it was the
first Thanksgiving

00:32:37.111 --> 00:32:39.480
I was in the company, and
the senior leadership team--

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.130
we've been working,
like, 70, 80 hour weeks.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.310
And I said to Brian,
like make sure

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:49.010
that no one talked to each
other over Thanksgiving.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.140
But also, on Wednesday,
before Thanksgiving

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.645
happens, the day
before Thanksgiving,

00:32:53.645 --> 00:32:56.180
I want you to send
wine, flowers,

00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.096
whatever to the spouses
and families of everybody

00:33:00.096 --> 00:33:01.970
who's on the leadership
team, because they're

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.680
the ones who are
at home saying, why

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.510
the hell did you take this job?

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.740
And so that kind of thinking,
that kind of thinking of like,

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.440
OK, it's not just
how we mellow--

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.280
like we're the collateral
damage in a family when

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.866
people are working this hard.

00:33:17.866 --> 00:33:19.490
So those are a couple
of simple things,

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:22.860
but I would tell you that
Commonwealth Club-- man,

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.220
the moderator was a
woman, Julie Hanna.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.990
She's an Egyptian
technologist, and she's

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.957
the executive chair of Kiva,
and, oh, she did a great job.

00:33:29.957 --> 00:33:31.790
She did a really great
job of pulling it out

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:32.794
from Brian and me, so.

00:33:32.794 --> 00:33:34.460
AUDIENCE: What is the
Commonwealth Club?

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.959
CHIP CONLEY:
Commonwealth Club's a--

00:33:35.959 --> 00:33:39.465
it's a 115-year-old club
in San Francisco that

00:33:39.465 --> 00:33:41.840
brings thought leaders from
around the world to come give

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.370
speeches and things like that.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.460
So yeah.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:44.960
Thanks.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.110
Great question.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.306
Who else?

00:33:48.306 --> 00:33:50.660
KAREN: We can use
a Dory question,

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.400
and then we'll
come back to live.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.840
So there is a
question that says,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:58.400
"With the arrival of
several young founders,

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.240
the culture of Silicon Valley
changed in the 21st century.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.690
Only technical intelligence
seemingly mattered,

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:09.290
yet the simple wisdom to
ask, why are we doing this,

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:11.510
can save a company millions.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.280
How do we get our
leaders to understand

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.840
the value of wisdom?"

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.750
CHIP CONLEY: Wow.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.310
What's this person's name?

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:18.370
AUDIENCE: It's anonymous.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:18.675
CHIP CONLEY: Anonymous.

00:34:18.675 --> 00:34:19.755
I love it.

00:34:19.755 --> 00:34:22.320
There's so many people with
that name here at Google.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.980
No, I'm kidding.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.610
So what I love about
your question, Anonymous,

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.080
is you asked a "why" question.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.679
One of the things I learned in
my five and 1/2 years at Airbnb

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:40.219
is that most of the time,
senior leaders and companies

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:43.670
ask "what" and "how" questions,
which are optimization

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:47.340
questions, whereas
"why" and "what if"

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.650
are bigger, almost
existential questions.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.310
They're, frankly, very
inefficient questions,

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:55.880
because they actually require
a bigger, broader answer.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.960
And so they're not
all that well-liked

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.730
when they come up in
a meeting, but that's

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.090
what the questions I asked.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.152
I asked a lot of "why"
and "what if" questions,

00:35:06.152 --> 00:35:07.610
which is, I think,
really valuable,

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:11.600
because being able to ask these
sort of formative questions

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.120
that might sound
naive, once I realized

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.840
I was an intern as much as I was
a mentor, and I was a learner,

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:23.030
I could feel comfortable asking
sometimes naive questions.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.950
So what I would say to the--

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.080
I think that--

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.990
Joe Gebbia and I--
who's the co-founder--

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:34.359
we did a fireside chat
yesterday at Airbnb.

00:35:34.359 --> 00:35:35.900
And one of the things
we talked about

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:43.550
was the fact that there's almost
a balancing act for companies

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:46.550
that grow fast between
scale and soul.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:49.430
And that scale and sole
kind of balancing act

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:53.000
speaks to the scale piece
being very quantifiably

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.240
driven and, often, very much
about what can be proven.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.220
And the soul piece,
being very intangible,

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:06.380
often very human-centric,
and, often, more intuitive--

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.440
and to me, the best
companies who get it right

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.610
figure out what's the right
alchemy of scale and soul

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.300
to actually--

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.190
to shoot for in the future.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:20.590
And I think the thing
that I said within Airbnb,

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:23.600
and I tried to lead at Joie
de Vivre, my own company,

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.940
although, frankly, in a bricks
and mortar boutique hotel

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.550
company, we grew
fast, but I mean

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:33.392
you don't grow like a global
giant like Google or Airbnb.

00:36:33.392 --> 00:36:35.600
We said, what is it that we
want this company to look

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.360
like five years from now
in terms of scale and soul?

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.910
And tangibly, what
does that mean?

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:44.270
And then how do
we work backwards?

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:47.480
And how do we actually have
people in the company who

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.210
are the role models for both?

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.910
I mean the person who actually
has both within them--

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:53.810
great.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:55.040
And those people are--

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.770
the left can do the left
brain-right brain tango.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.942
But the person who is
actually right here

00:36:59.942 --> 00:37:02.150
and the person who's right
here-- how do we make sure

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:04.640
they're on teams together?

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.900
And how do we actually look at
teams for cognitive diversity?

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.000
Not just the demographic
diversity-- yes,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.490
that's important-- but
cognitive diversity

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:15.650
is a really important
part of how do

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:19.800
you help group think not occur.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.900
And so that's a long-winded
answer, but I hope that helps.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.370
AUDIENCE: So we're at Google.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.040
You were at Airbnb.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.880
We've talked a lot
about Silicon Valley.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.900
I'm wondering how you
would generalize this

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.340
to the rest of the country,
the rest of the world,

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.950
and how that might be different.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.830
CHIP CONLEY: Well, here's the
thing, because people sometimes

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.330
say, well, this is
just your Airb--

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:43.110
this is just your technology,
Silicon Valley bubble.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:43.690
And I was like, you know what?

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:46.106
Seven of the 10 most valuable
companies in the world today

00:37:46.106 --> 00:37:47.484
are tech companies.

00:37:47.484 --> 00:37:49.150
All companies want
to be tech companies.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:51.430
I mean I was at
Procter and Gamble

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.230
two months ago in their
headquarters, spent

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.510
three days with the CEO, senior
team, did a bunch of things

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:57.130
there.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.170
Procter and Gamble wants
to be a tech company.

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:02.890
And what I mean by this
is what's going on here

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.340
and what goes on
in the tech world

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.150
and what goes on in terms of
showing value, what companies

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:11.020
actually create value,
frankly, in the stock market

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:12.940
is what all those
other companies

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.920
want to actually imitate.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.870
So what I want to say is--

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.530
and you see you it,
sometimes, in mistakes.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:24.340
Ford Motor Company
hired a 34-year-old CMO.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:27.880
Nothing wrong with hiring
a 34-year-old CMO, if they

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.950
could actually do the job well.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.960
The person lasted about
a year and a half,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.860
and they didn't work out well.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.200
But someone else could have.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.730
But the question is, when we're
making decisions about leaders,

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:42.580
are we making sure we're
asking enough questions

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.330
about their skill set beyond
what they're the expert at?

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.120
Somebody could be an expert
at something particular,

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.760
and then they grow, because
they're so good at that,

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.540
and they don't have the
balance of the other skills

00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:00.260
to actually pull off growing
in leadership like they do.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.340
So I would just say, I think
to answer your question,

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:07.840
I think that Silicon Valley
is the model for a lot

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.244
of other companies out there.

00:39:09.244 --> 00:39:11.410
Is it true that there's
lots of old school companies

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.070
that don't fit this?

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:12.570
Yes.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.160
I was on a webinar this
morning, and someone

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.569
from a manufacturing company
from Kansas was on the phone.

00:39:18.569 --> 00:39:20.110
And it was 200 people
in the company,

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.510
and the company he
described is a company that

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.340
felt like it's 50 years ago.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.820
And it might work
fine in manufacturing.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.497
They've just started to think
about robotics in this company.

00:39:31.497 --> 00:39:33.580
A lot of companies started
to think about robotics

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:34.670
30 years ago.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:36.580
But it seems to work for them.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:40.120
But that small company
in Kansas is not

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.250
the role model for a
lot of other companies

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:43.130
around the world.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:46.160
So I think how we do
things here, we need to--

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.220
the more you know
your role model--

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.720
it's like being a parent--

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.310
the more you actually have
to watch your behavior.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:53.130
So.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.880
AUDIENCE: If I might
add another question.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.630
CHIP CONLEY: Yeah.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.460
AUDIENCE: For you
transitioning from being

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.890
CEO to being a mentor-intern,
what are some areas that you

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.890
needed to grow that you
found yourself saying, wow,

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:06.730
this is different?

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.950
I maybe-- just some thoughts
on what you needed to improve

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.181
or what surprised you.

00:40:12.181 --> 00:40:13.930
CHIP CONLEY: Two things
I've already said,

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:14.980
and then I'll say others.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.920
One is my ego, just
right-sizing my ego,

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:22.600
realizing that it was time for
me to actually focus on being

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.770
not interesting but interested.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:30.160
And so I was very interested
in how I supported them,

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.030
so that was one.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:33.472
A second thing-- the
idea of being a learner

00:40:33.472 --> 00:40:34.930
and the idea of,
OK, I'm in my 50s.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:35.721
Maybe-- what is it?

00:40:35.721 --> 00:40:37.480
What would happen
if, in my 50s, I'm

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.000
having my biggest
decade of learning?

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.210
That was it as well.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.860
But I think beyond
that, I think one

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.430
of the things that happens
with our brains as we get older

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.160
is, yes--

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:49.920
is true.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.190
Our recall is not as
good as it used to be,

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:54.806
so memory and
quickness goes away.

00:40:54.806 --> 00:40:56.680
But one thing that a
lot of people don't know

00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:01.894
is as your brain ages, you
start getting all wheel drive.

00:41:01.894 --> 00:41:03.310
All wheel drive
means you actually

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:06.717
do the left brain-right
brain tango more easily.

00:41:06.717 --> 00:41:07.550
What does that mean?

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:10.150
It means you actually
are able to move

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.220
amongst your whole
brain more quickly

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.560
and adeptly than when
you were younger,

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.030
when you were more focused.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.810
OK, what is that?

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.790
What's the benefit of that?

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.440
In a company, the
benefit is it means

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:24.490
it gives you holistic, systemic
thinking that allows you

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.030
to get the gist of something.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:31.700
So what I started to see
at Airbnb and with my "why"

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:36.449
and "what if" questions was,
OK, I'm hearing something here.

00:41:36.449 --> 00:41:38.990
I'm not sure everybody else is
seeing the pattern recognition

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:40.250
that I'm seeing.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:44.750
And therefore, I'm not
listening for the precision

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:45.929
of that particular thing.

00:41:45.929 --> 00:41:48.470
There are a lot of other people
in the room who will do that.

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:51.030
I'm actually looking for
the holistic questions.

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.440
And so that was a shift for me.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.130
I was a pre--

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.200
I was very-- I was
focused on transformation

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.910
at my old company.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:04.555
But I became more and more of
a sort of bigger thinker, which

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:06.680
can be dangerous if you're
just the bigger thinker,

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.130
and you're not able to
give solutions as well.

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:15.890
But I think that that
shift into that sort of--

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:18.440
the Socrates role, as
one person said to me.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.480
Like you become a Socrates
talking to the p--

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.380
you know, walking
through Athens,

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.540
or he was in Greece, right?

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.040
Yeah.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.880
So you're asking really
interesting questions.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.620
And I think that
was a shift for me,

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.490
because, actually,
when I was younger,

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:34.597
I wanted to be the smartest
person in the room,

00:42:34.597 --> 00:42:36.680
and, therefore, I actually
tried to be the fastest

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.880
to answer the questions.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.550
And that's what I would do.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:45.700
And actually, I wasn't doing
that at Airbnb as much, so.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.450
AUDIENCE: I have one question.

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.940
Regarding retirement,
what's your take

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.570
on knowing we're living longer
with a third third of life

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:57.420
and wanting to do more, as we've
learned, and we're in our 50s

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.220
and growing that way?

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.910
Do you think that we need
to be rethinking retirement

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:03.470
on the individual
level, or is it

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:08.170
something more systemic to
have companies changing out

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:09.410
into a bigger movement?

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:10.410
What's your take?

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:12.076
CHIP CONLEY: Lots of
thoughts are there.

00:43:12.076 --> 00:43:13.130
Thank you, Rachel.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:17.240
So first of all, the way we've
defined life, historically,

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.290
is learn, earn, retire.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:24.890
Typically, learn until you're
25, earn until you're 65,

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.510
and then retire until you die.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:30.500
That's the model
that I grew up with.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.870
If you're younger than 40
today, you might look at that

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.280
and say, no way.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.960
That's not my model.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:36.860
And it's true.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.512
Young people have a whole
different perspective

00:43:39.512 --> 00:43:40.970
on their lives,
partly because they

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.010
know they're going
to live longer,

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.468
partly because
they're not climbing

00:43:43.468 --> 00:43:44.810
corporate ladders like we did.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.560
And it's all good.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.999
I would just say,
for younger people,

00:43:47.999 --> 00:43:50.540
you've got the right thinking,
because there's also something

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.390
called the U-curve of happiness,
which is when people actually

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.700
are least happy in life,
which is, typically--

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.970
sorry to say for you
people in your 40s--

00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:59.390
it's in your 40s.

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:02.750
But the less you actually
are locked into doing things

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.360
that you didn't
necessarily want to do,

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.250
because it was just
the conventional path,

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.890
the less likely you have
disappointment in your 40s.

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:11.610
So what does all that mean?

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:15.350
It means thinking of
your life as a portfolio

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.600
and being able to
curate your own life

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.110
and being a little bit
of a freelancer of how

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.750
you think about it and
knowing that you're going to--

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.240
you might take a year
off, do a sabbatical

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.630
in your 40s or your 30s,
or you might go back

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.240
to school in your 50s.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.210
All of that is on the table
today, and all of that's

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:38.780
good, because what I
think we're going to see

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.640
is more and more people in
their 70s in the workplace.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.880
And that may sound weird.

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.920
Like, the person who
checked me in at my hotel

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.940
was a 75-year-old.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.820
You know, we're going
to see more of that.

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.600
Especially in this country
if our employment situation

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.880
is at what it is, and
immigration doesn't open

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.940
up much, we are going to have
a necessity to actually find

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.970
new sources of employees.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.630
What does that
mean for companies?

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.088
I think what it
means for companies

00:45:05.088 --> 00:45:07.910
is more and more companies need
to respect the fact that when

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:10.910
people want to actually
start winding down,

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:14.980
they don't want to just be on
the conveyor belt to a cliff.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.150
I was 100% an
employee last week,

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:21.480
and this week, I'm 0%,
because I've retired.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.320
There's a lot of evidence that
shows that when people retire,

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.990
their health conditions
actually don't get better.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.970
They actually get worse.

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:30.930
And there's a lot
of reasons for that.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:32.360
So what do I think that means?

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.520
I think the idea of people
moving from five days

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:38.000
a week to three days a week,
and maybe then two days

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.060
a week over the course
of three or four years

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.440
is something for
companies to consider.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.080
Additionally,
especially for those

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.350
people who have great
institutional wisdom,

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:50.150
because that
institutional wisdom--

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.400
I mean that's my
role at Airbnb now.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.740
I'm an old timer at Airbnb
not because of my age,

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.250
but because I was the 350th
employee in that company that

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:01.040
now has 5,000 employees
five and 1/2 years later.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:06.740
And only 100 of the 350 are
still there, so the fact

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:09.620
that I'm a strategic advisor,
and when I come to the office,

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:11.270
I am pulled in
different directions,

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:13.910
because the people know I
have a little bit of awareness

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.730
of how that works
or this works is

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.870
a good thing for the company.

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:21.160
So thanks for the question.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.460
KAREN: Chip, there's another
question in the Dory,

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.000
though it's an observation.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.280
I want to read the
observation, and then

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.390
ask a question about it.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:31.098
CHIP CONLEY: Yes.

00:46:31.098 --> 00:46:33.520
KAREN: And then we'll go
back to live questions.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.780
So the observation is, "You're
making some assumptions

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.180
based on your own experience.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.802
Older people at Google are
probably quite technical.

00:46:41.802 --> 00:46:43.260
If we weren't, we
wouldn't be here.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:43.590
CHIP CONLEY: Yeah, agreed.

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.006
KAREN: And so the
question I would

00:46:45.006 --> 00:46:47.139
follow that observation with--

00:46:47.139 --> 00:46:49.680
I think it's a fair observation,
obviously-- but the question

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.570
I would follow that
with is, in your case,

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:56.820
you were able to, in a sense,
use the trade with Laura,

00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:02.880
where she taught you technical
competence and language,

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.240
and you were able to kind of
trade that for your wisdom

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.380
and experience.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.260
If you come in with
a more equivalent

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.330
technical groundwork,
in a sense,

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:13.925
you don't have that
trade to offer.

00:47:13.925 --> 00:47:15.550
CHIP CONLEY: Well,
it's not as obvious.

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:16.650
KAREN: Yeah, it's
not as obvious.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:17.287
So how do you--

00:47:17.287 --> 00:47:18.870
what would you say
in response to that

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.390
in terms of looking
for other ways

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:23.352
to establish that kind
of mutual relationship?

00:47:23.352 --> 00:47:25.560
CHIP CONLEY: I'm so glad
someone called me out on it.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.540
Let's just start by saying, yes.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:31.410
I'm talking in generalities here
and in the average population

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:32.730
as well.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.820
I loved-- I was at a
summit series event

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:39.390
in Utah speaking
about wisdom, and here

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:43.560
was Kevin Kelly, co-founder
of "Wired" magazine,

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:47.040
66 years old, talking to a
bunch of, generally, people

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:50.430
in their 20s and 30s about
the future of technology.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:54.090
And then right after him was a
guy named Ryan Holliday onstage

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:57.180
who has written a lot
of books about wisdom.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.310
So it was the 31-year-old
talking about wisdom

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:01.690
and the 66-year-old
talking about technology.

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:05.130
So let's be clear, this
is not across the board.

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.970
Everybody doesn't
fit this profile.

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:09.030
I think the bigger question is--

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:13.170
that you ask, Karen--
is, how do you

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:16.350
figure out what it
is you have to offer

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:19.600
or what it is that you're
looking for from someone else?

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.140
And I think the
subtleties of that

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.760
so often have to do with
what you see in a meeting.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.000
It literally could be somebody
who runs a great meeting,

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.920
and so this is not
an EQ for DQ thing.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.470
It's just like, that person
runs a great meeting,

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:36.444
and I have a hard
time running meetings.

00:48:36.444 --> 00:48:37.860
I'm just going to
see if they want

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:40.080
to have some coffee
and just talk with them

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:47.970
about, what are their four or
five best practices for running

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:48.990
a meeting?

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:50.400
Or it could be something else.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.220
I mean the specifics
of it aren't important.

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.410
What's relevant
is the willingness

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:58.620
to go and ask
someone else if they

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.170
could give you some tutelage.

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:06.690
And I think the more we create
the culture in companies, where

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:10.170
people feel like that's OK, and
the idea of mutual mentorship

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:14.130
might grow out of that,
that's all we can ask for.

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:17.490
AUDIENCE: Tribal knowledge
versus institutional wisdom--

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:19.440
when you said, "institutional
wisdom," I heard

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.655
tribal knowledge and--

00:49:20.655 --> 00:49:21.375
CHIP CONLEY: Did you
say "tribal" or--

00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:21.810
AUDIENCE: Tribal.

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:22.310
Tribal.

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:23.720
CHIP CONLEY: Tribal, OK.

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.700
Yeah.

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:25.950
AUDIENCE: Just the modalities.

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:27.570
You keep talking
about mutual meeting

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:30.150
face-to-face, mutual
collaboration,

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.230
mentorship kind of arrangement.

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.150
How about the other
modalities of-- like,

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:35.610
we talk about
knowledge transferred

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:41.370
teaching seminars versus
writing documents and things.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.840
What has your experience
been of the balance

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.980
of getting wisdom
effectively communicated

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.424
through other forms
than just face-to-face?

00:49:49.424 --> 00:49:51.090
CHIP CONLEY: You know,
we live in an era

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:54.300
where you better have other
forms available to you,

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:54.900
for sure.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:55.930
I mean I think the--

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:00.870
a few years ago, after
I sold my company,

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:04.860
I created a company
called Fest300, Fest300.

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:08.400
And the whole company was
based upon the 300 best

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.600
festivals in the world.

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.660
And so I went around to some
of the world's best festivals,

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:16.410
because what I believed is
that in the era of URLs,

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:19.380
that IRL experiences, in
real life experiences,

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.120
had something to teach us.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.210
So you have to acknowledge
that my bias is

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:27.900
quite strongly the IRL
experience of in real life.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.640
And part of the
reason for that is

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.010
because there's the kinds of--

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:34.632
our mirror neurons
work differently

00:50:34.632 --> 00:50:36.840
when we're face to face with
someone than, literally,

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.760
when we have a screen, and
we're doing a video call.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.160
So I think that there's that.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:46.800
There's also just the sense
that you can see subtleties

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:51.780
more easily in conversation,
when it's face-to-face.

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.960
But let me say,
at the same time,

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.680
that I think the technology
around how you understand

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.310
who you're talking to and
what the experience is,

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:04.140
is probably so early
stage at this point,

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.840
such that 10 years
from now, the ability

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.780
to have your mirror
neurons kicked

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:13.140
in more when you're talking
to someone when it's

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.160
with a screen may be better.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.140
And there's no doubt the
scaling piece of this,

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.264
if you're just talking
about one-on-one stuff, that

00:51:19.264 --> 00:51:20.380
doesn't scale very well.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:23.580
So the process of
educating people

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.670
in sort of a more webinar
kind of a format--

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:27.560
that's fine.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.600
I think the key on
everything, all of this,

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.600
is about helping
people to understand,

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.060
what are their best
learning modalities.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.090
And we aren't taught
that in high school.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.580
We're not taught, are
we a visual thinker?

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:44.750
Or what's the form of learning
that actually is best for us?

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.360
If we could help people
understand that earlier,

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.580
then I would say that the
question would be easier

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.620
to answer, because
then you'd help people,

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:55.740
steer them to that modality
that works best for them.

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.680
So thank you.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.710
With that, that's
our hour together.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:00.490
So thanks to--

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:00.750
KAREN: Thank you, Chip--

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.249
CHIP CONLEY: --all of you and
all of you out there watching.

00:52:03.249 --> 00:52:07.120
