00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.760
Oh crap, I wore my red shirt.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.990
I’ll just have to take the risk.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.719
Quantum teleportation, to space has finally
been done ‘successfully.Which is super exciting,

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.770
but it’s quantum -- which means we didn’t
teleport a thing per se, but some data.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.040
Basically, Chinese scientists beamed photons
from the ground to a satellite orbiting above

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.990
the Earth; then they messed with them using
quantum entanglement

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.590
Entanglement, we’ve talked about before,
Einstein called it “spooky action at a distance.”

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.840
And it happens when you have two particles
— usually photons – that are created together.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.500
They’re like twins, and their twinning can
stretch across space and time – like me

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.579
and Mark Ruffalo.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.390
Because they were entangled, when the scientists
observed the spin of the Earth-photons they

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.789
could also know the spin of the photons in
space too!

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.300
They spin in the exact same way!

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.809
Even though there’s no physical connection
between the two, they’re just… mimicking

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.809
each other.

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:53.809
How?

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:54.809
No one knows.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.809
It’s, Spooky.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:56.809
Action.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.050
They’re like telepathic twins in different
cities.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.559
Like me and Mark Ruffalo.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.559
In this case, the Chinese satellite was capable
of sensing the quantum state of the photons,

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.470
so they could prove that the photons were
entangled.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.860
Even across a vast distance!

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.370
So think about this for a minute, right now,
if I want to send a message I have to secure

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.430
it with encryption.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.830
Like over secured radio waves.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.640
But, if we could make entangled phones…

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.450
When my quantum particle moved, yours would
move.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.500
If we can take advantage of that, we could
communicate without any perceivable physical

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.500
interaction!

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.420
Of course, we’re totally not there yet.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.841
Quantum states are detectable, but, by the
laws of quantum mechanics, once we observe

00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:35.020
a particle, it changes.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.920
The nice thing is, entanglement means we only
have to observe one of the particles to sense

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.390
the state of the other’s, but it’s not
two-way data transfer… yet.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.680
So, we teleported information to space, which
is a humongous accomplishment.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.670
But the practicality of is still up in the
air.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.250
Quantum mechanics is still bound by the same
laws of the universe as regular physics (in

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.250
some ways).

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.260
So we couldn’t use the particles as faster-than-light
communication, but we could use them sort

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.960
of like decoder rings.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.430
For example: If a spy has one of a twin set
of entangled particles, and their contact

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.440
has the other, alongside each is a coded message.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.020
If they meet, observe their particles, and
the spins match…

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.580
They’d know no one had tampered with their
messages.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.730
Ultimate security.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.980
Companies are already working on quantum entanglement
as a security protocol for the future internet.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.270
Quantum entanglement could lead to moving
data without wires or wireless frequencies.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.030
And, because anyone who somehow observed the
entangled photons (i.e. spied on them) would

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.569
alter them, security could be incredible.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.170
The problem is, quantum mechanics isn’t
fully understood.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.390
This is very much like trying to create a
whole new type of computer, without fully

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.980
understanding how computer chips work.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.870
Or, like… building an airplane without fully
understanding air molecules!

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.490
Still, some Dutch researchers plan to start
the first, rudimentary quantum computer network

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.040
soon, and they’re not alone.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.850
It’s a huge engineering challenge.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.300
And it’s not impossible, but it’s hard.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.240
Success would most definitely change the world…

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.170
A quantum internet could change our banking
system, security would be way better, but

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.990
you’d still need you balance your books.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.680

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.840
One last fun fact: In this Chinese experiment,
the team sent millions of photons to their

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.870
satellite to measure them, but the sat only
caught 911.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.310
So, again, it’s a tough way to send information,
but not impossible
