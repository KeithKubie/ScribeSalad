00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.359
You know what is so so yummy, sushi.

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.160
But I hear the delicious bluefin tuna is almost
extinct.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.160
Eh, who cares?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.980
There’s plenty of fish in the sea, right?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.980
Well...

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.459
Maybe not.

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.080
Hey guys Julia here for Dnews

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.080
OCEANS ARE BIG.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.220
I mean according to NOAA, oceans cover 71%
of the Earth and 99% of its living space.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.520
So there’s a lot of room in there.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.190
How can humans even make a dent in sea life?

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.659
Over the past few decades fishing returns
have been shrinking year after year.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.190
It seems we’re overfishing our seas.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.069
Overfishing is when more fish are caught that
can be replaced by natural reproduction in

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:43.069
a year.

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:45.329
For most of human history fishing fleets were
made of small local boats.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.899
But in the mid 1900s new technology changed
the game.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.539
New nets and radar technology allowed for
fishing of deeper waters and getting more

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.020
fish at once.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.199
Suddenly fishing became a big commercial enterprise.

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.690
For a while things we’re going swell.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.190
Yet in the mid-1990s the world got a wake
up call.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.060
After 500 years one of the oldest fisheries
suddenly collapsed.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.130
In the summer of 1992, the Atlantic Cod stock
off the Eastern coast of Canada fell to 1%

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.560
of its previous levels.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.640
A moratorium was put in place to allow the
cod to recover.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.280
Over 20 years later, some studies suggest
the cod are slowly recovering, yet some studies

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.719
show the population is declining.

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:25.369
But it’s not just cod, it’s pacific tuna,
it’s sardines, it’s Chilean Sea Bass,

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.600
even whale populations are decimated.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.920
A recent estimate places the amount of whales
killed in the last century at nearly 3 million.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.979
One study in the journal Nature estimated
that overfishing reduced large fish populations

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.500
to 10% of their pre-industrial size.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.509
It’s kind of a domino effect.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.659
As one source of fish gets used up, fisherman
quickly move on to the next.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.140
What’s called “fishing down”, as we
deplete the schools of larger fish, we turn

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.399
to what they eat, until we deplete those fish
and so on and so forth.

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.850
We fish down the food chain.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.630
And it’s not just the fish, some fishing
practices ruin ecosystems too.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.420
One of the most popular methods of catching
fish is trawling.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.240
While it can capture lots of fish, it also
does lots of damage.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.460
One study published in Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), found

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.220
that it removes a layer of sediment which
over time could leave that area barren.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.110
I’m not trying to bad mouth fisherman here.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.480
The UN says that Fishing is central to the
livelihood and food security of 200 million

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.480
people.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.100
And many people depend on fish as a primary
source of protein.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.720
So it’s clear that scientists need to fish
for a solution soon.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.320
There are already some regulations in place.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.750
Like fishing quotas, closed seasons, size
limits and the protecting certain areas.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.010
Those help, but it’s hard to regulate the
open ocean.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.030
According to the World Wildlife Fund Just
1.6% of the world's oceans have been declared

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.990
as marine protected areas.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.780
One study published in the Journal of Applied
Ecology found that marine protected zones

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.820
with a mix of zones that allowed no fishing
and zones that allowed just a little bit of

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.430
a fishing could be a good compromise for both
business and biology.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.180
As for you, maybe check out seafood guides,
the Monterey Bay Aquarium has a smartphone

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.430
app called Seafood Watch, which is pretty
cool.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.680
Alright guys what do you think?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.870
Are fish friends and not food?

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.570
