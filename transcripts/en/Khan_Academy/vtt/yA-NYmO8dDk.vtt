00:00:00.656 --> 00:00:02.337
Voiceover: So we're pretty
familiar with the things

00:00:02.337 --> 00:00:04.506
Benjamin Franklin did later in his life,

00:00:04.506 --> 00:00:05.789
but let's just start with the beginning.

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:07.938
Where was he born, what
was his childhood like?

00:00:07.938 --> 00:00:10.055
Voiceover: He was born in Boston in 1706,

00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:12.574
he was the tenth son
of a Puritan immigrant,

00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:14.989
and as the tenth son of a Puritan,

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.338
if you've studied the
Puritans or your Bible,

00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:19.139
you know your supposed to be your father's

00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:21.422
tithe to the Lord.

00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:23.938
His father was gonna send him to Harvard,

00:00:23.938 --> 00:00:25.874
in order to study for the ministry.

00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:26.823
This was way back when...

00:00:26.823 --> 00:00:28.538
Voiceover: And so when
people tithed, I've always

00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:31.040
imagined tithe is you give
ten percent of your income,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.838
you always give ten percent away of your,

00:00:32.838 --> 00:00:34.573
I guess they consider
that part of your wealth.

00:00:34.573 --> 00:00:37.837
Voiceover: Right, well it
was indeed, tithing means

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.239
giving away ten percent of your wealth,

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.323
but if you were the
tenth son of a Puritan,

00:00:42.323 --> 00:00:44.736
one of the kids was
supposed to be a minister,

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.499
and in this case it was old Ben Franklin,

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:49.838
young Ben Franklin, was
supposed to be the minister,

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:53.756
but he was not exactly cut for the cloth.

00:00:53.756 --> 00:00:55.323
You know one day they were salting away

00:00:55.323 --> 00:00:57.005
the provisions for the winter,

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.822
and he said to his father,
"Why don't I say grace

00:00:59.822 --> 00:01:01.506
"over 'em now, we get it done with for the

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:04.482
"entire year, we can
bless the entire food!"

00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:06.515
Yeah, instead of every day. (laughing)

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:08.155
Voiceover: And so I think
his father realized that

00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:09.842
it would be a waste of money to send him

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:12.172
to Harvard to study for the ministry,

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.823
so instead he apprentices him,

00:01:14.823 --> 00:01:16.377
makes him become an apprentice

00:01:16.377 --> 00:01:19.238
to his brother James, who was a printer.

00:01:19.238 --> 00:01:22.323
He was apprenticed at age
12 to this older brother

00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:24.438
who was a printer.

00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:27.138
Voiceover: I see, at age
12, and that's essentially,

00:01:27.138 --> 00:01:28.838
you go do what your brother's doing,

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:30.739
this is your education,
I mean, back then...

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:32.721
Voiceover: That was the
way you got educated,

00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:37.759
but in return, you were
bonded, you were bound

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.187
to work from age 12 and, usually for,

00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:43.789
I don't know, seven, eight years at least,

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.756
for an older brother.

00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:47.355
And if you've ever had an older brother,

00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:48.505
this was not something

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:51.588
Benjamin Franklin liked after a few years.

00:01:51.588 --> 00:01:54.456
He rankled over authority.

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:57.205
That was one of the ways
he was very American.

00:01:57.205 --> 00:02:00.772
And so he has to decide to teach himself,

00:02:00.772 --> 00:02:02.905
because he's not going to Harvard,

00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:04.622
he's not in school.

00:02:04.622 --> 00:02:06.854
His father decided instead to make him

00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:08.657
an apprentice to the older brother,

00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:11.164
and so he teaches himself how to be a good

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:14.538
writer by pulling down the
books from his brother's

00:02:14.538 --> 00:02:17.072
print shop and publishing
house's bookshelf.

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:21.074
He started off with like,
Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress,

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:24.922
and you know, the essays by Plutarch,

00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:28.155
and Swift, and Defoe, all these things

00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:29.872
you and I were reading at age 12...

00:02:29.872 --> 00:02:31.989
Voiceover: Absolutely! (chuckling)

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.456
Voiceover: And then he
taught himself how to write.

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:36.823
He would take the Spectator
magazine, which was

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.500
a great magazine in
London at the time written

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.289
by Addison and Steele, and it would arrive

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:46.538
by the post to his brother's print shop,

00:02:46.538 --> 00:02:49.656
and Franklin would grab
it and he would write down

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:52.122
the arguments that Addison and Steele did

00:02:52.122 --> 00:02:54.289
in their essays, and
then he would chop 'em up

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:57.156
with scissors, he would
cut them up, and put it

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:59.324
in a different order, and then try to

00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:02.254
rewrite the essays in a better order than

00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:03.521
Addison and Steele had done.

00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:06.211
This is like a, he's by
then 14 or 15 years old!

00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:08.812
(chuckling) This is really
cool, it's like using

00:03:08.812 --> 00:03:11.410
Khan Academy to teach
yourself, but your using

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.988
the Spectator from England instead.

00:03:13.988 --> 00:03:16.156
Voiceover: And so he becomes, he actually

00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:18.405
does start writing then, i
guess he, but his brother

00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:19.496
didn't really wanna...

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:21.006
Voiceover: Right, his
brother wouldn't publish him,

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:23.905
as I said, he was an older
brother, even though he

00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:29.240
became a tolerable writer,
he can't get his stuff

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.873
printed in the New England
Courant, which is his

00:03:31.873 --> 00:03:34.706
brother's newspaper, so
he has a little trick.

00:03:34.706 --> 00:03:38.372
He disguises his
handwriting, and he makes up

00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:42.623
a pseudonym, and he
writes under a fake name.

00:03:42.623 --> 00:03:44.922
These wonderful essays, he's 16...

00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:46.106
Voiceover: What's the name that he uses?

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:48.739
Voiceover: Silence Dogood. (chuckling)

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.573
These are the Silence Dogood essays,

00:03:50.573 --> 00:03:55.088
and you're talking about a
kid who is aged 15 or so,

00:03:55.088 --> 00:03:57.656
making up this character.

00:03:57.656 --> 00:04:00.087
Now Silence Dogood was a woman.

00:04:00.087 --> 00:04:02.555
Now here as I say, this
is a boy who's a pretty

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:05.240
troublesome kid, Ben Franklin, he hangs

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.739
around the docks in
Boston and gets himself

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.272
in trouble all the time, and he's always

00:04:09.272 --> 00:04:12.589
cutting work at his brothers print shop,

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.856
but he invents a
character who's a widowed,

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:21.956
older woman, who is dating a minister,

00:04:21.956 --> 00:04:25.489
and living out in the countryside.

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:26.339
Voiceover: So pretty much the exact

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:27.656
opposite of himself.

00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:29.906
Voiceover: Right, (laughing) and it shows

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:32.304
something so important in education,

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:35.739
which is how do you let
the imagination triumph?

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:39.656
And here's a kid, 15
years old, who invents

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:42.673
this character, Silence
Dogood, and just does

00:04:42.673 --> 00:04:45.155
a pure thing of the imagination.

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:48.155
She was, indeed, the
opposite of Ben Franklin,

00:04:48.155 --> 00:04:50.337
but there are lots of
traits that Ben Franklin

00:04:50.337 --> 00:04:52.389
gave her, and every week she would

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.988
write about them, that
sort of made you realize

00:04:54.988 --> 00:04:56.989
okay, it's a bit like
Ben Franklin, because

00:04:56.989 --> 00:05:00.155
she had this, she wrote
once, "I am a mortal

00:05:00.155 --> 00:05:03.907
"enemy to arbitrary government
and unlimited power.

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:07.165
"I'm very jealous for my
rights and my liberties."

00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:10.124
In other words, she's a very spunky woman

00:05:10.124 --> 00:05:12.405
who has an aversion to tyranny.

00:05:12.405 --> 00:05:15.039
And it was a great description not only of

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.655
Ben Franklin, but of the country that

00:05:16.655 --> 00:05:18.322
Ben Franklin was helping to invent.

00:05:18.322 --> 00:05:20.173
Voiceover: And this is,
just to give people a

00:05:20.173 --> 00:05:22.554
historical context,
this is well before the

00:05:22.554 --> 00:05:24.655
American Revolution and independence from

00:05:24.655 --> 00:05:26.255
Great Britain, I mean we're talking about

00:05:26.255 --> 00:05:29.490
the early 1700s, we're
talking about the period

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.947
around 1720...

00:05:29.947 --> 00:05:31.816
Voiceover: Yeah, we're
talking about 50, 60 years

00:05:31.816 --> 00:05:34.488
before we really are
gonna have a revolution

00:05:34.488 --> 00:05:36.888
and break away from England, but already,

00:05:36.888 --> 00:05:40.471
he believes in liberty,
he believes in an aversion

00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:42.521
to tyranny, and fighting these things.

00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:46.373
And you see it in the
way that Silence Dogood,

00:05:46.373 --> 00:05:48.906
every week, she would write
an essay until he finally

00:05:48.906 --> 00:05:51.739
got (chucking) found out by his brother.

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:54.707
He makes fun of the connection between

00:05:54.707 --> 00:05:57.323
church and state in Massachusetts,

00:05:57.323 --> 00:06:02.239
because the governor, [Dunstrin], Dudley,

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:05.004
all these people, they
are Puritan ministers

00:06:05.004 --> 00:06:10.672
who are also the
governor, and the heads of

00:06:10.672 --> 00:06:15.088
the legislature in
Massachusetts, and he says

00:06:15.088 --> 00:06:17.722
of Governor Dudley, he said, "anybody who

00:06:17.722 --> 00:06:19.988
"goes from the clergy into government will

00:06:19.988 --> 00:06:21.739
"take your money in two different ways,

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:24.272
"they'll do it under the guise of taxes,

00:06:24.272 --> 00:06:27.539
"and then they'll do it
under the guise of God,

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.505
"asking you for a donation." (chuckling)

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:33.573
And so, this little kid
pretending to be an elderly

00:06:33.573 --> 00:06:37.005
woman is making fun of
the connection between

00:06:37.005 --> 00:06:39.055
church and state in Massachusetts.

00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:41.039
It's the beginning of a
free press in America.

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:42.021
Voiceover: And that's a big deal,

00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:43.438
the church was fairly powerful.

00:06:43.438 --> 00:06:47.073
Voiceover: In Boston in
particular, as you know,

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:50.522
it was settled by the
Puritans, and it is a

00:06:50.522 --> 00:06:53.906
theocratic colony, in other words,

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:58.255
Harvard University, the
colony of Massachusetts,

00:06:58.255 --> 00:07:01.755
and the Puritan heirarchy
were all the same.

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.165
I mean it was all the same people,

00:07:03.165 --> 00:07:05.323
Cotton Mather and Increase Mather,

00:07:05.323 --> 00:07:08.004
and Governor Dudley,
they were the ministers,

00:07:08.004 --> 00:07:09.457
they were the people who ran the state,

00:07:09.457 --> 00:07:10.906
they were the people who ran Harvard.

00:07:10.906 --> 00:07:12.575
Voiceover: So Silence
Dogood, I guess we said that

00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:14.572
she's the opposite, she
was maybe demographically

00:07:14.572 --> 00:07:16.437
the opposite of him,
but philosophically...

00:07:16.437 --> 00:07:19.040
Voiceover: Right, he's
using somebody who's

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.560
totally a different
type, an elderly woman,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.989
to express his own philosophical ideas

00:07:24.989 --> 00:07:27.936
so he doesn't get caught by his brother.
