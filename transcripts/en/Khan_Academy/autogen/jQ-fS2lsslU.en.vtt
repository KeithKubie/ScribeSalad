00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.320
 Let us solve some dots with dots 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.110
 feature graphs. 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.070
 The task requires us 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.590
 to find the coordinates 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.800
 at each of these points. 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.200
 Let's do it. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.350
 Let's start with this point here. 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.240
 Let's call it a point. 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.090
 We begin with the discovery of the x coordinate. 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.780
 x means how far is left or right from the start point. 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.830
 And it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 left or just 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.230
 -6 from the origin of the coordinate system. 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.420
 Minus 6 is right here. 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.950
 And then y-coordinate, which means how high is the distant point, 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.330
 right here. 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.850
 That's 4. 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.790
 Minus 6 and 4. 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.060
 Let's do the same for b. 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.890
 For the x-coordinate 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.580
 just get down, and that's 7. 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.950
 And y-coordinate, how high is the point, this is 6. 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.730
 All right. 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.980
 Let us now find the coordinates of point c. 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.410
 the x-coordinate is minus 8. 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.110
 8 to the left of the system. 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.550
 minus 8. 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.000
 And the y coordinate is 2 squares below the start of the system. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.120
 So the y coordinate is minus 2. 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.200
 That is, nothing complicated. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.590
 Item d. 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.880
 Point d, its y coordinate is 4. 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.990
 No, sorry, her x-coordinate is 4, and then 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.860
 its y coordinate, how much lower than the start of the system is, or just below 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.730
 the vertical axis, it is minus 7. 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.025
 And finally we are on the point is. 

00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:02.720
 Choosing a nice color for the point is. 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.420
 Right there. 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.460
 Its x coordinate is 5. 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.340
 On the abscissa axis x is equal to 5. 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.350
 And her y coordinate, well, she is neither above nor below 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.960
 the beginning of the system or the abscissa, so its y coordinate is 0. 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.930
 We can draw a line and get right to 0. 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.120
 And so. 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.940
 We found all these coordinates. 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.220
 Now, in Task 5 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.150
 we have to find out whether each dependency is a function. 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.990
 Here we have a trick that one dependence 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.040
 is not a function if there are two values ​​for x. 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.660
 For example. 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:51.680
 If I write that f (x) is equal to 5, if x is equal to 1, 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.820
 or is equal to 6 if x is equal to 1. 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.070
 That makes no sense. 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.710
 Why does it make no sense? 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.810
 Because if I put the number 1 there, I do not know what 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.510
 result I will get. 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.000
 Will I get 5? 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.460
 Or will I get 6? 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.230
 This is a badly built feature. 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.720
 This is not a function. 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.360
 So if we have a similar situation for an argument, 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.880
 which gives us several different possible outcomes, 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.030
 this is not a function. 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.860
 Let's see if there is something like this here. 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.120
 It is given us first that 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.160
 if x is 1 then y is 7. 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.010
 If x is 2, y is 7, well, well. 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.130
 Yes. 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.500
 We can have two values ​​for x at one for y. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:44.020
 For example, the same would be to say that f (x) equals 7 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.740
 if x is equal to 1 or 2. 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.540
 Everything is fine. 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.020
 For two different values ​​of x we ​​can have the same result, 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.160
 but we can not have two different values ​​for x to give us 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.120
 the same thing, excuse me, that is, we can not have the same value for x for which 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.060
 to have different results. 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.870
 Because then we do not know if we have f (1) 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.100
 how much it will be equal. 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.100
 f (1), will it be 5 or will it be 6? 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.900
 We do not know. 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.780
 Here we know how much f (1) is equal to 7. 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.440
 Here we know how much f (2) is equal to 7. 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.050
 So far so good. 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.850
 So when we have 2, we get 7. 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.570
 When the argument is 3, we get 8. 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.810
 If the argument is 4, we get 8. 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.840
 For example, let's define the function so we get 8 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.550
 if x is equal to 3 or 4. 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.960
 Then we have 5. 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.770
 The function is equal to 9 if x is equal to 5. 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.010
 For the first paragraph, this is the definition of the function, 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.250
 fully compliant with definition rules 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.680
 of the function. 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.080
 Whatever value you give me 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, which values ​​are actually 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.740
 the definition area in the case, I can tell you 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.000
 what will be the value of the function for each of these points. 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.230
 They will vary around 7, 8, or 9. 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.660
 So, for a sub-item we definitely have a function. 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.110
 Now b subsection. 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.940
 Let's see if x is 1 and y is 1. 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.140
 We are told that if x is 1, then y is minus 1. 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.560
 That makes no sense. 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.760
 Here's what they tell us here. 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.202
 Trying to compose a function where they tell us, 

00:05:12.202 --> 00:05:16.790
 that this function will be equal to 1 if x is equal to 1, but 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.180
 or it will be equal to minus 1 if x is equal to 1. 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.370
 So when we have f (1), we do not know 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.840
 how much the function will be equal. 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.700
 Will it be equal to 1 or minus 1? 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.910
 We do not know what to take, here or here. 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.870
 Therefore, this is not a function. 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.850
 Subpoint b is not a function. 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.270
 This dependency is not a function. 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.060
 All right. 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.450
 Let's cut some more. 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.520
 Task 6. 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.185
 Explain by an equation any function graph. 

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:48.450
 We have this letter-like thing. 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.910
 We can record it in several ways. 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.425
 Let's call it f (x). 

00:05:52.425 --> 00:05:55.120
 We can call it g (x) or h (x), but if we have not used it 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.440
 before we usually use f (x). 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.940
 This is x. 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.980
 Let's see we seem to have a straight line when x is 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.320
 greater than 0, and another straight line when x 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.320
 is less than 0. 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.960
 We have one case when x is 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.990
 greater than 0. 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.470
 And a separate case when x is less than 0. 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.490
 And I'll try to connect the two cases for a second. 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.520
 What do you like this line here like? 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.280
 When x is 0, y is 0. 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.860
 When x is 2, y is 1. 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.690
 When x is 4, y is 2. 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.370
 It seems that whatever number is x, y always 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.630
 is 1/2 times less than x. 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.630
 When x is 6, y is 3. 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.440
 So it is equal to 1 / 2x when x is greater than 0. 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.070
 And when x is less than 0 when x is 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.930
 minus 2, ye 1. 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.620
 When x is minus 4, y is 2. 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.750
 It seems that this is exactly 1/2. 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.600
 Minus 1/2 by minus 4 is 2. 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.790
 We have 1/2 x when x is less than 0. 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.870
 It seems like a totally correct answer. 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.660
 But if we want to make it a little easier, 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.670
 to clarify it a bit, we can record the function 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.640
 f (x) is equal to something instead of recording separately 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.340
 for greater or less than 0, let's take it straight 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.890
 the absolute value for x and multiply it by 1/2. 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.870
 Task 10.
