00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.050
Okay, because the reaction in the infant is

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.570
so severe, there's probably no lactase produced at all,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.970
due to some kind of significant deletion maybe

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.200
of the TATA box and the promoter region. If

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.230
it was just the enhancer, we might expect

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.730
some diminished lactase activity, but we wouldn't expect it

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.510
to be missing completely. Severe lactose intolerance suggested

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.210
that we have almost no lactase available, so this

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.500
probably means a problem in the promoter, not the enhancer.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.770
There were lot of different ways that you could have responded

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.930
to this question, to the why part of the question

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.380
and what I hope you did is spent some time planning

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.710
out your answer and writing it out. Now there's an

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.060
okay to a best level of answering this question, in my

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.640
opinion and an okay response, which isn't very good, and I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.730
hope you put more than this is, the promoter is mutated.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.220
Meaning that you were able to select

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.150
correctly that it's the promoter and just indicate

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.920
that you think that's where the mutation is

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.430
but that's not much of an explanation. The

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.380
next best answer ranked here as good would be saying that the promoter

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.670
likely has a mutation in the consensus sequence, preventing

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.800
transcription and causing the symptoms. So understanding that the actual

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.920
mutation itself is happening in a sequence, it's

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.300
a consensus, and it blocks transcription all together. Still

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.880
it leaves a little bit to be desired. A

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.070
better answer would be to say that the TATA-box,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.050
right, which we know is consensus sequence is

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.310
likely mutated which prevents transcription factors from binding right.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.710
We know that there are transcription factors that bind

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.500
and make transcription happen. This results in no lactase,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.600
which explains the severe phenotype. A change in

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.080
the enhancer, would have less of an effect.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.775
So you not only understand, right, that the

00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:53.730
TATA-Box is crucial to the effectiveness of the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.460
promoter, but you realize that the enhancer isn't

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.390
really doing that much as far as absolute

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.090
control, right? It can boost levels, right, but

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.430
it's not going to essentially take all the transcription away,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.240
as we see in the case of the infant. And the best possible answer here is to

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.185
be pretty comprehensive and to say that the consensus

00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:18.040
TATA- box of the promoter is likely deleted or

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.030
significantly altered as a result critical transcription factors can't

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.750
bind and transcription doesn't occur, so we get no

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.800
lactase protein. And this would explain the severe phenotype

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.530
better than a change or deletion in the enhancer

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.620
region, whose alleles seem only to effect lactase presistence

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.310
into adulthood. What I'd really like for you to

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.760
do is, look at your answer from the previous

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.430
video screen and I want you to compare it to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.180
these answers here and then select the check box

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.950
here that you think best evaluates how you answered

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.540
the question. if you think you were only okay

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.910
check the okay box, if you think you were best

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.820
check the best box. And there are boxes in-between these answers that

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.230
you can check as well if you think your answer is somewhere

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.280
in the middle. Go ahead and do that comparison now and then

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.110
select which box you think fairly assesses your answer to this question.
