00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:03.453
A few months ago, I was joined
here in my backyard by Dr.

00:00:03.453 --> 00:00:07.370
James Grime, and he was
planting a sunflower

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.750
here in this pot.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.920
It was all part of a big
national project, and I'll put

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.360
some information in the
link under the video.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.200
But now, I'm pleased to
reveal the sunflower.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.610
Grown up, no thanks to
me, I have to say.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.810
But we are having a
bit of a problem.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.700
You see, we've been counting
the seeds here in the head.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.290
It's all to do with
Fibonacci numbers.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.360
I'm sure you've all
heard it before.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.380
And we did one count, and we
came up with 34 spirals.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.740
And that's a Fibonacci number.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.450
That's what we were expecting.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.490
But when we counted the other
way, we keep coming up with 54

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.410
spirals, and not 55.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.440
It should be 55, because that's
the Fibonacci number.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.850
It is really hard counting seeds
in the head of a flower.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.740
And maybe we're doing
it wrong.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.180
So I'm actually asking some of
you guys to go and have a look

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.520
into our count for us to
see what you think.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.190
I'm going to put a nice, big,
detailed picture of that on my

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.090
blog and on Flickr.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.200
And I'll put links
under the video.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.010
So go and have a look, do
a bit of a count, and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.220
see what you think.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.680
Is this not a Fibonacci
sunflower?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.810
Or are we just a bit rubbish
at counting the spirals?

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.550
Get in touch.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.800
See what you reckon.
