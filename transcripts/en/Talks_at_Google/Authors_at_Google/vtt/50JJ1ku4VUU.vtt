00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.090
FEMALE SPEAKER: Today,
we are very lucky to have

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.770
with us chef Chris Ying.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.700
Chris is the co-founder of
the James Beard Award-winning

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.110
magazine, "Lucky Peach."

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.090
In fact, a congratulations are
in order for the three awards

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.515
you just won this weekend.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:17.910
CHRIS YING: Thank you.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.127
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:22.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: So the
magazine is an awesome food

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.910
and lifestyle journal that
has a very unique perspective

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.430
on food.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.470
And actually, I just read
an article this morning

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.200
describing the
magazine as, quote,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.810
"a food magazine for
people who wouldn't usually

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.880
pick up a food magazine."

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.070
And I thought that
was pretty fitting.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.520
It's innovative in its
explorations of themes

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.510
through essays, art,
photography, and recipes--

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.447
often actually highlighting
some of the Bay Area's bests.

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:48.780
And it's definitely become
one of the most popular reads

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.900
among today's foodies.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.030
Chris also designed an
edited several cookbooks

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.280
in collaboration with his
"Lucky Peach" co-founder.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.080
And their latest book,
"The Wurst of Lucky Peach,"

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.030
is a look into the great
sausage trails of the world.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.640
But Chris, I'll let you say
some more about the book.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.140
First, I would like
you to please join me

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.015
in welcoming Chris to Google.

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:10.865
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:12.750
CHRIS YING: Thank you.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.250
Thanks.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.340
Thanks for having me, guys.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.920
Thanks for putting
on this fake beach

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.910
volleyball game outside
to create the whole Google

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.140
vibe for my pleasure.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.490
I really appreciate that.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.790
I know doesn't usually happen.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.690
No, seriously-- thank you
guys all so much for coming.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.190
I have zero faith in my ability
to draw an audience, ever,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.811
so the fact that anybody's
here is very special to me.

00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:38.310
Let me also start
with a disclaimer.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.280
I am not a chef, despite
that lovely introduction.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.720
I have cooked in kitchens,
but I have to say,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.590
given that this will be online,
no, no, "Chris-y" no "chef-y."

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.210
So, yeah.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.604
One other little preamble--
there's beer over there.

00:01:54.604 --> 00:01:57.020
This whole thing will be much
more enjoyable for all of us

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.490
if you guys drink beer.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.448
I won't be offended if
you get up in the middle

00:02:00.448 --> 00:02:02.290
to replenish your beers.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.860
But otherwise, hi.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.700
My name's Chris.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.030
I'm the editor-in-chief
of "Lucky Peach."

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.580
Look, these guys are going
for a beer right now.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.545
It's amazing.

00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:13.550
You just say something,
and it happens.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.140
This is our second cookbook
from "Lucky Peach."

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.440
Our first one was a book called
"101 Easy Asian Recipes,"

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.400
which was originally a joke.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.650
We were going to make this
book called "101 Easy Asian

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.320
Recipes," and it was going to
be 101 super difficult recipes

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.280
that no one could pull off.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.550
But somewhere along the
line, we grew up a little bit

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.670
and decided that helping people
cook at home was important,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.640
and that kind of making
esoteric jokes that only

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.200
we thought were
funny was not really

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.408
that helpful to anybody else.

00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:49.190
So this book is the
second one we've made,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.200
and the first in a series
of single-subject cookbooks.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.140
So I don't know if you guys are
familiar with the "Time Life"

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.659
cookbooks that were
sort of covered,

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.700
you know, a single cuisine
from around the world,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.760
or a single ingredient.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.730
Or the "River Cottage"
series-- or, like, Alice Waters

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.910
has done books about just
vegetables, or just fruits.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.520
Those are sort of
spirit animals.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.750
Those are what we love
and are inspired by.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.240
But this book is nothing
like that whatsoever.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.650
It is not comprehensive,
or exhaustive,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.050
or nearly as intelligent as
those books are-- primarily

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.430
because I wrote most of it.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.405
So it's just not that smart.

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:34.280
No, I keep on describing
this series of books

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.700
as a series of
books that you could

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.000
enjoy reading in the
bathroom and then

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.272
find useful in the kitchen.

00:03:41.272 --> 00:03:43.730
One of the few items that you
could bring between those two

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.390
rooms safely.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.740
So anyway, that is the book.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.070
It's all about sausages.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.490
And the reason why we decided
to make a book entirely

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.530
about sausages, to be
honest with you, mostly

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.820
has to do with the fact that the
title was really funny to us.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.024
"The Wurst of Lucky Peach"
was sort of too good

00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:05.440
of a pun to pass
up, so we decided

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.130
make this book about sausages.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.840
And at first, when I sat down to
kind of put this book together,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.500
I thought, wow, this is
way too narrow of a topic.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.220
Like, not that many people
care that much about sausage.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.935
Why are we doing a book
entirely about sausages?

00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:25.240
Then I started
thinking more about it.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.237
And it started to be like
when you learn a new word,

00:04:28.237 --> 00:04:29.820
and all of a sudden,
everyone you know

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.220
has been using this
word for years,

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.350
and you just have not understood
what they were saying.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.880
And it was like
that with sausages,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.230
where all of a sudden,
everywhere I would go, I'd be,

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.650
like, oh, man, we
eat a lot of sausage.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.060
Like, we really like
sausages in this country

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.320
and around the world.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.840
And I started thinking
more and more about sausage

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.050
not as this joke thing, or not
as this kind of niche food,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.260
but more as an important part
of our culinary cultures.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.870
And that goes sort
around the world.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.520
Anywhere that you've had people
who eat meat, and have had

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.370
to worry about where food is
going to come from tomorrow,

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.870
or the next day-- or what
to do with this animal

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.610
that they just slaughtered,
and have all this extra meat--

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.060
or anywhere there's been a
lower socioeconomic class that

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.960
hasn't had access
to sort of the,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.100
you know, filet
mignon and tenderloin,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.259
and has had to make do with
off-cuts and intestines

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.800
and things like that-- anywhere
that's happened in the world,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.609
sausage has been invented.

00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:30.900
And that's what sausage is for.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.890
Sausage is for making
food out of stuff

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.990
that you don't necessarily
want to eat by itself, for lack

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.217
of a better description.

00:05:40.217 --> 00:05:41.800
Wow, you'd think I
would have a better

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.310
way of talking about
sausages, given

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.460
that I wrote a book about it.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.020
No, but it's
evolved beyond that,

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.995
to a point where I think
that sausage represents

00:05:51.995 --> 00:05:57.460
kind of everything good
about meat cookery,

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.020
engineered to be easier.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.275
So what are the hard
things about cooking meat?

00:06:01.275 --> 00:06:03.650
You have to cook things to a
certain temperature for them

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.358
to still be good.

00:06:04.358 --> 00:06:07.400
They have to be cooked to medium
rare for a steak to be good.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.932
Once you kind of go over
medium into well done,

00:06:09.932 --> 00:06:11.640
you kind of have this
tough piece of meat

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.480
that's not as good
as you want it to be.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.640
Getting flavor into a steak,
or a piece of chicken breast,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.440
or pork is a huge challenge.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.980
You marinate things, or
you brine things in order

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.260
to make them flavorful.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.760
And then you've got
a whole industry

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.710
of these sort of
prime cut meats,

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.374
like wagyu or Kobe
beef, that are prized

00:06:34.374 --> 00:06:36.540
for, like, the marbling of
the fat, and how much fat

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.690
they have in them.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.660
Well, then, you've
got sausage, which

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.220
you can cook to well done.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.510
You can season however
you want, and put as much

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.190
seasoning as you want in it, and
it will be seasoned throughout.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.580
And you can put as much fucking
fat in there as you see fit.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.392
So, honestly, like,
sausage has come

00:06:52.392 --> 00:06:54.350
from this really humble
beginning to this thing

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.100
where, done right, you
can make it the highest

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.070
form of meat cookery.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.692
So, anyway.

00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:01.650
The book is also funny.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.290
There's lots of poop
jokes and stuff.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.121
I highly recommend it for
Mother's Day or something.

00:07:09.121 --> 00:07:09.620
Yeah.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.400
So today, we're going
to make some sausage.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.743
How many people have made
sausage at home before?

00:07:14.743 --> 00:07:15.570
All right.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.350
Three to four people.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.017
There's sort of a whole
spectrum of difficulty

00:07:23.017 --> 00:07:24.350
when it comes to making sausage.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.990
You can make really
difficult sausage--

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.400
you can make mortadella, which
has to be sort of emulsified

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.830
at a certain temperature.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.700
And you have to stud it with
pistachios and peppercorns.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.020
And it can be pretty difficult.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.690
And on the other
end of the spectrum,

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.514
you can make sausage
really easily.

00:07:42.514 --> 00:07:44.180
And that's what we're
going to do today,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.727
because I'm not risking
anything difficult.

00:07:47.727 --> 00:07:50.060
So this is one of the things
I discovered when I started

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.435
thinking about sausage, and
what to include in this book,

00:07:52.435 --> 00:07:55.330
was, like, oh, sausage is
niche, sausage is, too narrow,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.580
there's not that much sausage.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.430
And then I was, like, wait, I
eat sausage four times a week

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.770
in the form of chorizo.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.330
If you live in the Bay Area,
in California in general,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.730
you've eaten chorizo.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.590
So chorizo is, you know,
probably the best known

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.020
Mexican sausage.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.270
And so, here to help
me make this today

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.950
is a Googler who
submitted a special video

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.460
to win the dubious
honor of helping me.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.225
Will you guys welcome Brandon?

00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:26.371
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.380
And also, from my
"Lucky Peach" staff,

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.990
this is Aralyn, who's going
to say smart things while I'm

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.700
distracted cooking.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.241
Hi, Aralyn.

00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:36.199
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Hello.

00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:37.365
CHRIS YING: Welcome, Aralyn.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.012
How's it going, man?

00:08:41.012 --> 00:08:43.220
You're among the people who
have made sausage before.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.240
BRANDON CHALK: I am.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.963
CHRIS YING: OK.

00:08:44.963 --> 00:08:46.070
BRANDON CHALK: Not
chorizo, though.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.570
CHRIS YING: Not chorizo.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.315
BRANDON CHALK: But I think that
was my first recipe in the book

00:08:48.315 --> 00:08:49.050
that I wanted to make.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:49.340
CHRIS YING: All right.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.980
We're going to do it right here.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.571
Chorizo starts here.

00:08:56.571 --> 00:08:58.610
You know, a lot of people
are kind of turned off

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.690
by the idea of making
sausage, because there's

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:00.740
all this equipment involved.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.531
You've got to buy a
grinder, and a stuffer,

00:09:02.531 --> 00:09:03.860
and all this kind of stuff.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.910
But there's also just
loose, uncased sausage

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.270
which most choirzo, when you
buy it from a Mexican grocery--

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.130
it comes in a big bulk, then
you buy it by the pound.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.320
And today, we're going to
do it without a grinder.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.277
We're going to do it with
a Cuisinart food processor.

00:09:21.277 --> 00:09:23.110
I'm not shilling you
Cuisinart specifically.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.609
[GRINDING]

00:09:23.609 --> 00:09:24.510
There it goes.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.752
BRANDON CHALK: It works.

00:09:26.752 --> 00:09:27.460
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.110
Let's get started, right?

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.265
So the backbone of
chorizo is chilies.

00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:33.940
And in this case--
this recipe comes

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:39.070
from Rick Bayliss, the wonderful
Mexican chef in Chicago.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.810
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.025
CHRIS YING: For
Chicago or something.

00:09:44.025 --> 00:09:45.650
The chile we're going
to be using today

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.046
is an ancho chile, which
is a dried poblano?

00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:51.170
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Couldn't--

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.128
CHRIS YING: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:52.128 --> 00:09:53.500
A dried poblano.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.455
So, what we're-- nice, nice.

00:09:56.455 --> 00:09:58.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.010
So we've got some
soaking right here.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.010
You can see this, right?

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.000
There's no way to
see thi-- whatever.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.825
BRANDON CHALK: Yeah, there is.

00:10:04.825 --> 00:10:05.991
CHRIS YING: OK, there it is.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.720
What we did with these
before was, you stem them.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.290
So they come dried like this.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.170
You'll stem them by just tearing
off the stem with your hands,

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:26.610
and then dump out
these seeds, like so.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.320
And you'll kind of just,
like, tear it open.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.117
Want to do this?

00:10:30.117 --> 00:10:30.950
BRANDON CHALK: Sure.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.560
CHRIS YING: You'll just
tear it open and seed it.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:40.353
And then you'll toast
them on a hot saute pan--

00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:43.311
[WHISTLING]

00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:44.390
--oops, sorry.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.165
Sorry.

00:10:45.165 --> 00:10:48.527
What kind of sausages
have you made in the past?

00:10:48.527 --> 00:10:50.610
BRANDON CHALK: I've done
some with caul fat, which

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.276
is another really
easy way to make them.

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:56.850
And then we did a bunch
of Italian sausages

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.030
at my friend's place.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.100
Because he has one of the super
crazy sausage stuffers that you

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:01.750
can fit, like--

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.775
CHRIS YING: Oh, yeah.

00:11:02.775 --> 00:11:03.900
We're not going to do that.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.649
BRANDON CHALK: No.

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:06.662
CHRIS YING: So just
put that in there

00:11:06.662 --> 00:11:08.200
and then press it on there.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.500
You can use a spatula,
if you're scared, or not.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.000
ARALYN BEAUMONT:
Would you like one?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.090
CHRIS YING: It really takes,
like, ten seconds on each--

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.150
BRANDON CHALK: We have
good worker's comp here.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.940
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.710
So you'll just press
this on the pan

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.240
for 10 seconds on each side.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.350
You'll see it starts to kind
of blister a little bit,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.900
as his fingertips
are currently doing.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.200
And it'll start to
smell incredible--

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.910
just, like, toasty and fruity.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.560
You can flip it over.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.870
This is just kind
of to-- I'm going

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.530
to make this up-- this is
to "activate" the flavors.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.462
It doesn't do that.

00:11:41.462 --> 00:11:44.599
It doesn't do that at all.

00:11:44.599 --> 00:11:46.890
And so, you'll just do this
with each of these chilies.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.111
This recipe, I think, calls for
something like 12 ancho chiles.

00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:51.920
Yeah, whatever.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.320
It doesn't matter.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.236
This is just for show.

00:11:53.236 --> 00:11:55.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.340
You'll soak them in
water for 20 minutes.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.300
You take a plate, and
you can push it on top

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.630
and submerge them, so they
stay under and get soft.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.088
And then we're
going to pulse them.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:08.930
I got you.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.620
BRANDON CHALK:
Child safety lock.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.440
Thank you.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.680
CHRIS YING: So just chilies
in there, without the water.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.580
Everybody's had chorizo, right?

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.070
So you're pretty aware
of the flavor profile.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:26.230
It's really, you know, a
little spicy, a little acidic,

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.800
a little sour.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.470
That's kind of a
hallmark of-- hold

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:35.710
on one second-- of sausages
in other places as well.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.540
So in Southeast Asia, they'll
hang chiles to dry and ferment

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.180
a little bit, so they get this
kind of sour taste to them.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.010
Chorizo has this
little sourness to it.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.700
It's not something
that we usually

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.980
have in our sort of
American-style sausages.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.720
But in the process
of making this book,

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.704
it's been something I've
really enjoyed tasting.

00:12:55.704 --> 00:12:57.060
Right?

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.010
So, here's what you're
going to do next.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.070
Bay leaves into the
mortar and pestle.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.980
BRANDON CHALK: Yup.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.545
CHRIS YING: Throw these--
throw that in there, too.

00:13:06.545 --> 00:13:07.711
BRANDON CHALK: Smells fresh.

00:13:07.711 --> 00:13:10.420
CHRIS YING: Add thyme, marjoram.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.899
And just powderize that.

00:13:13.899 --> 00:13:15.940
BRANDON CHALK: So do you
have any favorite places

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.935
for chorizo?

00:13:16.935 --> 00:13:19.310
CHRIS YING: Do I have
favorite places for chorizo?

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.630
BRANDON CHALK: Or is
that a loaded question?

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.380
CHRIS YING: I'm going
to help you out here

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:30.190
with a little bit of salt.
So I spend a lot of time

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.150
in the Mission District
in San Francisco,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:39.610
so the chorizo I eat usually
comes in very late night

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.824
burrito form.

00:13:41.824 --> 00:13:43.240
But other than
that, I really like

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.110
this thing called
a pombazo, which

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.070
is like a torta filled with
potatoes and chorizo and crema,

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.520
and then they dunk the whole
thing into this red guajillo

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.650
chili sauce.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.460
And then they'll
griddle it crispy.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.139
It's pretty delicious.

00:13:57.139 --> 00:13:58.680
You're not having
too much luck here.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.981
Let me help you out a little it.

00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:01.772
ARALYN BEAUMONT: And
where do you get that?

00:14:02.549 --> 00:14:04.840
CHRIS YING: You can get that
at a place called La Torta

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.599
Gorda, which is on 24th Street.

00:14:07.599 --> 00:14:09.140
I'm not having any
more luck, either.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.598
We're going to
pretend that worked.

00:14:10.598 --> 00:14:25.530
So basically, herbs, oregano,
cinnamon, more oregano,

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.790
for some reason.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:35.820
A little bit of ground
clove, salt, cider vinegar.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.390
And I imagine this is going
to need a little bit of water

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.548
to get it going.

00:14:40.548 --> 00:14:42.532
AUDIENCE: Chris, why is
it important to pestle

00:14:42.532 --> 00:14:44.020
before you put it in?

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.105
CHRIS YING: Ideally, I wanted
to break down the bay leaves,

00:14:47.105 --> 00:14:48.896
so it was powdered,
and it didn't get-- you

00:14:48.896 --> 00:14:50.104
didn't have big chunks of it.

00:14:50.104 --> 00:14:51.172
But we failed.

00:14:51.172 --> 00:14:52.630
In life, sometimes,
you just gotta,

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.695
like, accept your
failures and move on.

00:14:54.695 --> 00:14:56.987
You can't-- go for it, man.

00:14:56.987 --> 00:14:58.070
BRANDON CHALK: Pulse, or--

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.736
CHRIS YING: Yeah,
pulse it a little bit.

00:14:59.736 --> 00:15:00.400
[PULSING]

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.201
Nah, just go for it.

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:05.622
[GRINDING]

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:17.160
So what we're making is
this kind of spice puree

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.007
that will basically
just fold in with pork.

00:15:21.007 --> 00:15:22.465
ARALYN BEAUMONT:
Want me to get it?

00:15:22.465 --> 00:15:23.964
CHRIS YING: Will
you grab that fork?

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.762
So once this is smooth--
that seem smooth to you?

00:15:30.762 --> 00:15:31.595
BRANDON CHALK: Yeah.

00:15:31.595 --> 00:15:32.512
CHRIS YING: All right.

00:15:32.512 --> 00:15:34.595
I hope it's smooth, because
your next job is going

00:15:34.595 --> 00:15:35.855
to depend on it being smooth.

00:15:35.855 --> 00:15:36.730
We're going to push--

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.313
BRANDON CHALK: That
looks pretty good.

00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:39.024
CHRIS YING: Ooh.

00:15:39.024 --> 00:15:40.690
This is my least
favorite part, and this

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.630
is why it's helpful
to have a helper here.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.130
BRANDON CHALK: An
unassuming helper.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:44.838
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:59.360
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Chris, do you
prefer green or red chorizo?

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.222
CHRIS YING: Oh, that's
a great question.

00:16:01.222 --> 00:16:02.930
We're actually making
two chorizos today.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.820
We're making a red and
a green, which I think

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.900
is maybe less familiar
to most people.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.310
And the green is green
from fresh herbs,

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.350
and chiles, and
tomatillos, and spinach.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.272
And I hadn't really
ever seen it until we

00:16:20.272 --> 00:16:21.480
started working on this book.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.410
And I still prefer
the original "rojo"--

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.745
[LAUGHING]

00:16:26.745 --> 00:16:28.120
ARALYN BEAUMONT:
Not the "verde?"

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.650
CHRIS YING: But I also like the
"verde" for different purposes,

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.530
like green eggs and ham.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:35.830
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Oh, yeah.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:41.930
And at our favorite place north
of the city, at El Molino,

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.195
Karen Taylor uses
green chorizo a lot.

00:16:44.195 --> 00:16:45.070
CHRIS YING: Oh, yeah.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.430
Have you guys ever been to
El Molino Central on Sonoma.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.682
BRANDON CHALK: It's awesome.

00:16:50.682 --> 00:16:53.140
CHRIS YING: Have you ever seen
this brand called Primavera?

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.100
They make tortillas,
and chips, and salsa.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.750
You'll have them at Whole
Foods, and they have, like,

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.541
a stand at the Ferry
building on Saturdays.

00:16:58.541 --> 00:17:02.160
Anyways, this woman, Karen
Taylor, runs this company.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.680
And she has a restaurant
in Sonoma called El Molino

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.869
Central, where I'll be going
after this demonstration

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:10.220
for Cinco de Mayo.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.859
And it's legit, like, best
Mexican food in California,

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.109
I feel like.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:17.960
Just throwing it out there.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.910
Throwing it out there.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.160
BRANDON CHALK: You didn't
even mention the patio.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.951
That's, like, one of
the best things there.

00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:23.876
CHRIS YING: Oh, beautiful patio.

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:24.990
I'll see you guys later.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.656
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:26.656 --> 00:17:27.980
All right, so keep going.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:33.245
Why don't you scrape off here?

00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:34.620
And so, for the
purposes of this,

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.720
we're going to pretend that
you finished doing this,

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.520
and we're going to move on here.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.856
BRANDON CHALK: Perfect.

00:17:38.856 --> 00:17:39.240
ARALYN BEAUMONT:
Here, I can take that.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.656
CHRIS YING: So, basically, you
just want to get out, like,

00:17:41.656 --> 00:17:43.180
the big chunks of nonsense.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.270
Give me the-- let
me just hold this.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.200
You want to get rid of the
stringy bits of the bay leaf

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.490
that are stuck on there, any
unprocessed chunks of chile,

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.090
and things like that.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.080
And then you're going to have
this relatively smooth puree.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.850
So this is the part that I
feel like is pretty neat.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.360
You don't need the
KitchenAid attachment.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.070
You don't need a meat grinder,
or anything like that.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.340
You can really make an
[INAUDIBLE] sausage out

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.950
of your food processor.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:18.029
So pork shoulder, which you
can supplement with fat back.

00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:19.820
If you go to your
butcher and you ask them,

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.580
they're never going to
have it out for you to buy.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.540
But sausage--
generally, you know,

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:30.464
you want this percentage between
30% fat and 70% lean meat.

00:18:30.464 --> 00:18:32.130
So if your pork
shoulder's not that fat,

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.390
you can ask them for fat
back, and they'll usually

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:35.660
have some in the back.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.910
Just the other day, I bought
some, and I took it home,

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.570
and it was rotten.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:42.710
So check your fat back
before you get home.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.592
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:44.592 --> 00:18:47.320
AUDIENCE: Lesson of the day.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.440
CHRIS YING: Such an unhelpful
lesson to anybody at all.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.460
Freezing the meat
really helps when you're

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.590
doing it in a food processor.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.400
It keeps it from kind of
getting, like, squishing

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.744
instead of slicing.

00:19:01.744 --> 00:19:03.660
You'll be able to kind
of mince the meat more.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.486
You kind of want
this coarse texture

00:19:05.486 --> 00:19:07.485
to it, which is actually
the benefit of doing it

00:19:07.485 --> 00:19:09.910
in a proper grinder-- you're
going to get an even grind,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.350
an even coarseness,
according to what you want.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.195
When you do it here,
the other day, I

00:19:16.195 --> 00:19:18.772
had huge cubes of fat
left in my sausage,

00:19:18.772 --> 00:19:20.480
and other parts were
kind of just pureed.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.721
But, that's fine, because I'm
telling you do it this way.

00:19:24.721 --> 00:19:27.440
BRANDON CHALK: And how long
should you generally freeze it?

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.523
CHRIS YING: You do want
to freeze it just until it

00:19:29.523 --> 00:19:30.640
gets kind of crisp edges.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.390
BRANDON CHALK: OK.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:36.250
CHRIS YING: So not so it's hard,
but just so it's not squishy,

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.970
like my body.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.191
[PULSING]

00:19:39.191 --> 00:19:40.920
And so here's a
pulsing situation.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.580
[PULSING]

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.910
You don't want to get into the
food bolus situation, where

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.102
you've just got this
big ball spinning around

00:19:50.102 --> 00:19:51.060
in your food processor.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.420
And doing in batches also helps.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:20:00.490
So you're just trying to get
a pretty coarse grind on it.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.740
That looks pretty good, right?

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.050
I don't know.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:02.190
BRANDON CHALK: Yeah.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.280
I think it works.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.430
CHRIS YING: And here-- why
don't you do the next batch.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.055
And this is basically it.

00:20:11.055 --> 00:20:13.730
You pulse the meat until
it looks like sausage.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:15.230
Every knows what
sausage looks like.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.600
Just do it until it
looks like sausage.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.280
And then mix it
with your spice mix.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.420
Cover it, refrigerate it.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.170
Let it kind of absorb all
that flavor overnight.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.030
And then literally, that's it.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.220
Then you have chorizo.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.021
[PULSING]

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.000
Yeah, dude.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.490
Yeah, let's call it.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.990
Beautiful.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.308
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Ew. [LAUGHING]

00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.520
CHRIS YING: It's not the most
glamorous of cooking processes,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.094
but, you know-- works.

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:02.760
That's whatever.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.780
Let's just not even
do the rest of it.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.040
BRANDON CHALK: Perfect.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.248
CHRIS YING: Why don't you
mix these together by hand?

00:21:06.248 --> 00:21:07.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.790
BRANDON CHALK: Thank you, Chris.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.724
CHRIS YING: I love so much
that you volunteered for this.

00:21:14.724 --> 00:21:15.640
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Here.

00:21:18.676 --> 00:21:19.300
CHRIS YING: OK.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.660
Meanwhile, let me get
the-- you stay here.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.524
Do we have the other pork?

00:21:26.524 --> 00:21:27.024
OK.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.337
Are you not done yet?

00:21:31.337 --> 00:21:32.545
BRANDON CHALK: Uh, it's done.

00:21:32.545 --> 00:21:33.461
CHRIS YING: All right.

00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:34.100
So this is it.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.900
I mean, the rest of
the pork would kind of

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:41.161
make the proportions right,
but this is-- where am I going?

00:21:41.161 --> 00:21:41.660
Here.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:44.630
This is it.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:45.296
This is chorizo.

00:21:45.296 --> 00:21:48.200
Now you can fry it with
eggs, with potatoes,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.440
whatever-- however you
want to eat chorizo.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.940
You've made your own.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.680
You can buy quality
meat and be sort of

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.110
certain of the provenance
of where you got this.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.295
It's not from a shady place.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.180
That's chorizo.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.100
This is red chorizo.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.320
Now, let's make the green.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.560
The green is even easier,
because the meat's

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.280
already ground.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:13.863
Look at that.

00:22:13.863 --> 00:22:14.363
Perfect.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.930
So we take a chile.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.430
And have you guys ever
charred chillies on the stove?

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.080
Most people have
done this, right?

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.619
You just-- this thing work?

00:22:24.619 --> 00:22:25.410
BRANDON CHALK: Yup.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.290
It's on.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.951
CHRIS YING: All right.

00:22:27.951 --> 00:22:29.850
Like, that's it.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.270
Stick it on there.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.430
You wait until it's burnt,
until it's blackened.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.610
You turn it, you
blacken it all over.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.002
And basically, you get this.

00:22:40.002 --> 00:22:41.460
You let it kind of
cool down enough

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.640
so that you can handle it.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.931
And then all this skin is
just going to peel off really

00:22:44.931 --> 00:22:47.560
easily.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.892
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Why don't
you want the skin in there?

00:22:49.892 --> 00:22:52.440
CHRIS YING: Because it's
all papery and terrible.

00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.458
That's a good question, though.

00:22:57.458 --> 00:22:58.749
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Thanks, Chris.

00:22:58.749 --> 00:23:01.010
CHRIS YING: This is how
culinary-- next year, Grant

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.864
Achatz is going to serving,
like, poblano chile skin,

00:23:03.864 --> 00:23:06.280
and I'm going to be over here
being, like, I was an idiot.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.895
ARALYN BEAUMONT: I mean,
they might make great chips.

00:23:07.895 --> 00:23:08.920
I don't know.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.795
BRANDON CHALK: So do
you pair different beers

00:23:10.795 --> 00:23:12.540
with your green and red chorizo?

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.760
Or do you stick
to the same beer?

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.820
CHRIS YING: Uh,
I am a person who

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:23.460
likes flavorless beer
in all situations.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.170
So I don't really give too
much thought to pairing it.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.721
But do you have beers you prefer
with one versus the other?

00:23:29.721 --> 00:23:31.970
BRANDON CHALK: Well, actually,
you know, I'm visiting,

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:32.850
so I have a great--

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:33.230
CHRIS YING: Holy shit.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:36.090
BRANDON CHALK: --great corner
store right next to my hotel.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.405
So I brought some choice--

00:23:37.405 --> 00:23:37.905
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:37.905 --> 00:23:39.742
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Some classic--

00:23:39.742 --> 00:23:41.450
CHRIS YING: I feel
like I'm getting iced.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.158
Is this what it's like
when you get iced?

00:23:43.158 --> 00:23:44.930
BRANDON CHALK: No.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:48.320
That would be very rude to
do to a guest at Google.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.350
CHRIS YING: Um, yeah.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.770
ARALYN BEAUMONT: But these are
some of your favorite beers.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:51.686
CHRIS YING: Wonderful.

00:23:51.686 --> 00:23:55.650
So this is for-- the traditional
Tecate is for the red chorizo.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.567
And the Dos Equis
is for the verde.

00:23:57.567 --> 00:23:58.525
BRANDON CHALK: Perfect.

00:23:58.525 --> 00:24:00.820
CHRIS YING: Beautiful.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.410
OK.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.394
So you char chile.

00:24:02.394 --> 00:24:04.060
All right-- should
we drink these beers?

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:04.976
Is that what you want?

00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:05.874
There we go.

00:24:05.874 --> 00:24:08.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:08.900
Cheers.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.245
Cheers.

00:24:10.245 --> 00:24:10.745
Cheers.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:16.010
Ah.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.780
BRANDON CHALK:
[INAUDIBLE] was legal.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.363
It's all good.

00:24:17.363 --> 00:24:18.165
CHRIS YING: Ah.

00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:18.665
Wonderful.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:21.950
OK.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:22.769
What were we doing?

00:24:22.769 --> 00:24:24.060
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Green chorizo.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.840
BRANDON CHALK: You're
making sausages.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.570
CHRIS YING: So you char chile.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:30.480
You peel the skin off
into the processor.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.360
Take a whole bunch of cilantro.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.340
Break off just the
very end of it.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.270
I'm not kidding.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.390
This is Rick Bayliss'
method, not mine.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.600
Don't blame me.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.350
Serrano chilies-- you can
always go less if you want.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:54.250
But basically, just take off
the stems, and then into-- guys,

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:59.175
we gotta sharpen our knives
here-- into the processor.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.204
Have at it, dude.

00:25:03.204 --> 00:25:07.470
[PULSING]

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:13.730
BRANDON CHALK: So in the
creation of the book,

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.650
you guys travel to a
lot of different places.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:20.354
Do you have any memorable
stories about eating sausages?

00:25:20.354 --> 00:25:22.270
CHRIS YING: Memorable
sausage eating stories--

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.110
there are two travel
logs in that book,

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.850
in fact, that I
wrote specifically

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:31.200
about eating sausages,
both in Southeast Asia

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:38.430
and in Mitteleuropa, by which I
mean Germany, Austria, France.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.077
What just happened?

00:25:40.077 --> 00:25:41.410
BRANDON CHALK: I think I did it.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.368
CHRIS YING: Keep going.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.640
No-- what's
interesting is that we

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.960
eat so much sausage
in the States,

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.140
but there's not a culture
around eating sausages

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.535
in the way there is sort of
in beer halls in Germany,

00:25:59.535 --> 00:26:03.360
or, you know, in Alsace
region of France,

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.080
where it's such a
part of what you do.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.500
You go specifically out
to eat choucroute garnie.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.820
You go to a beer hall.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.210
You have sausages and beer.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.210
And we love that-- I mean,
we've got restaurants

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.660
built around that idea.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.031
But it's not something we do.

00:26:16.031 --> 00:26:16.530
So

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.850
So there were a lot of kind
of really memorable moments

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:19.350
for me.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.040
There was a-- oh, that's good.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.420
We were in this little
town called Miesbach,

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.690
which is known for Weisswurst
which is a white sausage,

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.960
like an emulsified sausage.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.490
And one of our interns put
together kind of a guide

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:36.740
for me.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.840
Put that in here.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.700
And he was like,
when you get there,

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.830
make sure you eat Weisswurst.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:47.320
And the way you do it
is, you pop off one end,

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.020
as though it's a
cigar, and then you

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:54.550
zuzel the sausage, which means
you put it in your mouth,

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.550
and you suck the meat
out of the casing.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.250
And we were sitting
here in this restaurant,

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.160
being like, this fucking
intern is just, like,

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.880
having a laugh at our expense.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.070
He wants us all-- like,
these dumb Americans

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.227
to be sitting in this tiny
town, sucking sausage meat out

00:27:12.227 --> 00:27:12.810
of this thing.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.580
And I look over,
and this old dude,

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.880
like, drinking a beer at 9
am, was zuzeling his sausage.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.280
And I was like, holy
shit, this is amazing.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.610
So anyway, that's
one interesting st--

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:23.790
AUDIENCE: Did you do it?

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.140
CHRIS YING: I did it.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.840
It's like-- I feel like I burst
a vein in my temple trying

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.460
to suck the meat out.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.600
And it was just not pretty.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.270
All right.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.480
So this sausage-- the green
chorizo's even easier.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.760
Like you saw, this
is spinach powder,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.040
which is basically dehydrated,
powderized spinach.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.129
You can buy this on Amazon,
or-- that's OK for you guys

00:27:46.129 --> 00:27:47.420
to buy things on Amazon, right?

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.616
Even though we're at Google.

00:27:48.616 --> 00:27:49.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.340
Google Shopping,
or whatever it is.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:01.510
And herbs, chiles, and
then pre-ground pork.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.980
Ready to get dirty again?

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.335
BRANDON CHALK: I am.

00:28:03.335 --> 00:28:04.390
CHRIS YING: And that's
it-- that's green chorizo.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:05.930
You just mix it in there.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.962
Let it sit overnight.

00:28:07.962 --> 00:28:09.550
And that's the
whole entire thing.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:14.704
You've got this really
brilliant green sausage.

00:28:14.704 --> 00:28:17.120
BRANDON CHALK: So speaking of
zuzeling and getting dirty--

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.470
CHRIS YING: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:18.540
All right, here we go.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.998
BRANDON CHALK: You
must have plenty

00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:21.875
of good sausage innuendos.

00:28:21.875 --> 00:28:22.750
CHRIS YING: Oh, yeah.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.650
This book is full of
sausage innuendos.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:25.885
I mean, it was just like--

00:28:25.885 --> 00:28:27.260
BRANDON CHALK: So
I think we have

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.676
a pretty raunchy crowd that
might want to hear one or two.

00:28:29.676 --> 00:28:31.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.922
CHRIS YING: The thing is,
there's no subtle joke

00:28:33.922 --> 00:28:36.130
to make about sau-- like,
sausage looks like a penis.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.940
All right, that's about it.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.740
Goes into a bun, which
looks like a butt--

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.440
I don't know-- there's nothing
subtle about sausage humor.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:55.510
Aralyn is the new, young
face of "Lucky Peach"--

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:58.040
the modern, enlightened woman.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.260
And I'm just like the caveman
vestige, where I'm just like,

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.900
ha ha, penises are so funny.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:07.800
So the book-- our
publisher's really sweet,

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.585
and didn't ask us to pull back
at all on the dick and poop

00:29:11.585 --> 00:29:12.085
humor.

00:29:12.085 --> 00:29:13.260
Oh, it also looks like poo.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.190
ARALYN BEAUMONT:
In all varieties.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:19.273
CHRIS YING: All varieties.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.260
But my own staff
was like, I think

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:27.331
we need ease up with the
dick and poop jokes, dude.

00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:27.830
There it is!

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:28.538
You made sausage!

00:29:28.538 --> 00:29:29.900
You made two kinds of sausage.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:30.000
BRANDON CHALK: I have.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.240
In what-- 15 minutes?

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.330
CHRIS YING: In 15 minutes.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.340
BRANDON CHALK: I'm quitting.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.650
CHRIS YING: So that's it.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.017
That's the green chorizo.

00:29:38.017 --> 00:29:38.600
What do we do?

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.370
Hold it up to this one again?

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:43.400
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Put it
in front of your face.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.270
CHRIS YING: It looks so good.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.440
Yeah, so that's it.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.940
So the book has recipes for
really easy sausages like this.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.190
It has recipes for
cased sausages.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.520
And then a whole slew of
things to do with hot dogs

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.569
and sausages, as well
as, like, there's

00:29:57.569 --> 00:29:59.110
a great recipe for
pancakes in there,

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.150
because pigs in a
blanket, you know.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.945
Like, you need a good,
solid pancake recipe.

00:30:03.945 --> 00:30:06.620
Hot dog chili.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.200
But yeah, I really hope
people will read this book

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.220
and appreciate the kind of
dorky sense of wonderment

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.930
we have about sausage
and about exploring how

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.660
it's eaten around the world.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.322
What else did I miss, Aralyn?

00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:24.780
ARALYN BEAUMONT:
There's some rants

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.238
throughout the
book, where you will

00:30:26.238 --> 00:30:28.670
learn how you should
and should not eat

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:32.030
sausage-- or hot dogs, really.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.665
BRANDON CHALK: Ketchup.

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:35.290
CHRIS YING: I got a
real problem with--

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.510
BRANDON CHALK: Should I bring
my fancy ketchup out right now?

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.090
CHRIS YING: Oh my god.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.006
What is in that bag you
have over there, dude?

00:30:40.006 --> 00:30:40.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.870
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Maybe
it'll convert you.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:42.940
Maybe you should try it.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.580
CHRIS YING: Do you have
some kind of fancy ketchup?

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.330
BRANDON CHALK: No.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.560
I hate fancy ketchup, too.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.340
ARALYN BEAUMONT: I thought
you were being serious.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:47.460
CHRIS YING: I appreciate it.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.293
There's a thing in the
book about-- everyone

00:30:49.293 --> 00:30:53.090
wants me to bring this up,
but I hate homemade ketchup.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.340
I find, when you go to a
restaurant, and they're like,

00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:00.050
served with our house-made curry
ketchup, I just want to leave.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:02.910
I don't find any
ketchup ever made

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.010
to be better than Heinz ketchup.

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:11.280
And if I want curry powder all
over my ketchup-- oh my God,

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.200
sorry-- I'll do it myself.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:19.338
So anyway, you'll find all that
kind of good stuff in the book.

00:31:19.338 --> 00:31:21.992
You guys have questions?

00:31:21.992 --> 00:31:23.450
Nobody ever wants
to ask questions,

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:24.623
but-- oh my god,
I was just going

00:31:24.623 --> 00:31:26.248
to say, wait, I have
like a whole thing

00:31:26.248 --> 00:31:27.881
to encourage you
to ask questions.

00:31:27.881 --> 00:31:29.380
If you ask a question,
I'll give you

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.930
one of these cool
bonus fun books

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.183
we made to go with "The
Wurst of Lucky Peach."

00:31:33.183 --> 00:31:34.058
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Wow.

00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:34.506
Wow.

00:31:34.506 --> 00:31:36.047
CHRIS YING: There's
only two of them.

00:31:36.047 --> 00:31:38.550
And there's also all these
stickers, which you can get,

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.050
too.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.110
ARALYN BEAUMONT: Great
car bumper stickers.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.610
AUDIENCE: So I love
chorizo, but it's always

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.650
so greasy and oily
when it's served.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:46.450
Why is that?

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.440
Is it just-- they don't
drain it out of the pan

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.050
when you're cooking?

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.341
CHRIS YING: Yeah, I mean,
chorizo's one of these things

00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:56.920
that-- it's just a high
fat percentage sausage.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.136
You know, they'll
cook it often times,

00:31:59.136 --> 00:32:01.260
like when it's cooked at
a tacqueria or something--

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.420
it's on a big flat top,
and so a lot of that fat

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.370
is going to drain out.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.800
But one of the benefits
of making your own

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.400
is you kind of control how much
fat you have in your chorizo.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.890
So I bought the kind of super,
super cheap, shitty brands

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.887
of chorizo with a little
pig, like, eating himself

00:32:18.887 --> 00:32:19.970
on the label, or whatever.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.590
And it comes in a plastic tube.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:25.385
And you put it in the pan,
and it just melts into liquid.

00:32:25.385 --> 00:32:26.760
I know what you're
talking about.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.509
It's really fatty.

00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:30.590
But, again, this one--
it's just pork shoulder,

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.380
so it's as much fat as
there is in pork shoulder.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.750
So, yeah.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.990
Go give her a fun book.

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.880
AUDIENCE: So during
this trip, what

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.530
was the sausage that ended
up being your favorite--

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.727
that you couldn't stop?

00:32:47.727 --> 00:32:48.685
CHRIS YING: In Germany.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.970
So I've had a lot of
cheese sausages in my life,

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.129
and I always find them to
be pretty disappointing.

00:32:59.129 --> 00:33:01.170
Because it's like, this
is a blue cheese sausage,

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.500
and you can't really tell--
doesn't mean anything.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.583
It just means, like,
somebody ate some blue cheese

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.820
while they were making
your sausage, or whatever.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.130
But in Germany-- I
think specifically,

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:15.180
we were in Munich.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.610
And I think it's actually
an Austrian sausage called

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.060
the Kasekrainer, which
is a cheese sausage.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.740
And we sliced into it,
and was sort of again

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.150
disappointed-- I was like,
oh, there's no cheese in here.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:29.000
And then miraculously, sort of
out of these invisible pores,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.090
all this melted cheese started
oozing out of the sausage.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:34.990
And it was the most
incredible thing.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:40.220
And I asked Eli Cairo
from Olympia Provisions

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.410
sort of about how it's made.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.493
And it all has to do with
kind of the temperature,

00:33:43.493 --> 00:33:45.600
and making sure you
are mixing this sausage

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.590
at a really cold temperature,
so the cheese doesn't distribute

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:50.470
into the meat.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:51.560
But that was amazing.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.350
I couldn't get enough of that.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:57.330
It was the best cheese
sausage I'd ever had.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.750
So, yeah.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:00.800
I don't know.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.050
Anybody else want a sticker?

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:04.010
Was a great question?

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:07.360
AUDIENCE: I want to know
about "Lucky Peach."

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.380
Are you planning on
taking over the world?

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:13.592
What's the next
step in domination?

00:34:13.592 --> 00:34:14.300
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.300
So, I mean, "Lucky
Peach" started, honestly,

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.872
as this crazy little whim
that three of us had.

00:34:18.872 --> 00:34:20.330
We thought we could
make a magazine

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:24.150
and just focus on the
things that we thought

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.310
were funny and interesting.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.550
And it turned out that
a lot of other people

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.960
found the same things
interesting as we did.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.969
Like I said, originally, we
were going to do "101 Easy Asian

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:36.742
Recipes" as a joke.

00:34:36.742 --> 00:34:38.200
But once we found
this audience, it

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.900
was kind of like, now we
should do this for real.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.850
So cookbooks-- we
went five years

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:49.250
without a proper website,
which I don't think

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.880
was smart in retrospect.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.600
But we're rebuilding
our website.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.010
Yeah, we're trying to grow it.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:35:01.310
And in the way that we
try to make the magazine

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:05.240
this big lush object
that people want to save,

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.300
we kind of want to play to
the forms that we expand to.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.960
So when we do digital
things, we hope

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.440
that we're not just online
for the sake of being online.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.530
You know, we're not just
making a "Lucky Peach" app,

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.090
because everyone
else has an app.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:26.720
So, yeah-- very slow domination
of a tiny corner of the world

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.541
is our plan.

00:35:28.541 --> 00:35:29.290
You got questions?

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:30.123
BRANDON CHALK: Yeah.

00:35:30.123 --> 00:35:32.340
Of course I have questions.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.870
So you had mentioned that
"The Wurst of Lucky Peach"

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:37.760
is the first of a series of
single-subject cookbooks.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.784
What other--

00:35:38.784 --> 00:35:39.700
CHRIS YING: Oh my God.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.310
This guy's the best.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:42.520
Brandon's the best.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.580
So our very next book is
called "All About Eggs."

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.660
And I think the
subtitle I came up

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.070
was like, "Everything We
Know about the World's Most

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.730
Important Food."

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:54.605
So it'll be eggs-- will be next.

00:35:54.605 --> 00:35:56.480
And then after that,
it's kind of in the air.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.040
I would love to do more books
in the way of those "Time Life"

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.127
books, where you sort of study
certain cuisines of the world.

00:36:05.127 --> 00:36:07.710
My mom has been bothering me to
do a book about-- she's always

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:09.606
like, Chris, do a
book about coconut.

00:36:09.606 --> 00:36:13.127
And I'm like, Mom, no one
gives a shit about coconut.

00:36:13.127 --> 00:36:15.210
ARALYN BEAUMONT: But you're
realizing she's right.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.130
CHRIS YING: I know, right?

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:17.130
ARALYN BEAUMONT: The
more you think about it--

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:17.830
BRANDON CHALK: Like,
coconut water--

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.150
I feel like that's
gotten really big

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.110
in the last couple of years.

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:20.885
CHRIS YING: Yeah,
coconut water and curry.

00:36:20.885 --> 00:36:23.380
Everyone loves curry,
so-- stupid moms.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.990
ARALYN BEAUMONT:
Coconut desserts.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.480
CHRIS YING: Coconut desserts?

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.594
My god.

00:36:29.594 --> 00:36:30.885
BRANDON CHALK: Coconut ketchup.

00:36:30.885 --> 00:36:32.444
CHRIS YING: No coconut ketchup.

00:36:32.444 --> 00:36:34.360
But yeah, that's sort
of next on the pipeline.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.120
I don't know.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.530
It's a fun thing, because
just like with sausages,

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:42.280
you think it's this very
specific, narrow topic.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:46.340
And then you kind of realize
that having these constraints

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.940
lets you be more
creative in how you

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.930
approach a subject, how you come
up with things to talk about.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.360
So yeah, I don't know-- I'm
looking forward to other books.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.110
AUDIENCE: So you claimed
to not be a chef,

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:59.470
but what got you into this
food space in general?

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:02.910
Was it parents cooking,
or something else?

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.490
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:11.790
I personally grew up in a
little bit of a food family.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.790
My mom owned a Mexican
restaurant and two ice cream

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.880
stores.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.325
But I think a lot of
first generation--

00:37:19.325 --> 00:37:20.960
am I first generation?

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.700
Whatever generation
of Asian person

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.520
I am-- I think a lot of us
sort of realized in the last 10

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.760
or 15 years-- the way we
grew up, the things we ate,

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.900
the familiar ways that
we ate with our families,

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:39.040
had some kind of value
or interest to people.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.830
And when I got to
college, I sort of

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:44.456
started sharing some of the
things that I ate as a kid,

00:37:44.456 --> 00:37:46.580
with my roommates and
friends and things like that.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.340
And I cooked in a restaurant
for four or five years.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:55.260
I helped open Mission Street
Food and Mission Chinese Food.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.510
But I never really
wanted these two worlds

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.830
to come together--
the writing thing

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:02.450
I was doing at this
company called McSweeney's,

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.800
and the food stuff.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.600
And then I met Dave
Chang and Peter Meehan,

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.480
and they kind of
convinced me to do this.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.540
And now I'm here making
chorizo for people at Google.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.820
And I just, like, I
don't know what happened.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.520
At some point, everything
went off the rails,

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.340
and now I do this.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.110
But yeah, no-- I mean, I
think that for me, it's

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:27.940
been a really long process
of-- or really, fortunate

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:33.100
process-- that me
discovering what food meant

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.150
to me as a person coincided
with everyone kind of starting

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:38.840
to care more about food
and paying attention

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.320
to how food plays into
our own American culture.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.040
So yeah.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.150
All right.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.020
Any last questions?

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.045
Do you want a sticker?

00:38:48.045 --> 00:38:49.092
Give the man a sticker.

00:38:52.381 --> 00:38:52.880
All right.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.935
Well, here we go.

00:38:53.935 --> 00:38:54.435
Question.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.310
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
made weird sausage stuff?

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:04.340
Like the ones with
intestines inside?

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.340
CHRIS YING: Have I ever
made weird sausage stuff

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.806
with intestines inside?

00:39:07.806 --> 00:39:08.798
AUDIENCE: Or whater.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.610
CHRIS YING: I've not personally
made the crazy, crazy sausages,

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.780
that are like-- there are
sausages, like she said,

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:24.120
that are intestines stuffed with
more intestines and other organ

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.830
meats, and really just
made from the off-cuts

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:27.720
and things like that.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.400
And andouillette is made
from the lower intestine,

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.437
and is kind of prized for how
poopy it smells and tastes.

00:39:35.437 --> 00:39:36.770
I haven't made too much of that.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:42.490
But I've been making sausage
since I was in college,

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.470
and really found
it to be rewarding,

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.574
once you have kind of a rough
formula for what goes in it.

00:39:48.574 --> 00:39:50.240
You can just sort of
mess around and put

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.364
whatever you want in there.

00:39:51.364 --> 00:39:55.040
So at Thanksgiving time,
I make a turkey sausage

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.910
with green Szechuan
peppercorn and all this, like,

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:00.750
funky-- it's really tingly,
and numbing, and spicy.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:04.410
And that was just kind
of pulled out of nowhere.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:05.970
So it's fun to just do whatever.

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.670
And that's in the book.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:10.699
AUDIENCE: So out of all the
ones that you make at home

00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:12.490
for your own personal
use, which one do you

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.086
find you making the most of?

00:40:17.135 --> 00:40:19.910
CHRIS YING: I would
say, because I make it

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:23.170
on such a consistent basis,
that sort of weird Thanksgiving

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:28.740
turkey tingling sausage is
the one I make most regularly.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.531
And I have this whole
break down system.

00:40:31.531 --> 00:40:33.530
I describe it in the book,
too, where it's like,

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.654
one turkey breast goes
here, another one goes here,

00:40:35.654 --> 00:40:37.260
and then the legs go this way.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.380
So Thanksgiving
turkey at my house

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.290
is like a weird smorgasbord.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:45.537
Other than that,
the loose sausages

00:40:45.537 --> 00:40:47.120
are the easiest and
most approachable.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.910
So you can make
them super often.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.846
You're going to make this over
and over and over again now.

00:40:51.846 --> 00:40:55.010
You know, you can make
breakfast sausage really easily.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:58.502
Those are probably the
most approachable ones.

00:40:58.502 --> 00:40:59.074
Yeah.

00:40:59.074 --> 00:40:59.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.300
Thank you very much.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.450
CHRIS YING: Thanks, guys.
