[Music]


00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.490
JAEWON: I'm Jaewon.


00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.250
I'm a physics major, and I'm
doing a certificate in visual

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.130
arts, and my show, entitled
"Frogs and Forms," is

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.380
opening next week.


00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.520 position:97%
 


00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.260
I'm constantly back and forth
from sort of freaking out and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.290
feeling really excited
about it.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.620
But at the same time, I'm trying
to remind myself how

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.340
happy I am to be
able to paint.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:00.780 position:97%
 


00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.840
This painting that I'm working
on right now is the biggest

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.710
painting that I've
made so far.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.700
EVE ASCHHEIM: It's a very
ambitious show.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.880
The paintings are not only
large, but they're challenging

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.150
in terms of the subject
matter.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.530
I think her work deals with
sexuality and its different

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.690
forms. For example, aggression,
intimacy,

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.900
voyeurism, exhibitionism,
the uncomfortableness.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.830
Her paintings are
confrontational, they're

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.680
arresting, but they're also
personal and intimate.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.710
You have the feeling the
figures are inhabited.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.560
They're not merely objects
that are sort of for the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.520
viewer's consumption,
but they have some

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.740
of their own volition.


00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.490
I think it's a really
interesting moment where young

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.200
women can determine how
they want images of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.450
themselves to appear.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.930
LYMAN PAGE: So we just heard the
critique of Jaewon's work.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.490
People say what they want to
say, and their impressions,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.930
and their thoughts, and their
critiques are all over the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.610
place, and emphasizing
different things.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.340
Whereas in Physics,
it's much more--

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.930
is it correct or is
it incorrect?

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.200
JAEWON: I absolutely love
studying physics at Princeton.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.660
It is not any less beautiful
than art.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.650
LYMAN PAGE: Her thesis is about
the light that's left

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.820
over from the birth
of the universe.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.820
Actually, the light she's
studying for the Physics side

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.920
of her thesis, we can't
see with our eyes.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.550
By far the most rewarding thing
is working individually

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.840
with students.


00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.100
It's just fun, because students
are so open, and do

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.280
everything, and can
do anything.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.310
EVE ASCHHEIM: Being a young
person and discovering

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.760
something for the first time,
and being able to make

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.990
something that's never been
made before, is a very

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.400
exciting moment.


00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.640
It's exciting to
be part of it.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.880
It is one of the joys
of my life.
