00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.730
- [Instructor] Let's
discuss interest groups

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.100
and as you can see here, it
is one of the three parts

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.060
of the iron triangle that we first studied

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.010
when we looked at the bureaucracy
in the executive branch.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.110
And the whole point of the
iron triangle is to show

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.230
how these different parties
can influence each other.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.300
And so just as a reminder,
an interest group

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.610
is any collection of folks who organize

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.630
in order to advocate for
something in public policy.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.360
This could be groups of corporations.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.120
It could represent an industry.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.300
It could represent a social cause.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.790
And we're going to look at
some major interest groups

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.710
in the United States in a few minutes,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.810
but some can be quite large
and some can be quite small.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.210
But what you see from the iron triangle

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.690
is how these parties can
influence each other.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.250
An interest group can
give electoral support

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.950
to a member of Congress
by getting its members

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.250
to go out and vote for
that member of Congress,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.290
or maybe even doing advertising
for that member of Congress

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.740
or giving direct financial support.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.500
In exchange, they might
get friendly legislation

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.140
and oversight, and that'll happen

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.450
because a congressperson
who got that support

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.000
from the interest group
might have a friendly ear

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.720
to that interest group and might be open

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.580
to hanging out with lobbyists
from that interest group.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.580
The term lobbyist, or lobbying
is believed to originate

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.240
in 17th century England where people

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.750
who wanted to influence
members of Parliament

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.910
would hang out in the lobby
of the parliamentary building

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.310
waiting to talk to those
members of Parliament.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.720
And that's what essentially
lobbyists do today.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.360
They try to meet with congresspeople

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.180
or meet with the staff of congresspeople

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.900
and try to influence the types of bills

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.500
that are introduced to
Congress for consideration

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.560
and how various members
should vote for those bills.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.310
Now bureaucracy, these are the folks

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.700
who for the most part are doing the work

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.970
of actually running the government

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.880
and they have influence
and they can dictate

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.820
what regulations are going to be,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.470
who gets various contracts,
and so you can imagine

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.560
that might be of interest
to interest groups.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.150
Now to make tangible what some
of these interest groups are,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.340
you have entities like the AFL-CIO,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.350
which stands for the
American Federation of Labor,

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.320
Congress of Industrial Organizations.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.420
And this is a meta organization
of a bunch of labor unions

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.190
and as you can imagine
they are going to advocate

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.790
for labor-friendly policies.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.020
It might be things that favor
the manufacturing industry

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.410
or that favor employees' rights
to collectively negotiate

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.550
with their employer.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.230
It might be advocating for trade policies,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.280
which would be perceived as more friendly

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.890
to the American worker.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.940
Its membership is roughly
12.5 million people

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.790
and so just getting them out to vote

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.070
can have a significant
influence on elections.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.060
You have groups like the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.820
and what's interesting
here, this membership

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.920
of over 300,000, this
isn't just individuals.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.350
This includes corporations.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.710
Even though the Chamber of Commerce

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.330
does not have the biggest
budget of the groups

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.190
we're gonna look at, it
is actually consistently

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.000
the biggest lobbying group,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.750
spending most of this money on lobbying.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.520
And they're going to try to advocate

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.650
for business-friendly
policies in our government.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.730
You have groups that
advocate for social causes

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.750
like the NAACP, they
don't have a huge budget

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.640
but they are considered
very, very influential

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.040
when it comes to issues
surrounding minority rights.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.960
You also have very influential groups

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.200
like the National Rifle Association.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.850
And when we compare the NRA
to some of these other groups

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.450
it's interesting to think
about the number of issues

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.370
they concentrate their efforts on.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.400
For example, the Chamber of Commerce

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.780
might be thinking about a very broad array

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.150
of policy decisions that
might affect commerce,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.730
that might affect businesses,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.390
while the National Rifle
Association and its members,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.450
and this is a significant membership here,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.470
is likely to be much more
focused on a narrower set

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.800
of issues around gun
rights and gun ownership.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.160
You have the American Medical Association,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.430
which despite its relatively
small membership here

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.070
is highly, highly influential
because these 240,000 people

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.820
are for the most part physicians,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.840
who many of us are very
used to listening to.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.580
You have the American Association
for Retired Professionals

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.800
which has a membership
of 37 million people

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.540
and a budget of 1.6 billion.

00:04:26.118 --> 00:04:28.510
So these entities can be very large

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.450
and very, very influential.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.650
Now as I mentioned, not
all of these dollars

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.800
go directly to lobbying.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.150
They could be spending
money on voter education.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.470
They could be spending
money on legal funds

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.530
to advocate for cases that
are in their interest.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.820
They could be giving direct support

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.640
to various candidates
or to various parties.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.830
They could be advertising in
the media for their cause.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.120
But if we think about directly lobbying,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.910
this chart right over
here is quite interesting.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.110
It comes from OpenSecrets.org
and if you're really intrigued

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.730
by understanding more of
how money and influence

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.760
come together in American politics

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.720
I encourage you to go to their site.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.540
But this is a list in
2017 of the top spenders

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.690
in lobbying in the United
States, and as I mentioned

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.360
you see here at the top the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.320
at $82 million, and
this isn't even the most

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.540
they've ever spent in a year.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.410
There's some years where it
is well over $150 million

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.400
that they've spent.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.130
The National Association of Realtors,

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.970
the Business Roundtable,
Pharmaceutical Research

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.220
and Manufacturers of America.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.400
And this money is, for the
most part, to pay lobbyists

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.890
who will meet with
members of our government

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.020
to directly advocate for certain policies.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.470
Now an interesting thing to think about is

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.230
what positive things might
be done by interest groups,

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.700
and what potentially negative
things might be there

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.930
and how equitable is this system?

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.990
The positive things, folks
could argue, are hey,

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.040
they could work on voter education.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.730
Many issues that policy
makers are trying to decide on

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.730
are quite complex, so it might be good

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.860
to have experts weighing
in, but on the other hand,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.860
it might seem like money is
disproportionately influential

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.640
and that industries that
generate a lot of money

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.630
could have a disproportionate
amount of influence

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.980
and they could potentially
use that influence

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.710
to further benefit those industries

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.890
to give them even more
power and influence.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.183
So I will let you decide.
