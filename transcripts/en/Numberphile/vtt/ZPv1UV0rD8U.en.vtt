00:00:03.276 --> 00:00:04.700
STEVE MOULD: I'm Steve Mould.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.660
And I think we should stop using
pi and start using tau.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.980
MATT PARKER: And I'm
Matt Parker.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.620
And I think Steve said
something ridiculous.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.150
I think pi is fantastic.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.710
It's wonderful.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.790
And even if this was an equal
race, we would've been using

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.130
both of them.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.730
Or even if tau had been
established first, I'm still

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.430
pretty pro-pi.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.890
STEVE MOULD: Wow, that's
quite a claim.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.590
MATT PARKER: Yes, there's
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.450
STEVE MOULD: So let's
talk about this.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.036
So pi is the circle constant.

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:30.560
It's the constant that
defines a circle.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.250
And the argument is--

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.650
MATT PARKER: We're
agreed so far.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.780
[RINGING]

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.455
STEVE MOULD: Let's think of a
reasonable definition of what

00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:35.980
a circle is.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.720
The classic is all points
equidistant

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.470
from a single point.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.190
That distance is the radius.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.160
And if you're ever doing maths
using circles, you talk about

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.740
the radius.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.665
All your equations about circles
talk about the radius.

00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:53.600
Unless you're an engineer,
you use diameter.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.970
But as a mathematician,
you use the radius.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.900
The circle constant should
surely be defined in terms of

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.235
the radius.

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:00.490
[RINGING]

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.180
STEVE MOULD: But it isn't pi--

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.230
is the circumference
divided by the

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.250
diameter, which is crazy.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.890
So the circle constant should
be the circumference divided

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.840
by the radius.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.760
When you do that, you
get 2 times pi.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.080
[RINGING]

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.650
STEVE MOULD: And so we're not
saying let's redefine pi and

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.870
call it 6.28.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.560
But instead--

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.820
MATT PARKER: Wow.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.280
STEVE MOULD: --we're saying--

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.820
[RINGING]

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.710
STEVE MOULD: Shut up.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.295
Instead, we're saying that's
going to be confusing, so

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:25.830
let's invent a new constant.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.595
And we'll call it tau.

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:28.930
MATT PARKER: To be honest, one
of the points was quite nice,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.220
which is that if you're an
engineer, you use pi.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.620
And in fact, historically, we've
used pi because when you

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.510
measure a circle, the only
direct measurement you can

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.460
make is of the diameter.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.790
[RINGING]

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.320
MATT PARKER: And so that's why
historically we've done that.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.480
And to this day in precision
engineering we do that.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.010
And yes, you can do some
very nice maths with

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.300
the radius in a circle.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.730
But the only thing
you can directly

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.990
measure is the diameter.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.070
So that's why we've used pi.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.130
People say, oh, but we have
to put 2 pi into lots of

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.230
equations, and then
blah, blah, blah.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.280
It's always 2 pi.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.270
Why don't we just
use tau instead?

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.900
There are as many fantastic
equations out there which use

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.790
just the single pi.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.654
And there's no reason
to bring in 2 pi.

00:02:09.654 --> 00:02:10.080
[RINGING]

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.780
MATT PARKER: And so I see
Steve is holding a pen.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.730
But I have brought my own.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.590
STEVE MOULD: [CHUCKLING].

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.520
MATT PARKER: So everyone's
classic is the e to the i pi

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.240
job, where e to the i
pi plus 1 equals 0.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.605
[RINGING]

00:02:22.605 --> 00:02:25.280
MATT PARKER: And that is
using a solitary pi

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.100
out the front there.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.070
And if you want to go
wild, things like

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.340
the area of a torus--

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.170
this is a nice one-- that
equals pi squared--

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.470
[RINGING]

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.200
MATT PARKER: --outside the major
radius squared minus the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.430
minor radius squared.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.040
So I'm still doing things
in terms of

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.950
radiuses or radii or whatever.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.615
But the pi squared--
that's lovely.

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:46.645
What-- you want 4?

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:47.560
I mean, how you are going to--

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.020
STEVE MOULD: Yeah, I want--

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.710
MATT PARKER: Tau squared on 4?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.290
STEVE MOULD: What-- yeah,
absolutely-- tau squared on 4.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.400
And I'll explain why.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.660
And this is important.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.323
OK, let's just say that Matt has
cherry-picked a couple of

00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:57.010
nice equations there.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.620
Two things I'd say-- let's look
at, for example, the area

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.700
of a circle.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.990
So we're looking at the
area pi r squared.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.350
MATT PARKER: That's
just lovely.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.740
Look at that.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.136
[RINGING]

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:08.520
STEVE MOULD: Yeah, OK-- but
here's the problem.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.210
Here's the problem.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.630
If we reframe that in
tau, that would

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.060
be tau by 2 r squared.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.130
And you think, OK, that's
less beautiful.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.815
But this tells us something
important.

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:22.140
[RINGING]

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.950
STEVE MOULD: This tells
us something.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.100
This is information that you're
obscuring by using pi.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.860
Because you can derive
the area--

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.860
MATT PARKER: By simplifying
your--

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.260
[RINGING]

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.580
STEVE MOULD: No, listen.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.710
You can derive the area of
a circle by integrating.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.140
[RINGING]

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.010
STEVE MOULD: So you say, OK,
here's our full circle.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.330
Let's look at the area of this
little strip where the width

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.070
of it is delta r.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.260
And this is r going up.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.330
And so this is full
r or whatever.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.780
So you integrate.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.998
The area of this is pi r dr.

00:03:55.998 --> 00:03:57.342
MATT PARKER: Tau.

00:03:57.342 --> 00:03:58.620
STEVE MOULD: No, but--

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.420
sorry, tau, yeah, actually.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.820
[RINGING]

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.945
MATT PARKER: See, pi's
just easier to use.

00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:03.830
STEVE MOULD: Shut up.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.560
And then you end up with
1/2 tau r squared.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.850
[RINGING]

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.390
STEVE MOULD: And so that 1/2
tells you something.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.090
It tells you you've done an
integration to get there.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.350
[RINGING]

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.116
STEVE MOULD: And an equation
like this obscures it.

00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:16.474
Similarly, with this, if you had
tau squared over 4, that

00:04:16.474 --> 00:04:17.810
would tell you something.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.079
This equation here-- let's
just reframe that.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.510
e to the i tau minus
1 equals 0.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.740
[RINGING]

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.030
STEVE MOULD: And the great
thing is that is a full

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.350
circle, right?

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.920
If you want to go through half a
circle, then it's e to the i

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.380
tau over 2.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.120
If you want to go a quarter
of a circle, it's e to

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.900
the i tau by 4.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.200
[RINGING]

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.380
STEVE MOULD: The pi
is confusing.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.975
It's especially confusing
for children when

00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:43.120
they're learning as well.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.840
A full circle is 2 pi?

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.030
OK, so that half
a circle is pi.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.540
A quarter of a circle
is pi by 2.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.590
So there's always this
factor of 2--

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.945
[RINGING]

00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:55.670
STEVE MOULD: --that you've got
to keep in your mind when

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.270
you're doing calculations.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.580
And actually, if you're a
seasoned mathematician, you're

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.800
probably always thinking in
terms of 2 pi, anyway.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.210
[RINGING]

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.390
STEVE MOULD: And so let's just
stop thinking in terms of 2 pi

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.360
and start thinking
in terms of tau.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.160
MATT PARKER: This is the
hypocrisies of tau.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.350
You want halves here.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.640
You don't want halves
over there.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.160
[RINGING]

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.620
STEVE MOULD: I want halves here
because the half tells

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.880
you something.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.020
[RINGING]

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.290
MATT PARKER: This works
out just as nicely.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.160
Because if you want to
integrate, and you've got your

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.910
2 pi r dr, then you
get a wonderful

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.960
thing you can simplify.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.550
Because you end up with
this-- r squared--

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.750
STEVE MOULD: Yeah, so in
this particular case--

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.770
MATT PARKER: --and you
end up with a--

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.930
[RINGING]

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.070
STEVE MOULD: So in this
particular case--

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.710
MATT PARKER: --2 pi and
the 1/2 simplifies.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.010
[RINGING]

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.310
STEVE MOULD: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.730
MATT PARKER: Pi r--
that's just--

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.220
there's nowhere else in maths
where you say, you know what?

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.100
Let's not simplify it.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.080
Let's leave it in a more
complicated form because it--

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.860
STEVE MOULD: No, but in fact,
this is the one case where you

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.420
think, actually it's useful to
have a 2 there because we can

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.300
cancel later.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.740
Most other cases you don't get
to do that cancel because

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.050
you're not dividing
by 2 later on.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.330
[RINGING]

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.150
STEVE MOULD: In most cases, you
end up with an equation

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.370
that's got 2 pi in it.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.480
BRADY HARAN: A lot of smart
people, who I know you

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.970
respect-- and I know
you respect the guy

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.970
sitting next to you--

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:57.370
STEVE MOULD: [CHUCKLING].

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.115
BRADY HARAN: --make the case--

00:05:58.115 --> 00:05:58.560
STEVE MOULD: That's correct.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.450
MATT PARKER: Professionally.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.895
BRADY HARAN: A lot of smart
people make the case for tau.

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:02.675
MATT PARKER: Yeah.

00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:06.550
BRADY HARAN: How do you explain
their reasoning?

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.766
How do you--

00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:09.190
I mean, you don't think
Steve's an idiot.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.150
But he has this feeling about
tau that you disagree with.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.590
What's different about his
thinking to yours?

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.200
MATT PARKER: You know what?

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.200
A lot of people do have very
good arguments for tau.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.210
And a lot of people have very
good arguments for pi.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.700
And there is a wonderful
thing--

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.260
I don't know.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.970
I think people like the fact
that it's different and that

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.020
they're going, oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa-- everyone

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.910
else has got it wrong.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.930
We can change this.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.635
And tau is better.

00:06:30.635 --> 00:06:33.900
And oh, people try and
do maths and they

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.200
think pi's all that.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.320
No, they're wrong.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.490
But I don't think there's any
great advantage other than it

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.030
can be a bit more exclusive to
say, oh, we're all over tau--

[RINGING]

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.210

think pi works just

as well in all cases.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.165
It's got the--

00:06:49.165 --> 00:06:50.460
I know--

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.515
historical--

00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:53.510
the fact that it's got a bit
of heritage doesn't mean we

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.100
should keep it around
necessarily.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.640
But it's worked for
a very long time.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.980
And it's there for very
good reasons.

[RINGING]

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.340
MATT PARKER: Nothing people have
thrown at me in terms of

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.240
tau, saying it's better--

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.950
you gain as much as
you lose from--

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.960

disadvantages and their
advantages.

[RINGING]

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.820
MATT PARKER: I don't think
there's enough for an entire

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.200
overhaul of the subject because
people think, oh,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.380
what, this particular equation
looks a bit nicer.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.330
Oh, but we've lost the fact that
you get negative numbers

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.690
in Euler's identity.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.180
And even your arguments
with circles--

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.090
this is my clincher.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.670
This is why I genuinely
think pi is nicer.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.680
If you've got tau, right?

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.730
If you do tau radians--

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.180
you do an entire revolution--

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.270
you end up right back
where you started.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.356
Tau gets you nowhere, right?

00:07:38.356 --> 00:07:38.762
[RINGING]

00:07:38.762 --> 00:07:40.460
STEVE MOULD: [CHUCKLING].

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.990
MATT PARKER: With pi, if you
do pi radians, you actually

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.870
get somewhere.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.610
And I think if you want a unit
to measure things, the unit

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.910
shouldn't be the whole thing.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:49.195
[RINGING]

00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:49.480
STEVE MOULD: What?

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.880
[LAUGHING].

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.820
MATT PARKER: A unit should
be a section of it.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.270
And so it's more nuanced.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.090
And for that reason--

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:54.930
STEVE MOULD: Oh, then
in that case--

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.960
MATT PARKER: I think
pi is better.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.040
STEVE MOULD: --divide it
by-- you know--360.

[RINGING]

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.800
MATT PARKER: Now you've
just gone too far.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.155
No one would use that
kind of a unit.

00:08:01.155 --> 00:08:01.640
BRADY HARAN: Steve--

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.420
STEVE MOULD: Yeah.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.270
BRADY HARAN: I've heard
you talk a little bit.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.900
And you seem to have an
enjoyment of the history of

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.550
mathematics.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.380
Maths is beautiful and pure.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.985
But it's also got
great stories.

00:08:11.985 --> 00:08:12.570
STEVE MOULD: Yeah.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.680
BRADY HARAN: Why are you willing
to ditch pi, which is

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.020
one of our most important
clinged-to, loved stories?

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.256
MATT PARKER: Don't overstate
my case here, all right?

00:08:21.256 --> 00:08:22.830
STEVE MOULD: One word--
progress.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.110
[RINGING]

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.400
STEVE MOULD: The historical
point is a good one.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:26.890
[RINGING]

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.280
STEVE MOULD: Historically, we
used to sacrifice goats.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:30.670
[RINGING]

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.394
STEVE MOULD: And I think we
should keep doing that.

00:08:32.394 --> 00:08:33.510
No--

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.059
so you can't just cling to
something because of history.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:41.970
Having said that, one argument
against tau is that pi is very

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:42.539
well established.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.910
And we'll just never
replace it.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.200
[RINGING]

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.010
STEVE MOULD: The strong argument
for me is that tau is

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.070
more intuitive.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.420
And so from an educational
point of view--

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:52.930
[RINGING]

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.300
STEVE MOULD: --in terms of
understanding circles and

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.510
working with circles, tau
makes more sense.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.125
MATT PARKER: Maybe just
call it a circle.

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:01.100
BRADY HARAN: OK, Steve--

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.200
MATT PARKER: When you're trying
to teach kids angles,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.990
and you go, what
angle is this?

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.530
All of it.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:05.895
[RINGING]

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:08.820
MATT PARKER: That's just
all the way round.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.080
STEVE MOULD: But then you start
dealing with radians.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.210
MATT PARKER: And then you
get half the circle.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.030
It's called a circle.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.120
BRADY HARAN: Steve, if I made
you education minister of the

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.710
world tomorrow, what would you
do about this situation?

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:18.660
STEVE MOULD: Well,
here's the thing.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.870
I think you can actually
slowly bring it in.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.880
Because you can use pi and
tau at the same time.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.320
[RINGING]

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.600
STEVE MOULD: Because wherever
you see 2 pi,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.390
you can write tau.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.190
So you don't have
to change any--

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.380
you don't have to suddenly
overhaul textbooks and

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.660
redefine pi.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.810
You can bring it in slowly.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.540
And so if I was education
minister of the world-- and I

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.955
hope to be one day--

00:09:41.955 --> 00:09:44.176
you can bring it
in very slowly.

00:09:44.176 --> 00:09:48.210
BRADY HARAN: Matt, your argument
seems to be that the

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.410
tau people aren't wrong.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.960
It's just a bit needless.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.820
It's extra work--

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.180
MATT PARKER: They're
insufficiently right.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.450
[RINGING]

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.710
STEVE MOULD: [LAUGHING].

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.975
BRADY HARAN: So what's wrong
with education minister for

00:09:57.975 --> 00:10:00.330
the world there next to you
slowly bringing in tau?

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.750
MATT PARKER: I have no problem
with tau sitting alongside pi.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.030
[RINGING]

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.890
MATT PARKER: I have
no problem with--

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.750
I think it's very important--
you're right-- to teach

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.690
radians in terms of it's a
whole circle, and we're

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.060
splitting it up into smaller
amounts, and how it links to

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.340
wonderful things like this.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.705
But you never see anyone who's
plugging tau in and going, you

00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:20.150
know what, this would
be useful as well.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.900
They're always like,
pi is wrong.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.020
And I'm like, well,
pi is not wrong.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.284
STEVE MOULD: Pi is not wrong.

00:10:23.284 --> 00:10:23.420
No, I know.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.275
MATT PARKER: It's perfectly
serviceable.

00:10:25.275 --> 00:10:26.740
It's worked a treat.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.950
And it's a wonderful concept.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.880
And I think genuinely it's got
a lot more going for it for

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.490
doing maths than tau.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.020
But there's many things where
you could say historically--

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.115
like, why don't we
count in base 12?

00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:40.340
That would be nicer.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:40.670
But we don't.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.450
We count in base 10, which, I
admit, I would almost say base

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.670
12 has more advantages if we
switch to that than if we

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.460
switch to tau.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:46.670
[RINGING]

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.355
MATT PARKER: So why are we
getting so emotional about our

00:10:48.355 --> 00:10:50.810
irrationals when we could be a
bit more rational about our

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:51.540
base systems?

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.213
BRADY HARAN: I'm stopping
the tape before

00:10:53.213 --> 00:10:55.364
you both start talking.

00:10:55.364 --> 00:10:57.515
MALE SPEAKER: 4.8 kilograms--

00:10:57.515 --> 00:10:59.850
MALE SPEAKER: So we define
angles counterclockwise--

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.710
MALE SPEAKER: --of order--

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.180
MALE SPEAKER: --so we go that
way rather than that way.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.650
Quite why we do that,
I have no idea.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:05.980
It's convention.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.520
MALE SPEAKER: And similarly, if
I went up, say, to the size

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.010
of a boulder, so
that this was--
