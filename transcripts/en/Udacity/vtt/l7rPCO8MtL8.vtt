00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.428
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This equation, let's us calculate the cost of the truck rental for any amount

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:08.827
of miles that I drive it, x. This table provides a limited view of the cost of

00:00:08.827 --> 00:00:13.223
the truck rental. We can only see it for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 20 miles. If I want

00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:17.699
a different representation of this data, I could use a graph. A graph can help

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.307
us visualize the cost of the truck rental, say, for 6 miles, 10 miles or even 15

00:00:22.307 --> 00:00:27.181
miles, we can see everything at once. Here is a graph with the positive x-axis

00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:31.930
and the positive y-axis. X is in miles and y is the cost in dollars. Here is

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.629
some points on the graph. What I want you to do is to check the points that

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.908
satisfy our equation. Good luck.
