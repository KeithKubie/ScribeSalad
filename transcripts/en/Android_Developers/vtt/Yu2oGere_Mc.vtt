00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.296
JP: Well welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.296 --> 00:00:05.170
First of all, thank you
very much for waiting

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.980
in the hot sun outside in line
to come to our presentation.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.047
My name is JP.

00:00:11.047 --> 00:00:13.630
PETER: And I'm Peter, and we're
here from the Google Developer

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.230
training team.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.780
JP: And we're excited to present
our first Google certification:

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.960
Associate Android Developer,
a performance-based exam

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.270
where you'll write real
apps to show your skill.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.090
PETER: So the Google
Developer Training Team

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.230
is part of the Developer
Relations Team at Google.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.520
And in this team,
our mission, really,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.970
is to educate and
inspire developers.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.200
And we'd like to
do that at scale.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.680
So what we'd like to
do is help developers

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.880
like yourself teach the best
practices, the design patterns,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.420
the tips and tricks
that you need

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.210
to know to build high
quality apps in the most

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.500
efficient way possible.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.300
Now, JP and I and other
members of the training team

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.150
that are also here today, we've
been in this training world

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.470
for awhile.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.080
And one of the things about
developer certifications

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.410
is whether you
should do it or not.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.190
And it's kind of
a tricky balance.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.510
Many certification
programs kind of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.480
miss the mark of what they're
intending to try to do.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.240
And so at the same time, we
felt that the certification

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.690
could really set the bar
for helping people achieve

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.330
some of their goals--
career wise, job wise--

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.300
and really accomplish
what they want to do.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.160
And that's what we're trying to
set up with this program here

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.240
today that we're
really excited about.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.906
JP: What we want to
do today is give you

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:42.840
a short view of the
program, introduce you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.130
to Associate Android Developer
and really show you how to get

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.899
started.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.440
We want to keep this
short and sweet.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.610
We want to give you lots of
time for questions and answers,

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.110
and give you lots
of time so you can

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.900
get a good seat for
the concert too.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.000
So imagine a developer.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.750
She has this amazing app, and
she wants to change the world.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.810
Now, if you're already
an entrepreneur

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.980
or an independent app developer,
you can do this today.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.949
And we even have
training to help you.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.054
However, there's
other situations,

00:02:13.054 --> 00:02:14.470
situations where
it's not quite so

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.080
easy to go from zero to
hero, where developers

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.330
around the world look for
and need resources to help

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.730
them accomplish their dreams.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.140
So one of these
situations, which

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.380
is familiar to probably many
of us, is getting a job.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.770
Maybe you or someone
you know is looking

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.940
for a job as an app developer.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.160
Maybe it's a first job, or maybe
it's a new job or a new career.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.480
You have ideas.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.580
You have skills.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.180
You have a network.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.570
But maybe you can't quite
connect to employers

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.710
to land that job.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.289
There's really a gap
between skilled developers

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:54.580
and those jobs that will let
them fulfill their dreams.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.617
Now, as Peter and I started
to look at this gap,

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:02.200
and other members
on the training team

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.815
looked at this gap, we
discovered it was really,

00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:07.560
I'd say, way larger
than we thought.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.834
We saw it in
developer education.

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:11.000
We saw it in the job market.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.250
We saw it where skills that
employers were looking for

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.845
and how people were
training to get those jobs.

00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:20.290
And really, two questions arose.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.980
The first question,
for employers,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.002
how do you show that
somebody is qualified?

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:27.335
How do you know that somebody
can perform the tasks that

00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:29.210
are required of them?

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.310
The second one, for
individuals, how

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.711
do you stand out for job
interviews and get recognized,

00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:35.460
whether it's for a new
job or a promotion?

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.820
PETER: Separately, a
lot of industry studies

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.960
came out that showed that we
had a significant disadvantage

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.460
here.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.190
For example, this report
from Vision Mobile

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.250
really pointed that out.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.970
And we realized the lack of
this objective industry standard

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.580
was really holding us
back, and specifically

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.290
in different countries
around the world.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.900
Now, we started thinking
about this quite deeply.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.920
And I have to say,
this is something

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.030
that kept us up at night.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.100
We really wanted to
solve that for Google.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.560
Now, generally with the rise of
these alternative credentialing

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.529
methods, like the
ones you're probably

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.180
familiar with with Udacity
and General Assembly,

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.480
we realized that there
was a real appetite

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.260
for learning app development
that would directly

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.130
lead to jobs.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.090
And so over the last few
years, we've done quite a bit

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.780
to close this gap.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.330
And perhaps a lot
of you are already

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.020
familiar with some
of our training.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.080
But I'll go into a little
more detail on that as well.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.760
So for example, with Udacity,
our online training partner,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.360
we built 35 MOOC
training courses

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.670
providing end to end paths
for Android development, web

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.300
development, and tech
entrepreneurship.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.710
We also built other courses
around machine learning

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.370
and cloud computing and so on.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.890
Now over the last few years,
the people enrolling in this

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.550
have really
dramatically increased,

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.620
and it's still picking
up a lot of steam.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.870
For example, we now have
1 and 1/4 million people

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.850
enrolled in our Google
courses on Udacity.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.160
And we have about 2,500 people
enrolling in these courses

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.310
every single day, right now.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.790
So it's been a really
good platform for us

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.550
to get the message out,
to educate developers,

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.310
which is our original mission.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.240
Now, we also realize
that not everyone

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.290
learns with the same--
online and self-paced.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.260
And so we worked together
with General Assembly

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.260
to build a complete 12 week
Android immersive, sort

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.850
of a full time in-person course
where you go on-site and spent

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.060
12 weeks really
dedicated to that,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.220
whereas most of the online
learning is self-paced.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.420
And we just had our first
people graduate from that.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.630
The first cohort in New
York, about 25 people,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.830
and the next one is
graduating very soon here

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.120
in San Francisco.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.430
And there is going to be opening
up about 12 order locations

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.180
globally.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.040
So I wanted to take just a
quick step back about what we've

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.220
done, specifically to Android.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.350
Two years ago at I/O, we
released the first Android

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.020
fundamentals or Developing
Android Apps training

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.830
course with Udacity.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.970
And that's sort of our
flagship Android course.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.560
We have almost 300,000 people
enrolled in that course.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.450
I think it's 288,000
at last count.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.830
This is a course
that's developed

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.250
by Reto Meier, Katherine Kuan,
who's here in the audience,

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.020
and Dan Galpin.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.820
So a really great course.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.200
But at that time, we
were still building

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.120
in a very ad hoc manner.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.090
So we were building one
course on the HTML5 games,

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.900
another one on mobile
web development,

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.170
and another one on
Android fundamentals.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:05.660
But what we were lacking
was that well-lit path

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.070
for developers through
an entire curriculum that

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.610
would lead directly to jobs.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.590
And so we decided to
start building that.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.570
And last year at I/O
[INAUDIBLE] announced

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.410
that we launched the
Android Nanodegree.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.290
And later in the year, we
launched that in September,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.710
or relaunched that
effectively, in India

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.850
with local pricing,
1,000 scholarships,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.815
and local e-commerce
options for Indian students

00:07:35.815 --> 00:07:36.690
to take that as well.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.030
Of course, they could have
taken that by itself already.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.090
Now late last year, we started
seeing the first graduates

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.680
from these Nanodegrees.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.210
It takes generally
about six to 12 months

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.350
for people to complete.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.570
We hosted a career
summit in Mountain View

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.640
for about the 50 top students.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.620
And what we're seeing there is
that people are getting jobs.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.660
For example, in India, we
have 16 Nanodegree students.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.340
And keep in mind that this
is still kind of early days

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.850
because it takes
six to 12 months,

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.950
and it's only been 12 months.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.220
And out of these six
students, four of them

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.950
were hired without even as much
as an interview at Flipkart.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.430
So pretty amazing stories.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.210
Some of these graduates have
also been hired at Google.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.570
So a pretty high level
of mastery, and just

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.740
a great outcome.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.960
We also launched last year the
Android for Beginners course.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.630
This is a fantastic course.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.020
All you need for that is
a phone, a computer where

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.159
you can install Android Studio,
and an Internet connection.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.770
You could take that
course and really

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.410
take you from zero
programing experience

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.560
all the way to actually having
apps running on your machine.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.710
That's Katherine
Kuan and [INAUDIBLE],

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.040
who are here in the
audience today, somewhere.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.460
Raise your hand.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:57.960
There.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.802
All right, thank you.

00:08:59.802 --> 00:09:01.385
So we launched that
as well last year.

00:09:01.385 --> 00:09:06.030
So then fast forward
to this year.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.590
We realized there
were still a big gap.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.040
Generally we say that
for Android fundamentals

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.780
and the Android Nanodegree,
you need about two years

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.290
of programming experience.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.230
Android for Beginners takes
you part of the way there,

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.710
but it's not quite complete.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.232
And so we've been working
really hard-- in fact,

00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:26.690
Katherine and
[INAUDIBLE] have been

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.960
working really
hard-- on bridging

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.440
that gap in intermediate
Android development skills.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.490
And so stay tuned for some
really exciting announcements

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.080
in that space because we're
building out, effectively,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.540
an entire end to end path
for developers on Android

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.860
so that we no longer
have to tell people,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:50.580
if you want to take
the Android Nanodegree,

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.870
go off and go to these
16 different places

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.310
to learn the prerequisites.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.490
So we'll have an end to
end, zero to hero path

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.860
for all of that.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.620
So in summary, we've
come a long way

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.740
to closing that gap
that JP described.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.840
When we're trying to accelerate
that gap even further.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.240
And so today, we're
taking one step closer

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:17.140
to supercharging how employers
and employees can effectively

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:21.700
work together in the
most efficient way.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.210
JP: Today we're excited to
announce Google Developer

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.570
Certification, a new program
to help close the gap

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.300
for employers and job seekers,
to help set common standards,

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.320
and to help
developers worldwide.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.800
Now, we're very excited
about this program.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.320
We think that it's going to
help developers stand out,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.400
be recognized, get a job, help
build higher quality apps.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.430
And I'm going to tell you about
the details, what it contains,

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.830
and how you can benefit.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.510
Now, if you're an
individual, if you've

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.350
got a great idea, if
you're looking for a job,

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.470
or maybe you represent
a company or an agency

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.670
looking for talent, we think
we've got something for you.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.920
PETER: Now, I want to talk
a little bit about how this

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.280
is not, let's say, an ordinary
developer certification,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.470
or expel a few
myths that you might

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.230
think about when you think
of developer certification.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.330
So one of the big
things here is that it's

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.750
based on job task
analysis, and JP

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.330
will tell you more about
that in a little bit.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.060
The big difference with,
let's say, a typical exam

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.530
is that this is a
performance-based exam.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.570
We're trying to take
certification into 2016,

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.860
do it in a bit of a Googley way.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.910
And basically, you'll need to
build apps and show your skills

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.500
to pass these exams.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.290
It's very performance-based.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:48.320
So it's not a 200 question,
trick question, multiple choice

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:48.870
exam.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.720
It's not really
a knowledge test.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.210
It's really testing
actual app development.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.067
JP: So we've thought about this.

00:11:57.067 --> 00:11:58.650
And I think, as Peter
was alluding to,

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.430
we thought about the
traditional concept

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.707
of technical certification
for developers.

00:12:02.707 --> 00:12:05.290
Now, in other industries, there
may be performance-based exams

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.300
that work well.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.950
But specifically,
when we're looking

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.190
at technical certification
for app developers,

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.830
it was something that we
really need to think about.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.080
So we thought first we need
to make it job-focused,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.745
as Peter alluded to.

00:12:17.745 --> 00:12:20.550
When we say job-focused, we
mean that every certification

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.280
that we develop
is actually mapped

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.645
to a job that's in the
industry, as determined

00:12:24.645 --> 00:12:28.170
and vetted by a
job task analysis.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.600
Peter also mentioned
performance-based exams.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.660
So we take an exam
that we will develop.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.740
Let's just take one.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.110
In that, you'll be
asked to build, extend,

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.010
add functionality
to an existing app,

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.666
or determine and correct
defects in the code.

00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:45.290
So we feel like this is similar
to the task the developer would

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.170
do in the real world, for
an entry level developer.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.440
And as opposed to a
knowledge-based exam,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.990
it's going to evaluate the
ability to perform tasks.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.040
Can you do the task
required in the job?

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.875
Not recall facts or concepts.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.930
Probably one of the
things that's probably

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.820
most important for this
program is how we're

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.685
going to be using rubrics.

00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:07.560
Now typically, rubrics,
you just kind of say,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.940
OK I have to know these things,
and if I know these things,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.000
I'll do well.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.590
Well, there is some
aspect of that, of course,

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:15.710
for us and with grading.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.350
The rubrics will be
transparent, published,

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.516
you'll have them as soon
as you sign up for an exam.

00:13:19.516 --> 00:13:22.860
You'll know what you need to
do in order to pass that exam.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.450
But it also would
reduce ambiguity.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.450
It's going to make it
very clear, very empirical

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.420
and objective how you will
earn the certification.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.789
So if you're prepared,
if you can build an app,

00:13:31.789 --> 00:13:34.080
and you know these rubrics,
you should be in good shape

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.480
to pass and earn one of
these certifications.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.437
We like to say there's
no tricks, no guile, just

00:13:40.437 --> 00:13:41.395
measurable performance.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.870
PETER: So JP showed
you a little bit

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.931
about our overall
certification program.

00:13:47.931 --> 00:13:49.430
And we're really
excited about that.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.930
And today, we're
launching the first

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.660
in the series, Associate
Android Developer.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.560
Now, this certification
maps to what

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:03.250
you would need to know as an
entry level Android developer.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:11.964
Now, the exams for this,
they will open up in July.

00:14:11.964 --> 00:14:13.880
And so today, it's all
about getting prepared.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.350
Now, a lot of you,
in this audience,

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.808
you're probably
Android developers,

00:14:16.808 --> 00:14:20.230
and you may already be
ready to pass this exam.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.980
But if you're not, and
you need to brush up

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.270
on some of these skills, we
have a great training page.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.040
You can find out all about
our certification and training

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.720
offerings that we have
to help you get ready.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.010
So you can find our
new certification page

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.720
that we just launched
earlier today that

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.010
has more details on it.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.560
You can find there
what these rubrics

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.540
are that we talked about,
what the program is all about.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.740
And today, you can sign up,
literally just put your email

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.080
in, so we can notify you as
soon as the exams open up.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.580
So the key takeaway here is
you can start your journey

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.940
toward certification.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.360
Now, how do you prepare?

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.440
So coming back to that
landscape of Android

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.050
training that we developed
over the last few years.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.330
Really what this is about is
more on the advanced side--

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.430
on the intermediate to
advanced side-- which

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.910
is based on, if we
zoom into, let's say,

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:18.660
that advanced
Udacity nanodegree.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.310
Then you can take
Android fundamentals,

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.690
which is really the course
to dive into that maps

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.840
to the task analysis.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.930
Can we get the next slide?

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:32.990
Great.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.580
So Android fundamentals
maps closest to the job task

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.440
analysis that we performed.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.390
And so by taking
that course, you

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:44.120
can really get ready
to get the exam.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.682
Now, taking that
course also means

00:15:47.682 --> 00:15:49.640
you have to do all the
practical parts of that.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.140
Right?

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.540
It's not just
watching the video,

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.302
but it's actually really
getting your hands dirty,

00:15:55.302 --> 00:15:57.010
building the projects
that come with that

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.710
and really mastering
that material.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.960
So that's, in essence, what I
think the best place to start

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.787
with to get started today.

00:16:08.787 --> 00:16:09.620
JP: So that's great.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.640
Thank you, Peter.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.640
That's how you go about
preparing for this exam.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.080
And you can do that,
again, starting today.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.100
So what about July?

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.625
Let's fast forward a little bit.

00:16:17.625 --> 00:16:19.570
When July comes, what
you'll do is you'll

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.120
complete your sign-up process.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.790
You'll be presented
with some projects.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.450
Basically, the
projects will represent

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.400
what you need to know in
order to pass the exam

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.262
and then earn the certification.

00:16:31.262 --> 00:16:32.720
When you get these
projects, you'll

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.530
work on them
independently, submit them.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.970
They'll be graded, and ding!

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.170
You'll be certified.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.000
Then you can take your
mark, show recruiters, show

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.397
employers, show your friends.

00:16:45.397 --> 00:16:47.980
I don't know, hand it in front
of your dog and let him see it.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:48.970
Something like that.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:50.590
Show your mark,
so you can proudly

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.210
show everyone what
you've earned.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:57.030
And not only that, we
looked at grading too.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.130
Sometimes in certifications,
it becomes just something

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.859
earned to just get through.

00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:03.900
We really wanted this to
be part of your learning

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.230
path towards mastery as well.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.599
So when we think about
grading for this,

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:09.569
it's not pass or fail.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.750
It's really you get
three chances to pass.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.060
You can retake the exam.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.609
And there's a combination of
machine and human grading.

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:18.770
So with the human
grading, Android experts

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.089
will give you feedback.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.611
So again, it's not just about
earning the certification,

00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:24.819
it's also about learning as
you're doing and building

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:25.443
these projects.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.395
And well, that's it.

00:17:29.395 --> 00:17:31.906
That's what we had
to talk about today.

00:17:31.906 --> 00:17:33.280
Thank you for
attending the talk.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.890
We hope you're excited about
Google Developer Certification.
