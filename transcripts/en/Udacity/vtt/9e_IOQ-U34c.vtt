00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.861
When solving this problem, I'm going to start within the absolute value bars.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.440
Remember, I have a negative 1 on the outside, and then, I need to do the

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:14.310
exponent first. So, I have 8 minus 25. 8 minus 25 is negative 17. So, I have

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:19.422
negative 1 times the absolute value of negative 17. The absolute value of

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:24.433
negative 17 is positive 17, so I have negative 1 times 17. Remember, when I do

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:29.610
the absolute value of a number, I want the positive result, or the distance from

00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:34.715
zero and I don't have to put the absolute value bars anymore. Negative 1 times

00:00:34.727 --> 00:00:38.064
17 is negative 17. If you got negative 17, nice work.
