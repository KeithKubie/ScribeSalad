00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.840
When I think about
places at Harvard that

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.960
are meaningful to me, the
one that first comes to mind

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.580
is Memorial Hall.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.230
And it has three
different parts that

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.480
are meaningful to me in
somewhat different ways.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.079
The one that is so
powerful in my mind

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.100
is the Transept as you
enter into Memorial Hall

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.590
where the names of Harvard Union
dead are honored on the walls.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.130
There 136 of those
names and each of them

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.240
comes with a date of death.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.530
And most of them have
the name of the battle,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.620
the final battle at which
the individual was killed.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.830
And it includes such individuals
as Robert Gould Shaw, who

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.970
commanded the Massachusetts
54th Regiment of Black Troops

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.640
at Fort Wagner and died
charging the enemy there

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.320
and was buried with his men.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.070
Wilder Dwight, who was killed
in Antietam in the fall of 1862

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.010
and wrote a letter to his
mother from the battlefield

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.400
on the morning of the battle
saying how cheerful he was

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.590
on that misty, moisty morning.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.990
And another, Nathaniel
Bowditch, whose papers

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.720
I've read extensively
at the Mass Historical

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.970
and I've written
about, who was killed

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.290
in Virginia early in
1863 and left wounded

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.320
on the battlefield, inspiring
his father, a Harvard Medical

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.620
School professor, to devote
himself to ambulances

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.480
and making sure ambulances
were provided for the military

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.290
so that other men's sons
would not die as his did.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.110
It's a space that
mimics a cathedral

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.110
and is meant to
inspire and uplift.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.010
And for me, it certainly does.
