there's been a lot of talk over the past

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:04.870
there's been a lot of talk over the past
 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.320
there's been a lot of talk over the past
few years and in some popular books

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.330
few years and in some popular books
 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.180
few years and in some popular books
about the power of intuition and how if

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190
about the power of intuition and how if
 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.369
about the power of intuition and how if
we trust that our intuitions or went

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.379
we trust that our intuitions or went
 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:12.659
we trust that our intuitions or went
with our guts more often we would

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:12.669
with our guts more often we would
 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:13.739
with our guts more often we would
actually wind up making better decisions

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:13.749
actually wind up making better decisions
 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.629
actually wind up making better decisions
in the world would even be a better

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639
in the world would even be a better
 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.450
in the world would even be a better
place some researchers have talked about

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460
place some researchers have talked about
 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.000
place some researchers have talked about
how our intuitions and the intuitive

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010
how our intuitions and the intuitive
 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.860
how our intuitions and the intuitive
judgments we can make the snap judgments

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:22.870
judgments we can make the snap judgments
 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.720
judgments we can make the snap judgments
are actually accurate a lot of the time

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730
are actually accurate a lot of the time
 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.810
are actually accurate a lot of the time
and a lot of that is true but what we

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820
and a lot of that is true but what we
 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.520
and a lot of that is true but what we
noticed when thinking about our gorilla

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530
noticed when thinking about our gorilla
 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.320
noticed when thinking about our gorilla
experiment and doing research for this

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330
experiment and doing research for this
 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.090
experiment and doing research for this
book is that there's a whole category of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100
book is that there's a whole category of
 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.889
book is that there's a whole category of
intuitions that are actually

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899
intuitions that are actually
 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.989
intuitions that are actually
systematically wrong and in very

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:36.999
systematically wrong and in very
 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:38.220
systematically wrong and in very
dangerous ways and those are the

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230
dangerous ways and those are the
 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.689
dangerous ways and those are the
intuitions we have about how our own

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699
intuitions we have about how our own
 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:40.619
intuitions we have about how our own
minds work

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629
minds work
 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.509
minds work
so the gorilla experiment shows that we

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519
so the gorilla experiment shows that we
 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.489
so the gorilla experiment shows that we
intuitively think that we pay attention

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499
intuitively think that we pay attention
 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.139
intuitively think that we pay attention
to a notice much more than we actually

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149
to a notice much more than we actually
 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.910
to a notice much more than we actually
do and that can have tragic consequences

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920
do and that can have tragic consequences
 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.450
do and that can have tragic consequences
if you get into a car accident or one of

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460
if you get into a car accident or one of
 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.189
if you get into a car accident or one of
the examples in our book is a nuclear

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199
the examples in our book is a nuclear
 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.989
the examples in our book is a nuclear
submarine that surfaced right into a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999
submarine that surfaced right into a
 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.899
submarine that surfaced right into a
Japanese fishing boat because in part

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909
Japanese fishing boat because in part
 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.700
Japanese fishing boat because in part
the captain of the submarine looked up

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710
the captain of the submarine looked up
 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.559
the captain of the submarine looked up
in the periscope didn't see any boats

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569
in the periscope didn't see any boats
 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.110
in the periscope didn't see any boats
around and surfaced right into one that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120
around and surfaced right into one that
 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.700
around and surfaced right into one that
he didn't see that was actually probably

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710
he didn't see that was actually probably
 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.709
he didn't see that was actually probably
right in front of him so there's an in

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719
right in front of him so there's an in
 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.240
right in front of him so there's an in
case where intuitively we think

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250
case where intuitively we think
 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.190
case where intuitively we think
something and it can really get us into

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200
something and it can really get us into
 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.600
something and it can really get us into
big trouble we realized as we were

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610
big trouble we realized as we were
 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.130
big trouble we realized as we were
thinking about the book and putting

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140
thinking about the book and putting
 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.749
thinking about the book and putting
together the ideas that this category of

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759
together the ideas that this category of
 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.819
together the ideas that this category of
intuitions is very broad it's not just

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829
intuitions is very broad it's not just
 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.620
intuitions is very broad it's not just
about visual attention it's also about

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630
about visual attention it's also about
 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.510
about visual attention it's also about
memory we think we remember things much

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520
memory we think we remember things much
 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.639
memory we think we remember things much
more accurately than we really do it's

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649
more accurately than we really do it's
 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.160
more accurately than we really do it's
about confidence we think that people

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170
about confidence we think that people
 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.649
about confidence we think that people
who are confident are also more skilled

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659
who are confident are also more skilled
 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.600
who are confident are also more skilled
and accurate and knowledgeable and it's

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610
and accurate and knowledgeable and it's
 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.340
and accurate and knowledgeable and it's
about our own knowledge we think that we

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350
about our own knowledge we think that we
 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.870
about our own knowledge we think that we
know and understand more about the world

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880
know and understand more about the world
 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.670
know and understand more about the world
and we really do and so on they're sort

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680
and we really do and so on they're sort
 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.749
and we really do and so on they're sort
of like a whole sort of set of these

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759
of like a whole sort of set of these
 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.389
of like a whole sort of set of these
intuitions which can really lead us

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399
intuitions which can really lead us
 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.950
intuitions which can really lead us
astray if we're not aware of them and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960
astray if we're not aware of them and
 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.120
astray if we're not aware of them and
that's what we decided to write the book

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130
that's what we decided to write the book
 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.760
that's what we decided to write the book
about

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770
 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.730
we are in a way taking on the impression

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740
we are in a way taking on the impression
 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.100
we are in a way taking on the impression
that a lot of people have from books

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110
that a lot of people have from books
 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.320
that a lot of people have from books
like blanked by Malcolm Gladwell and

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330
like blanked by Malcolm Gladwell and
 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.570
like blanked by Malcolm Gladwell and
others in that category which is sort of

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580
others in that category which is sort of
 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.340
others in that category which is sort of
an uncritical belief in the power of

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350
an uncritical belief in the power of
 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.350
an uncritical belief in the power of
intuition and snap judgments and so on

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360
intuition and snap judgments and so on
 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.149
intuition and snap judgments and so on
and the idea that you should rely on

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159
and the idea that you should rely on
 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.300
and the idea that you should rely on
them whenever possible we sort of are in

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310
them whenever possible we sort of are in
 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.520
them whenever possible we sort of are in
a sense taking on the cult of intuition

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530
a sense taking on the cult of intuition
 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.169
a sense taking on the cult of intuition
or the myth of intuition as we call it

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179
or the myth of intuition as we call it
 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.210
or the myth of intuition as we call it
in the book I should also say that we're

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220
in the book I should also say that we're
 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.410
in the book I should also say that we're
very pleased that Malcolm Gladwell

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420
very pleased that Malcolm Gladwell
 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.630
very pleased that Malcolm Gladwell
actually read our original scientific

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
actually read our original scientific
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.400
actually read our original scientific
journal article about the invisible

gorilla study and talked about it in one

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300
gorilla study and talked about it in one
 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.670
gorilla study and talked about it in one
of his New Yorker articles which helped

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680
of his New Yorker articles which helped
 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.100
of his New Yorker articles which helped
it get more publicity and ultimately led
