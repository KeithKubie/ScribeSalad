00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.950
my name is Nadine and I was born in
Syria with cerebral palsy I couldn't go

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:20.460
to school so TV became my classroom when
the world came my sister and I had to

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:29.750
leave I wasn't supposed to see the
bright side of my journey

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:41.530
so I made it an adventure and discovered
all sorts of new things like boats

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.520
trains

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.280
the best hot chocolate I've ever had

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:59.480
I wasn't supposed to make it past Syria

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.090
or Turkey

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.659
or Austria

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:17.740
But here I am in a classroom I was never
supposed to be in.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.130
So imagine how I feel

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.129
when people tell me I can't be an astronaut.
