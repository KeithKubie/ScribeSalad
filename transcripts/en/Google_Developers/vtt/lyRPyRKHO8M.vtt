[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:07.904
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:10.260
SUNDAR PICHAI: Good morning.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.090
Good morning.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.360
Wonderful to be back here at
Shoreline with all of you.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.070
It's been a really busy few
months for us at Google.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.000
We just wrapped up Cloud Next in
San Francisco with over 30,000

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.380
attendees, as well as
YouTube Brandcast last week

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.850
in New York.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.250
Of course, today's about you
all, our developer community.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.790
And thank you all for
joining us in person,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.760
and to the millions around the
world watching on livestream.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.770
I would love to say welcome
in all our languages

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.020
our viewers speak,
but we are going

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.640
to keep the keynote
under two hours,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.350
especially since Barcelona kicks
off against Liverpool at noon.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.160
[CHEERING]

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.680
That should be an amazing game.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.870
Every year at I/O,
we learn and try

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.827
to make things a
little bit better.

00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:00.410
That's why we have
lots of sunscreen--

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.150
hope the sun comes out--

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.920
plenty of water and shade.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.780
But this year, we
want to make it easier

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.470
for you to get around.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.640
So we are using AR to help.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.380
To get started, open your I/O
app and choose Explore I/O.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.290
And then you can just point
your phone where you want to go.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.910
We really hope this
helps you get around

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.950
and answers the number
one question people have--

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.960
where the sessions are.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.960
Actually, it's not that.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.440
They want to know
where the food is.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.810
And we have plenty of it around.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.050
We also have a couple
of Easter eggs,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.760
and we hope you
enjoy them as well.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.950
This is a pretty
compelling use case.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.800
And we actually want to
generalize this approach

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.480
so that you can
explore and navigate

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.490
the whole world that way.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.970
There's a lot of
hard work ahead.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.560
And it's a hard computer
science problem.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.610
But it's the type of
challenge we love.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.560
Tackling these
kinds of problems is

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.350
what has kept us going
for the past 21 years.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.460
And it all begins
with our mission

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.890
to organize the
world's information

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.210
and make it universally
accessible and useful.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.850
And today, our mission
feels as relevant as ever.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.900
But the way we approach
it is constantly evolving.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.090
We are moving from
a company that

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.750
helps your find answers
to a company that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.640
helps you get things done.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.670
This morning,
we'll introduce you

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.330
to many products built on
a foundation of user trust

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.770
and privacy.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.120
And I'll talk more
about that later.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.790
We want our products
to work harder

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.000
for you, in the context of your
job, your home, and your life.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.340
And they all share
a single goal--

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.220
to be helpful, so we
can be there for you

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.490
in moments big and small
over the course of your day--

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.710
for example, helping you
write your emails faster

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.250
with automatic solutions
from Smart Reply,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.520
and giving you the
chance to take them back

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.810
if you didn't get it
right the first time,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.730
helping you find
the fastest route

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.350
home at the end of a long
day, and when you get there,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.890
removing distractions so
that you can spend time

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.820
with the people most
important to you,

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.480
and when you capture
those perfect moments,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.350
backing them up automatically
so you never lose them.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.800
Simply put, our goal is to
build a more helpful Google

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.810
for everyone.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.960
And when we say
"helpful," we mean

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.000
giving you the tools to increase
your knowledge, success,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.940
health, and happiness.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.370
We feel so privileged to
be developing products

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.230
for billions of users.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.010
And with that scale comes a
deep sense of responsibility

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.580
to create things that
improve people's lives.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.580
By focusing on these
fundamental attributes,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.960
we can empower individuals and
benefit society as a whole.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.380
Of course, building a
more helpful Google for us

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.440
always starts with search and
the billions of questions users

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.480
trust Google with everyday.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.529
But there is so much more
we can do to help our users.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.980
Last year, we launched a
new feature in Google News

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.690
called Full Coverage.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.080
And we have gotten great
feedback on it from our users.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.360
We'll be bringing
Full Coverage directly

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.330
to search to better
organize results

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.470
for news-related topics.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.680
Let's take an example.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.740
If you search for
"black hole," we'll

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.405
surface the relevant top news.

00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:43.520
It was in the news recently.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.680
We use machine
learning to identify

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.110
different types of
stories and give you

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.890
a complete picture of how
a story is being reported

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.230
from a wide variety of sources.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.430
You can click into
Full Coverage.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.870
It serves as a
breadth of content,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.760
but allows you to drill down
into what interests you.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.330
You can check out different
aspects of the story,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.850
like how the black
hole got its name.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.690
You can even now see
a timeline of events.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.660
And we'll be bringing this
to search later this year.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.020
Podcasts are another important
source of information.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.370
And we'll be bringing them
directly to search as well.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.170
By indexing podcasts, we can
surface relevant episodes

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.180
based on their content,
not just the title.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.500
And you can tap to listen
right in search results,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.190
or you can save an episode
for listening later

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.410
on your commute or
your Google Home.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.500
These are all examples of how
we are making search even more

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.430
helpful for our users,
surfacing the right information

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.320
in the right context.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.010
And sometimes, what's most
helpful in understanding

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.690
the world is being able
to see it visually.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.190
To show you how we are bringing
you visual information directly

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.326
in search, here's Aparna.

00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:06.784
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:06.784 --> 00:06:10.672
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.960
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Whether you're

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.570
learning about the
solar system or trying

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.130
to choose a color
scheme for your home,

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.480
seeing is often understanding.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.210
With computer vision
and augmented reality,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.670
that camera in our
hands is turning

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.000
into a powerful visual
tool to help you understand

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.350
the world around you.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.490
So today, we are excited
to bring the camera

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.270
to Google search, adding a
new dimension to your search

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.260
results--

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.970
well, actually three
dimensions, to be precise.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.820
So let's take a look.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.250
Say you're a student
studying human anatomy.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.690
Now, when you search for
something like muscle flexion,

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.680
you can view a 3D model
built by Visible Body

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.165
right from the search results.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.330
Pretty cool.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.430
Not only that, you can also
place it in your own space.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.853
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.630
Look, it's one thing to read
about flexion or extension,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.870
but seeing it in action
right in front of you

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.650
while you're studying
the concept, very handy.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.360
OK, let's take another example.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.610
Say, instead of
studying, you're shopping

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.140
for a new pair of shoes.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.700
That happens.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.160
With New Balance,
you can look at shoes

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.200
up close from different angles,
again, directly from search.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.660
That way, you get a much
better sense for things

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.020
like, what does the grip
look like on the sole,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.620
or how they match with
the rest of your clothes.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.612
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.340
OK, this last example
is a really fun one.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.030
So you may have all seen a
great white shark in the movies.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.900
"Jaws," anyone?

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.840
But what does it actually
look like up close?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.260
Let's find out, shall we?

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.440
OK.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.450
I have Arjuna here with
me to help with the demo.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.060
So let's go ahead and search for
"great white shark" on Google.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.920
As you scroll through,
you get information

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.500
on the knowledge panel facts,
but also see the shark in 3D

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.130
directly from the
knowledge panel.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.390
Why don't we go
one step further?

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.565
Why don't we invite
the shark to the stage?

00:08:39.565 --> 00:08:40.065
Whoa!

00:08:40.065 --> 00:08:42.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.200
There it is.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.980
It's one thing to read a
fact like "a great white can

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.650
be anywhere between 17
feet to 21 feet long,"

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.730
but to see it in
front of you at scale,

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.870
filling up the Shoreline stage
like a rock star, that is truly

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.030
understanding its scale.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.570
OK, let's take a closer look.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:05.460
It's an AR shark.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.100
It won't bite.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.610
Ooh.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.098
Look at those layers of teeth.

00:09:11.098 --> 00:09:12.640
You know, I don't
know about you all,

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.700
but I'd much rather see
these teeth up close in AR

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.510
than in real life.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.870
Thank you, Arjuna.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.810
Really excited about bringing
the camera and AR capabilities

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.760
to Google search.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.500
Now, sometimes,
though, the things

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.570
that you're
interested in, they're

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.520
difficult to describe
in a search box.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.540
So that's why we
created Google Lens,

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.840
to help you search and
do more with what you see

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.260
by simply pointing your camera.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.080
The built lens has a
capability across products.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.880
So you can access it directly
from the Google Assistant.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.360
But we've also built it into
Google Photos and the Camera

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.990
app on many Android devices.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.460
People have already used Lens
more than a billion times so

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.660
far.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.310
And they've used
it to ask questions

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:12.480
about what they see, like
what kind of flower that is,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.680
or where to get
a lamp like that,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.730
or just who the artist is.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.830
One way we've been
thinking about it is,

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.610
with Lens, we're indexing
the physical world, billions

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:28.020
of places and products and so
on, much like search indexes

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.630
the billions of
pages on the web.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.320
OK, today, let me
show you some new ways

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.950
that we're making Lens
more helpful to you.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.750
Say you're at a
restaurant trying

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.910
to figure out what to order.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.330
Instead of going from the menu
to different apps on the phone

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.850
and back to the
menu and so on, you

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.690
can simply point your camera.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.410
Lens automatically
highlights the popular dishes

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.230
at this restaurant
right on the menu.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.485
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.610
And of course, if you
want to know more,

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.540
you can tap on any
dish on the menu,

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.518
and you can see what
it looks like, again,

00:11:11.518 --> 00:11:12.310
at the restaurant--

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.688
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:15.688 --> 00:11:17.730
--and, of course, check
out what other people are

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.790
saying about it on Google Maps.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.920
By the way, when
you're done eating,

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.070
Lens can help pay for your meal.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.000
Not so fast.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.800
It's not picking up your tab.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:35.040
But it can calculate the tip
and even split the total--

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.380
again, just by pointing
your camera at the receipt.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.942
And voila.

00:11:41.942 --> 00:11:45.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.130
So you saw how we connected
the menu with information

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.750
from Google Maps.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.030
But we're starting to
think of other ways

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.180
that we can connect
helpful digital information

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.650
with the things in
the physical world.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.110
So I'm going to give
you just one example.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.010
So you're flipping through
a "Bon Appetit" magazine

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.990
and you see a recipe you like.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.620
Soon, you can point your
camera at the recipe

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:17.360
and see the page come
alive, showing you

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.260
how to make the dish.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.970
We're starting to work with
more partners, like museums,

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.640
magazine publishers,
and retailers,

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.370
to bring unique visual
experiences like this.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.170
There's one final area where
we think that the camera can be

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.200
particularly helpful to people.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.060
Around the world, there are
more than 800 million adults

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.010
who are struggling to read the
words that they come across

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.840
in their daily lives--

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.020
bus schedules, bank
forms, et cetera.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.540
And many of them are coming
online for the first time

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.730
with a smartphone.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.210
So to help with that, we've
integrated a new camera

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.150
capability into Google Go.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.830
This is our search app
for entry level devices.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:10.180
Take this sign in
English next to an ATM.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.390
Now, for someone who does
not understand the language

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.680
and cannot read the words, this
is important information that

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.290
they're not getting access to.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.640
And we think that the
camera can help here.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.020
So let me show you how.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.670
So directly from the
Google search bar,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.700
you can use Lens,
open it, point it

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.840
at the sign to hear the
text read out aloud to you.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.080
ASSISTANT: Information
for card holders--

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.900
all customers using old
proprietary magnetic stripe

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.393
cards should be advised.

00:13:42.393 --> 00:13:43.810
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
What is nice

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.590
here is that it is highlighting
the words as they're spoken.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.110
That way, even if you can't
read the language well,

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.220
you can follow along, and you
understand the full context

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.050
of what you see.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:03.108
You can also translate it into
your own language, like this.

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:07.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.810
Notice that the translated
text is overlaid right

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.210
on top of the original sign.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.250
It almost feels
like the sign was

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.650
written in your own
language to start with.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.370
And again, you can
hit Listen and hear

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.460
the words read out loud, this
time in your own language.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.930
ASSISTANT: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:32.046
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.140
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
What you're seeing here

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.900
is text-to-speech, computer
vision, the power of translate,

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.650
and 20 years of language
understanding from search

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.460
all coming together.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.590
Now, our teams in
India have been

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.160
working with some early testers
and getting a lot of feedback

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.810
to make the product better.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.060
And I want to now show
you how one of them

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.160
is using it in her daily life.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.760
Take a look.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:37.173 --> 00:16:38.840
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Thank you, Urmila,

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.320
for testing it and giving us
a lot of feedback for the team

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.530
to make the product better.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.520
The power to read is the
power to buy a train ticket,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.310
to shop in a store,
to follow the news.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.550
It's the power to
get things done.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.720
So we want to make this feature
accessible to as many people as

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.150
possible.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:05.598
So it already works in more
than a dozen languages.

00:17:05.598 --> 00:17:08.540
And the teams worked
incredibly hard to compress

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.416
all of this tech to
just over 100 kilobytes.

00:17:12.416 --> 00:17:16.313
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:17.893 --> 00:17:19.310
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
That way, it

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:25.098
can work on phones that
cost as little as $35.

00:17:25.098 --> 00:17:28.720
So we're super excited about
this and all the other features

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.650
across search and Lens to
help you throughout the day.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.810
You'll start to see
these updates roll out

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.230
later this month.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.730
Thank you.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:37.724
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:41.700
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.120
SUNDAR PICHAI: Thanks Aparna.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.340
Helpfulness is also about
saving time and making

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.960
your day a little bit easier.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.930
That's why, last
year, at I/O, we

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:02.430
gave you a first look at
our Duplex technology.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:07.290
Duplex enables Google Assistant
to make restaurant reservations

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:11.100
on your behalf by
actually placing a call.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.450
It's now available in
44 states across the US.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.780
And we've gotten great feedback
not only from our users,

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.080
but from businesses as well.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.110
For us Duplex is the
approach by which

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.400
we train AI on simple
but familiar tasks

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.370
to accomplish them
and save you time.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.650
Duplex was launched with
restaurant reservations

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:36.860
on the phone.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.000
But now, we are
moving beyond voice

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.590
and extending Duplex
to tasks on the web.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.950
We again want to focus on
narrow use cases to start.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.500
So we are looking at rental
car bookings as well as

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.500
movie ticketing.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.250
Today, when you make a
new reservation online,

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.340
you have to navigate a
number of pages and steps,

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.830
filling out
information and making

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.910
selections along the way.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.520
I'm sure you're all familiar
with this experience.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.300
It's time consuming.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.090
And if users leave
during the workflow,

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.550
businesses lose out as well.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.610
We want to make this experience
better for both users

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.120
and businesses.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.850
So let me show you how that
system can do it better.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.760
Say you get a calendar reminder
about an upcoming trip.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.430
And you want to
book a rental car.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:29.000
You can just ask Google,
book a National car rental

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.620
for my next trip.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.830
The Assistant opens
the National website

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:38.030
and automatically starts
filling out your information

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.945
on your behalf--

00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:40.465
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:40.465 --> 00:19:42.770
--including the
dates of the trip.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.830
You can confirm the
details with just a tap.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.720
And then the Assistant
continues to navigate the site.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.530
It even selects
which car you like.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.950
It's acting on your behalf
and helping you save time,

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.040
but you're always in
control of the flow.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.960
Let's go ahead and
add a car seat.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.260
And once all the
details are in, you

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.780
can check everything
one last time

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.350
and just tap to finalize
the reservation.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:15.370
You'll immediately get
a booking confirmation.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.480
It's amazing to see
the Assistant complete

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:23.020
a task online on your behalf
in a personalized way.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.760
It understands the
dates of your trip

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.900
and your car preferences
based on trip confirmations

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.400
and Gmail.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.770
And I also want to point
out that this was not

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.570
a custom integration.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:39.160
This required no action on part
of the business to implement.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.710
What you just saw
is an early preview

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:46.000
of what we are calling
Duplex on the Web.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.920
We're going to be
thoughtful and get feedback

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.250
from both users and businesses
to improve the experience.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.832
And we'll have more details
to share later this year.

00:20:55.832 --> 00:20:59.164
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.250
The Google Assistant
helps people

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.600
around the world with
all kinds of tasks,

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.220
whether they are at
home or on the go.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.550
But we want to build an
even more helpful assistant.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.920
In order to process
speech today, we

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.460
rely on complex algorithms
that include multiple machine

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.020
learning models.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:26.580
One model maps incoming sound
bites into phonetic units.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.420
Another one takes and
assembles these phonetic units

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.160
into words.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.010
And then a third model
predicts the likelihood

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.450
of these words in a sequence.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.000
They are so complex
that they require

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.360
100 gigabytes of storage
and a network connection.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.940
Bringing these models
to your phone--

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.130
think of it as putting
the power of a Google data

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.930
center in your pocket--

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.380
is an incredibly challenging
computer science problem.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.420
I'm excited to share
we have reached

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.610
a significant milestone.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.860
Further advances
in deep learning

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.960
have allowed us to combine and
shrink the 100-gigabyte models

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.710
down to half a gigabyte,
small enough to bring it

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.810
onto mobile devices.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:15.510
This eliminates network latency
and makes the Assistant so much

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.740
faster--

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:22.180
so fast that tapping to use
your phone would seem slow.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.980
I think this is
going to transform

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.960
the future of the Assistant.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.750
And I'm thrilled to
bring Scott to tell you

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.719
more about our next
generation Assistant.

00:22:31.719 --> 00:22:33.156
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:33.156 --> 00:22:36.988
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:39.383 --> 00:22:41.790
SCOTT HUFFMAN: Thanks, Sundar.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.150
Well, what if we could bring
the AI that powers the Assistant

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.340
right onto your phone?

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.730
What if the Assistant was so
fast at processing your voice

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.960
that tapping to operate your
phone would almost seem slow?

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.670
It opens up many new use cases.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.580
And we want to show
you how fast it is.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.620
Now, internally, we've
been calling this

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.050
the next generation Assistant.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.080
Running on device, it can
process and understand

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.590
requests in real time,
and deliver the answers up

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.360
to 10 times faster.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.610
Now, Maggie's here.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.470
And she's going to
help us test it out,

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.780
starting with some
back-to-back commands

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.970
to demonstrate its speed.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.100
Now this demo is
hot off the press.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.560
So please send your
positive energy over

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.520
in Maggie's direction.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.992
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.400
MAGGIE: Hey, Google,
open Calendar.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.070
Open Calculator.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.710
Open Photos.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.220
Set a timer for 10 minutes.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.130
What's the weather today?

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.160
What about tomorrow?

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.900
Show me John Legend on Twitter.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.310
Get a Lyft ride to my hotel.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.330
Turn the flashlight on.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.130
Turn it off.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.824
Take a selfie.

00:24:09.824 --> 00:24:16.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.430
SCOTT HUFFMAN: All right.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.390
Now as you can see--

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.324
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:19.824
Yeah.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.160
That was awesome.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.928
Maggie was able to open and
navigate apps instantly.

00:24:28.928 --> 00:24:30.470
Now you might have
also noticed that,

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.720
with continued
conversation, she was

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.970
able to make several
requests in a row

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.690
without having to say
"hey Google" each time.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.060
Now, beyond an effortless
way to operate your phone,

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.780
you can start to imagine how the
Assistant fused into the device

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.932
could orchestrate
tasks across apps.

00:24:47.932 --> 00:24:49.640
Let's look at another
demo where Maggie's

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.360
chatting with a friend.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.630
He's going to ask her
about a recent trip.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.740
Notice how easy it is for her to
respond with her voice and even

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.460
share a photo.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:05.730
MAGGIE: Reply.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.025
Had a great time with my
family, and it was so beautiful.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.183
Show me my photos
from Yellowstone.

00:25:16.183 --> 00:25:17.100
The ones with animals.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.060
Send it to Justin.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:28.811
SCOTT HUFFMAN: All right.

00:25:28.811 --> 00:25:30.235
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:30.235 --> 00:25:30.735
Yeah.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:38.120
Now another example is when
a friend asks you a question

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.870
and you need to look up
the information to respond.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.938
Justin wanted to know when
Maggie's flight arrives.

00:25:43.938 --> 00:25:44.980
MAGGIE: When's my flight?

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.450
When's my flight?

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.010
Reply.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.630
I should get in around 1:00 PM.

00:25:57.808 --> 00:25:58.850
SCOTT HUFFMAN: All right.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.490
So notice how it
helped Maggie multitask

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.190
more easily across
different apps,

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.900
saving her a lot
of back-and-forth.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.100
Now you can even imagine this
next generation assistant

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.920
handling more complex
speech scenarios,

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.040
like composing and
sending an email.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.220
MAGGIE: Hey, Google,
send an email to Jessica.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:25.310
Hi, Jessica.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.190
I just got back from Yellowstone
and completely fell in love

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.210
with it.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:35.420
Set subject to
"Yellowstone Adventures."

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.380
Let me know if next
weekend works for dinner

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.910
so I can tell you all about it.

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.353
Send it.

00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:44.186
SCOTT HUFFMAN: Whoa.

00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:46.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.140
All right.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.720
Now, as you can see, this
required the Assistant

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.090
to understand when
Maggie was dictating

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:58.700
part of the message
versus when she was asking

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.070
it to complete an action.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.700
Thanks, Maggie.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.795
MAGGIE: Thanks, Scott.

00:27:02.795 --> 00:27:05.927
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.930
SCOTT HUFFMAN: By moving
these powerful AI models

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.290
right onto your phone, we're
envisioning a paradigm shift.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:17.010
This next generation assistant
will let you instantly

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.790
operate your phone with your
voice, multitask across apps,

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:25.560
and complete complex actions,
all with nearly zero latency.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.540
And actions like turning
on the flashlight,

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.610
opening Gmail, or
checking your calendar

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.690
will even work offline.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.780
Now, it's a very hard
problem we've been solving.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.110
And I'm really excited to share,
the realization of this vision

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.680
is not far off.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.190
In fact, this next
generation assistant

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:45.122
is coming to the new Pixel
phones later this year.

00:27:45.122 --> 00:27:48.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.990
All right.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.390
Now our mission is to make
the Assistant the best way

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.070
to get things done.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.890
You just saw how we're
making it much faster.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:01.060
But it also has to be personal
enough to really help you.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.610
Now, personalized help is
especially important in areas

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.860
where people's
preferences completely

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.620
differ, like choosing
what to listen to,

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.360
what to do on the weekend,
or even what to eat.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.540
So let's look at
a recipe example.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.890
Hey, Google, what should
I cook for dinner?

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.600
ASSISTANT: Here are some
recipe picks for you.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.050
SCOTT HUFFMAN: Now
as you can see,

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.980
the Assistant picked
recipes tailored to me.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.560
For example, it suggested
a bourbon chicken recipe,

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.640
because it's helped me with
barbecue recipes in the past.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.800
Now what I really love is
that different people get

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.500
completely different results.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.100
We call this feature
Picks for You.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.850
And it will be launching
on smart displays

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:45.310
later this summer, starting with
recipes, podcasts, and events.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.980
Now, beyond your preferences,
becoming more personal

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.620
means the Assistant will better
understand the people, places,

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.980
and events that are
important to you.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.480
Now, one important
person in my life

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.660
is my mom, who I'm going
to visit right after I/O.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.790
So let's say I asked
my Assistant, how's

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.490
the traffic to Mom's house?

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:06.310
Now, we all understand what
I mean by Mom's house, right?

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.230
Well, if I'm in
Toledo, Mom's House

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:12.310
might have meant this place,
a nonprofit childcare center.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.910
In other cities, Mom's House
can be a restaurant or a grocery

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:16.700
store.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.540
In fact, there's lots of
things in the world called

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.650
Mom's House.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.740
Now, in linguistics, the
process of figuring out

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:28.270
which thing a phrase refers to
is called reference resolution.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.600
And it's fundamental to
understanding human language.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.160
At Google, we
approached this problem

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.990
using our knowledge
graph of things

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.338
in the world and
their relationships.

00:29:37.338 --> 00:29:39.130
It's what allows us to
understand something

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.040
like the Starbucks near
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.890
Today, we're expanding
the Assistant's ability

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.700
to understand you better by
applying those same techniques

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.710
to the things in your world.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.570
We call it Personal References.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.320
So if I shared my mom's contact
info with the Assistant,

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.380
I can ask, hey, Google, what's
the weather like at Mom's house

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.577
this weekend?

00:30:00.577 --> 00:30:02.410
ASSISTANT: Friday and
Saturday in Carmichael

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.197
will be partly cloudy.

00:30:04.197 --> 00:30:06.280
SCOTT HUFFMAN: How long
will it take to get there?

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.655
ASSISTANT: With
light traffic, it

00:30:07.655 --> 00:30:09.430
will take you two
hours and 14 minutes

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.592
to get to 123 Main
Street by car.

00:30:11.592 --> 00:30:13.300
SCOTT HUFFMAN: Remind
me to order flowers

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.885
a week before Mom's birthday.

00:30:14.885 --> 00:30:15.760
ASSISTANT: All right.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.107
I'll remind you on July 3.

00:30:18.107 --> 00:30:19.690
SCOTT HUFFMAN: And
it goes beyond Mom.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.060
If you've shared important
people, places, and events

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.880
with the Assistant, you'll be
able to ask for things more

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.750
naturally.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.530
Like, show me photos of my son,
or directions to the restaurant

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.690
reservation, or
reminding me to pick up

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.000
chocolates on my anniversary.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.130
And rest assured, you're
always in control.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.950
You can edit or delete
this information

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:44.443
at any time in the updated
You tab in Assistant settings.

00:30:44.443 --> 00:30:45.860
Now, one place
where the Assistant

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.220
can be especially
helpful is in the car,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.790
offering a safer hands-free
way to get everything you

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.760
need while you're on the road.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.510
Now, we've been focused
on the main things

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.460
that we all want
when we're driving--

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.280
to get where we're going safely,
to catch up with friends,

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.220
and listen to something
interesting along the way.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.860
Last year, we brought the
Assistant to Android Auto.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.440
And earlier this year,
we added it to Navigation

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.000
in Google Maps.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.580
I'm happy to share,
the Assistant

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.230
is also coming to Waze
in the next few weeks.

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.020
Now, I'd like to
show you the future

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.020
of how we're improving your
mobile driving experience even

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.010
more.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:25.400
Introducing the Assistant's
new driving mode.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.780
Just put your phone
in the car and say,

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.830
hey, Google, let's drive.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:33.620
Driving mode has a
thoughtfully designed dashboard

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.620
that brings your most relevant
activities front and center

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.470
while you're driving,
and includes suggestions

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.670
personalized for you.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.610
For example, if you have
a dinner reservation

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:46.370
on your calendar, you'll
see a convenient shortcut

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.590
to navigate to the restaurant.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.440
Or if you started a podcast
at home in the morning,

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.060
once you get in
your car, it will

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.820
display a shortcut
to resume the episode

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.910
right where you left off.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.810
Now it also highlights
top contacts,

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:02.600
making it easy to call
them or message them,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.340
and recommendations for
other things to listen to.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.080
Now, once you're navigating,
phone calls and music

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.390
appear in a low
profile way, so you

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:15.710
can get things done without
leaving your navigation screen.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.853

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.130
So if a call comes
in, the Assistant

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.170
will tell you who's
calling and ask

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.060

answer without having

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.485

and how it's able to help

So far, we've talked about
building a more helpful Google.

It's equally important to us
that we do this for everyone.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.860
"For everyone" is a core
philosophy for us at Google.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.500

the earliest days,

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.585

whether you you

00:35:29.585 --> 00:35:34.670
were a professor at Stanford or
a student in rural Indonesia.

and products that are
accessible at their core.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.610
Let's start with
building AI for everyone.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.980
Bias has been a
concern in science

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.860
long before machine
learning came along.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:31.100
But the stakes are
clearly higher with AI.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.040
It's not enough to
know if a model works.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.560
We need to know how it works.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.830
We want to ensure that our AI
models don't reinforce bias

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.080
that exists in the real world.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.810
It's a hard problem,
which is why

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:48.880
we are doing fundamental
computer science

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.570
research to improve the
transparency of machine

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:55.100
learning models and reduce bias.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.190
Let me show you what I mean.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.480
When computer scientists
deploy machine learning models,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.640
it can sometimes be
difficult to understand why

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.920
they make a certain prediction.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.420
That's because most
machine learning

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:12.010
models appear to operate
on low level features--

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:16.450
edges and lines in a picture,
color of a single pixel.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.220
That's very different
than the higher

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.790
level concepts more
familiar to humans,

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:25.020
like stripes on a zebra.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:28.260
To tackle this problem,
Google AI researchers

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.380
are working on a new
methodology called TCAV,

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.800
or testing with concept
activation vectors.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.300
Let me give you an example.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.450
If it's a machine
learning model, trained

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:43.620
to detect zebras, you would
want to know which variables

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.990
were being used to decide if the
image contained a zebra or not.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:51.480
TCAV can help you understand
if the concept of stripes

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.090
was important to the
model's prediction.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:57.060
In this particular
case, it makes sense.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.450
Stripes are an important
predictor for the model.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:06.060
Now suppose a classifier was
trained on pictures of doctors.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.700
If the training data
was mostly males

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:12.480
wearing coats and
stethoscopes, then the model

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.930
could inaccurately
assume that being male

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.840
was an important
prediction factor.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.970
There are other important
examples as well.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.870
Now imagine an AI
system that could help

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:27.240
with detecting skin cancer.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.540
To be effective, it
would need to recognize

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.170
a wide variety of skin
tones representative

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.580
of the entire population.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.630
There's a lot more to
do, but we are committed

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:44.740
to building AI in a way that's
fair and works for everyone,

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.630
including identifying and
addressing bias in our own ML

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:52.020
models and sharing
tools and open data

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.360
sets to help you as well.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.160
Another way we
build for everyone

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.790
is by ensuring that our
products are safe and private,

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:03.190
and that people have
clear, meaningful choices

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.940
around their data.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.750
We strongly believe that
privacy and security are

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.790
for everyone, not just a few.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.570
This is why powerful privacy
features and controls

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.510
have always been built
into Google services.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:21.620
We launched incognito mode
in Chrome over a decade ago.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:25.310
We pioneered Google Takeout,
which gives you easy controls

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:29.480

any time you choose to.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.270
But we know our work on privacy
and security is never done.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.180
And we want to do more to
stay ahead of constantly

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.672
evolving user expectations.

00:39:43.672 --> 00:39:45.380

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.750
and you can quickly access
the most relevant privacy

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:17.070
controls for search, in the
case of your data in search.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:21.120
Here, you can view and
manage your recent activity.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:25.720
And you can easily change
your privacy settings.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:29.770
Last week, we announced
auto-delete controls,

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:33.370
which you'll also be able to
access right from the app.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:37.150
Data helps make search
work better for you.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:40.390
And with auto-delete, you can
choose how long you want it

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:41.680
to be saved--

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:47.440
for example, three or 18 months,
after which any old data will

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.420
be automatically
and continuously

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.400
deleted from your account.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.960
This is launching today
for web and app activity.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.790
We'll be rolling it
out to location history

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:59.380
in the coming weeks.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.630
And we'll continue to
bring features such as this

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.430
to more controls over time.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:08.260
In addition, one-tap access
to your Google account

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.700
will be coming to
our major products,

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:15.710
including Chrome, search,
Assistant, YouTube,

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.490
Google News, and Maps.

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:22.810
And speaking of Maps, if you
tap on your profile photo,

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.520
in addition to
finding easy access

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.150
to your privacy controls, you'll
find a new feature, incognito

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.200
mode.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.320
Incognito mode has been a
popular feature in Chrome

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.770
since it launched.

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:35.800
And we are bringing
this to Maps.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.170
While in Incognito in
Maps, your activity,

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:42.040
like the places you
search and navigate to,

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.140
won't be linked to your account.

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:48.130
We want to make it easy to
enter in and out of Incognito.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:51.580
And maps Will soon
join Chrome and YouTube

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.260
with support for Incognito.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:57.889
And we'll be bringing it to
search as well this year.

00:41:57.889 --> 00:42:01.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.360
Another way we
ensure your privacy

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.840
is by working hard to
keep your data secure,

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.260
from Safe Browsing, which now
protects over 4 billion devices

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.040
everyday, to using TensorFlow
to significantly reduce

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.920
phishing attacks
in Gmail, we also

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.850
encourage users to use
two-step verification,

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:29.510
because an additional layer of
protection is always helpful.

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:32.210
Today, we are making
two-step verification

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:34.520
even more convenient
for everyone

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.220
by bringing the protection
of security keys

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.570
directly into your
Android phone.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:44.110
So now, you can confirm a
sign-in with just a tap.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.640
And today, it will be
available to over 1

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.065
billion compatible devices.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:55.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.430
We always want to
do more for users,

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.500
but do it with less
data over time.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.710
So we are applying the
same cutting edge AI

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:06.590
research that makes
our products better

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:10.820
and applying it to
enhance user privacy.

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.390
Federated Learning-- this
is a new approach to machine

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.460
learning developed by Google--

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.420
is one example.

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.280
It allows Google's AI products
to work better for you

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.950
and work better for
everyone without collecting

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:27.830
raw data from your devices.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:32.060
Instead of sending data to the
cloud, we flipped the model.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:36.350
We ship machine learning
models directly to your device.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:40.220
Each phone computes an
update to the global model.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:43.580
And only those
updates, not the data,

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:48.020
is securely uploaded and
aggregated in large batches

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.090
to improve the global model.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:52.070
And then the
updated global model

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.870
is sent back to
everyone's device.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.730
Let me explain it with
a concrete example.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:00.770
Take Gboard, Google's keyboard.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:05.270
Using on-device learning alone,
when new words become popular,

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:08.330
Gboard would not be able to
suggest them until you've

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.130
typed them many times.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.500
Federated Learning,
however, allows

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:18.020
Gboard to learn new
words like BTS or YOLO

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.530
after thousands of people start
using them without Google ever

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.420
seeing anything you type.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:27.480
Actually, with BTS, it's
probably millions of people.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.130
This is not just research.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:32.300
In fact, Gboard is already
using Federated Learning

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:36.800
to improve next word prediction,
as well as emoji prediction,

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.870
across tens of
millions of devices.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.510
It's still very
early, but we are

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.780
excited about the progress
and the potential of Federated

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:49.152
Learning across many
more of our products.

00:44:49.152 --> 00:44:52.484
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:56.760
Privacy and security
are the foundation

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.080
for all the work we do.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.260
And we'll continue to push
the boundaries of technology

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.750
to make it even
better for our users.

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:08.950
Building for everyone also
means ensuring that everyone

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:11.290
can access our products.

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:15.220
The World Health Organization
estimates that 15%

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:17.170
of the world's population--

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:18.850
over 1 billion people--

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:20.880
has a disability.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.900
We believe technology can
help us be more inclusive.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.840
And AI is providing
us with new tools

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.270
to dramatically
improve experience

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.730
for people with disabilities.

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:35.930
For example, there are
almost 500 million people

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:40.010
in the world who are
deaf or hard of hearing.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.130
Think of how many
conversations are challenging,

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:46.070
from in-person discussions
and phone calls,

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:50.240
to even experiencing
videos online.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.140
A few months ago we
launched Live Transcribe,

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.170
powered by Google's
Cloud Speech API,

00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:00.720
to caption conversations
in real time.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.430
You can leave your
phone open with the app.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:07.020
And when someone speaks to you,
it transcribes their speech

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.310
into text.

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:12.510
Those who cannot-- or prefer
not to-- speak can also respond

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:14.310
by typing.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:17.270
I was really inspired by
how the product came about.

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:21.180
Two of our Google
researchers, Dimitri and Chet,

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.460
saw an opportunity
to help people

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.830
and collaborated
to develop the app.

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:30.180
Together, with a small team
of engineers and people

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:34.110
who volunteered their 20% time,
they built Live Transcribe.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.680
And it is now available in
over 70 languages and dialects

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.780
on Android devices.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:44.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:48.340
Today, we are going further
in extending this technology.

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.580
We are announcing a new
feature called Live Caption.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:55.810
Live Caption makes all
content, no matter its origin,

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:57.685
more accessible to everyone.

00:46:57.685 --> 00:47:01.660
The incredible thing is that
it works completely on device.

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.340
So there's no delay.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:06.430
With one click, you
can turn on captions

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:09.940
for a web video,
podcast, or even

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:11.950
on a moment you capture at home.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:14.290
SPEAKER 19: You like
the blueberries?

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:16.170
Blueberries.

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.856
Delicious?

00:47:17.856 --> 00:47:19.810
Here comes more.

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:21.090
Yum!

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.000
Show Daddy.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.663
Ah.

00:47:24.663 --> 00:47:26.835
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:27.335 --> 00:47:31.480
It's only possible due to our
recent breakthroughs in speech

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.490
recognition technology.

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:37.090
We recently tested Live
Caption with some users.

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:37.840
Let's take a look.

00:48:11.346 --> 00:48:15.114
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.600
You can imagine all the use
cases for the broader community

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.420
too--

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.050
for example, the ability to
watch any video if you're

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:27.580
in a meeting or on the subway
without disturbing the people

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:28.853
around you.

00:48:28.853 --> 00:48:31.270
The Android team is going to
talk a little bit later today

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.520
about what made Live
Caption possible.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.650
We're also exploring
how this technology

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:38.960
can caption phone calls.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.930
But we want to go one step
further and actually allow

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:46.130
more people to
respond and accomplish

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:48.880
tasks over their phones.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.950
As you'll see in
this example, Nicole,

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:53.690
who's deaf and
prefers not to speak,

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:56.620
can receive a call
from her hairstylist.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.540
With Smart Compose
and Smart Reply,

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:02.070
she can answer the
call and interact.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:02.820
Let's take a look.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.068
[PHONE RINGING]

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.090
ASSISTANT: Hi.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:09.770
This is Nicole's Assistive Chat.

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:11.720
She'll see what you
say, and her responses

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.165
will be read back to
you, starting now.

00:49:14.165 --> 00:49:15.110
JAMIE: Hi, Nicole.

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:15.870
It's Jamie.

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:16.370
How are you?

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.480
ASSISTANT: Hey, Jamie.

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.080
I'm good.

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.390
And you?

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:24.097
JAMIE: Great.

00:49:24.097 --> 00:49:26.180
Are we still on for your
1:00 PM haircut tomorrow?

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:33.130
ASSISTANT: Sorry,
can you do 3:00 PM?

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.540
JAMIE: Yes, I can do 3:00 PM.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.040
We have a lot to catch up on.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.488
I want to hear all
about your trip.

00:49:40.488 --> 00:49:41.280
ASSISTANT: Perfect.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.700
Thumbs up.

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:43.440
JAMIE: Great.

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.610
See you tomorrow.

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:46.380
Bye.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.711
SUNDAR PICHAI: Thumbs up indeed.

00:49:48.711 --> 00:49:52.527
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.290
We call this new
technology Live Relay.

00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:59.220
While there's still
more work to do,

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:03.500
we are excited to see how it
can help people like Nicole

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.720
get things done more easily.

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:10.000
Just like with Live Caption,
this runs completely on device,

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.330
and these conversations
remain private to you.

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:16.390
We also want to help those
with speech disorders,

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:22.210
or people whose speech has been
affected by a stroke or ALS.

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:25.480
Researchers from Google
AI are exploring the idea

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.930
of personalized communication
models that can better

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:31.600
understand different
types of speech,

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:36.580
as well as how AI can help
even those who cannot speak

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.170
to communicate.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:41.080
We call this research
Project Euphonia.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.273
Let's take a look.

00:50:42.273 --> 00:50:45.610
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:53:17.146 --> 00:53:21.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:25.813 --> 00:53:27.230
SUNDAR PICHAI: We
are working hard

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:29.030
to provide these
voice recognition

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:32.480
models through the Google
Assistant in the future.

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.390
But as you saw in
Dimitri's case,

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:37.990
this will only be possible
with many more speech samples

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:40.150
to train our models on.

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:43.450
If you or someone
you know has slurred

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:45.730
or hard to understand
speech, we'd

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:49.300
like to invite you to
submit voice samples

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:52.160
to help accelerate this effort.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.420
Fundamentally AI research
which enables new products

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:59.930
for people with disabilities
is an important way

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:02.390
we drive our mission forward.

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:06.530
Live Transcribe, Live
Caption, Live Relay,

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:10.430
and Project Euphonia will
ultimately result in products

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:13.460
that work better for all of us.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.070
It's a perfect
example of what we

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:20.530
mean by building a more
helpful Google for everyone.

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:24.450
One of the most powerful ways
we deliver help to our users

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:27.570
is through our open source
platforms like Android.

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:31.627
To tell you more, I'd like to
invite Steph onto the stage.

00:54:31.627 --> 00:54:32.621
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:54:32.621 --> 00:54:37.094
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:39.973 --> 00:54:41.890
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
It's amazing we're here

00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:44.830
to talk about
Android's version 10.

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:48.148
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:52.780
And we get to celebrate
a milestone together.

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:58.812
Today, there are over 2.5
billion active Android devices.

00:54:58.812 --> 00:55:01.976
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:02.705 --> 00:55:04.580
And today, we want to
walk you through what's

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:09.590
coming next in the Android
Q. Innovation, security,

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:10.490
and privacy--

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:13.010
the central theme
of the Q release,

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:15.920
and digital well-being.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.660
A lot has changed since 1.0.

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.720
Smartphones have evolved
from an early vision

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.080
to this integral
tool in our lives.

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.640
And they are incredibly helpful.

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.410
Looking ahead, we
see another big wave

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:31.400
of innovation coming to
make them even more helpful.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.130
Q shows Android shaping
the leading edge

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:37.760
of mobile innovation,
with over 180 device

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.920
makers around the world.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.270
Driven by this
powerful ecosystem,

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:46.160
many innovations have been first
on Android, from large screens

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.140
to the first OLED display.

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.540
And this year,
display technology

00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:53.480
will take an even bigger
leap with foldables coming

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.970
from multiple Android OEMs.

00:55:55.970 --> 00:56:00.690
These devices open up a
completely new category,

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.510
which, though early,
just might change

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:05.260
the future of mobile computing.

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.520
Foldables take advantage
of completely new display

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:08.150
technology.

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:10.610
They literally bend
and fold from phone

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:12.380
to tablet-sized screen.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:16.100
And Q maximizes what's
possible on these screens.

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:19.500
For instance, foldables
are great for multitasking.

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.180
So I can watch some funny
videos my sister sent me

00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:23.930
while we chat about
what we're going to do

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:27.230
for my mom on Mother's Day.

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:30.960
But the feature I'm most excited
about is screen continuity.

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.490
So let's say we finish chatting.

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:33.410
It's time to head out.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:35.840
And I'm standing around,
waiting for my ride.

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.470
So I start playing a game on
the folded smaller screen.

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:43.310
When I sit down and
unfold, the game seamlessly

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:44.750
transfers to the larger screen.

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:46.190
It is so cool.

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:48.710
And I can pick up exactly
where I was playing.

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:52.370
Now, multiple OEMs will
launch foldables this year,

00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:55.212
all running Android.

00:56:55.212 --> 00:56:59.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:04.470
Another exciting
innovation is 5G.

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:07.890
5G networks mean
consistently faster speeds

00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:10.050
with lower latency.

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:12.810
So apps and especially
games can target

00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:17.550
rich, immersive experiences
to these 5G-connected phones.

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:20.280
And Android Q
supports 5G natively.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:24.150
This year, more than 20
carriers will launch networks.

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:28.350
And our OEMs have over a
dozen 5G-ready phones all

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:29.550
launching this year.

00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:32.790
And they'll all be
running Android.

00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:34.590
Now, in addition to
hardware innovation,

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:38.820
we're also seeing huge firsts
in software, driven by advances

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.630
in on-device machine learning.

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:43.560
Sundar showed Live Caption.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:46.050
Now, I would really like
you to see it in action

00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:47.610
and then take you
under the hood.

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:50.187
Please welcome Tristan.

00:57:50.187 --> 00:57:53.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:56.930
TRISTAN: Like many people,
I watch videos without sound

00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:58.430
when I'm on the go.

00:57:58.430 --> 00:58:00.560
With captions, I
can still keep up,

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.960
even if I'm in a crowded space
or I'm sitting in a meeting.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.540
So for me, they're
super helpful.

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:10.220
But for almost 500 million
people who are deaf or hard

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.670
of hearing, captions
are critical.

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:17.090
Today, loads of mobile content
embeds audio, from video

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:20.180
to voice messages and
everything in between.

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:25.040
Without captions, this content
is nowhere near as accessible.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.520
Live Caption in Q takes
audio and instantly turns it

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.655
into text.

00:58:29.655 --> 00:58:32.030
Let's take a look at this
video my friend Heather sent me

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.960
yesterday.

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.620
To turn it on, I open
the volume rocker and tap

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.380
the Live Caption button.

00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:40.160
HEATHER: Hey, cutie.

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:43.550
Do you want to give
your puppy a hug?

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:44.290
Oh.

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:45.840
Oh, I guess not.

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.982
Puppy is walking away.

00:58:48.982 --> 00:58:51.350
TRISTAN: So as you can
see, these captions

00:58:51.350 --> 00:58:54.710
appear in real time, over
a video that would normally

00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:56.900
never have captions.

00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:01.510
You can expand them, contract
them, move them up and down.

00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:02.900
It's a lot of fun.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.900
But what makes this
feature so incredible

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:07.503
is that it's entirely
done on device.

00:59:07.503 --> 00:59:09.170
In fact, it doesn't
need to be connected

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:11.390
to the internet at all.

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:14.450
If we take a look,
this entire demo I've

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:15.560
done in airplane mode.

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.200
Thank you.

00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.440
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
Thank you, Tristan.

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:21.990
OK.

00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:23.850
So how is this possible?

00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:25.830
It's because of a
huge breakthrough

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:29.640
in speech recognition that
we made earlier this year.

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.010
This once required
streaming audio to the cloud

00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:35.350
to run a two-gigabyte
model for processing.

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:38.040
Now we can do that same
processing on device,

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:41.850
using a recurrent neural
net, in just 80 megabytes.

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:44.280
The live speech model
is running on the phone.

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:47.490
And no audio stream
ever leaves it.

00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:49.800
All this protects user privacy.

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.300
And this is OS-wide,
which means you

00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:55.770
get those captions in all your
apps and in web content too.

00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:57.450
Now, the same on-device
machine learning

00:59:57.450 --> 01:00:01.560
powers another useful Q
feature, which is Smart Reply.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.510
With Smart Reply,
the OS helpfully

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:05.340
suggests what you'll type next.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.170
It'll predict the
text you'll type--

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.310
even emoji.

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:10.080
And it's a huge time-saver.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.790
What's really cool
is, this works now

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:14.880
for all messaging
apps in Android.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.860
Like in Signal, you can
see the OS providing

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:18.570
these helpful suggestions.

01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:21.432
And Smart Reply can now
even predict the actions

01:00:21.432 --> 01:00:22.140
that you'll take.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.640
So say a friend
sends you an address.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.640
And normally, you copy
and paste that into Maps.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.020
That's kind of a hassle.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.630
With Smart Reply, you just
tap and it will open for you.

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:33.480
Now, all this is
saving you time.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.610
On-device machine
learning powers everything

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:38.340
from these incredible
breakthroughs like Live Caption

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.070
to helpful everyday
features like Smart Reply.

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:43.680
And it does this
with no user input

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:49.037
ever leaving the phone, all of
which protects user privacy.

01:00:49.037 --> 01:00:51.370
Now there's one more addition
to Android Q that's small,

01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:53.500
but you've been asking
us about for a while,

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.840
and that is dark theme.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.446
And we're launching it in Q.

01:00:56.446 --> 01:00:59.918
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:04.130
So you can activate it
by using the quick tile

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:05.690
or by turning on Battery Saver.

01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:07.730
And in fact, it will
help you save battery.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:11.030
Your OLED display is one of the
most power-hungry components

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:12.020
in your phone.

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.690
So by lighting up less pixels,
it will save you battery.

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:16.820
So that's innovation.

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:19.430
But we feel all
innovation must happen

01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:22.640
within a frame of
security and privacy.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.250
People now carry
phones constantly.

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:28.970
And we trust them with a
lot of personal information.

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:32.690
You should always be in
control of what you share

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:34.310
and who you share it with.

01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:36.470
And that's why the
second area we'll

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:39.170
cover in the central
focus of the release

01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:41.970
is security and privacy.

01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:44.690
Now, over the years,
Android's built out a huge set

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:46.340
of protections already--

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:49.160
file-based encryption,
SSL by default,

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.950
secure DNS, work profiles.

01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:54.770
And many of these
were first on Android.

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:58.070
Android has the most
widely deployed security

01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:03.170
and anti-malware service of any
OS, with Google Play Protect.

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:05.040
It runs on every device.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.090
And it scans over 50
billion apps a day.

01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:13.650
In fact, in Gartner's
2019 security report,

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:16.890
which was published
this week, Android

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:20.790
scored the highest
possible rating in 26

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:22.860
out of 30 categories.

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:25.710
It's ahead on multiple
points, from authentication,

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:30.070
to network security, to
malware protection, and more.

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:33.290
At the same time, we
wanted to go much further.

01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:36.190
And that's why Android Q
includes almost 50 features

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:39.100
focused on security
and privacy, all

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:43.490
providing more protection,
transparency, and control.

01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:46.330
So first, in Q, we brought
privacy to the top level

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:47.120
in settings.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.540
And there, you'll find a
number of important controls

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:50.830
all in one place--

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:53.920
activity data, location
history, ad settings.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.370
And you decide what's on or off.

01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:59.110
Now, location is
another place we've

01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:02.530
created tools for more
transparency and control.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:04.990
Now, location can be really
helpful, especially when

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:07.250
you're lost in a new place.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:10.730
But it's also some of your
most personal information.

01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:13.210
And you should, again,
always be in control

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:16.730
of who you share it with
and how they can use it.

01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:18.940
So first, if you're
wondering which

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.490
apps can be accessing
your location,

01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:23.710
we make it easy for you to know.

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:25.090
With Q, your device
will give you

01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:28.120
helpful reminders
whenever an app accesses

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.000
location when you're not
actively using that app.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.950
So you can review
and decide, do you

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:36.050
want to continue sharing or not?

01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:39.190
Second, Q will give you
more control over how you

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.410
share location data with apps.

01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:43.990
For example, say you want
to get pizza delivered.

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:46.030
You can choose to
share your location

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:48.780
only while the app is in use.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:53.343
And as soon as you close,
you'll stop sharing location.

01:03:53.343 --> 01:03:54.760
Finally, what if
you're wondering,

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.855
what kind of location
do all my apps have?

01:03:56.855 --> 01:03:58.720
In Q, we've brought
location controls

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.610
to the forefront in settings.

01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:04.060
So you can quickly review every
app and change location access

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:05.900
with simple controls.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.770
Now, there are many, many
more enhancements to security

01:04:08.770 --> 01:04:12.250
and privacy throughout
the OS, like TLC v3,

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:15.640
encryption for low-end devices,
randomizing your Mac address

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.253
by default, and many more.

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:19.420
And you can read about all
of these in our blog post

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.050
this week.

01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:24.110
But there's one more really
big thing for security.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:27.080
Now, your Android device
gets regular security updates

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:27.590
already.

01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:29.480
But you still have to
wait for the release.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.700
And you have to
reboot when they come.

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.530
We want you to
get these faster--

01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:34.950
even faster.

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:38.300
And that's why, in Q, we're
making a set of OS modules

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.400
updatable, directly
over the air.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.610
So now, these can be
updated individually as

01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:47.641
soon as they are available, and
without a reboot of the device.

01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:51.569
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:55.750
Now, this was a huge
technical challenge.

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:58.120
We're updating these in
the background the same way

01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.675
we're updating Google Apps.

01:04:59.675 --> 01:05:01.300
It's easier for our
partners, with whom

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.440
we're working closely.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.177
But more importantly,
it's much better for you.

01:05:05.177 --> 01:05:07.010
You can learn more about
this at the session

01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:08.440
"What's New in Android?"

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.940
Now, there's one
more thing that's

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.922
changed since the
early days of Android.

01:05:11.922 --> 01:05:13.630
Now, people carry
smartphones everywhere,

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:15.220
because they're really helpful.

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.760
But we're also spending
a lot of time on phones.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.590
And people tell
us sometimes they

01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:24.020
wish they'd spent more
time on other things.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:27.610
We want to help people find
balance and digital well-being.

01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:30.370
And yes, sometimes, this
means making it easier

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:34.210
to put your device away entirely
and focus on the times that

01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:35.380
really matter.

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:37.660
That's why, last year, we
launched digital well-being

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:41.470
tools with dashboards,
app timers, Flip to Shush,

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:44.500
and Wind Down to help you
set the phone down and get

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.910
to sleep at night.

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:47.920
And these tools
are really helping.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.080
App timers help users
stick to their goals

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.510
over 90% of the time.

01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:57.850
And users of Wind Down had a
27% drop in nighttime usage.

01:05:57.850 --> 01:05:59.290
If you're not using
these already,

01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.310
I would really recommend them.

01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:04.390
But this year, we want to help
even more with distraction.

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:06.880
A lot of times, I just
want to sit down and focus

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.952
to get something done.

01:06:07.952 --> 01:06:09.910
And when I'm trying to
do this-- like, working.

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:11.500
Maybe it's studying for you--

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.140
I don't want email or
anything else to distract me.

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.990
And that's why we've created
a new mode for Android.

01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:19.810
It's called Focus mode.

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.880
When I enter Focus mode,
I can select the apps

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.050
that I find distracting.

01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:25.700
For me, that's email, news.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:28.060
So now they're turned off
and I can really get to work.

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.190
Those apps that distract
me are disabled.

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:31.540
But I can still keep text.

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:34.210
Because it's important to
me that my family can always

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:36.880
get a hold of me, until
I come out of Focus mode.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.290
And then everything is back.

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:43.230
Focus mode is coming to
devices on P and Q this fall.

01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:46.730
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:51.790
Now, finally, I want
to talk about families.

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:56.470
For 84% of us parents,
technology use by our kids

01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:58.090
is a top concern.

01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:01.240
In the US, the average
age of kids getting phones

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.950
is now eight.

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:05.590
In Q, Family Link
parental controls

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:08.780
will be built right into
the settings of the device.

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.230
So when you set up a device
for someone in your family,

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:14.260
Family Link will help
connect it to a parent.

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:18.880
And you can review any apps that
your child wants to install.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.360
After that, you can set
daily screen time limits.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.160
You can check, where
are the apps where

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.020
my kids are spending time?

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.810
And you can set a device
bedtime so your kids can

01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:31.420
disconnect and get to sleep.

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:33.820
And now on Android Q,
you can set time limits

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.680
on specific apps.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.150
And when your child hits
that device bedtime,

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:40.150
if you want to give them
just five more minutes,

01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:42.588
now we have bonus time.

01:07:42.588 --> 01:07:46.280
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.780
Now, there's a ton
more in Q that we

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:48.863
don't have time to cover--

01:07:48.863 --> 01:07:51.080
a ton-- everything
from streaming media,

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.150
to hearing aids, to
better connectivity,

01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:55.550
to new gesture UI, and more.

01:07:55.550 --> 01:07:58.160
So today, I'm excited
to announce that Q Beta

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:02.210
3 is available on 21 devices.

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:05.290
That is 12 OEMS plus all Pixels.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:07.930
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:10.283
And that is more than
double last year.

01:08:10.283 --> 01:08:12.700
We hope you head over to the
link to get it on your phone,

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.830
because we would love
to have you try it out.

01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:16.486
And now I will hand
it over to Rick.

01:08:16.486 --> 01:08:17.319

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:28.170
Well, we've heard about some
terrific innovations today

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.510
in Android, AI,
and the Assistant,

01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:33.750
and real breakthroughs in how
we're able to help our users.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:35.609
I'd like to spend a
few minutes and talk

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:38.340
about how some of those come
to life in our made by Google

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.050
products.

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:43.319
Now, we continue to believe that
the biggest breakthroughs are

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:48.160
happening at the intersection
of AI, software, and hardware,

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.580
whether that's a tensor
processing unit, an entire data

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:55.890
center, the phone in your hand,
or a helpful smart display

01:08:55.890 --> 01:08:57.550
in your home.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.460
Let's start there.

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:04.290
The smart home of today is
fragmented and frustrating.

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:06.760
To deliver real
help in the home,

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.310
you can't start with technology.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.410
You have to start with people.

01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:13.979
And we've always worked to
put people first and build

01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:17.229
technology around their needs.

01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:19.710
There's no more important
place to get this right

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:20.880
than in the home.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.620

RICK OSTERLOH: Your home
is the most special place

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:27.995
in your life.

01:10:27.995 --> 01:10:30.120
So we need to be thoughtful
about the technology we

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.710
create for it.

01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:33.930
By putting people
first, we're going

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:39.322
beyond the idea of a smart home
to create a truly helpful home.

01:10:39.322 --> 01:10:41.530
Over the past year, we've
brought the Nest and Google

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:45.400
teams together to deliver on
our vision of the helpful home.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.640
And today, we're further
simplifying things,

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:53.440
bringing all of these products
together under the Nest name.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.650
As a single team and a
single product family,

01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:59.380
we're following a set of

reflect our commitment
to putting people first.

Now, to start, we
believe technology

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:08.170
should be easy for everyone
in the home to use,

01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:11.640
whether they're five or 95.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:15.220
The helpful home should also
be personal for everyone.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.840
With Google Assistant
at the core,

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.240
we can provide a
personalized experience

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:23.440
for the entire household,
even in communal spaces.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.440

home should work together

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:31.210
for a single seamless experience
across rooms and devices.

01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:32.710
Most importantly,
the helpful home

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:35.290
needs to respect your privacy.

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:38.650
And today, we're publishing
privacy commitments

01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:40.810
for our home
products that clearly

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:43.780
explain how they work,
the data we're storing,

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.550
and how it's used.

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:48.805
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.330
Our vision for the helpful home
is anchored in the Assistant.

01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:56.000
And as you heard
from Scott, we're

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.347
continuing to get more
helpful over time.

01:11:59.347 --> 01:12:01.430
We want to make sure that
you can get the help you

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:03.380
need where you need it.

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:07.340
Google Home Hub, which
we're renaming Nest Hub,

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:09.140
was designed
specifically to bring

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:13.460
the helpfulness of the Assistant
to any room in your house.

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:15.920
Now, we've also been working
on a new display that

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.530
builds on the things that
people love about Hub,

01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:20.600
but is designed
for communal spaces

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.700
in the home where
the family gathers.

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:25.800
Introducing Nest Hub Max.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.170
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:32.810
It's a new product that
has a camera and a larger

01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:35.690
10-inch display, which
is perfect for the center

01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:37.580
of your helpful home.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.790
Hub Max pulls together
your connected devices

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.760
into a home view dashboard,
where you can see your Nest

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.660
cams, you can switch on
lights, control your music,

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:49.940
and adjust your thermostat.

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.700
Hub Max also supports Thread.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:55.850
So just like Nest Connect,
it communicates directly

01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:58.370
with Thread-supported
devices that

01:12:58.370 --> 01:13:01.310
need a low power connection,
like door locks or motion

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:03.020
sensors.

01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:07.640
And we've designed Hub Max width
an incredibly helpful camera.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.750
If you want to know what's
going on in your home,

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:12.830
you can choose to use
it like a Nest Cam.

01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:15.088
You can turn it on when
you're away from home.

01:13:15.088 --> 01:13:16.880
You can check on things
right from the Nest

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.500
app in your phone.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.040
And just like a Nest Cam, it's
easy to see your event history,

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.345
enable home and away assist,
and you also get a notification

01:13:25.345 --> 01:13:27.470
if the camera detects any
motion or sees someone it

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:30.680
doesn't recognize in your home.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:35.090
Now, video calling is
easy too with Google Duo.

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:37.250
The camera has a
wide angle lens.

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:41.030
And it automatically adjusts to
keep you centered in the frame.

01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:44.660
You can chat with any
iOS or Android device,

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:48.300
or a PC with a Chrome browser.

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.410
You can also use Duo
to leave video messages

01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:54.380
for members of your household.

01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:58.880
Hub Max is designed to give you
full control over the camera.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.520
Nothing is streamed or recorded
unless you intentionally

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.420
enable it.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.550
And you'll always know
when the camera is on,

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:07.700
with a green indicator light.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:10.340
You have multiple controls
to disable camera features.

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:11.990
And a physical
switch on the back

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:16.130
electrically disconnects the
camera and the microphones.

01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:18.115
And you can see all
these controls clearly

01:14:18.115 --> 01:14:18.740
on the display.

01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:23.480
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:23.980
Thank you.

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:32.555
Hub Max is designed to be used
by multiple people in your home

01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:34.180
and provide everyone
with the help they

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.680
need in a personalized way.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.460
Now to help with that, we've
offered users the choice

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.650
to enable voice match,
so the Assistant

01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:46.120
can recognize your voice
and respond directly to you.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.070
But today, we're also
extending the options

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:50.830
to personalize using the
camera, with a feature

01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:53.530
we call Face Match.

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:56.530
For each person in your family
that chooses to turn it on,

01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:58.480
the Assistant guides
you through a process

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.960
of creating a face model, which
is then encrypted and stored

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.760
on the device.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.260
Then, whenever you walk
in front of the camera,

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.970
Hub Max recognizes you and shows
just your information and not

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:11.920
anyone else's.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.220
Face Match's facial
recognition technology

01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:18.220
is processed locally on the
device using on-device machine

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:22.290
learning, so the camera data
never leaves the device.

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:25.270
And in the morning, I
can walk into the kitchen

01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:27.040
and the Assistant
knows to greet me

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.430
with my calendar, my commuting
details, the weather,

01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:33.550
and any other information
I need to start my day.

01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:36.550
And when I get home,
Hub Max welcomes me

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:40.120
home with any reminders that
might be waiting for me.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.520
And the Assistant offers
personalized recommendations

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.630
for music and TV shows.

01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:48.130
And I can even see if anyone's
left me a video message.

01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:51.190
One of my favorite
things about Hub Max

01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:54.437
is that it's a great
digital photo frame.

01:15:54.437 --> 01:15:56.020
No matter what kind
of day I'm having,

01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.520
nothing makes me
feel better than

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.020
seeing some of my
favorite memories

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:01.120
on this beautiful screen.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.500
And the Google
Photos integration

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.880
makes this whole
process really simple.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.970
I can select my
family and friends.

01:16:06.970 --> 01:16:11.050
And Hub Max displays the best
photos of them from years ago

01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:13.198
or from earlier today.

01:16:13.198 --> 01:16:14.740
And now, with a
simple voice command,

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:19.580
sharing my favorite shots
is easier than ever.

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:22.270
The big screen
also makes Hub Max

01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:25.480
the kitchen TV you've
always wanted to.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.890
Tell it what you want to watch.

01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:28.480
Or if you need
help deciding, just

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.900
ask the Assistant to pull
up our new onscreen guide.

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:35.290
Hub Max can stream your
favorite live shows and sports

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:37.090
on YouTube TV.

01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:38.980
But unlike your
kitchen TV, it can also

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:42.310
teach you how to cook, see
who's at the front door,

01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:45.010
and play your music.

01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:46.875
You're also getting
full stereo sound--

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:47.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.517
--with a powerful
rear-facing woofer.

01:16:49.517 --> 01:16:51.100
And now, when the
volume's up, instead

01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:54.430
of yelling at the Assistant to
turn it down or pause the game,

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:57.040
with the camera, it's
as simple as a gesture.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.420
[PHONE RINGING]

01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.250
You just raise your hand.

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:04.010
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.630
And Hub Max uses
on-device machine

01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:12.240
learning to instantly
identify your gesture

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.460
and pause your media.

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:18.600
Hub Max is a Google
Assistant smart display

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.420
that's also a smart
home controller,

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:24.870
a TV for your kitchen,
a great digital photo

01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:30.250
frame, an indoor camera, and
it's perfect for video calling.

01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:34.780
All this will be available on
Nest Hub Max later this summer

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:36.280
for just $229.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.016
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:48.190
And today, we're lowering the
price of the original Nest Hub

01:17:48.190 --> 01:17:50.590
from $149 to $129.

01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:53.060
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:56.230
And we're expanding its
availability to 12 new markets

01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:58.120
and supporting
nine new languages.

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.960
So whether you prefer a Hub
with a camera or without one,

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:07.930
we have a device that'll
help you in your home.

01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:10.810
As I said earlier, there
is a fundamental difference

01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:13.660
between a smart home
and a helpful home.

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:16.600
And we're excited to unify all
our products under the Nest

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:22.920
brand to make the helpful home
more real for more people.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:23.420
All right.

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:25.455
Next, I want to
talk about Pixel.

01:18:25.455 --> 01:18:26.400
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.300
Yeah, thank you.

01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:33.470
And I love talking about Pixel.

01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:37.190
I want to talk about our work to
bring a more hopeful smartphone

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:40.160
experience to more people.

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.170
A core element of
Google's mission

01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:46.130
is to make technology more
available and accessible

01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:47.330
for everyone.

01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:49.020
And Sundar said it earlier.

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.440
We need to ensure that
technology benefits

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.780
the many, not just the few.

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.910
But there's been a
really troubling trend

01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:57.650
in the smartphone industry.

01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:59.690
To support the
latest technologies,

01:18:59.690 --> 01:19:01.490
everyone's high-end
phones are getting

01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:04.660
more and more expensive.

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.570
So we challenged
ourselves to see

01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:08.340
if we could optimize
our software

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.120
and AI to work great on
more affordable hardware,

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:15.000
so we can deliver these
high-end experiences at a more

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.473
accessible price point.

01:19:17.473 --> 01:19:19.890
I want to introduce you to the
newest members of the Pixel

01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:22.980
family, Google
Pixel 3a and 3a XL,

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:25.780
designed to deliver premium
features at a price people

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:26.770
will love.

01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:30.690
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:36.020
We didn't compromise on the
capabilities and performance

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.910
you'd expect from a
premium device, which

01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:40.310
is why we branded them Pixel.

01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:43.850
They start at just $399.

01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:45.738
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:45.738 --> 01:19:48.160
That's about half the price--

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.920
half the price of
typical flagship phones.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.750
And I want to introduce
Sabrina to tell

01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:54.212
you more about how we did it.

01:19:54.212 --> 01:19:56.180
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:00.608
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:00.608 --> 01:20:03.450
SABRINA ELLIS: Thanks, Rick.

01:20:03.450 --> 01:20:07.920
Delivering premium features
with high performance on a phone

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.080
at this price point--

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.080
it's been a huge
engineering challenge.

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.690
And I'm really proud
of what our team has

01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:19.320
been able to accomplish
with Pixel 3a.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:21.510
So let's start with the design.

01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:25.140
Pixel 3a follows the design
language of the Pixel family--

01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:28.260
the familiar two-tone
look, smooth finish,

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:30.430
and ergonomic unibody design.

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:34.320
It feels good in your hand
and it looks beautiful.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:38.880
Pixel 3a comes in three colors,
Just Black, Clearly White,

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.145
and a new color, Purple-ish.

01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:48.490
Everything looks amazing on
the vibrant OLED display.

01:20:48.490 --> 01:20:51.460
And your music, your
podcasts, they sound great

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:54.550
in premium stereo sound.

01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:59.500
Pixel 3a supports Bluetooth
5.0 and USB-C digital audio.

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:04.583
And we've also included a
3.5-millimeter audio jack.

01:21:04.583 --> 01:21:08.530
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:15.020
Because we've heard some people
want more headphone options.

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:20.550
But what Pixel is really known
for is its incredible camera.

01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:22.630
And with software
optimizations, we

01:21:22.630 --> 01:21:24.940
found a way to bring
our exclusive camera

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:28.360
features and our
industry-leading image quality

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:34.660
into Pixel 3a, so photos
look stunning in any light.

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:37.030
What other smartphone
cameras try

01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:39.970
to do with expensive
hardware, we

01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:43.030
can deliver with
software and AI,

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:46.960
including high-end
computational photography.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.430
So here's what that means.

01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:52.055
Pixel 3a can take amazing
photos in low lights--

01:21:52.055 --> 01:21:52.900
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:54.600
--with Night Sight.

01:21:58.490 --> 01:22:02.800
It's one of Pixel's
most popular features.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.500
We've also enabled
Pixel's portrait mode

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.870
on both the front
and rear cameras.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:14.290
And our Super Res Zoom applies
computational photography,

01:22:14.290 --> 01:22:16.630
so you can get closer
to your subject

01:22:16.630 --> 01:22:20.380
while still maintaining a
high degree of resolution.

01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:23.140
And all of your beautiful
photos are backed up

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:27.076
for free in high quality
with Google Photos.

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:30.478
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:34.640
Pixel 3a also has
the helpful features

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.410
you'd expect in a Pixel.

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.970
Just squeeze the
sides of your phone

01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:41.120
to bring up the
Google Assistant.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.360
We're using the AI in Pixel
3a to help manage your phone

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.830
calls too.

01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:50.030
I'm pretty sure we all
hate getting robocalls.

01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:52.910
And Call Screen uses
Google speech recognition

01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:55.880
and natural language processing
to help you filter out

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.650
those unwanted calls.

01:22:57.650 --> 01:23:01.580
It's already screening
millions of them.

01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:05.810
Now, you might remember, last
year, we shared our vision

01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:09.290
for using AR in Google Maps.

01:23:09.290 --> 01:23:12.770
Starting today on
Pixel phones, when

01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:15.380
you use walking
directions, instead of

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:18.380
staring at that blue
dot on your phone,

01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:21.680
you're going to see
arrows in the real world

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:23.575
to tell you where to turn next.

01:23:23.575 --> 01:23:27.086
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:31.820
We're just beginning our
journey with AR and Maps.

01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:34.340
And we're really
excited for Pixel users

01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:38.750
to experience this
early preview.

01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:41.390
Battery life-- it's one of
the most important features

01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:42.070
on a smartphone.

01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:43.620
It makes sense.

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:46.310
People need to know that
their phone won't quit on them

01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:48.710
before the end of their day.

01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:51.230
Pixel 3a has adaptive battery.

01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:53.510
It uses machine
learning to optimize

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:57.080
based on how you use your
phone, so you can get up

01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.424
to 30 hours on a single charge.

01:24:00.424 --> 01:24:01.400
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.460
And with the included
18-watt charger,

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:06.920
you'll get up to seven
hours of battery life

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:10.990
with just 15
minutes of charging.

01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:13.670
Pixel 3a doesn't compromise
on security either.

01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:17.420
It's got the same comprehensive
approach as Pixel 3.

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:20.330
On the hardware side,
our Titan M security chip

01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:23.270
protects your sensitive data
on the device, like login

01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:27.950
credentials, disk encryption,
app data, and OS integrity.

01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:31.070
On the software side, you get
the latest Google security

01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:33.360
patches and updates
for three years,

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.170
including Android Q this summer.

01:24:36.170 --> 01:24:39.350
So instead of getting slower
and less secure over time,

01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:44.360
your Pixel gets better
with every update.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.180
We think this hybrid approach
provides the strongest data

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:48.230
protection.

01:24:48.230 --> 01:24:51.050
And in a recent
Gartner report, Pixel

01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:55.453
scored the highest for built-in
security among smartphones.

01:24:55.453 --> 01:24:58.560
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.030
Pixel 3a offers the
complete Pixel experience.

01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:06.480
And we're proud to make it
available and affordable

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.470
to more people around the world.

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:12.210
Verizon's been a great partner
over the past two and a half

01:25:12.210 --> 01:25:13.440
years in the US.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.660
And we're excited to be
partnering with them again

01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:18.420
for the launch of Pixel 3a.

01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:22.920
And for the first time, we're
expanding our US carrier

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.280
partnerships.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:27.750
So the entire Pixel family
is now available for sale

01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:31.080
at T-Mobile, Sprint,
and US Cellular.

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.330
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:33.330 --> 01:25:36.750
You can also get Pixel
3a from the Google Store

01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:43.230
and use it on any US carrier,
including Google Fi and AT&amp;T.

01:25:43.230 --> 01:25:49.090
Pixel 3a and 3a XL are available
in 13 markets, starting today.

01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:52.570
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:55.330
You can find more details
online at the Google Store.

01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:59.350
We're really excited
to have you try it out.

01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:03.070
Next, Jeff will tell you about
our efforts in Google AI.

01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:06.340
But first, here's a quick
look at our new Pixel.

01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:09.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:26:36.452 --> 01:26:39.200
SPEAKER 22: Hey, Google,
show me donut shops nearby.

01:26:56.398 --> 01:26:57.366
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:57.366 --> 01:27:01.238
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.176
JEFF DEAN: Hi, everyone.

01:27:06.176 --> 01:27:09.480
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.520
Everything from building
a low cost premium

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.980
device like the one you just
saw without compromising

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:17.670
on capabilities to developing
a truly helpful Assistant

01:27:17.670 --> 01:27:19.710
were all built on
a tremendous amount

01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:22.200
of research and innovation
under the covers.

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.740
And they're examples of
what we do at Google AI.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.570
Google AI is a
collection of teams

01:27:27.570 --> 01:27:30.420
focused on making progress
in artificial intelligence

01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:34.650
research across a wide
range of different domains.

01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:38.220
We focus on solving fundamental
computer science challenges

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:41.520
in order to solve
problems for people.

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.770
That includes things like
improving speech recognition

01:27:43.770 --> 01:27:46.380
models to answer
questions faster and let

01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:48.870
you interact with
your device quickly,

01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:51.210
or pushing the boundaries
of computer vision

01:27:51.210 --> 01:27:53.650
to help people interact with
their world in new ways,

01:27:53.650 --> 01:27:55.630
as you've seen today.

01:27:55.630 --> 01:27:59.290
We publish papers, , release
open source software,

01:27:59.290 --> 01:28:02.650
and apply our research
to Google products.

01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:05.380
The goal is really to
solve problems everyday

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.760
that touch billions of people.

01:28:09.043 --> 01:28:10.710
One of the things I'm
most excited about

01:28:10.710 --> 01:28:13.350
is progress in
language understanding.

01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:16.020
As Scott mentioned earlier,
so much of our daily life

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:18.780
depends on actually
understanding language--

01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:21.870
reading traffic signs
and shopping lists,

01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:26.310
writing emails, communicating
with the people around us.

01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:28.860
We'd really want computers
to have the same fluency

01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:31.080
with language that we do--

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:33.910
not just understand
surface forms of the words,

01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:37.640
but actually understand
what sentences mean.

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:39.260
Unlocking that
would get us closer

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:41.840
to our mission of organizing
the world's information

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:46.240
and making it universally
accessible and useful.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.570
In the past few years,
we've made major strides.

01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:52.030
Take teaching a machine
to answer questions

01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:55.780
like this one about Carlsbad
Caverns, a national park in New

01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:58.380
Mexico.

01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:02.790
Only recently, the
state-of-the-art architecture

01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:05.670
for language understanding was
something called a recurrent

01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:08.220
neural network, or RNN.

01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:12.120
RNNs process words
sequentially, one after another.

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:14.220
They work well for
modeling short sequences,

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:16.260
like sentences,
but they struggle

01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:19.530
to make abstract
associations, like knowing

01:29:19.530 --> 01:29:22.860
that stalactites and stalagmites
are natural formations,

01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:26.840
and that cement pathways,
for example, are not.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.530
In 2017, we made a leap
forward with our research

01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:35.690
on transformers, models that
process words in parallel.

01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:38.890
One year later, we used
it as the foundation

01:29:38.890 --> 01:29:41.290
for a technique we called
bi-directional encoder

01:29:41.290 --> 01:29:43.990
representations
from transformers.

01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:48.690
It's a bit of a mouthful,
so we just call it BERT.

01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:51.650
BERT models can consider
the full context of a word

01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:55.690
by looking at the words that
come before and after it.

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:57.860
They're pre-trained
using plain text

01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:01.340
from the web and
other textual sources.

01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:04.220
To do that, we use a
process to train it

01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:07.430
that's a little like the
word game of Mad Libs.

01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:10.220
We hired about 20%
of the input words.

01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:13.760
And we train the model to
guess those missing words.

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:16.237
You can actually try this
at home with a bit of text

01:30:16.237 --> 01:30:16.820
that you have.

01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:19.310
Hide a few words and see if
you can guess what they are.

01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:21.650
That's effectively
what we're doing.

01:30:21.650 --> 01:30:23.450
This approach is
much more effective

01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:26.030
for understanding language.

01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:29.270
When we published the research,
BERT obtained state-of-the-art

01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:34.010
results on 11 different
language processing tasks.

01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:35.690
Fast forward to today.

01:30:35.690 --> 01:30:37.340
And we're excited
to see how BERT

01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:39.650
can help us answer more
complex questions that

01:30:39.650 --> 01:30:42.490
are relevant to
you, whether that's

01:30:42.490 --> 01:30:45.790
getting the flight time
from Indiana to Honolulu,

01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:48.370
learning a new
weightlifting exercise,

01:30:48.370 --> 01:30:52.070
or translating
between languages.

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:54.650
Research like this gets us
closer to technology that

01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:57.460
can truly understand language.

01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:00.310
We're now working with product
teams all across Google

01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:03.310
to see how we can use BERT to
solve more problems in more

01:31:03.310 --> 01:31:05.210
places.

01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:07.460
We're excited to bring this
to people around the world

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:11.870
to help them get the
information they need everyday.

01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:13.350
All this machine
learning momentum,

01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:18.080
though, wouldn't be possible
without platform innovation.

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:20.060
TensorFlow is the
software infrastructure

01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:22.340
that underlies our work
in machine learning

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:24.480
and artificial intelligence.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.982
When we developed TensorFlow,
we wanted everyone

01:31:26.982 --> 01:31:28.440
to be able to use
machine learning,

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:31.710
so we made it an
open source platform.

01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:33.830
And while it's been
essential to our work,

01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:37.310
we've been amazed to see what
other people outside of Google

01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:40.570
have used it for-- all
kinds of different things.

01:31:40.570 --> 01:31:44.280
We've seen engineers at
Roma Tre University in Italy

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.340
parsing handwritten
medieval manuscripts.

01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.620
We've seen coders
in France colorizing

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:51.540
black and white photography.

01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:54.865
We've even seen companies
developing fitness centers

01:31:54.865 --> 01:31:55.365
for cows.

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:01.750
The work that people are doing
is really inspiring to us.

01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:04.280
It pushes us to keep
asking ourselves,

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.430
how can machine
learning crack open

01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:11.500
previously unsolvable problems
in order to help more people?

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:16.360
One example is our work in
the field of health care.

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:19.490
We're really optimistic that our
research can create real world

01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:23.450
impact in medicine by improving
solutions and establishing

01:32:23.450 --> 01:32:25.940
new diagnostic procedures.

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:29.440
To share more, here's Dr. Lily
Peng from the Google AI health

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:30.394
care team.

01:32:30.394 --> 01:32:32.370
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:32:32.370 --> 01:32:36.322
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:40.274 --> 01:32:42.210
LILY PENG: Thanks, Jeff.

01:32:42.210 --> 01:32:44.730
So as a doctor,
what I care about

01:32:44.730 --> 01:32:47.760
most is improving
patients' lives.

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:51.960
And that means good care
and accurate diagnoses.

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:55.650
That's why I was so excited
two years ago at I/O

01:32:55.650 --> 01:32:59.070
when we shared our work
in diabetic retinopathy.

01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:01.410
This is a complication
of diabetes

01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:04.770
that puts over
400 million people

01:33:04.770 --> 01:33:08.190
around the world at
risk for vision loss.

01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:11.610
Since then, we've been piloting
this work with patients

01:33:11.610 --> 01:33:13.530
in clinical settings.

01:33:13.530 --> 01:33:15.210
Our partners have
fairly recently

01:33:15.210 --> 01:33:17.850
received European
regulatory approval

01:33:17.850 --> 01:33:19.860
for the machine learning model.

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:22.290
And we have clinical
deployments in Thailand

01:33:22.290 --> 01:33:24.060
and in India that
are already screening

01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:26.860
thousands of patients.

01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:29.610
In addition to diabetes,
one of the other areas

01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:34.080
we think AI can help
doctors is in oncology.

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.300
Today, we'd like
to share our work

01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:38.970
on another project
in cancer screening

01:33:38.970 --> 01:33:43.110
where AI can help catch
lung cancer earlier.

01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:47.820
So lung cancer causes more
deaths than any cancer.

01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:53.340
It's actually the most
common cause of death

01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:57.960
globally, accounting for
3% of annual mortality.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:00.990
We know that, when cases
are diagnosed early,

01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:03.850
patients have a higher
chance of survival.

01:34:03.850 --> 01:34:07.860
But unfortunately, over
80% of lung cancers

01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:10.490
are not caught early.

01:34:10.490 --> 01:34:12.720
Randomized control
trials have shown

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:17.040
that screening with low dose
CTs can help reduce mortality.

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.760
But there's opportunity to
make them more accurate.

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.390
So in a paper we are about to
publish in "Nature Medicine,"

01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:28.860
we describe a deep learning
model that can analyze CT scans

01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:31.650
and predict lung malignancies.

01:34:31.650 --> 01:34:35.490
To do it, we trained a neural
network with de-identified lung

01:34:35.490 --> 01:34:38.160
cancer scans from our
partners at the NCI--

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.230
the National Cancer Institute--

01:34:40.230 --> 01:34:42.660
and Northwestern University.

01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:45.810
By looking at many
examples, the model

01:34:45.810 --> 01:34:48.450
learns to detect
malignancy with performance

01:34:48.450 --> 01:34:53.130
that meets or exceeds that
of trained radiologists.

01:34:53.130 --> 01:34:56.490
So concretely, how
might this help?

01:34:56.490 --> 01:35:00.060
Very early stage
cancer is minuscule,

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:04.410
and can be hard to see, even
for seasoned radiologists, which

01:35:04.410 --> 01:35:07.980
means that many patients
with late stage lung cancer

01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:11.290
have subtle signs
on earlier scans.

01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:14.970
So take this case, where
an asymptomatic patient

01:35:14.970 --> 01:35:19.590
with no history of cancer
had a CT scan for screening.

01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:23.310
This scan was
interpreted as normal.

01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:26.840
One year later, that same
patient had another scan.

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:29.400
It picked up a late
stage cancer, one

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:32.020
that's much harder to treat.

01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:35.910
So we used our AI system to
review that initial scan.

01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:37.320
So let's be clear.

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:39.600
This is a tough case.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.570
We showed this initial
scan to other radiologists,

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:46.170
and five out of six
missed this cancer.

01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:49.800
But our model was able to detect
these early signs one year

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:52.590
before the patient was
actually diagnosed--

01:35:52.590 --> 01:35:53.940
one year.

01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:57.840
And that year could translate
to an increased survival rate

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:01.821
of 40% for patients like this.

01:36:01.821 --> 01:36:05.637
[APPLAUSE]

01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:14.050
So clearly, this is a
promising but early result.

01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:15.520
And we're very much
looking forward

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.470
to partnering with
the medical community

01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:19.660
to use technology
like this to help

01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:22.240
improve outcomes for patients.

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.236
Now I'll hand it back to Jeff.

01:36:24.236 --> 01:36:27.224
[APPLAUSE]

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:31.890
JEFF DEAN: Thanks, Lily.

01:36:31.890 --> 01:36:35.130
The same technologies that you
just saw driving health care

01:36:35.130 --> 01:36:38.490
innovation have applications
across almost every field

01:36:38.490 --> 01:36:40.750
imaginable.

01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:44.050
Our AI for Social Good program
brings together our efforts

01:36:44.050 --> 01:36:47.320
to use AI to explore and
address some of the world's

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.640
most challenging problems.

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:53.120
Last year, we announced the
program and its two pillars--

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.550
research and
engineering, and building

01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:57.780
the external ecosystem.

01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:01.340
Let's talk first about
research and engineering.

01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:04.310
One project we're working
that's already creating impact

01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:07.690
is our work on
flood forecasting.

01:37:07.690 --> 01:37:10.690
Floods are the most common,
deadliest natural disasters

01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:12.190
on the planet.

01:37:12.190 --> 01:37:15.190
Every year, they affect
up to 230 million people

01:37:15.190 --> 01:37:18.100
across the world, more
than storms and earthquakes

01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:19.890
combined.

01:37:19.890 --> 01:37:23.465
20% of flood fatalities
happen in India alone.

01:37:23.465 --> 01:37:24.840
This is a problem
that we're even

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:30.490
seeing this week with the
impact from Cyclone Fani.

01:37:30.490 --> 01:37:32.470
Floods prevent kids
from being able to play

01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:34.510
in their neighborhoods
or parents

01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:36.820
from protecting and
providing for their families,

01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:39.780
often because they don't
have enough advance warning.

01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:42.550
And without consistent
accurate warning systems,

01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:46.090
people are prone to ignore
warnings and be unprepared.

01:37:46.090 --> 01:37:51.090
That's especially detrimental in
areas hit with annual monsoons.

01:37:51.090 --> 01:37:54.150
That's why, last fall,
we shared our work

01:37:54.150 --> 01:37:56.910
on flood forecasting models
that can more accurately predict

01:37:56.910 --> 01:38:01.930
flood timing,
location, and severity.

01:38:01.930 --> 01:38:03.930
Through a partnership
with India's Central Water

01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:06.660
Commission, we began
sending early flood warnings

01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:10.370
to the phones of users
who might be affected.

01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:11.840
Today, we're
thrilled to announce

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.030
the expansion of our
detection and alerting

01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:16.850
system for the upcoming
monsoon season.

01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:18.710
The expanded area
will cover millions

01:38:18.710 --> 01:38:21.770
of people living along the
Ganges and Brahmaputra River

01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:23.450
areas.

01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:26.180
Not only are we increasing
the area of coverage,

01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:28.160
but we're also better
forecasting where

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:30.620
the floods will hit hardest.

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:33.320
Through a new version
of our public alerts,

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.390
people can better understand
whether they'll be affected,

01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:40.110
so they can protect
themselves and their families.

01:38:40.110 --> 01:38:42.000
Our model simulates
water behavior

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.820
across the flood plain,
showing the exact areas

01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.810
that will be affected.

01:38:46.810 --> 01:38:49.440
We combine thousands
of satellite images

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:51.870
to create high resolution
elevation maps,

01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:54.780
using a process similar
to stereographic imaging,

01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:57.270
to figure out the
height of the ground.

01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:59.560
We then use neural networks
to correct the terrain,

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.240
so it's even more accurate.

01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:02.700
And then we use
physics to simulate

01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:05.265
how flooding will happen.

01:39:05.265 --> 01:39:06.890
We also collaborate
with the government

01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:09.290
to receive up-to-date
stream gauge measurements

01:39:09.290 --> 01:39:11.030
and send forecasts in real time.

01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:16.060
We're excited to continue
working with partners

01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:19.090
to increase the accuracy and
precision of these models,

01:39:19.090 --> 01:39:21.340
which we hope will make
people safer from flooding all

01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:23.740
around the world.

01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:27.140
Research like this is critical.

01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:29.980
But we also know that AI will
have the biggest impact when

01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:32.230
people from many
different backgrounds

01:39:32.230 --> 01:39:37.480
all come together to develop new
solutions to problems they see.

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:41.050
That's why the second pillar of
our AI for Social Good program

01:39:41.050 --> 01:39:43.570
is to build the
external ecosystem.

01:39:43.570 --> 01:39:47.390
We want to empower everyone
to use AI to solve problems

01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:50.710
they see in their communities.

01:39:50.710 --> 01:39:53.560
Last year, we partnered
with Google.org

01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:57.840
to launch the Google
AI Impact Challenge.

01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.230
It was a call for nonprofits,
social enterprises,

01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:04.260
and universities to share
their ideas for using AI

01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:07.750
to address societal challenges.

01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:10.960
We received applications
from 119 countries

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:13.060
across six continents,
representing

01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:17.290
all kinds of sizes and
types of organizations.

01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:21.490
Today, we're really excited
to announce the 20 selected.

01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:23.660
We even have a few of
them with us today.

01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:25.738
Let's give them a warm welcome.

01:40:25.738 --> 01:40:29.610
[APPLAUSE]

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:34.030
Here's the list
of organizations.

01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:36.330
These organizations are
working on some of the world's

01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:38.640
most meaningful issues.

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:41.160
La Fondation Medicins
sans Frontieres

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:44.790
is using image recognition
to help medical staff analyze

01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:47.820
anti-microbial images
in order to prescribe

01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:52.300
the right antibiotics
for bacterial infections.

01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:54.760
New York University
in partnership

01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:56.710
with the Fire Department
of New York City

01:40:56.710 --> 01:40:59.350
is building a model to help
speed up emergency response

01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:00.730
times.

01:41:00.730 --> 01:41:04.280
This could really improve
public health and safety.

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:06.860
And Makerere
University in Uganda

01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:09.680
will use AI to create a
high resolution monitoring

01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:15.200
network to shape public policies
for improving air quality.

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.930
We'll be supporting
our 20 grantees

01:41:16.930 --> 01:41:20.070
and bringing these
ideas to life.

01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:25.810
We're providing $25 million
in funding from Google.org,

01:41:25.810 --> 01:41:28.180
as well as coaching and
resources from teams

01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.020
all across Google.

01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:32.330
Congratulations to
all our grantees.

01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:36.110
[APPLAUSE]

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.060
As we head into the
next decade, I'm

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.310
really excited about
what's to come.

01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:45.960
There are so many
promising avenues

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:48.750
for fundamental research.

01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:51.530
For instance, machine
learning models today,

01:41:51.530 --> 01:41:54.050
typically, we can get
them to be good at solving

01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:56.005
individual tasks.

01:41:56.005 --> 01:41:57.380
But what if they
could generalize

01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:01.370
across thousands of tasks,
solving new problems faster,

01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:04.310
and with just a few
examples to learn from?

01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:07.220
The keys to progress on these
kinds of research problems

01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:10.880
are those most human
characteristics, perseverance

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.690
and ingenuity.

01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:17.820
As you heard Sundar mention
at the start of the day,

01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:21.120
we're moving from a company
that helps you find answers

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:24.610
to a company that also
helps you get things done.

01:42:24.610 --> 01:42:28.430
And all the products we showed
you today share a single goal--

01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:31.200
to be helpful.

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:33.060
At the same time,
we want to ensure

01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:36.330
that the benefits of
technology are felt everywhere,

01:42:36.330 --> 01:42:40.620
continue to uphold our
foundation of user trust,

01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:43.940
and build a more helpful
Google for everyone.

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:46.270
To everyone joining
us on the livestream,

01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:48.370
thank you for tuning in.

01:42:48.370 --> 01:42:51.080
And to everyone here with
us in the audience today,

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.150
welcome to Google I/O 2019.

01:42:54.150 --> 01:42:55.140
Thank you.

01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:56.780
And enjoy the rest of I/O.

01:42:56.780 --> 01:43:00.730
