00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.330
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I remember the Krill, which this is radiolab.

2
00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:07.950
Today on this program we are calling it lost and found, right.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.780
We have stories of getting lost and of course getting found now.

4
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:15.870
I think we're gonna, we're gonna make a little adjustment here. Recalculating.

5
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.430
Shift gears. Approaching emotional lift. Thank God.

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.920
I'll give it to me.

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.390
This next story is a very different kind of lost and found sort of a love story.

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.830
If you can tell us your name. Oh, here's the guy. My name is Alan London guard.

9
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.100
Do you want to say anything more than that? I don't know. Is this,

10
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.750
is this for like a credit intro?

11
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.260
Let people introduce themselves? Oh, I don't know. I don't have a title. Okay.

12
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.260
All right. So that sound the girl Emily,

13
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.870
we'll meet her a bit later for reasons that will become clear.

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.230
The story begins on a fall day in Brooklyn.

15
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.440
And so the day in question, um,

16
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.860
I guess was the morning of October 8th.

17
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.470
They're both living in this one room loft in Brooklyn.

18
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.370
And we woke up and you know, both 21 went about our daily routine.

19
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:09.530
And prepared to go. He was in art school.

20
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.800
She was taking some time off from art school to work for a local artist.

21
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:15.680
So she would take the bike and I would take the train. What was it morning like?

22
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.850
It was a beautiful day. It was, you know, sun was low in the skies there,

23
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.230
you know, long shadows. I strapped on her helmet and adjusted it,

24
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.590
took her bike out for her. We kissed each other goodbye and said,

25
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:29.480
I love you and I watched your ride down the street.

26
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.820
<v 1>Mm.</v>

27
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.840
<v 0>It's early morning and then you know, on, I went down into the subway,</v>

28
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.720
six hours later he's working in the studio doing some sculpture and he gets a

29
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:46.700
call from a cop and he just said, Emily, you,

30
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.780
she had an accident. She's at Bellevue. This is the address.

31
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.900
And I said, oh, I mean, do you have any more information?

32
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.340
He just told me that it was bad.

33
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.700
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

34
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.660
<v 0>I was like carrying a bunch of stuff and I just dropped everything and started</v>

35
00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:02.494
running

36
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.010
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

37
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.560
<v 0>now Alan and Emily had only been together nine months,</v>

38
00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:10.630
but when it started says Alan,

39
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.610
it was just so immediate. The night they got together,

40
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.050
they both just kind of knew.

41
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.110
It was sort of like a weird prophetic kind of thing where I think it was the

42
00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:25.270
first day that the school has had a snow day. It was snowed out.

43
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:27.220
It was kind of like this past blizzard, you know,

44
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:30.430
sort of like the city shuts down, magical kind of thing.

45
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.410
He'd gone out with some friends just as the snow was coming down and we were

46
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.530
trapped at this party and that's where he bumped into Emily pint sized.

47
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.530
Cause he's big like you're destined eyes and very kind of,

48
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.860
I have trouble describing her voice. It's almost as if,

49
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.270
I know you guys are audio people, but it's like stereo. Almost.

50
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.430
Truth is they've known each other for a while,

51
00:02:57.431 --> 00:03:01.960
but that night says Allen fireworks all of a sudden and it felt right.

52
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.260
So you had, you had a feeling this wasn't just a thing, this was a thing, right,

53
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.310
right. Or the thing, the thing, right. The thing that you think the sole thing.

54
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.533
Yeah. All right.

55
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.290
<v 2>Well, Emily, uh, they've always been boys frowned to Emily. I mean,</v>

56
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.850
Susan Garcia, Emily's mom, she says at first when Emily told her about Allen,

57
00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:21.900
she thought, okay, so that's another boy. Right?

58
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.120
Emily seemed to have that effect on boys perhaps because she didn't really seem

59
00:03:26.121 --> 00:03:26.954
to need them.

60
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.290
Here is someone who's been obsessed with art and it's given up every body in her

61
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:35.780
life for art. At the age of six,

62
00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:38.300
she was creating her own comic books in junior high school.

63
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.280
She took drawing classes every night.

64
00:03:40.281 --> 00:03:43.400
And then in high school she left us friends,

65
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.250
boyfriends to go to a high school of the arts in Florida.

66
00:03:46.251 --> 00:03:51.200
No one stands in the way of her art. It's all she sees. It's all she focuses on.

67
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.300
But then she visited Emily in May,

68
00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:55.640
a few months before the accident and she met Alan.

69
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.250
I met Alan and he was delightful. Um,

70
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.620
but there was a different look that I'd never seen in Emily's eyes before when

71
00:04:03.621 --> 00:04:06.350
she looked at him and I didn't like it.

72
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.820
Tell us about the accident from your perspective. For My, for when I, yeah,

73
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.730
I was at work. I, you're in New Orleans mattering,

74
00:04:16.731 --> 00:04:21.731
which is a suburb of New Orleans and I get a telephone call and I looked and I

75
00:04:22.071 --> 00:04:25.850
saw it was Allen Allen has never called me before, answered the phone.

76
00:04:25.851 --> 00:04:29.390
I said Hello Allen. And he said, ah, you have to come.

77
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.070
Emily was hit by a truck,

78
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.120
<v 0>uh, 18 wheelers, semi truck.</v>

79
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.770
<v 2>And I took a breath and I said, Alan, is Emily dead?</v>

80
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.480
And he said, no, but you need to get here as soon as possible. Six hours later,

81
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.560
her and her husband, Emily's dad, we're at Bellevue hospital here in Manhattan.

82
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.770
They brought us into the, her Roman surgical ICU.

83
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.390
<v 0>We all went in, she was just lying in bed and they were tubes, tubes down,</v>

84
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:57.990
her throat coming in and out and her face was so swollen.

85
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.980
Emily covered in blood wait at probably at the time of the accident,

86
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:06.981
about a hundred pounds and she then weighed 128 she had swollen 28 pounds.

87
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.330
She had multiple fractures in her leg and her pelvis and the left side of her

88
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:13.164
face

89
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.040
<v 2>open her abdomen and they had taken her intestines out and put them on top of</v>

90
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:19.990
her body so that she could breathe

91
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.660
<v 0>and she was just lying completely still.</v>

92
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.550
You know that first 48 hours, nothing moved.

93
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.460
Not Nothing. We took up shifts, you know,

94
00:05:31.461 --> 00:05:34.650
her mother would be there in the day and her father in the evening and then I

95
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.653
would be there with her.

96
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.470
<v 2>Her eyes weren't even flickering and as she sat there watching Emily not move,</v>

97
00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:42.660
she says, she kept thinking, why?

98
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.010
I've got these four kids and everything bad seems to happen to Emily starting at

99
00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:51.510
six months. Wow. Ear Infections than sinus infections than asthma.

100
00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:52.530
Then by kindergarten,

101
00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:55.710
Emily was losing her hearing for reasons no one could quite figure out.

102
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.310
She had to get hearing aids on both sides, but somehow

103
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.400
<v 0>her mom says, all this just made Emily more fierce.</v>

104
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.430
If anyone can conquer this, it's Emily.

105
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.570
I think on the second day they started to take her off her medication,

106
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.200
expecting to see some sort of reaction from her and

107
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.893
nothing,

108
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.553
<v 1>nothing.</v>

109
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.780
<v 2>There was a nurse and the nurse said that Emily was gone and asked me about</v>

110
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.530
organ donations. And I said yes. And so,

111
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.850
um, I worked up enough courage to go into what they call the track room,

112
00:06:36.851 --> 00:06:38.560
which is where the residents usually are.

113
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.000
And there was one woman residents sitting at a computer and I went and I said,

114
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.070
when are you going to let Emily go? And she,

115
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:51.071
so we will have a family meeting tomorrow morning and we'll talk then.

116
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.640
And so I said, okay. And I, I left and I went back and,

117
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.770
and I'm sitting with Emily side of her bed and I'm telling her,

118
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:02.620
Emily and I read the book, the bridge of San Louis,

119
00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:06.730
right when she was a sophomore. And I remember the ending of the book.

120
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.190
There's a land of the living,

121
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.440
there's a land of death and the bridge is love and that love is the only thing

122
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:16.750
that survives and is kind of the weight goes.

123
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.650
And so I was sitting there with Emily and I was telling this to,

124
00:07:20.651 --> 00:07:25.150
I was saying this and talking in her ear and saying this and talking to her and

125
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:28.060
telling her that I would love her eternally through all time.

126
00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:32.620
That I love with never end. And Emily raised her left hand.

127
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.673
<v 1>Did</v>

128
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.150
<v 2>I got it. I can wait. What was it was, it was chaos.</v>

129
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.860
I was yelling for the nurse. I saw it. I saw her move.

130
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.330
<v 0>That was really one of the really abrupt moment. Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.380
<v 2>Now they knew Emily was not dead. Emily was alive,</v>

132
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.880
but how alive

133
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.390
<v 0>over the next few days says Allen, she slowly started moving more,</v>

134
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.800
not really in response to anything. She'd arrive in bed,

135
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.550
scratch her leg where there was a wound, we would hold her hand. Yeah,

136
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.760
<v 2>and she'd slap, slap our hands away.</v>

137
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.980
<v 0>When they tell this to the doctors, the doctors would say,</v>

138
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.660
that's not indicative of any kind of mental functioning. Could just be a reflex.

139
00:08:19.661 --> 00:08:24.100
Really. So the medical team began trying to determine just how damaged was,

140
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.270
see the ophthalmologist teams were coming in and they were trying to get Emily's

141
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:32.110
eyes to eye pupils to respond and they weren't responsive.

142
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.280
And so I knew what that meant. What did that mean? Image? She could be blind.

143
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.530
So Emily couldn't see, couldn't hear because remember she wore hearing aids.

144
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.840
And why didn't you just put those in? We tried,

145
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.830
we tried many times to put it in, but she just wouldn't allow it.

146
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.690
But what you do exactly when you did it,

147
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.170
flail her head shake around kick and she would hit,

148
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.990
had a lot of bruises on my body where kicked me and pinched. So we, we stopped.

149
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.880
We every once in a while we would go back to it, but there was the question,

150
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.660
you know, um, maybe she couldn't hear anymore. So what do you,

151
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:08.060
what do you do to a WHO's key?

152
00:09:08.061 --> 00:09:11.800
You don't know what's going on inside her and you can't get to her. Um,

153
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.690
you send it to a nursing home and you know,

154
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.730
that's where she would have remained. And after several weeks in the ICU,

155
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.160
Emily, she was stable and that meant they had to make a decision.

156
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.180
Once you become stable,

157
00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:29.780
then you have to move off surgical ICU and out of the hospital to either a

158
00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:33.200
rehabilitation or to a nursing home. So that became the new question.

159
00:09:33.201 --> 00:09:35.960
Where would she go? Could she be repaired, so to speak?

160
00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:39.560
In which case you'd go to Rehab or is it for her,

161
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.930
in which case she'd go to a nursing home.

162
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.280
Now making that call medically is um, sometimes tricky.

163
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.080
That's Dr McCalla Eisenberg.

164
00:09:48.081 --> 00:09:51.530
She's a physician at NYU and it's her job to make that call.

165
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.880
And she says one of the key criteria for getting someone into rehab to do Rehab

166
00:09:55.881 --> 00:09:58.820
on somebody, you need to have them reacting to you.

167
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.980
A person needs to be able to participate in a meaningful way for three hours of

168
00:10:03.981 --> 00:10:04.880
therapy a day.

169
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.900
They have to be able to follow commands because that's how you rehabilitate

170
00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:12.620
someone. If the person can't hear, if the person can't see,

171
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.560
then there's no way to communicate with her.

172
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.220
And so they made the assessment that she could not go to rehab and that Emily

173
00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:23.900
should go to a nursing home.

174
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.510
<v 1>Mm.</v>

175
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.530
<v 3>So is that my husband back to New Orleans to look for a nursing home?</v>

176
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.040
<v 0>Did they can bring her back too?</v>

177
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.640
They just kept it all secret from me that they were going to take her away from

178
00:10:39.641 --> 00:10:40.600
me. I mean, how do you

179
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.000
<v 3>tell someone who loves your daughter that much? That we're taking her away.</v>

180
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.620
But there was not just one life that we had in our hands. It was two lives.

181
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.580
We felt that that would be the best thing for him.

182
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:53.990
<v 4>Um,</v>

183
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.250
<v 3>and Alan could hate us.</v>

184
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.490
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

185
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:01.200
<v 3>maybe as a way for him to bridge and let go for that grief.</v>

186
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.020
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

187
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.860
<v 0>but then as the doctors are prepping Emily to move her to a nursing home,</v>

188
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.980
they had to remove her tracheotomy, which was helping her breathe.

189
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:15.570
And she all of a sudden started talking. Really? She, she spoke? Yes.

190
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.130
What was she saying? She would curse. Don't touch me.

191
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:22.670
You blanked a blank. You know, she would say, stop.

192
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.160
This was in response to someone touching her, touching her.

193
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.990
And if she wasn't cursing, says Ellen,

194
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.500
she would call everybody Miss Dash would certain people that were touching her

195
00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:32.420
where mustache would, oh,

196
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.400
that's from sense and sensibility quoting Jane Aust Yellow. Yeah.

197
00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:40.430
We had watched the movie like a couple months previous to this,

198
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:45.460
so somehow she was locked in the movie and it was just the assumption of the

199
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:48.620
doctors that she was just sort of mentally damaged.

200
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.620
But if she's calling people Ms Dashwood, doesn't that at least mean something?

201
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.810
No, it wasn't enough to say that Emily could follow a command,

202
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:59.590
like set up, raise your right hand. So the plan was still the nursing home,

203
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.210
right? I mean though, every possibility had not been exhausted. I can see him,

204
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:09.250
he was sitting across the room and his jaws were just clenched.

205
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.500
It just was not going to give up. And he was saying,

206
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.880
you have to give her a chance. She, you have to give her the chance.

207
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.260
You have a plan. No, I had no plan whatsoever. No, that was lost.

208
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:25.000
This experience was just completely traumatic to me emotionally.

209
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:29.300
But at the same time, I was going to help her in whatever way I could. Uh,

210
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.610
the only trajectory I had was to help her. And One night,

211
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.870
just a few days before Emily was going to be discharged to a nursing home away

212
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:40.810
from him, I was there alone with her and his 3:00 AM or something,

213
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.690
and she was calm. Like she wasn't trying to fight me away or anything.

214
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.600
I had helped her fix a thing that was wrong with her, uh,

215
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.030
mouth wiring. It was like a wire that was poking her and I fixed it for it.

216
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.550
And he says at that moment something occurred to him. I really just was like,

217
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:56.020
in the recesses of my mind,

218
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.600
he thought of the story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan.

219
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.580
He'd read about it a few days earlier online and he thought, hmm,

220
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.090
what if I tried what Annie Sullivan did with Helen Keller on Emily?

221
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.120
I took her left hand with my left hand and I leaned over and using her wrist as

222
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:17.140
the baseline for the words in his finger is the pen I just wrote.

223
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.190
I waited a second. Oh, wait a second.

224
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.710
Oh, wait a second.

225
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.730
The he waited a second.

226
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.980
You then, according to Allen, she said to him, she said, Oh,

227
00:13:32.981 --> 00:13:34.180
you love me. Thank you.

228
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.480
She literally replied immediately because she knew who, you know,

229
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.750
she has no idea who I am.

230
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.873
<v 1>Uh,</v>

231
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.220
<v 0>now we had a way to get to her so he could figure out how much of her was</v>

232
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.700
actually there and maybe even prove it to the doctors. You know,

233
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:57.730
I had to have something that was conclusive to present to them.

234
00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.140
The following evening,

235
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.440
I took out my cell phone and it has a record function on it and I started

236
00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:05.614
recording

237
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.840
<v 6>question after question to determine her Tonya disability.</v>

238
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.890
<v 5>What is your name?</v>

239
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.430
<v 6>What? W? H. A. T.</v>

240
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.133
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

241
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.520
<v 6>Yes, I am</v>

242
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.123
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

243
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.680
<v 6>you finger spelled every letter? Yeah.</v>

244
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:36.263
<v 5>Hi.</v>

245
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.293
[inaudible]. [inaudible]

246
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.220
[inaudible] [inaudible]. Hi it. Hey

247
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.950
[inaudible] she's writing her name on the poem of Mine and

248
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.280
[inaudible] [inaudible].

249
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.870
<v 6>Alan called me four o'clock in the morning and said, you have to come now.</v>

250
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.943
I have proof.

251
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.220
<v 5>No, I'm going to ask her what year it is.</v>

252
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.060
What? Hi,

253
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.440
I'm going to ride year.

254
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.350
[inaudible] question mark.

255
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.560
[inaudible] Emily. Very good. Very, very good.

256
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.030
Do you know where you a question mark?

257
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.980
Okay. Right now I'm going to ride hospital

258
00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.600
<v 6>that there are about four 45 in the morning.</v>

259
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.610
Alan is over there by the bed continuing to finger spell and talk to her and

260
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.590
she, she calls him Allen.

261
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:25.630
She knows that this person who is finger spelling on her hand is named Allen,

262
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.950
but Alan can't get her to understand who he really is. That it's her ally.

263
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:31.900
<v 5>I'm just going to write my name again. Alan.</v>

264
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.580
<v 6>She just couldn't make that mental jump to connect her past life with her</v>

265
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:37.803
present.

266
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.480
<v 5>Hello? [inaudible].</v>

267
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:50.100
Are you a Jian? Am I Asian? Tell her no.

268
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.270
<v 6>Next thing I hear her say is</v>

269
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.610
<v 3>pull me out of the wall. She kept saying, pull me out.</v>

270
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.450
Please pull me out a few. It's dark in here. Pull me out.

271
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.070
Help me know you can do it. Pull me out of the wall. I kept saying I can't.

272
00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:13.200
I would write on her hand. I can't. Allen starts to sob and I'm crying too.

273
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.240
What are you thinking at this point? Wasn't enough. That wasn't enough.

274
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.620
It wasn't enough and I said, Allen,

275
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:26.020
ask her about her hearing aids and so he finger spelled hearing aid aid and she

276
00:17:27.711 --> 00:17:31.850
said, okay. He agreed with the hearing aid and for the first time,

277
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.630
so we put it in and switched it on. He said,

278
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.780
Emily, Emily, can you hear me? Me, Alan. And immediately

279
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:46.110
<v 6>everything came back to me. I was [inaudible] everything.</v>

280
00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.310
<v 3>The door opened and Emily stepped</v>

281
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.740
<v 7>out. She was back. Yeah.</v>

282
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.240
It's just a hearing his voice and you always had an eye.

283
00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.960
He's an anomalies day and I heard her say what?

284
00:17:59.961 --> 00:18:04.961
I had been waiting for her to say all those weeks [inaudible] she said,

285
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.360
Mama, no, I couldn't leave her there the whole time.

286
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.520
We asked Emily before she came back, where was she?

287
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.340
I didn't know where I was.

288
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:23.060
If I could see at all and I knew that I was sleeping and I was always dreaming.

289
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:30.290
She says people would come to her in her dreams and say, don't touch that.

290
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:35.360
Stop scratching your wounds. Nine genes, they blend in with reality.

291
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.210
She says she knew somehow that there are people around her,

292
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.780
but she couldn't get to them and that she also knew she was in a dream.

293
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.760
Why am I still sleeping? But you couldn't somehow wake up from, I felt helpless.

294
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.320
I felt really helpless. Where you waiting for someone like that?

295
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.650
I mean where are you? Cause I was waiting for

296
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.350
some communication, you know,

297
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:08.160
[inaudible] and I was really [inaudible]

298
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.050
Alan [inaudible] call to me

299
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.110
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

300
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.770
<v 7>Emily's now at the Rusk Institute,</v>

301
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.140
which is one of New York city's leading rehab centers.

302
00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.310
And on the day we visited her, she just had a breakthrough.

303
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:35.330
Today is the first day [inaudible] stand on both legs and walk,

304
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.220
actually walk.

305
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.040
I walked a hundred sheets actually today after rehab she'll be moving into an

306
00:19:42.041 --> 00:19:44.020
apartment in lower Manhattan with Allen.

307
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.460
She's blind and the chances of seeing again are slim.

308
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:52.600
But Allan plans to spend his time helping her cope and helping her find a new

309
00:19:52.601 --> 00:19:55.450
way to make art. Really. Can you, can you introduce yourself?

312
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:06.640
but I thought of one title. Yeah. And I'll do mine.
