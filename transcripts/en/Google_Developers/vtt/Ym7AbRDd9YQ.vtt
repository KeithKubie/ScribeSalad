[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.810
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: I want
to move on a little bit

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.990
towards another
challenge that I hear

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.510
from agencies time
and time again,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.330
which is about recruitment
growth and retention.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.840
So it's really tricky to
acquire very good talent

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.030
into a company.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.960
And it's even trickier,
in many respects,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.510
to keep that talent that.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.450
I'd say the turnover
rate in agencies

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.200
as a whole tends to
be a little bit higher

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.990
than many other organizations.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.450
So, what is it that you
do to maximize retention

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.042
within your company?

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:46.070
JEFF NAMNUM: So, I don't
want anybody to throw up,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.870
but we don't really have
many problems with retention.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.101
In fairness, we're probably
smaller than a lot of you all.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.260
But the reason that we don't--
and I'm talking maybe three

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.140
folks in the last three
years that we have lost.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.480
There's a few factors to that.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.480
One, we cheat, right?

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.620
We cheat on
recruitment big time.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.860
Kevin, my partner, was either
dumb enough or brilliant enough

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.270
to be one of the founders of
the Android Meetup in New York

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.270
City, which is now--
under the guidance

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.640
of our wonderful, wonderful,
brilliant Olivia--

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.300
something over 3,500 members.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.920
We do run the
Droidcon in New York,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.860
and we have our hand in most
of the Droidcons in America,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.670
in one way or another.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.480
We encourage our
folks to go speak.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.590
We sometimes force
our folks to speak.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.880
Part of coming to
Touchlab is you're

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.010
at the center of that little
developer and design world,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.900
and people are
going to know you,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.900
if you want them to know you.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:15.510
So we attract a very
specific kind of folk,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.690
but that's just our
way of cheating, right?

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.420
Novoda did something
very similar, right?

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.460
Knowing the boys over
there, Kevin and Carl

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.290
did an unbelievable
job of doing just

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.740
about the same damn thing in
parallel, in another country.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.580
And that thing, whatever
that thing is, I think

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.380
is crucial, right?

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.920
Kevin and I, we speak a lot.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.590
We're press hogs.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.810
And some people dig that.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.080
Plus, we have a
lot of fun, right?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.180
We have a really
good time internally.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.810
And it has paid off.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.690
I remember putting up our ad
for our very first designer,

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.170
our very first
in-house designer.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.030
And we got a reply the
same day from possibly one

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.480
of the best known,
outside of Google, Android

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.670
first designers.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.150
It was great, right?

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.220
But that's all because we cheat.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.510
I think if you're--
no offense, right?

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.940
Agency life is hard.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.350
If you're just
doing the same thing

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.380
that everybody else
is doing, you're not

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.482
getting who you really want.

00:03:32.482 --> 00:03:34.440
RYAN BATEMAN: Yeah, I
think that's good advice.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.370
PRADEEP NALLURI: Yeah.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.690
RYAN BATEMAN: Cheating
as a way to get ahead.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.690
Yeah, I would say getting
out into the community,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.260
automatically you
self-select the people who

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.250
want to be engaged in
the technology are then

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.230
part of your meetup group,
or-- yeah, people who are just

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.120
engaged with technology.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.347
And then in terms of
retention, if you then

00:03:55.347 --> 00:03:56.930
recognize that the
people you've hired

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.230
are driven by a passion
for this technology,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.990
again, that's
another way to cheat.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.640
Give them a conference budget.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.550
Help them plot a career path.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.430
Make sure there is education to
help them build as developers

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.660
or designers or proj managers.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.334
And, yeah, it's all cheating.

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:20.500
But you're just building
really, really great people

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.474
to work with.

00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:23.140
JEFF NAMNUM: And you
don't have to start

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.464
a meetup like your guys
did and like we did.

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:26.630
You don't have to start one.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.296
You can just get
involved in one, right?

00:04:28.296 --> 00:04:30.110
We didn't start the iOS meetups.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.180
You get involved in community.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.930
RYAN BATEMAN: That's
better than cheating.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.960
JEFF NAMNUM:
Community is so much

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.690
a nicer word than cheating.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.810
Community.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.270
It's loving.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.310
Loving and beautiful.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.435
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Pradeep,
anything to add to that?

00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:48.170
PRADEEP NALLURI: These guys
answered the holy grail, right?

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.670
Kidding.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.430
But I think we are in
the business of selling

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.680
our people's time and efforts.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.010
We should have a
people-first approach policy.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.970
There's a lot of jobs
for talented people.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.384
Why do they have to work
with your agency, right?

00:05:03.384 --> 00:05:04.800
That's something
you need to think

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.800
about every day, every
night before you go to bed.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.120
Enlisting people, give
them meaningful work,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.090
challenging work.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.530
Keep talking about how the
work they're going to do

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.560
is going to help the
community or the society.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.060
I think that's one thing.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.230
Keep paying for their learnings,
and they're unstoppable.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.676
In fact, we have [? Mustafa, ?]
[? Fanisha, ?] [INAUDIBLE],

00:05:26.676 --> 00:05:28.550
they're with the company
for last five years.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.760
They started out as interns.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.630
Our retention program is really,
really working well for us.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.040
They come through-- our
primary source of recruitment

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.280
is by internship.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.050
Then we put them through
something called Mutual Mobile

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.980
Academy.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.580
Jay's here.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.970
I think he can talk about it.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.380
Our senior leaders
in the company

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.530
actually conduct these classes.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.830
They do this training
program, training classes.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.760
So having in-house Academy,
and engineering leaders

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.450
conducting those courses for
the interns, and making sure

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.870
they're always working
on exciting stuff

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.810
and not just doing what
other agencies are doing--

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.260
if you're working
on emerging tech

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.704
it actually helps, because
they're constantly learning.

00:06:06.704 --> 00:06:07.870
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Excellent.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.450
But have you used any
of the Udacity content?

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.970
So there's professional
nanodegrees that are available,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.570
and some companies have
been doing study jams

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.930
where you actually bring
together a number of developers

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.060
to learn at the same
pace, at the same time.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.420
And that motivates
one another to go

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.920
through the program
at the same time

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.560
and actually, ideally, get
certified at the end of this.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.270
Is that something
you've adopted?

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.561
PRADEEP NALLURI: No, we plan
to actually use nanodegree

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:35.590
for our intern program.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.412
That's a prerequisite.

00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:39.870
Once you join, you need to get
certified within two months.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.411
Otherwise, you're
out of the company,

00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:43.030
out of the internship program.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.480
I think the senior
engineering team actually

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.750
did the advanced
courses in Udacity,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.804
and they have benefited
a lot from it.

00:06:49.804 --> 00:06:50.970
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Excellent.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.670
So what are the
benefits you've seen?

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.170
Has that been more about
speaking a common language?

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.299
Or uniting--

00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:59.340
PRADEEP NALLURI: It's
actually when our engineers

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.964
and when our developers,
designers, work on their craft,

00:07:01.964 --> 00:07:03.130
there's no internal benefit.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.750
But when they actually
speak to the client,

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.130
it actually shows in the
work and the kind of product

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.050
we ship.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.785
So that's the benefit we have.

00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:10.940
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Yeah.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.481
PRADEEP NALLURI:
The quality products

00:07:12.481 --> 00:07:15.740
you see in the app store,
that's because of the training

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.694
and the hard work these
guys do behind the scene.

00:07:18.694 --> 00:07:19.860
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Excellent.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.050
Anything to add to that
in terms of the training

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.215
that you run internally?

00:07:24.215 --> 00:07:26.340
RYAN BATEMAN: Yeah, we have
a very similar program.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.910
We run something called
Novoda University, where,

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.220
if you join the company, you
are put on to the training

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.110
program for a few months.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.200
You get time set aside to read
up on kind of common texts.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.700
We're now also integrating
Udacity courses.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.290
And the other kind of added
benefit we try and push

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.845
a little bit is we try and
get people on these courses

00:07:46.845 --> 00:07:48.220
to give what we
call hack intels.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.252
So they talk about what
they've been learning.

00:07:50.252 --> 00:07:52.710
And it's a chance to kind of
push them a little bit, maybe,

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.820
to talk to everyone else.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.930
So that's just a quick, kind
of 15-minute talk through.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.760
And then out of that
as well, it gives them

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.360
kind of a basis for speaking
technically to other people,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.640
if they don't have that already.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.350
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: And, Jeff,
what about Touchlab University?

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.901
The university
thing seems to be--

00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:14.400
JEFF NAMNUM: Touchlab University
was almost a very different

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.880
thing.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.830
So we don't have a formalized
program officially.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.550
Everybody goes through a thing.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.650
We don't have a name for it.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.050
We don't, at this
point, use Udacity.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.059
We are in New York.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.919
Since we're all
there, we're somewhat

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:42.065
fortunate in that
there is consistently

00:08:42.065 --> 00:08:43.190
something happening, right?

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.890
So our folks learn
from one another.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.750
They learn, quite frankly--
not to give him a big head--

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.930
but a lot from Kevin.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.850
And there's a lot of
one-on-one time with him.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.740
And then we have
them go teach, right?

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.770
We were very
fortunate to-- Kevin

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.390
helped develop a program over
at C4Q, Coalition for Queens,

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:15.610
which helps under-represented
folks learn development.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:21.530
We at least had a
hand in reviewing GAs.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.950
A General Assembly in America
has the official Android

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.450
course, in-person course.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.540
We had a hand in reviewing that.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.370
We have folks who
go out and mentor

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:37.080
different young
developer groups.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.410
There's a lot to learn in
the projects that we do,

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:46.020
because we tend not to do the
same thing twice very often.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.850
But we do think that
getting out and teaching,

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:55.171
and teaching one another,
also reinforces quite a bit.

00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:57.670
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: So actually,
the question I've got as well

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.970
is we're seeing quite a strong
debate between native and web,

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.940
and what's the role
between the two,

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.850
and whether you can just
get away with a web client

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.580
when the right time
is to go native.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.960
Do you have any strong
feelings about that?

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.420
So I'm going to ask you
last, because actually I

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.510
think-- actually I'll ask
you first on this one,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.070
because you'll sit very clearly
on one side of the equation,

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.770
I suspect.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.061
RYAN BATEMAN: Yeah, I mean yes.

00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:26.250
Yes and no.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.910
I think there are
certainly occasions

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:33.160
where hybrid applications
or web applications are

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.830
a good solution.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:40.685
I don't think it's as often as
certain companies would like.

00:10:40.685 --> 00:10:42.430
And from a budget
perspective, it

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.030
can't always make more sense.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.570
Native development does
inherently take longer.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.110
But certainly for Novoda, we're
very much focused on quality,

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.180
and we're very much focused
on quality of experience

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.880
from a user perspective.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.790
And I'd love to see
someone challenge it,

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.420
but I've yet to see a web
application that could

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.670
meet a good native experience.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.280
JEFF NAMNUM: Yes,
yes, yes, and yes.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.980
So, yeah, Kevin and I
have this discussion.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:21.260
And there are always
situations where

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:27.990
a hybrid-- that's a nice name--
a hybrid application makes

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.490
sense.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.530
And it's generally
where, quite frankly,

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.940
the user has no option, right?

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.430
It's an educational app.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.630
There's a specific
budget requirement.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.260
And what's the
student going to do?

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.560
Say, I really don't
like this, teacher?

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.100
So they have no option.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.430
It doesn't matter what their
experience is, because you

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.810
don't care, as an organization.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.070
Sometimes internal
corporate apps

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.670
are forced down the throats
for employees in the same way.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:00.680
As you can see, I'm
not a big huge fan.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.820
So when the experience doesn't
matter, great option, right?

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.910
When you don't give a crap about
the person who's getting it?

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.760
Awesome.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.970
I agree I've not
seen-- now that's not

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.780
to say I haven't seen really
great web applications

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:16.640
in native wrappers.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.580
I have seen that.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.580
I can think of a few shops
that do an awesome job at that.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.370
Active Theory is
one I'm thinking of.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.730
But those are damn
specific cases.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.375
They're like games or
event-driven things.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.800
The challenge with
native, both ways, right?

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.900
Because again, the platform is
increasingly, in my opinion,

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.000
increasingly going
to be less important.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.100
I'm not going to say
that out loud, though.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.340
The glass is what matters,
and getting to the glass

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.950
and delivering that
experience is what matters.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.530
And the big
challenge with native

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.820
is you're building the same
crap twice very often, right?

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.580
All the logic, everything
underneath the hood,

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.940
is the same damn thing twice.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.510
And as you're maintaining
it over the course of months

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.770
and years, you get
even copy/paste errors.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.790
And those things have to be
tracked down, and that cost,

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.680
that's a real cost.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.680
There are some good solutions.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:30.350
There may be a much better
solution on the horizon,

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.050
and that's all I'll
say about that.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.550
But it is the challenge.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.120
But there is no
comparison to native

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.687
when it comes to quality.

00:13:39.687 --> 00:13:41.270
RUPERT WHITEHEAD:
It's interesting you

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.870
say that in the context
of progressive web

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.860
apps like Flipkart, for
example, where you just

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:52.270
have a pure mobile web
experience that arguably

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.530
delivers a very
native-like experience

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.720
but purely using
web technologies

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.340
rather than, I'd say,
the hybrid web-view apps,

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.660
which is a slightly
different case.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.251
JEFF NAMNUM: Yeah,
doing a thing, yeah.

00:14:07.251 --> 00:14:09.750
PRADEEP NALLURI: We do have a
[INAUDIBLE] web team in Austin

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.570
in our office, and they
have shipped really, really

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.560
elegant products.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.242
So we are agnostic
in this debate.

00:14:16.242 --> 00:14:19.070
We apply what is the right
solution for the client.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.690
And we have shipped web-views
inside a native container.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.560
So we do what is
best for the client

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.280
or what is best for the product.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.700
We don't want to take the
sides and get into this

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.770
because-- but there
are times when you want

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.460
an extremely good experience.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.886
We recommend native.

00:14:38.886 --> 00:14:42.179
Yeah, we are on the
side of the native.

00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:43.970
RUPERT WHITEHEAD:
Another question I've got

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.697
is, have you
convinced-- I don't know

00:14:46.697 --> 00:14:48.280
if you've stumbled
across this problem

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.380
where, maybe they come from
the iOS side, your customer,

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.060
or they come from
the Android side.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.694
And they seem to believe
that one size fits all.

00:14:56.694 --> 00:14:59.110
I think you're kind of nodding
and smiling going, oh, I've

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.600
never come across it before.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.590
In that situation, have
you brought arguments

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.727
that actually worked with them,
to convince them that that's

00:15:10.727 --> 00:15:11.810
not the right way forward?

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.960
And I know trust is an
important part of that.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.990
We've talked about that
a little bit already.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.406
Is there anything
else that you've

00:15:17.406 --> 00:15:19.410
used to convince them
that actually they've

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:23.430
got to think a little bit
differently about this?

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.800
JEFF NAMNUM: Kevin and I have
two different little vignettes

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.720
that we're big fans
of in that situation.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.370
And Kevin's is-- and
I'll tell it wrong,

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.710
and Kevin will correct it later.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.510
Find Kevin later, and he will
tell this in the clever way.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.540
The stepchild theory, right?

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.080
Android users are damn
tired of being the stepchild

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.540
with the hand-me-downs.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.200
Here is your Instagram
app eight months later,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.030
stripped down in functionality.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.780
And you know what?

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.871
It looks just like an iOS
app and functions like one.

00:16:01.871 --> 00:16:06.310
And it doesn't feel right
to people, and they hate it.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.560
They hate it.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.000
I tend to talk more about
the ratings spiral, right?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.490
Android users, they're
going to be vocal.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.840
And they're going to vote
with their thumbs, right?

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.640
They're going to give you
the lowest star rating.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.850
And the second you dip below
4, really, but let's say 3.5,

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.520
people are thrilled
to give you 1s, right?

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.540
If you're above a 4,
then they're like, damn,

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.500
if I give this guy
a 1, it's like me.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.660
It's all me.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.310
But you're 3.5,
they're like, nope,

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.970
I'm thrilled to
just pile on the 1s.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.620
And then it's just
[BUZZING SOUND].

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.190
And that comes from not
feeling an experience, right?

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.780
Now we tell those
little stories,

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:55.330
but then really and truly it
is that design-- design has

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.700
to be centered on
a user, and it has

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:03.830
to be educated by the context
of that user, in whatever that--

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.440
and the context shifts
in different situations.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.390
But in the situation of mobile,
a very important context

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.550
is the platform that
they're used to.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.750
And you would never,
ever have a designer

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.150
with no experience in
iOS design an iOS app,

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.210
unless you just
had money to burn

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.675
and didn't care about results.

00:17:28.675 --> 00:17:32.150
And people relate to
that very quickly.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.340
RYAN BATEMAN: I would
say a good-- yeah,

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.940
building on that, a good
kind of thing we push

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.737
is the [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:39.737 --> 00:17:40.820
Yeah, that's a great idea.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.320
Cool.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.010
So we take that
basis of the design.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.270
We'll do just another
design for our own sake,

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.830
because we have our own opinion.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.788
And then we'll do some
very basic user testing,

00:17:49.788 --> 00:17:53.922
because we try and push
user research-based design.

00:17:53.922 --> 00:17:54.880
And oh, look, surprise.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.440
Oh, the iOS design doesn't
seem to work with the five

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.152
people we pulled in.

00:18:00.152 --> 00:18:01.610
Oh, well, we're
going to have to go

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.380
with the Android
design that's much more

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.260
native to the platform.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.340
And that's-- yeah,
it does depend.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.660
I think that you can't
do that all the time.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.640
But if all the arguments
fail, it's easier

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.386
just to pull in five random
people and say, yeah,

00:18:19.386 --> 00:18:21.402
this is our expert witness.

00:18:21.402 --> 00:18:23.610
PRADEEP NALLURI: In the past
we had issues with that.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.590
But I think with the
material coming along,

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.832
our customers and clients
understand the value of design.

00:18:30.832 --> 00:18:32.540
But it's still hand
me down, as you said.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:37.505
And the [INAUDIBLE]
had phone problem.

00:18:37.505 --> 00:18:41.100
They design primarily for iOS,
and when-- Android is always

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.720
second in thought and
always like product,

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.710
getting that Apple,
especially in North America.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.930
That's when we get iOS
designs, our designers actually

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.300
go through it and completely
do the material for it

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.394
and implement it.

00:18:53.394 --> 00:18:54.605
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Excellent.

00:18:54.605 --> 00:18:56.105
I'm going to come
to a last question

00:18:56.105 --> 00:18:58.350
now, because I know we're
running out of time.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:03.090
But if you were going to give
one tip to the other agencies

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.690
here, something you
found useful internally

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.060
within your own
company, that you

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.010
found a way of doing things that
maybe is not hugely well-known

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.570
but has been really helpful for
you as a company, what would it

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.210
be?

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:22.710
RYAN BATEMAN: So off my head,
the one tip, the silver bullet,

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.030
I would say listen
to your developers.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.920
If they feel like they're
building a bad app,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.961
odds are pretty good they
are building a bad app.

00:19:33.364 --> 00:19:35.030
Any agency, especially
in the beginning,

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.880
you take the work
that you can find,

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.399
and you build something
that's based on iOS.

00:19:41.399 --> 00:19:42.940
And if you listen
to your developers,

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.680
they hate doing that, because
they know instinctively

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.815
they're building something they
don't believe in or care about.

00:19:48.815 --> 00:19:51.190
And if you optimize for somebody
who's building something

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:55.960
that they believe is
a quality product,

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.700
then what you're
going to end up with

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.085
is probably a quality product.

00:20:00.085 --> 00:20:02.376
PRADEEP NALLURI: I think the
digital landscape is vast.

00:20:02.376 --> 00:20:04.727
And don't try to be jack of all.

00:20:04.727 --> 00:20:06.810
Pick few [? a verticle ?]
specializations,

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.110
and be world class
at it is my advice.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.020
JEFF NAMNUM: Say no.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.990
Say no when you know
you should say no.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.940
Stop saying yes when you
know you should say no.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.100
You know you should
have said no.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.420
You know that client is
the same damn client you

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.640
had three months ago, and he is
just as bad as that guy before.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.280
Say no.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.940
You know that decision is wrong.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.340
Say no.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.816
It sucks, and it's terrifying,
especially when you're little

00:20:35.816 --> 00:20:38.334
and you're starting, but say no.

00:20:38.334 --> 00:20:39.500
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Excellent.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.730
Well, thank you very
much to our panelists.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.380
I mean, there's a ton
of different things

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.910
we could talk about, and
I'd like you to explore

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.100
some of these topics later.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.690
It could be around
design, resource planning,

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:54.210
prototyping, interagency
collaboration, and continuing

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.290
these kind of
conversations afterwards.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.930
What team structures do you use?

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.670
How do you operate
teams effectively?

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.070
How do you deal with pipeline
management, structures, roles,

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.220
thinking about the market?

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.820
All of these things are
fascinating to talk about

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.930
and hear these different
perspectives in the room.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.550
So I'll just leave that with
you to think about, and thank

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.440
you very much to our panel.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.454
Thank you Jeff,
Pradeep, and Ryan.

00:21:16.454 --> 00:21:17.370
It's been fascinating.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:17.970
Well done.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:18.470
