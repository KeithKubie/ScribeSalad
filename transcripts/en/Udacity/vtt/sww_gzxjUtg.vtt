00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.100
Traits come in two main types, quantitative

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.510
or qualitative. Quantitative traits vary continuously over a

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.560
range of measurements, and display in statistics what

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.310
we call a normal distribution or bell curve.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.890
We've already talked about one of these breast

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.370
cancer risk. Good examples of this are. Things

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.230
like height or weight. You can see that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.480
measurements for height vary continuously over a range.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.840
And that we have an average height. But

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.800
there is a spectrum for all other possible

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.210
heights. Everybody has these traits. But they vary

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.590
in their quantities on a continuous spectrum. You could

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.400
be five feet tall. You could be six

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.040
feet tall. Anywhere in between. Now, qualitative traits don't

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.060
have this quantitative aspect. Instead, qualitative traits are

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.560
said to vary discontinuously. They measure the presence or

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.430
absence of something, maybe a category that something falls

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.200
into. For example, you may be right or left

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.720
handed or you may be ambidextrous which is a

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.740
mix of both. But we typically don't quantify a

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.630
trait like this. You're either right handed or you're

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.320
not. Now some of you more advanced learners out

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.040
there may take issue with this, sort of, simple

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.470
categorization here. But this is very useful in research.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.870
Being able to categorize traits as quantitative

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.610
or qualitative and then measure them accordingly. Allows

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.130
us to plan and carry out research that

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.000
can correlate with various outcomes. So let's look

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.060
at the polygenic trait of eye color,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.300
poylgenic, remember, meaning that it's influenced by multiple

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.580
genes. Suppose we classify everyone based on whether

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.420
they have. Brown eye color, green eye color,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.750
blue eye color. Would this be an example of a quantitative or qualitative trait?
