00:00:00.452 --> 00:00:04.337
- [Voiceover] The polynomial p
of x has four distinct zeros.

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:06.145
Four distinct zeros.

00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:08.041
Which of the following
graphs could represent

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.942
y is equal to p of x?

00:00:10.942 --> 00:00:12.594
Well, four distinct zeros means

00:00:12.594 --> 00:00:14.487
that the graph is going to intersect

00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:18.155
the x-axis exactly four times.

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:20.454
So this first one intersects the x-axis

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:23.646
one, two, three times.

00:00:23.646 --> 00:00:25.271
So we can rule that one out.

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:29.013
This one intersects the x-axis one, two,

00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:31.897
three, four, five times.

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:34.063
So can rule that one out.

00:00:34.063 --> 00:00:36.084
This one intersects the x-axis

00:00:36.084 --> 00:00:40.054
one, two, three, four times.

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:42.275
It has four distinct zeros.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.014
So this looks like,

00:00:44.014 --> 00:00:45.917
this one right over here
looks like our choice.

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:47.513
And this one right over here,

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:50.327
it actually only has two,

00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:52.964
two distinct zeros, or at least
that's what it looks like.

00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:54.624
So I'd rule that one out as well.

00:00:54.624 --> 00:00:56.331
So this is definitely going to be the one

00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:58.851
that has four distinct zeros.

00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:02.090
Zeros are the x-values

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.830
at which the function is equal,

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.246
or the polynomial in this case,

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:08.233
and which is a function of x,

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.741
is going to be equal to zero.

00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:11.647
And you can see that's happening

00:01:11.647 --> 00:01:13.607
exactly four times.
