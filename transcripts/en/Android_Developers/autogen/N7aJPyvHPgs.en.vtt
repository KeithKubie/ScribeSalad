I'm going to talk about Android wear and
how you can take advantage of adding

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550
how you can take advantage of adding
 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.020
how you can take advantage of adding
pages to your existing notifications if

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
pages to your existing notifications if
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.190

my next adventure so the app will
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.390
my next adventure so the app will
generate notifications whenever books

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
generate notifications whenever books
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.339
generate notifications whenever books
have borrowed or overdue to be returned

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
have borrowed or overdue to be returned
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.160
have borrowed or overdue to be returned
to the library on a phone there'll be a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
to the library on a phone there'll be a
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.870
to the library on a phone there'll be a
single notification indicating how many

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880
single notification indicating how many
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.860
single notification indicating how many
books are overdue

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
books are overdue
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.350
books are overdue
so with an Android wear device this is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
so with an Android wear device this is
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.270
so with an Android wear device this is
easily glanceable on your wrist and you

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
easily glanceable on your wrist and you
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.920
easily glanceable on your wrist and you
can see the notification without pulling

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
can see the notification without pulling
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.090
can see the notification without pulling
your phone out of your pocket

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
your phone out of your pocket
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.799
your phone out of your pocket
now since wearable displays are quite

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809
now since wearable displays are quite
 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510
now since wearable displays are quite
small there's a limit to what you can

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
small there's a limit to what you can
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.459
small there's a limit to what you can
see in a single glance however so what

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
see in a single glance however so what
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.979
see in a single glance however so what
can we do about this with Android wear

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
can we do about this with Android wear
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.410
can we do about this with Android wear
we support adding extra pages to a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
we support adding extra pages to a
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.240
we support adding extra pages to a
notification allowing you to swipe

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
notification allowing you to swipe
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.189
notification allowing you to swipe
sideways and see a lot more information

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
sideways and see a lot more information
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.040
sideways and see a lot more information
on the wearable we can see the specific

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
on the wearable we can see the specific
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200
on the wearable we can see the specific
titles and authors of each book that are

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
titles and authors of each book that are
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.420
titles and authors of each book that are
overdue and there can be some kind of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
overdue and there can be some kind of
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.210
overdue and there can be some kind of
action at the end as well so how do we

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
action at the end as well so how do we
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.130
action at the end as well so how do we
go and implement all this for a phone

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
go and implement all this for a phone
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080
go and implement all this for a phone
application your code will currently be

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
application your code will currently be
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.179
application your code will currently be
traversing some kind of array or a list

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
traversing some kind of array or a list
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.710
traversing some kind of array or a list
of books within a look like this and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
of books within a look like this and
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.990
of books within a look like this and
then calculating how many are overdue

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
then calculating how many are overdue
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.969
then calculating how many are overdue
from it you're probably already doing

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979
from it you're probably already doing
 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.590
from it you're probably already doing
this to generate the main notification

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
this to generate the main notification
 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480
this to generate the main notification
you can see here on the phone screenshot

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
you can see here on the phone screenshot
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.510
you can see here on the phone screenshot
at the bottom there to add extra pages

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
at the bottom there to add extra pages
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.640
at the bottom there to add extra pages
what you do is you modify your code to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
what you do is you modify your code to
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.859
what you do is you modify your code to
keep a list of extra notifications so

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
keep a list of extra notifications so
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.590
keep a list of extra notifications so
here I've created an ArrayList which we

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
here I've created an ArrayList which we
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.170
here I've created an ArrayList which we
were used to store these for use later

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180
were used to store these for use later
 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.460
were used to store these for use later
you would now modify your loop to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
you would now modify your loop to
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.230
you would now modify your loop to
generate a new notification for each

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
generate a new notification for each
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.120
generate a new notification for each
overdue item with whatever text you want

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
overdue item with whatever text you want
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.460
overdue item with whatever text you want
inside of it like this code here and you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
inside of it like this code here and you
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.510
inside of it like this code here and you
should add each of these into your

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
should add each of these into your
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.539
should add each of these into your
ArrayList for use later on so adding the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
ArrayList for use later on so adding the
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.010
ArrayList for use later on so adding the
extra pages to your code is now really

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
extra pages to your code is now really
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.539
extra pages to your code is now really
really easy so this is what your

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
really easy so this is what your
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.889
really easy so this is what your
existing code might look like right now

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
existing code might look like right now
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.499
existing code might look like right now
and then we now make a call to a method

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
and then we now make a call to a method
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.810
and then we now make a call to a method
called add pages and this takes in a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
called add pages and this takes in a
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.550
called add pages and this takes in a
collection so you can just pass any

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
collection so you can just pass any
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200
collection so you can just pass any
extras list you created earlier as a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
extras list you created earlier as a
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.539
extras list you created earlier as a
single argument so he can see it's just

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
single argument so he can see it's just
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.539
single argument so he can see it's just
a one line change so make sure you also

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
a one line change so make sure you also
 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.880
a one line change so make sure you also
use the new notification manager compat

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
use the new notification manager compat
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.130
use the new notification manager compat
instead of a notification manager from

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140
instead of a notification manager from
 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.260
instead of a notification manager from
the framework so the new notifications

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
the framework so the new notifications
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.520
the framework so the new notifications
are work properly with wearable

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
are work properly with wearable
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.600
are work properly with wearable
vices and finally you can combine pages

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
vices and finally you can combine pages
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.010
vices and finally you can combine pages
with the stack feature that was

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020
with the stack feature that was
 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.960
with the stack feature that was
discussed in my previous dev byte so

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
discussed in my previous dev byte so
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.040
discussed in my previous dev byte so
there are lots of combinations that are

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050
there are lots of combinations that are
 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.840
there are lots of combinations that are
possible here based on whatever you want

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850
possible here based on whatever you want
 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.210
possible here based on whatever you want
to do so that's it for pages it's a

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220
to do so that's it for pages it's a
 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.130
to do so that's it for pages it's a
really very simple way of adding extra

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140
really very simple way of adding extra
 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.930
really very simple way of adding extra
functionality to your existing Android
