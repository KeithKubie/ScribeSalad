00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.116
Every minute of every day,

00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:20.100
you breathe without even thinking about it.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.682
Your body does it on its own, from the day you're born until the day you die.

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:26.418
You have muscles contract to bring oxygen, a gas,

00:00:26.418 --> 00:00:31.316
into your lungs, which is then transferred by your bloodstream to every cell in your body.

00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:32.751
Gases are strange.

00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:36.283
We can't see them, but we know they're there because we can feel them.

00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:43.002
What we experience as wind is really trillions and trillions of gas molecules slamming into your body.

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:44.766
And it feels good, right?

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.116
Science is based on observation.

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:51.566
Unfortunately, we cannot observe gases with our eyes -- they're too small.

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:55.682
We have to use our other senses to make observations and draw conclusions.

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:58.600
Observations are then compiled, and we create a model.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.850
No, not that kind of model.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.266
A model is a way scientists describe the properties of physical phenomena.

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.532
First, gases always move in a straight line.

00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:13.316
We don't really have anything to demonstrate this with because gravity always pulls objects down.

00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:20.492
So imagine a bullet fired from a gun, and that bullet goes on at a constant speed in a perfectly straight line.

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:22.892
That would be like a gas molecule.

00:01:22.892 --> 00:01:27.560
Second, gases are so small, they occupy no volume on their own.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.009
As a group they do, blow up any balloon and you can see how that volume changes.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.959
But single gases have no volume compared to other forms of matter.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:43.143
Rather than calculating such a small amount of matter, we just call it zero for simplicity.

00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:48.110
Third, if gas molecules collide, and they do -- remember, these are assumptions --

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.458
their energy remains constant.

00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:55.976
An easy way to demonstrate this is by dropping a soccer ball with a tennis ball balanced on top.

00:01:55.976 --> 00:01:59.842
Because the soccer ball is bigger, it has more potential energy,

00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:03.342
and the energy from the larger ball is transferred to the smaller tennis ball

00:02:03.342 --> 00:02:05.959
and it flies away when that energy is transferred.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.608
The total energy stays the same.

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:10.340
Gases work the same way.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.842
If they collide, smaller particles will speed up, larger particles will slow down.

00:02:14.842 --> 00:02:17.541
The total energy is constant.

00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:22.643
Fourth, gases do not attract one another, and they don't like to touch.

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:27.559
But remember rule three. In reality, they do collide.

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:32.643
Finally, gases have energy that is proportional to the temperature.

00:02:32.643 --> 00:02:36.992
The higher the temperature, the higher the energy the gases have.

00:02:36.992 --> 00:02:43.093
The crazy thing is that at the same temperature, all gases have the same energy.

00:02:43.093 --> 00:02:47.542
It doesn't depend on the type of gas, just the temperature that gas is at.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:51.759
Keep in mind this is a model for the way gas particles behave, and based on our observations,

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.625
gases always move in straight lines.

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:57.143
They're so small, that they're not measurable on their own,

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.575
and they don't interact with one another.

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:04.127
But if they do bump into one another, that energy is transferred from one particle to another,

00:03:04.173 --> 00:03:06.425
and the total amount never changes.

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:08.592
Temperature has a major effect, and in fact,

00:03:08.592 --> 00:03:12.375
all gases at the same temperature have the same average energy.

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:15.159
Whew! I need to go catch my breath.
