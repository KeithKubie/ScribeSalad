Hey, so stop me if
you've heard this before.

00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:04.059
Don't actually stop the video.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.560
That's just an expression.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.409
But using a trusted
third party like Google

00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:08.950
to handle sign-in
for your app can be

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.000
a great benefit for everybody.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.570
Your users don't have to come
up with yet another username

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.510
and password, and
you as a developer

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.460
don't need to hire
a full-time security

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.300
team to keep that all safe.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.380
That said, developers
had a few concerns

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.940
with Google's original
sign-in library for iOS.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.020
Your users needed
a Google+ account,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.420
which not everybody had.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.810
It was also kind of big.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.990
And if your users didn't have
the Google+ app installed,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.630
it would swap them out to
Safari in order to complete

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.410
the sign-in process, which was a
kind of clunky user experience.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.120
This also led to some issues
during the app review process,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.854
which is never a good thing.

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:44.270
But I'm happy to
report that we've

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.770
addressed all these concerns
with the new Google Sign-in

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.190
library for iOS.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.645
Let's find out more on
this episode of Route 85.

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:53.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:04.510
So let's imagine
you've got an app

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.545
and you want your
users to sign in, maybe

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:08.670
so they can use their
account on different devices,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.515
maybe so they can access
their data on your server.

00:01:10.515 --> 00:01:12.660
You know, there's a number
of different reasons.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.480
And while you could certainly
deal with this yourself

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.590
by having your users
create their own usernames

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.420
and passwords and storing
them in a database somewhere,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.540
this can be a
hassle, particularly

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.640
if you don't have a dedicated
security team working 24/7

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.080
to keep that database safe.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.670
Do you?

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.990
And no, your cats don't count.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.560
Oh, but that is
good advice, though.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.310
So for many developers,
a better option

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.950
is to let a trusted third
party like Google take care

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.590
of the sign-in work for you.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.060
Your users can sign into Google
using an account that they

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.730
already have, and we give
you some profile information

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.110
that you can then
use to identify

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.760
that user for your app.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.510
And so that's what
you're looking at here.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.009
I'm clicking the
Sign-in with Google

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.940
button so that I can
sign into my account.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.070
I copy and paste my password so
that you people can't see it.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.020
I'm on to you.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.450
I click the Accept button, and
there we go, I'm signed in.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.950
So does this look
somewhat familiar?

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.074
I bet you it probably does.

00:02:01.074 --> 00:02:03.700
We've had Sign-in available
for many years now as part

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.140
of the Google+ library on iOS.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.330
But I'm using the new and
improved Google Sign-in

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.610
library, which comes with
a number of improvements

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.330
that you may not be aware of.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.010
For starters, I can now sign
in with any Google account,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.160
whether or not I've signed up
for Google+ with that account.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.970
Now, granted if you wanted to
see my Google+ relationship

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.480
status, or see who's in my
circles, or what have you,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.900
you could still do that.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.190
You'd add some Google+ scopes
to your sign-in request,

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.510
and then I would need
a Google+ account.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.022
But if all you're looking to
do is just sign-in a user so

00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:33.480
that you can remember
who they are,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.021
maybe get like their
name and profile

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:38.470
picture, just a plain old Google
account is all I would need.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.560
For another thing, it's
a lot more lightweight.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.470
This new Sign-in
library is about a third

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.846
of the size of
the old one, which

00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:45.803
means there's less stuff
for users to download,

00:02:45.803 --> 00:02:47.630
and, you know, that's
always a good thing.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.640
And finally, the user experience
has been greatly improved.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.580
With the older version
of Sign-in, signing in

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.380
involved one of two options.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.950
You could switch over to
the native Google+ app,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.900
or you could switch to Safari.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.482
Now, using the native
Google+ app wasn't so bad.

00:03:01.482 --> 00:03:02.690
In fact, it was pretty slick.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.720
It was nice.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.619
But not everybody
had that installed,

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.160
which meant that they were stuck
with swapping out to Safari,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.990
and this tended to be a less
slick experience and one

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.010
that sometimes lead to
rejections during the app

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.300
approval process.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.250
And that didn't
just make users sad,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.530
it made developers sad, too.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.300
So with the new version
of Google Sign-in,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.940
we'll first try and switch you
over to any native Google app

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.648
you might be signed
in to, whether that's

00:03:24.648 --> 00:03:27.192
Google Search, or YouTube,
Maps, or what have you.

00:03:27.192 --> 00:03:29.400
But if your user doesn't
have any of those installed,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.620
well, that's not a problem.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.230
We now slide up the
sign-in page in a UIWebView

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.580
right within the application.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.540
There's no more
switching out to Safari.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.610
Hurray!

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.010
Oh, and both these experiences
get a whole lot better

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.040
in iOS 9.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.520
For starters, we're able to
use a Safari view controller

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.770
for the embedded WebView,
which is not only

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.780
more secure than
using the old WebView,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.930
but it also means that
if your user has already

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.030
logged into Google
in Safari, they

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.520
don't need to do it again
when they sign in to your app.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.950
So that whole enter your
username and password thing

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.970
you saw earlier, we
get to skip that.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.550
And switching to a native app
is now super, super slick.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.896
Since iOS 9 is in beta,
according to Apple's NDA,

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:07.520
I'm technically not
allowed to show you

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.332
what it looks like, so this
picture of a unicorn barfing

00:04:10.332 --> 00:04:12.790
a rainbow will have to give
you a general idea of how great

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.550
it is.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.050
But seriously, the
whole experience,

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.370
it looks really nice in iOS 9.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.661
The team did a really good job.

00:04:17.661 --> 00:04:19.490
I think you're going
to be happy here.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.660
So to get started
using Google Sign-in,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.850
you can check out our
documentation here.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.870
Please note that the old Sign-in
experience is still available

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.090
as part of the Google+ library
and still sometimes shows up

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.916
in search results.

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:32.540
So you want to make
sure you're looking

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.470
at the documentation
with the green header

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.459
here, not this documentation
with the red one.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:39.500
But hey, you've made it
to the end of this video,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.540
so you must like videos,
or maybe you just like me.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.616
How you doing?

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.990
Either way, how
about I treat you

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.040
to a little video of my walking
through the process of adding

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.236
Google Sign-in to an app.

00:04:49.236 --> 00:04:50.110
Com on, follow along.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.902
It'll be fun.

00:04:50.902 --> 00:04:53.110
As for the rest of you, if
you don't like screencast,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.920
that's OK.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.680
I'll still see you
soon on Route 85.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.030
