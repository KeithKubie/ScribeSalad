FEMALE SPEAKER: Please
welcome Dr. Temple Grandin.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:10.886
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:13.340
DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN: It's
really great to be here today.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.780
I'm gonna talk about a
lot of different things.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.830
I was one of those kids that was
kind of different growing up,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.320
bullied and teased in school.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.020
And the thing that saved
me was my science teacher.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.080
I had a great
science teacher that

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.920
got me interested in doing all
kinds of interesting projects.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.265
Which brings it down to
you want to get kids doing

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:32.890
interesting stuff,
you're going to have

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.410
to show them interesting stuff.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.370
There's a scene in the HBO movie
where I got really interested

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.740
in optical illusion rooms.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.240
Well, and I actually saw
that optical illusion room

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.600
on a Bell Labs 16
millimeter movie-- now

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.850
I'm showing how long ago that
was-- on optical illusions.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.200
So you know, gotta get them
out there and show them stuff.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.430
Now the thing is,
what I want to do

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.270
is to get you thinking about
different kinds of minds

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.330
that think differently.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.599
When I was in 20s,
30s, and early 40s,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:09.180
I thought that everybody thought
the same way that I think.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.040
Then I asked this
question, and this

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.110
is where I learned how
thinking can be different.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.600
Access your memory
on a church steeple.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.990
How does that information
come into your mind?

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.290
I was shocked to find
out that a lot of people

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.780
get this vague,
generalized thing.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.260
I don't have any vague
generalized thing.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.280
I only have specific ones.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.030
Now you might ask, why am I
talking about church steeples?

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.340
Why don't I ask house or car?

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.630
Well, most people are so
familiar with their own home

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.020
or their own car, that
they're going to see that.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.570
But I wanted to ask you
something you don't own,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.010
but they're out there
and you have to see them

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.474
and everybody knows
what they are.

00:01:49.474 --> 00:01:51.140
And you have to see
a whole lot of them.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.150
You just can't even drive
around without seeing them.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.570
And that really
started giving me

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.130
some real insight that different
people think differently.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.430
So then I divided
the world into people

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.947
that think in words and
people that think in pictures.

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:06.780
And then I started to--
well, wait a minute.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.669
There's this other kind of
person that thinks in patterns.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.450
This is more the
mathematical kind of mind.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.895
Now when does something
become an abnormality?

00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:22.060
Well, you get a little
bit of the autism trait,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.940
you take out some social
stuff in the brain,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.076
and you get geek traits for
all kinds of fun tech stuff.

00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:32.450
I think a brain can either be
made more cognitive or more

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.340
thinking, or a brain
can be made more social.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.492
Because after all, who
invented the first stone spear?

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:42.460
It wasn't the yack-yacks around
the campfire, that's for sure.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.584
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:45.500
DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN: It
was some geek out there

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.750
in the back of the cave
chipping away at a rock

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.350
and figured out how to
get it fastened to a stick

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.910
and make a stone spear.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.600
You see, you get a little
bit of that autism trait,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.930
you get some advantages.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.440
You get too much
of the trait, you

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.832
get a very, very
severe handicap.

00:02:59.832 --> 00:03:02.290
'Cause one of the big problems
that you got with the autism

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.740
spectrum is it's so huge.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.970
At one end, you have got
lot of people, probably

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.370
people like Tesla, who
invented the power plant.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.210
You got a lot of people
in Silicon Valley.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.710
There's a lot of
them that are live.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.060
I don't talk about live ones.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.640
I'm only gonna talk
about dead ones

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.170
when I show their pictures.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.190
You know who all
the live ones are.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.580
You can look them up in
"Business Week" magazine,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.510
and it's really, really obvious.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.615
But you get a
little bit of-- you

00:03:30.615 --> 00:03:32.520
know, you get the
creative people.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.480
There tends to be
relatives of people

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.610
that may have bipolar disorder.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.080
There's more techies
in the autism careers.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.430
Now the thing is, an autism
diagnosis is not precise.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.420
And over the years they
kept changing the diagnosis.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.010
In the early '90s, they
put in Asperger's, where

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.060
now just geeks and nerds with
no speech delay become autistic.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.180
Then in 2013 they took that out.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.460
So now you've got this great
big mucky autism diagnosis that

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.380
goes from heads of Silicon
Valley companies down to people

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.140
that remain nonverbal and
cannot dress themselves.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.350
So you've got this
huge spectrum.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.730
OK, maybe that's heresy that
I put his picture up here.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.010
But I promised that I would
only talk about dead ones

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.350
and stuff I could dig off of
publicly available things,

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.640
like a very popular
book that's out now.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.320
Now the thing I want to
get you to think about

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.230
is what would happen
to little Albert today.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.170
Little Albert Einstein.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.970
He had no language until
he was three years old.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.870
Wasn't very social,
liked to line up blocks.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.590
He'd probably be labeled
autistic spectrum today.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.380
And little Stevie.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.410
Oh, weird loner.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.680
This is right out of publicly
available information.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.210
A weird, weird
loner that brought

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.130
snakes to his elementary
school and turned them loose.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.464
And then he was bullied and
bullied and bullied and teased,

00:05:00.464 --> 00:05:01.880
and what saved him
was getting out

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.660
in the neighborhood
computer club.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.420
This brings up a
really important thing.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.700
Getting these teenagers
that are kind of different,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.850
now today they're getting
addicted to video games.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.558
Sometimes getting
addicted to video games

00:05:11.558 --> 00:05:13.090
and get an autism
diagnosis and get

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.960
paid Social Security
to play video games.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.490
You have people saying I'm
too much down on video games.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.330
Well, I was just down
at JPL yesterday.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.020
And if you want to
work at JPL all day

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.720
and play video games at night, I
don't have a problem with that.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.160
What I'm getting
concerned about is

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.250
the kid that's getting
addicted to video games

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.400
and they're not
getting a job at JPL.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.850
That concerns me
very, very much.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.754
And so he was bullied.

00:05:36.754 --> 00:05:38.420
And then when he went
to work for Atari,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.490
he was such a filthy slob they
made him come in at night.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.832
No, being a filthy
slob's not OK.

00:05:43.832 --> 00:05:46.040
And there's a scene in the
movie where they slam down

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.330
a deodorant and they
said, "You stink.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.980
Use it."

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.330
That actually happened.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.020
This is where bosses
are gonna just have

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.960
to give some instruction
on how to behave at work.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.353
And being an absolutely filthy,
dirty slob I don't think

00:05:58.353 --> 00:06:00.830
is gonna be very
acceptable here either.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.720
It's just too gross.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.370
Now I like to look at
personality differences

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.950
sort of like a
music mixing board.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.270
It's not black and white.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.100
If I get a diagnosis for
tuberculosis, that's definite.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.420
I either got
tuberculosis or I don't.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.390
Or I've either had
tuberculosis or I didn't.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.640
So when I check the
Australian customs form, which

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.940
I did two months
ago, I can check

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.740
"I have never had tuberculosis."

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.950
That's definite.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.340
When you see autism, that's
a much more gray area.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.280
Geeks and nerds, when does
that turn into mild autism?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.320
No black or white dividing line.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.660
It's a continuous trait.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.290
And if you got rid of
this trait completely,

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.920
you won't have
any new employees.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.310
It's just that simple.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.700
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.190
DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN: Now I
am a total visual thinker.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.760
I think in
photo-realistic pictures.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.890
I don't think in words.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.690
So when I think about
designing something,

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.720
I can test run it and
see it in my head in 3D.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.412
Before 3D virtual
reality computer programs

00:07:08.412 --> 00:07:10.370
were invented, I could
sit in a conference room

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.820
and they could try stuff.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.236
And I could say,
well yeah, if you

00:07:13.236 --> 00:07:14.750
do that, that's not gonna work.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.010
And you might wonder
why is the chute curved?

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.640
Well, as the cattle
come on around the bend,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.160
they think they're going
back to where they came from.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.160
And that's one the
reasons why that works.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.170
I always get asked all
the time questions like,

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.580
do cows know they're
going to get slaughtered?

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.660
I had to answer that question
very early in my career.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.170
And I found they behaved exactly
the same way at a slaughter

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.750
plant as they behaved going up
a chute for the veterinarian.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.830
It's not stress free.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.280
But the amount of stress they
have in both of those places

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.720
is approximately the same.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.770
In fact, I just updated that
literature for my class slides

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.700
and it's still the same.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.845
They tell us to do blood
samples in both places.

00:07:56.845 --> 00:08:00.080
Yeah, it can vary from very
little stress to higher stress,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.360
but it's about the same in
the two different places.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.590
Well, when you're a weird geek,
one of the things I've found

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.700
is that the way that
I had to sell myself

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.130
was by showing off my work.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.320
You sell your work
rather than yourself.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.920
So I put portfolios together.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.420
OK, I'd say the quality of this
projector's about medium good.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.710
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.320
DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN:
I've had ones

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.289
where it's shown up
better than this.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.470
Now the thing is when
I first started out,

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.419
I'd go to the AG
engineering meeting

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.604
and they thought I
was really weird.

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:39.770
No one wanted to talk to me.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.630
And then I whipped out
a big foldout drawing.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.670
Then I started to get respect.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.220
That's selling your work.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.560
And the thing I learned
about my portfolio,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.530
you want to make a portfolio
where someone looks at it

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.730
and 30 seconds later it's "wow!"

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.290
Don't put too much
junk in a portfolio.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.090
You just put enough stuff in
there so look at it really

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:06.050
quickly, wow this person
really can do some stuff.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.360
Now I used to joke around
that I had huge internet

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.610
access to my visual cortex.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.150
Well, turns out I've got a
pretty big circuit there.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:19.746
And that's probably in the
top 10% or so of circuits

00:09:19.746 --> 00:09:21.120
going from the
frontal cortex all

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.680
the way deep to the back
of the visual cortex where

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.580
the graphics files are stored.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.280
Now Walter Schneider at the
University of Pittsburgh

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.500
has a new scanning
technology, which

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.990
I'm sure some Asperger people
had to develop the computer

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.995
to enable this scanner to
track white matter fibers.

00:09:39.995 --> 00:09:42.520
So your brain's got the
gray matter on the outside.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.970
And the inside of the
brain is all white matter,

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.460
big long axons that go all
the way across the brain that

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.080
form cable bundles.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.850
And this new
technology can actually

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.460
dissect out the cable bundles.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.570
It can tell the difference
between a bridge that

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.030
cross each other
or an intersection.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.910
And that took a lot
of computer power,

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.490
and they can fit it inside a
box that Walter can pick up.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.994
And so I'm an
associative thinker,

00:10:05.994 --> 00:10:07.410
so start thinking
about that song.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.076
[SINGS] You can get
eight great tomatoes

00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:10.780
in that itty-bitty can.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.940
That's an ancient old
ad for tomato sauce.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.210
So that came up.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.980
You can get lots of computing
in an itty-bitty box.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.080
That's sort of
how my mind works.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:28.820
OK, now this is the cable
bundle for speak what you see.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.260
And it goes from the visual
cortex up to the language area.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.990
That's the normal one.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.980
And that's mine.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.870
And those branches, you can see
they've been truncated there

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.520
on that rendering, they
actually go all over the brain.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.282
So I basically have
got a search engine--

00:10:46.282 --> 00:10:47.990
it's a lot like Google
for images-- where

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.790
you type in keywords and
I get lots of pictures.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.180
And they are specific!

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.500
The thing I find so fascinating
about search engines

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.210
is they work just like
how my mind works.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.399
Well, who made search engines?

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:02.690
Some people that are much
more linear in their thinking

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.750
don't like the way the
search engine works.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.212
I like the way it
works just fine!

00:11:07.212 --> 00:11:09.170
And one of the things I
gotta teach my students

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.870
is, you gotta use all
the different key words.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.510
All right, let's just
take cattle, for example.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:21.960
There's bulls, cows, cattle,
bovines, calf, calves.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.860
You gotta use all
those different words.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.330
That's really obvious to me.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.246
And I find if you use
all the different words,

00:11:28.246 --> 00:11:30.900
you find a lot of papers
you wouldn't find otherwise.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.700
Now the price I paid
for this circuit is I

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.140
have less bandwidth for
the speak what you see.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.320
So I had speech delay.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.430
Didn't talk until age four.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.355
And I couldn't get my words out.

00:11:42.355 --> 00:11:44.290
See, there's always a price.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.380
This scanner was originally paid
for by the Defense Department

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.330
to look at veterans'
head injuries.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.900
And if this had been
an injured circuit,

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.930
it would look like dried
spaghetti and went [CRUNCH]

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.540
and broke about half of them.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.870
I'll tell you, the
football players

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.320
doesn't look very pretty.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.374
OK, now this is
another scan that

00:12:07.374 --> 00:12:08.790
was done at the
University of Utah

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.350
and presented at the
Neuroscience Meeting.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.130
And the blue part is basically
full of cerebrospinal fluid.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.090
It's full of water.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.730
And you can see, I've got
a big asymmetry there.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.130
I got visual thinking and my
math department got trashed.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.030
See, where I think innate
differences make the biggest

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.400
difference is either in
real deficit in something

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.990
or an extreme
ability in something.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.910
Yes, there's brain plasticity.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:38.060
But that's happening in the
gray matter out on the edges.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.730
Those big white fiber
bundles, I don't

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.400
think you grow those
big axons back.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.520
I mean, they're that long.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.640
OK Malcolm Gladwell says
if you have enough practice

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.500
and you have enough
access to services,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.820
anyone can learn anything.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.510
Well, back in '68,
Bill Gates and I

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:57.390
had access to this exact
same computer system.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.650
I wanted to learn how to program
it, it was just hopeless.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.440
Algebra, just hopeless.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.150
I wanted to become
an expert skier.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.199
I could never keep
them together.

00:13:08.199 --> 00:13:09.990
I could get to the good
intermediate stage.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.720
I mean, I could
ski recreationally.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.230
But get really good?

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:17.446
There were other kids, one
winter they'd be experts.

00:13:17.446 --> 00:13:19.560
Well, I just couldn't
do computer programming,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.220
no matter how hard I tried.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.410
I agree with Gladwell about
the practice, and of course,

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.790
the access to the teaching.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.410
You know, you have
to develop abilities.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.630
This is probably one of
my most important slides.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.250
The different kinds
of minds slide.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.600
I am a photo-realistic
visual thinker.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.590
An object visualizer.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.650
Lot of people in programming
are a pattern visualizer,

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.170
a spatial visualizer.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.740
See, in your brain you have
circuits for what is something?

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.150
That's me.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.244
And then you got circuits
for where is something?

00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:01.035
And people that are
super good at the where

00:14:01.035 --> 00:14:04.030
is something located
in space tend

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.880
to not be so good at the
object visualization.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.430
And the pattern thinkers
are also often good at math.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.260
These kids often have
trouble with reading.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.857
I hear stories where OK, they're
having handwriting problems

00:14:15.857 --> 00:14:17.440
and they won't let
them type a laptop.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.000
That's just stupid.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.700
Another thing that
I hear that's really

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.080
bad-- political
correctness gone crazy--

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.437
is you've got a fourth
grader bored doing baby math.

00:14:27.437 --> 00:14:29.770
And they make them do baby
math and they don't give them

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.270
the more advanced book.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.680
That's just ridiculous.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.600
You can get into
a situation where

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.660
a kid may be gifted in math
but need special ed in reading.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.630
Now I like to bust
out of the silos.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.010
Everybody tends to get
inside their own box.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.980
There's a text box.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.480
There's a farm and ranch box.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.430
There's a gifted box.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.940
And there's an
autism box or silos.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.554
And I like to pick out
my speaking engagements

00:14:56.554 --> 00:14:58.220
so I like to get a
little mixture of all

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.030
these different things.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.750
Because I'm seeing something
that kind of disturbs me.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.880
I go to an autism meeting and
a geeky little 10 year-old

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.200
walks up to me, a real
smart little 10 year-old,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.300
and he's fixated on his autism.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.789
And sometimes they get kind
of a handicap mentality

00:15:13.789 --> 00:15:15.330
and they're not
learning basic stuff,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.950
like saying please
and thank you.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.100
Learning just basic skills.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.620
Kind of get over protected.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.240
Then I go to a gifted meeting.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.955
The same little geeky
kid comes up to me,

00:15:24.955 --> 00:15:27.330
but he wants to tell me about
what he saw under the Brock

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.070
Magiscope, which is a really
cool little children's

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.520
microscope.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.220
And then I go to
a place like this,

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.381
all full of undiagnosed
little bit on the spectrum.

00:15:37.381 --> 00:15:39.786
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:15:39.786 --> 00:15:42.890
DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN: Avoid
the labels like the plague,

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.910
'cause it might hold you back.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.220
Now where learning about autism
can really help some of you

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.670
guys here is in
your relationships.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.230
You don't need to go
out and get diagnosed,

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.671
but just reading about
it, that can help you out.

00:15:56.671 --> 00:15:59.170
And then I go over to the farm
and ranch and the meat world,

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.480
and I go to this big
huge meatpacking plant.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.450
And there's this old
gray haired hippie

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:05.390
and he runs the
maintenance shop.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:08.065
And he's out there playing
with the giant LEGOs putting up

00:16:08.065 --> 00:16:09.220
a new cooler.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.610
Big huge concrete LEGOs, you
use a crane to put them up.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.999
And he's pure spectrum, but
he had welding in high school.

00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:19.040
The worst things they've
done in the high schools

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.100
is taken the hands-on classes.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.430
In fact, at JPL they make all
the metal parts of something

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.570
like the Mars lander, they
make them there in shops.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.070
And they're having
problems finding

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.880
who's going to replace the
machinists when they retire.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.454
Now a third kind of thinker
is the verbal facts thinker.

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:38.870
They know everything about
whatever their favorite subject

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.610
is and they're a verbal thinker.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.320
Now so-called
normal people, they

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.810
are mixtures of these
different kinds of thinking.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.959
But I'm finding, when you
get into autism programs,

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:50.375
there's an awful
lot of smart kids

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:54.310
that ought to get headed down
a track towards Google or JPL,

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.460
that the teachers
and the schools

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.155
are having a hard
time shifting gears

00:16:58.155 --> 00:17:00.245
on how to deal with
the nonverbal kids

00:17:00.245 --> 00:17:03.360
and they got smart, geeky,
kids in that same class.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.130
It's a really,
really big problem.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.180
Because I can think of
kids I went to school

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.210
with when I was
in college that I

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.160
know are on the spectrum today.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.560
But the problem that the
parents of little kids

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.190
have and the schools have,
in order to get a service,

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.430
you have to have a label.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.430
Now I don't think it hurts
a kid when he's three

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.180
to put a label on him
to get speech therapy.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.230
But then you get the kid that's
10 or 12 years old getting

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.070
bullied in school,
and he gets a label

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.547
because you get
bullied in school.

00:17:31.547 --> 00:17:33.505
And Steve Jobs was one
of the kids with-- well,

00:17:33.505 --> 00:17:35.130
they had to take him
out of one school,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.480
put him in another
school in Cupertino.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.095
And fortunately, he had a
dad that had a machine shop.

00:17:41.095 --> 00:17:44.790
That was another thing
that was his salvation.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.080
He was doing hands-on things.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.744
Now I know that
Steve Jobs may not

00:17:49.744 --> 00:17:51.410
be the best thing to
be mentioning here.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.540
But I only can talk
about the dead ones

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.800
where I have information
I've gotten off

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.580
of publicly available things
like books and "Business Week"

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.730
magazine, which
I've read carefully.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:05.250
Now in "The Autistic
Brain" book,

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.190
I now show evidence that
these two kinds of visualizers

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.510
actually do exist.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.490
Today the schools are
all about evidence based.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.640
Well, Marie Kozhevnikof's work.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.890
Surfing the internet, three
o'clock in the morning, I,

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.790
found her stuff about the
two kinds of visualizers.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:25.030
This PET brain scan
study show that these two

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.190
kinds of visualizers exist.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.190
I was so happy
when I found this.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.340
Because I had just observed
these things just on my own.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.060
And when I did my TED talk, I
hadn't found these references

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.560
yet.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.030
And they weren't
very easy to find.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.800
There's kind of a bias
about innate ability.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.640
No, everyone's not the same.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.120
Yes, there's a
lot of plasticity.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.529
You got a lot of people
here in the middle.

00:18:46.529 --> 00:18:48.320
You can get them pretty
good at programming

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.810
up to here or whatever,
but you probably

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:50.700
won't get them to here.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.491
They can move back and
forth in the middle.

00:18:52.491 --> 00:18:54.320
That gray matter's got
a lot of plasticity.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.470
But then you've got these great
big huge white matter cables.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.760
Well, you're kind of
born with those things.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.600
OK, there's two ways
you can do the math.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.100
You can do it the
verbal way, or you

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.683
can do it the more
visual spatial way.

00:19:05.683 --> 00:19:08.130
And there's kids that can just
do the math in their head.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.600
And the school says
well, you can't do that.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.860
They don't get it that
he thinks differently.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.530
Well, I'm saying let
him do it in his head.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.417
But we will take some
precautions against cheating.

00:19:19.417 --> 00:19:21.250
So we're going to put
him in a room stripped

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.650
of everything electronic, and
if he can do it, then just

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.799
absolutely fine.

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:27.340
Now I just want to
show you something

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.840
that's definitely not my mind.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.950
That praying mantis is
made out of a single sheet

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.730
of folded paper.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.225
No cutting, no tape.

00:19:37.225 --> 00:19:39.530
And what you see
in the background,

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.170
that is the folding pattern.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.150
And people look at
that and go, wow.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.220
Well, there's no
way I could start

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.700
with a square piece of paper and
make it into a praying mantis.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.160
That's not my mind.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.840
And here are some
great little origami

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.915
stars that some kids gave me.

00:19:55.915 --> 00:19:58.950
Well, they need to be in
the advanced math class.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.870
Now my thing was art.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.150
And when I was in elementary
school, my ability in art

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:05.324
was always encouraged.

00:20:05.324 --> 00:20:07.490
And I was encouraged to do
lots of different things.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.200
So I wasn't just
drawing the same horse

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.640
head over and over again.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.480
You gotta take the
things they're fixated on

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.090
and broaden it
out, 'cause you've

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:19.100
got to learn how to do stuff
other people are going to want.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.640
I always like to show
my drawings off again.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.560
And here's a beautiful
bridge that Jessy Park drew.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.870
She was more moderate.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.720
Well, her favorite thing used
to be electric blanket controls.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.662
Well, we had to get
her off of that.

00:20:33.662 --> 00:20:36.740
And while on the
subject of bridges,

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.660
I think our governments
are going crazy

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:44.590
when you've got a governor
and his aides are deliberately

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.170
creating traffic
jams on a bridge!

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.630
The one that looks
just like this.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.360
This is absolutely ridiculous!

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.080
They're getting totally
separated from reality.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.729
We have great things going
on with private industry

00:20:59.729 --> 00:21:01.020
docking with the space station.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.510
But instead we
have a stupid thing

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.210
on the news this morning
about government officials

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.600
messing up traffic on
purpose on a bridge,

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.770
and some dumb thing about
I think sports players

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.410
getting scared by
their own mascot.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:18.960
I mean, that was on
the news this morning

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.529
when I was having breakfast.

00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:23.070
I think there's more
important things

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.740
to have on the news than that.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.920
And these people, as far
as causing a traffic jam

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.125
on a bridge, that's
the kind of mindset

00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:31.700
of about an eight year-old.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.077
It's also something that
I would have learned

00:21:35.077 --> 00:21:37.160
when I was eight years old
that you don't do stuff

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.575
like that because it
inconveniences other people.

00:21:39.575 --> 00:21:41.150
You don't do those
kind of things

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.565
'cause you wouldn't like if
you were in that traffic jam.

00:21:43.565 --> 00:21:45.650
It's just that simple.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.600
There's some other
gorgeous artwork

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.950
made by a person that was
at mid-level on their autism

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.110
spectrum.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.720
All right, now
I'm gonna tell you

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.560
math people why you need
to have us art minds.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:04.789
One of the things that really
worries me, with all the STEM

00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:07.080
emphasis-- and we're going
to have to have algebra now.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.220
How could I get through
college with algebra?

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.910
Know how I got through college?

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.510
Because thank goodness for
the educational fads of 1967.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:19.760
And in 1967, the required
math class was finite math.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.050
Probability, matrices,
and statistics.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.300
Bit more visual,
tons of tutoring.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.720
I managed to get through it.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.094
But the engineering mind
does need the art mind.

00:22:29.094 --> 00:22:31.510
'Cause I've learned there's
certain things the engineering

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.065
mind doesn't see.

00:22:33.065 --> 00:22:34.930
Now what's there?

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.140
I don't know if that came
from-- I got a satellite image.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.127
I don't know if it's
Google's or not.

00:22:40.127 --> 00:22:41.460
I did get that off the internet.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.293
I certainly wasn't gonna
fly over it and get

00:22:43.293 --> 00:22:48.090
my own picture of the
Fukushima nuclear power plant.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.270
Not something you want
to get very, very near,

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.370
that's for sure.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:57.230
'Cause sometimes the most
obvious is the least obvious.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.722
So I was getting all these
newspapers, all this stuff,

00:22:59.722 --> 00:23:01.305
and reading about
it on a plane 'cause

00:23:01.305 --> 00:23:02.120
I find this stuff interesting.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.840
And when I found out
why this happened,

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.620
I'm going how could you do this?

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.745
I can't design a nuclear
reactor, there's no way.

00:23:10.745 --> 00:23:13.120
But if I had been drawing the
concrete work for the plant

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.300
and doing my site
elevation drawings,

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.200
there's no way I would have
made a mistake they made.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.540
All I have to know
about a nuclear reactor

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.195
is if the emergency pump fails
to work after you've scrammed

00:23:23.195 --> 00:23:27.380
it-- see it doesn't quite get
turned off all the way-- it

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.980
burns up and you're in so
much trouble it's not funny.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.680
That's all I have
to know about it.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.590
Well OK, earthquake broke all
the power lines and everything.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.870
There's no electric power
to run the main stuff,

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.350
so they had to scram it.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:43.270
And what happened is
the emergency generators

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.420
that ran the emergency
equipment were

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.550
in a non-waterproof basement.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.940
How could you make a
mistake that basic?

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.280
Now when I was young, I used
to think, well stupidity.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.310
No.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.970
I found the mathematical
mind doesn't see it.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.940
I could see the water smashing
out the baby blue louvers.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.939
This plant was painted
baby blue, of all colors,

00:24:03.939 --> 00:24:06.070
with little clouds on
the top of the boxes,

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.210
make it look
innocent and pretty.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.310
See those baby blue
louvers getting busted out.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.860
And two seconds later,
those big generators,

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.280
all the electric
panels under water,

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.750
and it's not going to work.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.482
There's no way I
would have done that.

00:24:20.482 --> 00:24:22.940
I mean, I would've been going
to every shipbuilding company

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.010
that there was and say, I want
catalogs on all your waterproof

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.690
doors.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.930
I want to try out all
your waterproof doors.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.020
I want to find waterproof doors
that are really easy to open,

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.440
don't have to have training
to open and close them,

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.520
close really tight, obvious
when they're closed.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.850
And it wouldn't have happened.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:43.080
This is why you really need all
the different kinds of minds.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.695
Now I've been thinking about
a lot of other things too.

00:24:45.695 --> 00:24:50.150
You see, 'cause I can visualize
ways that it can break.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.960
Especially anything
mechanical sort of stuff.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.730
OK, Steve Jobs went to college.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.840
And he also did a calligraphy
class, which he didn't pay for.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.040
But it really
influenced computing,

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.390
and all the computers have
nice fonts as a result of that.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.120
And he was an artist.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.150
He developed the
interface for the phones.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.380
Oh, and I know there's a
lot of bad blood going on

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.480
with the lawsuits.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.310
I read all about that.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.570
Steve wanted to go
thermonuclear on Android.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.520
I know all about
that kind of stuff.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.940
But again, I can only
talk about the dead ones.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.250
So that's the reason
why I have these slides.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.230
But one of the point
I'm trying to get across

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.887
is he wasn't an engineer.

00:25:33.887 --> 00:25:35.470
This is where you
need to have the art

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.850
mind and the engineering minds
working together on projects.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.570
They have complementary skills.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.150
Well, there's a big
debate right now

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.790
that maybe humanities programs
are just useless in colleges.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.672
I was at a state about two years
ago that'll remain nameless.

00:25:51.672 --> 00:25:53.130
But their governor
said they wanted

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.050
to charge extra
tuition at the state

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.380
university for
humanities classes.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.280
And so the "Chronicle
of Higher Education"

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.630
David Barash said that the
connection between Steve Jobs

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.360
and so-called useless humanities
programs, such as calligraphy,

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.480
cannot be ignored.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.040
Now one thing about calligraphy
is it's a hands-on class.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.970
You actually have to do it.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.330
And there is a need
for humanities.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.360
I thought this was
really interesting.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.000
You want evidence based?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.410
"Science," the
premiere journal, that

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.830
when students read
serious literary fiction,

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.282
helps them with some
of their social skills,

00:26:29.282 --> 00:26:31.240
rather than just reading
the latest Steven King

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.835
or something like that,
or Michael Chrichton.

00:26:34.835 --> 00:26:36.210
I have to say,
those are the kind

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.343
of books I like when I'm
on a long airplane flight

00:26:38.343 --> 00:26:41.020
and it's really boring.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.860
OK, some of the other work
I've done with livestock

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.280
was to look at the things
that they're scared of.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.270
They're going up a chute
in a strange place,

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.260
meat plant for example.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.060
They were afraid of a
lot of little things.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.390
Shadows, reflections,
chains hanging down,

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.445
seeing people standing up ahead.

00:26:58.445 --> 00:27:00.520
Things that we
tend to not notice.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.880
And if you take those
distractions out, maybe change

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.850
a light to get rid of a
reflection, add a light 'cause

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.960
they don't like
going to a dark hole,

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.150
then they would move through
the chute more easily,

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.340
especially when it was
in a strange place.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.990
Now how many people
here noticed this animal

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.630
is locked onto that
sunbeam like radar?

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.770
Raise your hand if
you noticed that.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.450
OK, we're doing
pretty good here.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.440
JPL a little bit
better than here.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:32.301
Well see, that's purely the
visual thinking sort of stuff.

00:27:32.301 --> 00:27:34.800
Well I know there's some people
interested in animal issues,

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.175
so I think I'll
talk a little bit

00:27:36.175 --> 00:27:37.920
about some of the
things I've done.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.130
When I was young,
I used to think

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.900
I could fix everything
with equipment.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.170
If I could just build
the right magic system,

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.530
everything would be perfect.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.560
What I found is equipment's
only half the equation.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.330
The other half is
management, and management

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.110
wanting to do things right.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.540
Now I have a saying.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.440
Heat softens steel.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.980
And then people like me who
want to reform things can now

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.210
shape it and bend it
into pretty grill work.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.040
And when McDonald's,
back in 1997,

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.450
decided that they were
going to do something

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:12.430
about bad stuff going
on in slaughterhouses,

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.960
that resulted in
a lot of change.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.700
And it was my job
to implement it.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.400
And I came up with a very
simple scoring system

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.630
that was like traffic
rules for slaughter houses.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.840
And if you didn't follow certain
rules and make certain numbers,

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.510
you failed the McDonald's audit.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.060
95% of the cattle dead
on the first shot or you

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.930
fail the audit.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:34.030
You've got to get them all
dead before you hang them up.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.980
Only three animals are
allowed to moo and bellow

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.580
in the stunning area.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.785
Only 1% falling.

00:28:39.785 --> 00:28:42.030
And if you want a real
excellent score, only 5%

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.580
can get hit with
the electric prod

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.320
if you want excellent score.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.690
Simple, very simple.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.510
You see, these are
outcome measures.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.590
I'm not telling you
how to build the plant.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:53.810
They are very simple
outcome measures.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.010
And it worked because it was
very objective and very, very

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:57.750
simple.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.550
When big customers say that
something's got to be changed,

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:02.050
then things are
going to be changed.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.640
Walmart has just come
out with a big statement

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.560
they came out with two days
ago on putting video cameras

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.330
in swine houses to make
sure people aren't beating

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:14.290
the pigs up with gate rods or
throwing up piglets or doing

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:18.890
some other really
nasty thing like that.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.520
I'm sure you've all seen
that show "Undercover Boss."

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.780
I think that's a great show.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.700
I saw those kind of bosses'
eyes opened up moments

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.765
when I took some
of the executives

00:29:30.765 --> 00:29:35.440
from some of the large hamburger
restaurants on their first trip

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.140
to farms and slaughterhouses.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.910
I remember the day-- this
was back in 1999 or 1998,

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.250
around that time-- when
one of the executives

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:46.120
saw a half-dead dairy cow
go into their product.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.680
Boy, that was a real
undercover boss moment.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.580
I'd like to do
another show called

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.215
"Undercover Legislature."

00:29:55.215 --> 00:29:58.398
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:58.398 --> 00:29:59.940
DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN:
OK, let's take

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.660
people who do things
like deliberately

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.190
cause traffic jams.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:07.190
And we've got a real, real
special trailer set up

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.970
for them.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:11.140
It's about 10 miles
from the local Walmart.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.970
And we're going to
drop him off there.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.370
He'll just have his license
in his wallet, that's all.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.280
There'll be a $50 debit card
on the counter, a Walmart pen,

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.290
couple of beans on the shelf,
this much gas in the car.

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.500
OK, you report to work
tomorrow at Walmart.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.250
You're going to be
there for two months.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:32.450
And we've taken away your
medical insurance card.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:36.580
Let's let them get a taste of
what some people are actually

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.360
up against.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.958
Living in a total
rarefied world.

00:30:40.958 --> 00:30:44.786
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:44.786 --> 00:30:46.410
Now look at how the
horse and the zebra

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:47.790
put an ear on each other.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:49.140
And then the other ear is on me.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.210
Watch, animals it's
all about details.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.980
All about details.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.240
Well, there's what the
entrance to a slaughter plant

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.125
looks like.

00:30:57.125 --> 00:30:59.250
In fact, I saw your great
Google Earth thing there.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.600
Think I'll go Google
Earth a few of my jobs.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.573
That's always fun.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.026
And I show this
slide to my students

00:31:07.026 --> 00:31:08.400
and I'll say, OK
now tell me what

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.190
I can improve here,
what is bad here.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.120
Well, with one thing that's
good is inside the tunnel,

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.170
I got white translucent plastic.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.900
So they're not going
into a dark hole.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.325
But the bad thing is--
and I'd say about half

00:31:21.325 --> 00:31:22.980
my students don't
notice it-- is you've

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.188
got three people standing
right where they should not

00:31:25.188 --> 00:31:26.560
be standing.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.670
Then sometimes the most
obvious is the least obvious.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.470
Now there's evidence that
in the normal human brain,

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:36.660
language covers up
art and mathematics.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.630
Because there's a type
of Alzheimer's that when

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:42.440
the language parts of
the brain get wrecked,

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.874
art comes out for about
three or four years.

00:31:44.874 --> 00:31:46.790
And when van Gogh was
painting "Starry Night,"

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.552
I don't think he realized he
was putting mathematics on it.

00:31:49.552 --> 00:31:51.580
And there's going to be
a new book coming out

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.490
on a guy who got in a bar fight
and got bashed on the head.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.510
And now he's a mathematician
studying physics.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.900
Sort of got his inner
mathematician turned loose.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.400
Yep, there's a lot
of things that we

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.560
don't know about the brain.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.090
Now an important thing,
understanding someone

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.660
who thinks the way I do,
is I'm a bottom up thinker.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.260
My approach to things,
it was my same approach

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.960
on developing equipment
for livestock,

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.489
was to go around and look at
all of the state of the art.

00:32:18.489 --> 00:32:20.280
You go download, you'd
get all the patents.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.360
Well, we couldn't download
them when I was doing it.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.443
We had to write to the
Patent Office and get them.

00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:25.670
It was a real pain.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.170
But you'd get all
the patents, you'd

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.920
get all the state of the art.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.170
Go around, visit
all these places

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:35.520
and try to get the good ideas,
chuck out the bad ideas.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.340
In other words, it's bottom up
thinking rather than top down.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.910
Well today what's happening,
especially in those government

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.880
stuff, too much top down.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.680
Very vague things.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.550
But concepts are formed
by specific examples.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.340
When I was a young
child, cats and dogs.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.970
OK, all the cat pictures
in this file, all the dog

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.305
pictures in this file.

00:32:56.305 --> 00:32:59.510
Well, when I was very young,
I could sort cats from dogs

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.600
by size.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.660
Until our next door
neighbor got a daschund.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.070
OK, now I can no longer use
size as a visual criterion

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.867
for cat versus dog.

00:33:10.867 --> 00:33:12.700
So then I noticed they
all had the same nose

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.460
shape if they were dogs.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.770
So that was a visual feature
that every dog has got.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.240
Everything's learned
by specific example.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.465
So how do I learn what
being nice or being bad is?

00:33:23.465 --> 00:33:25.430
Well, my mother would
just correct me.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:26.985
Forgot to say please?

00:33:26.985 --> 00:33:28.390
Well, say please.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:29.930
That's nice behavior.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.300
You wait politely in line
at the movie theater.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.740
That's nice behavior.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.990
You want to teach something
like up or down, gotta use

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:39.080
a lot of different examples.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.480
Because there's some kids
with autism where if you say,

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.060
put that in, just
goes in the garbage.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.850
They need to learn that could
be put that in the drawer,

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:50.710
in the cupboard,
in something else.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:52.790
Not necessarily in
the garbage can.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.900
So up can walk up the
stairs, I lifted up a cup,

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.160
the plane flew up in the air.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.140
Lot of different examples.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:05.970
My thinking is associative, just
like how a search engine works.

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:09.150
So if I'm at the Chicago
airport-- there quite

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.139
often-- OK, I'll look at that.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:14.310
Now I can start looking through
Google for images of my head.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:17.000
A glass structure category,
start going through that.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.639
Or I could start off
in an airport category.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:21.870
There are no
generalized pictures.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.235
This was something
that was really

00:34:24.235 --> 00:34:26.360
a breakthrough in my thinking
when I did the church

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.350
steeple as my question
rather than house or a car.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.250
Something that people weren't
quite so familiar with.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:34.840
OK, glass structure.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.449
Biosphere in Arizona,
Crystal Palace,

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:40.370
greenhouse at Colorado State.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.710
Now when I'm on
this subject, I now

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:46.030
am seeing a building that's
now under construction.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:49.530
Now I'm seeing other buildings
that were under construction

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:53.290
and the contractors used up 25
of our super valuable parking

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.530
spaces for their trailers.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.780
OK, so that's how I got
from glass structures

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.180
to contractor trailers.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.330
Real sore point with me.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:02.880
I wasn't home when
they did that.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.380
I think I would have walked out
there like I owned the place

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.260
and told them to
move their trailers.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.010
But once they got established,
then you're just stuck with it.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.176
Did they ask permission to
put those trailers there?

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:15.450
I'm sure they did not.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.650
OK, airport category.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:21.390
Now when you think about
really big amounts of money,

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.990
let's start thinking
about it in something

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.660
the public can understand.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.529
This is worth $5 billion.

00:35:27.529 --> 00:35:29.820
And they're building a new
light rail and a new Westin.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.360
I gotta get the price
for that 'cause that's

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.210
going to be quite a lot
more than $5 billion

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.532
when that's done.

00:35:34.532 --> 00:35:35.990
But if we start
thinking about some

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:39.030
of these big amounts of money
in something real like airport

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:45.030
units, then people can
really put it in perspective.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:49.070
So you got Denver Airport,
Dallas-Fort Worth, Minneapolis,

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.570
Atlanta.

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:55.250
And you've got the grungy
old terminal at LaGuardia.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:59.030
And it'd be fun to
explore that place.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.460
And when I asked an
astrophysicist about the church

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.480
steeples, he saw a motion of
people singing and praying.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.980
I go, oh wow.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.140
Trippy.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.010
That is definitely not my mind.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.070
Now cattle will make a category.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:16.410
If they get used to being
handled by a man on a horse,

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.050
they've learned that's safe.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.910
The first time they see the
man on the ground, they panic.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:21.910
You see, it's different.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:23.030
It's a different picture.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:25.280
I've learned man on
the horse is safe.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.340
Man on the ground's
new and scary.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:32.102
I can also learn that man
on the ground is safe.

00:36:32.102 --> 00:36:33.560
But that's something
totally novel.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.935
You see, most people wouldn't
think the man on the ground

00:36:35.935 --> 00:36:37.410
is something novel.

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:40.920
Now I find when you're trying
to categorize problems,

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.830
a lot of people have
trouble categorizing

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.470
where's a problem coming from?

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:46.700
OK, if I got something
wrong in a factory,

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.850
is there's something wrong
with the equipment or something

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:54.160
wrong with how people are
operating that equipment?

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.550
I find people often don't
make that differentiation.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.720
If it's equipment
problem, is it a glitch?

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.053
Course with the meat plant--
and I've done a lot of work

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.110
with them- stuck trolley.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:06.310
Or is it a fundamental
design problem?

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.550
They don't make that
differentiation.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.480
I've got a problem
with a kid in school.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.730
Does he have a
biological problem?

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.440
Maybe his tummy hurts so much
that he can't pay attention

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.570
in school.

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:19.130
Or does he just not
want to do the work?

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.320
It's just strictly behavior?

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:26.640
Top down thinkers tend to
overgeneralize, especially

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.630
when they're not doing
practical things anymore.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:35.860
Well, I got this out of
one of the tech magazines

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:36.970
about dog fooding.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:40.320
You know, you gotta use
the stuff that you make.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.070
Then you really find out
if it actually works.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:46.300
Policymakers need to
be directly experience

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.260
the consequences
of their policies.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.510
And if you want to mess up
traffic and cause a traffic

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.884
jam, then you need to be stuck
in the middle of the worst

00:37:52.884 --> 00:37:54.430
traffic jam.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.585
Well, there are
the guys up at JPL.

00:37:56.585 --> 00:37:58.450
It was very cool to
get to meet them.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.590
You know, kind of
unconventional.

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:05.673
It's OK to be eccentric.

00:38:05.673 --> 00:38:06.173
That's OK.

00:38:06.173 --> 00:38:09.880
Some of the most creative people
are really, really eccentric

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.570
and they're doing
marvelous things.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.150
And in talking to
the public, we need

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:17.300
to tell the public well,
what are some of the spin

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.360
offs from maybe some
of the JPL stuff?

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.750
Not stuff from the '60s.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:22.090
That's ancient history.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:25.010
Let's look at inventions
in the last 10 or 15 years.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:28.320
How about the
active pixel sensor?

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.050
That's the heart of
the cell phone camera.

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.370
How about coding
that's involved that

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:37.080
will help the phone to work
from one cell phone tower

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.710
to another cell phone tower?

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.670
How about a mass
spectrometer this big?

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:45.780
Yeah, we have mass spectrometers
the size of a giant desk.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.382
Well, you can put
a sample in that

00:38:47.382 --> 00:38:49.090
and it'll tell you
what chemical's in it.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:52.460
Well that would have a lot
of really good useful uses.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.320
Well, I was more interested in
looking at pictures of things

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.320
than pictures of people.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.701
But we need people
interested in things.

00:38:58.701 --> 00:39:00.200
'Cause the social
yakity-yaks aren't

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.949
going to solve some
of the energy problems

00:39:01.949 --> 00:39:04.400
and stuff like that.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.410
Let's have some of the
kids that are different.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:09.140
I don't care if
they're labeled gifted,

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:14.806
they're labeled quirky,
weird, nerds, or mild autism.

00:39:14.806 --> 00:39:17.180
One thing you gotta do with
these kids when they're young

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.710
is you gotta stretch them just
outside their comfort zone.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:25.110
And the other thing is we need
to be learning job skills.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.150
That needs to start at age 12.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.380
We need to find paper
route substitutes.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.520
Things like walking
dogs for the neighbors,

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.240
things like maybe setting
up chairs at the community

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.820
center, something like that.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:39.360
One place where all my teachers
and everybody drew a line,

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.590
I wasn't allowed to become
a recluse in my room.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:45.050
That was absolutely not allowed.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.810
I had to get out and do things.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.980
Kids aren't doing
free play, which

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.130
teaches valuable social skills.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.570
You know, dogs need to do
this too when they're young.

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:57.650
Because if dogs don't do
this when they're young,

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.847
then they fight other dogs
really viciously 'cause

00:39:59.847 --> 00:40:03.160
they never learned
how to get along.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.580
Taking out the hands-on
classes was the worst thing

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.660
the schools ever did.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.480
They took out cooking, sewing,
woodworking, machine shop,

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.250
welding.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.680
We have a shortage
of skilled trades.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.170
I mean, JPL needs people
to make the wheels

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:17.990
and stuff for the Mars lander.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.100
Oh, there's something
really cool and really geeky

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.780
about the wheels of "Curiosity."

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.430
I'm gonna just let
you figure it out.

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:27.596
And I don't know if I'm
supposed to tell you or not.

00:40:27.596 --> 00:40:32.170
But it's so geeky and anti-suit,
it's just really, really cool.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.365
But they need to have
those machinists.

00:40:37.365 --> 00:40:40.740
It's not going to
work without them.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.820
The other thing that's bad about
taking out hands-on classes

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:47.760
is we're losing resourceful
problem solving.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.012
Even something as
simple with cooking.

00:40:50.012 --> 00:40:51.220
You're missing an ingredient?

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.790
Can you do it with
another ingredient?

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:54.620
'Course in the '50s,
girls were taught sewing.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.360
So I had a wonderful
toy sewing machine.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.735
I was in fourth grade.

00:40:57.735 --> 00:41:00.800
And I remember one project
where I cut the fabric wrong

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.500
and I ruined it
as I got in rush.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.730
Some of the things you learn
from doing hands on things.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.550
This is the stuff that saved me.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:11.950
These were things that were
refuges away from teasing.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:14.655
Kids that did the teasing were
not interested in woodworking

00:41:14.655 --> 00:41:16.800
or interested in riding horses.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.540
I was also an Estes
model rocketer.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.415
A I loved model rockets.

00:41:21.415 --> 00:41:23.345
I was in the model rocket club.

00:41:23.345 --> 00:41:25.800
And I was horrified go
on the Estes website

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.440
about a month ago, and you
can buy a ready-made rocket.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.580
That is disgusting!

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.972
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:41:31.972 --> 00:41:34.180
DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN: The
whole point is to build them.

00:41:36.946 --> 00:41:39.160
And I made a few points
with the other kids

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.660
when I made a rocket that
looked like our headmaster,

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.680
a Mr. [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.870
And he was aerodynamically
stable and he flew.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:48.397
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:41:48.397 --> 00:41:50.480
DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN: And I
didn't do much studying,

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.063
but I was in a special
boarding school

00:41:52.063 --> 00:41:54.650
for gifted kids with a
lot of emotional problems.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.150
And instead of studying,
I was remodeling

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:58.599
our [INAUDIBLE] house.

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:00.390
But the headmaster let
me do that because I

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:02.790
was learning work skills.

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:06.080
And a lot of these kids are
not learning work skills.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.680
I cleaned a lot of horse
stalls too when I was 15.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.090
Lots and lots of them.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.100
And I was responsible
for the horse barn

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.360
and making sure I always
closed the feed box.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.160
Gotta always close the
grain box because a horse

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.490
dies if eats out
of the grain box.

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:21.610
You've got to close it.

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:25.049
I think we need to limit
screen time with little kids.

00:42:25.049 --> 00:42:26.840
The thing that I'm
finding with electronics

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.970
and with little kids
is yeah, little kids

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.580
want to play with electronics.

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.290
But we need to get
that teacher in there

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:33.700
and get them taking turns.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:37.420
These kids have got to
learn how to take turns.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.900
Well, I think we need to
start making connections,

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.460
physical connections
between the virtual world

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.600
and the real world.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.410
And one really enterprising mom,
she went to the lumber yard,

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:49.430
got some two by fours
cut up, and then she

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.260
brought them all
home to the driveway

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.590
and had the kids
paint them to make

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.650
Minecraft blocks
in the driveway.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:59.520
In other words, linking the
online world to the real world.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.600
Then her little autistic kid
had lots of friends coming over

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.020
to play with the
Minecraft blocks.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:07.480
Activities with animals.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.160
Get kids involved in activities
they can do with other kids.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.700
4H, FFA, robotics clubs,
maker bot, 3D printing clubs.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.650
Get them involved
in these things.

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:20.890
My ability in art was
always encouraged.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.930
We need to be working
on building up

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:25.930
the area of strength.

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.740
The kid's good at math, let
him do more advanced classes.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.190
Use fixations to motivate.

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:33.650
Great online sources.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.500
Now I was reading
that on Audacity

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.950
or some of these things
like this, that only 4%

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.700
of the people took
the entire class.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.890
I don't consider that a failure.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:45.630
Because there's an
awful lot of people

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:47.910
that might want to just look
at some programming stuff

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:50.076
and just take a couple of
lessons to learn something

00:43:50.076 --> 00:43:51.750
they needed for work.

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:55.390
Because back when I was doing
hydraulic stuff all the time,

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:56.932
I had all these
books for hydraulics.

00:43:56.932 --> 00:43:58.306
And I didn't need
algebra, 'cause

00:43:58.306 --> 00:44:00.400
I had all these tables for
things like fluid flow.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.340
Look it up in the tables.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.080
And when I first started
out, I took the first book

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.980
and I did read the
first book pretty well.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.550
But I didn't read all the books.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.182
I used them as reference books.

00:44:10.182 --> 00:44:12.640
I think the thing they need to
look at is how many of those

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.420
people that went on Udacity took
a few lessons as a reference

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.344
and it helped them
in their work.

00:44:18.344 --> 00:44:20.510
I think that's something
that needs to be looked at.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:24.730
But I show this to
a lot of parents

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:27.400
that don't realize there's a
lot of free stuff out there.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.650
And we gotta do something
about rural internet access.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:31.290
It is beyond awful.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:32.944
You cannot play videos.

00:44:32.944 --> 00:44:34.360
And you go out in
the rural areas,

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.832
you still got the mom
and pop DVD stores

00:44:36.832 --> 00:44:38.540
because they don't
have movies otherwise.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.760
It's just that simple.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.820
It is atrocious.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.130
Well, there's the
optical illusion room.

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.610
I got fixated on that.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.540
And the movie did a nice
job of showing me making it.

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.920
And there's one of my
designs in SketchUp.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.320
I know you don't own it
anymore, but it's great.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.250
I've seen some really
great things going on

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.360
with teenage kids
doing SketchUp,

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.620
and then they're printing their
stuff out with 3D printers.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.750
Really, really cool stuff.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.150
And I really liked
this warning they

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:07.870
had on the Maker Bot website.

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:11.295
You need patience-- that's kind
of a fiddly little machine.

00:45:11.295 --> 00:45:14.090
You get mad at it,
you're going to break it.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.250
Knowhow and a sense
of adventure required.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.867
I really liked that thing
they wrote on the website.

00:45:19.867 --> 00:45:21.950
Yeah, you don't design it
right, your little thing

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:23.590
is going to collapse in goo.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:26.260
You're getting back
to the real world.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.802
The other thing on something
like this, people say well,

00:45:28.802 --> 00:45:29.760
they can't afford that.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.145
OK, it's $1,500, $2,000.

00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:34.140
Look at all the money's
getting spent on sports.

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.385
That's the price of one major
league football uniform.

00:45:37.385 --> 00:45:38.540
It's all it costs.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.800
Maybe two high school uniforms.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.020
It's not very much money.

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.696
I don't want to hear that.

00:45:44.696 --> 00:45:48.121
Now that's just a kind of
neat little thing I made.

00:45:48.121 --> 00:45:50.245
And this is some views
through the Brock Magiscope,

00:45:50.245 --> 00:45:53.455
a great little really adorable
little child's microscopes.

00:45:53.455 --> 00:45:55.150
It's $150.

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:57.620
No fiddly mirror.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.930
Very easy for kids to use.

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:01.250
You don't have a
glass slide in it.

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.647
And I was so happy to
go to gifted conference.

00:46:03.647 --> 00:46:04.980
It wasn't the autism conference.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.550
I wish this had been at
the autism conference.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:08.060
It was at the gifted conference.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:11.230
We had a hotel room
about the size of this.

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.552
And all these kids, they'd
put the electronics away

00:46:13.552 --> 00:46:15.510
and they were playing
with the Brock Magiscope.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:17.740
And they're looking at
pond scum and leaves.

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:21.110
And it was really cool.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:22.110
Just got to show people.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:24.526
And you guys know about this
stuff that's on the internet.

00:46:24.526 --> 00:46:27.050
But I do a lot of talks
in a lot of places,

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.650
and I just want to give
people ideas of cool things

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:32.720
that are out there.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:37.760
There's some evidence that kids
learning to write sometimes

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.010
can help them on reading.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.410
On learning reading, maybe turn
off all the bells and whistles

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:46.400
and use the plain ebook, maybe
just with still pictures.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.970
And you have them read to them.

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:49.990
And they're learning
a story better.

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:51.560
And again, this is refereed.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.440
Scientific stuff.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.460
We're going evidence based here.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.190
Well, people need to
touch to perceive.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:58.575
I had a really good
time over at Pixar.

00:46:58.575 --> 00:47:00.075
They found that
sometimes they gotta

00:47:00.075 --> 00:47:04.230
get them off the computers
and get them actually drawing.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:06.120
And when they print
their figurines out

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.240
on their 3D printer, they put
them around the computer mouse

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.281
so they could touch them.

00:47:09.281 --> 00:47:11.910
You gotta touch to see.

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:13.960
Gotta do that.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:14.950
Science teacher.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:17.160
Boy, he helped me.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.330
Well, he was a NASA
space scientist.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:20.460
Was he a credited teacher?

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.220
No.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.300
No stupid ed courses for him.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.380
We gotta get back to doing
real things in this country.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.650
That's what we gotta do.

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:33.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.610
DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN: One
thing a lot of employers

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:41.440
want today is students
who know how to work.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.320
This came up in a lot of things.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.300
I learned to sell
my work, not myself.

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.759
Also in working with some of
the people that are different,

00:47:49.759 --> 00:47:51.675
you don't take that
employee and go, well just

00:47:51.675 --> 00:47:52.770
develop some new software.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:55.144
You want to say OK, I want to
make an app for the Android

00:47:55.144 --> 00:47:56.922
phone and it does
this specific thing,

00:47:56.922 --> 00:47:58.380
it uses this
language, this memory.

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.440
You don't tell them
how do it, but it's

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.980
got certain parameters.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.680
Then OK, that's easy to do.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.810
And when mistakes
are made, the boss

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:11.459
needs to just pull them
aside in the office quietly,

00:48:11.459 --> 00:48:13.500
no yelling and screaming,
and say, well you know,

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.000
we had the project
meeting last week

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.810
and you called Jim a jerk
in front of the other five

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:18.860
colleagues.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.350
That's not the Google
way of doing things.

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:23.650
Just don't do that.

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:27.430
And I learned you can
get some people that

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.310
will sabotage a project
due to jealousy.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:31.945
That was very, very difficult
for me to deal with.

00:48:31.945 --> 00:48:33.820
And then you get other
people where they just

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.730
think differently.

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.280
You kind of differentiate
between the two.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.130
Well, if I in was in a plant,
on of my meat plant projects,

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.485
and the plant engineer's
sitting like this--

00:48:44.485 --> 00:48:46.175
I was hired by the
manager, he didn't

00:48:46.175 --> 00:48:49.030
like this weird geek
coming on his turf.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:51.360
I would pull him into project.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.230
And that oftentimes
stopped that.

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:55.470
OK, tour guide.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:58.231
Great job for 12 year-olds.

00:48:58.231 --> 00:48:59.980
You gotta demonstrate
the correct distance

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.810
to get from the visitor.

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.270
Demonstrate the
correct greeting.

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.810
It's just like coaching
somebody in a foreign country.

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.730
And there's sensory issues.

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:11.240
Some people just can't
stand a lot of noise,

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.972
can't stand 60 cycle
fluorescent lights.

00:49:13.972 --> 00:49:15.680
You got a lot of
sensory issues, and they

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:19.110
can vary from being very
mild to being very severe.

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:20.870
This needs to be
researched, and how

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:23.721
to treat some of these problems.

00:49:23.721 --> 00:49:26.850
When I was a little kid,
loud sounds hurt my ears.

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:30.030
I still absolutely hate the
vacuum toilets in airplanes.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.340
And if I'd had to deal
with those when I was five,

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.610
I would have been sure I'd be
sucked out of the airplane.

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:39.820
My visual thinking mind went
wild when I was six years old

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.400
and they were
remodeling our house.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.044
They had this big circular
saw and I was afraid

00:49:44.044 --> 00:49:45.460
that maybe its
blade would come up

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:46.668
through the floor of my room.

00:49:46.668 --> 00:49:47.860
Which was just ludicrous.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.860
But when you're
maybe six years old,

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.580
it wasn't quite so ludicrous.

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:54.760
I had trouble hearing
hard constant sounds.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.290
So my speech
teacher slowed down,

00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:59.320
enunciated the hard consonants.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.320
She'd say cup, and
then shed say cuh-puh.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:06.420
Slow down, enunciate it
so that I could hear it.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.440
Attention shifting.

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.760
I have problems with this.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.320
Somebody rings a
cellphone off, I orient.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.610
Takes me much longer
to shift back.

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:19.240
Attention shifting slowness.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.920
Some people when
they go to read,

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.070
the print will
jiggle on the page.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:25.620
That's probably
about 10% of students

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.670
that are having some
trouble in college.

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:29.660
Doesn't explain all autism.

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.400
It doesn't explain all dyslexia.

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.733
But there's something wrong
with the circuits back here.

00:50:33.733 --> 00:50:35.940
Shape, color, emotion, texture.

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.110
They're not merging
together right.

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:41.210
And sometimes they can be
fixed with a very simple thing.

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:44.430
Like pale pink glasses,
pale lavender glasses,

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:47.870
different print your work on
some different colored papers,

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.500
maybe try different
background on colors

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.090
on the computer screen,
different fonts.

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:54.900
Now wouldn't it be
stupid to lose a job

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.520
or flunk out of school
'cause you didn't do this?

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.280
I'm finding one
out of 50 has got

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.840
this problem in my
livestock handling class.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.770
Because they do really horrible
on my drawing assignment.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:06.850
They cannot draw.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:09.970
If I say draw this,
they're drawing.

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:11.450
That's what they draw.

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:13.040
They don't see it.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.390
Well, there's my head.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:19.590
Well, and that's all the
white matter that's inside.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:22.080
And the gray matter-- this
is not lining up right.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.920
Something got changed here.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:29.150
There should be a little space
there for the gray matter.

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.740
Something got out of
sync there on that.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:37.120
And that's all the
circuits, the cable bundles

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.236
that are the interoffice
communication.

00:51:39.236 --> 00:51:40.610
That's where you
have differences

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:44.530
in developmental problem.

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:47.040
Well, my fear center
was bigger than normal.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.155
Well, that's controlled now
with antidepressant medication.

00:51:50.155 --> 00:51:55.190
Little Prozac Us visual
thinkers, panic monsters.

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.220
I know a lot of
visual thinkers where

00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:01.770
a little dab of Prozac in the
morning, or Lexapro or Zoloft,

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:03.530
stops the anxiety.

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:07.890
Then you're not getting whacked
out on drugs and alcohol.

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:11.980
Cerebellum's smaller, so
I've got really bad balance.

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.910
Simple accommodations
in the workplace.

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:16.114
Some people have gotta
get away from the 60 cycle

00:52:16.114 --> 00:52:16.905
fluorescent lights.

00:52:16.905 --> 00:52:18.530
They need a quiet place to work.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:24.210
Open office plan and I gotta do
serious writing, doesn't work.

00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:25.710
The other thing
that doesn't work

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:27.710
with people that are
on the autism spectrum

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:29.970
is a sudden change
in work routine.

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:32.350
They come into work
and they just go OK,

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:34.590
we're yanking out all
the office cubicles today

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:35.940
and we're going to move them.

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.670
OK, if we're going to do
that, let's have some warning.

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:42.100
Maybe a week at
least of warning.

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:44.130
And I still can't
tolerate scratchy clothes.

00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:46.300
Scratchy clothes just horrible.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.710
Like sandpaper.

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:51.630
Some cotton itches, other
cotton doesn't itch.

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:55.070
Now the thing is it's
OK for geeks to cry.

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:57.280
When the space
shuttle got shut down,

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.800
there were a lot of people
crying on "60 Minutes."

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:03.230
And I got thrown out
of a large girls school

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:06.350
for throwing a book at
a girl who teased me.

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.320
And when I went to
boarding school,

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.250
I got in a fistfight
in the cafeteria

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:12.630
after a guy called
name some name.

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:15.000
And they took horseback
riding away for two weeks.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.620
I still had to clean the
barn, but no horseback riding.

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.790
And somehow I
switched to crying.

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:22.350
It's OK for geeks to cry.

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:24.230
That's perfectly OK.

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:26.650
And I would go and hide
in the electrical room,

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:30.586
because the tech companies
don't tolerate any violence.

00:53:30.586 --> 00:53:33.050
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:34.520
DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN:
I have to say

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:38.365
that it made me chuckle to
look in the clean room at JPL

00:53:38.365 --> 00:53:43.170
and here's this big giant
Craftsman tool chest there.

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:46.360
To think that bolts on the Mars
lander were tightened by a tool

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.932
kept in a Craftsman tools chest.

00:53:48.932 --> 00:53:50.390
But you better not
throw that tool,

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:52.420
otherwise it's bye-bye job.

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:55.530
It's that simple.

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:57.340
It takes a village
to raise a child.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:59.820
We gotta figure
out how we can all

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.880
work together to
make things work.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.770
Because I'm seeing
too many smart kids

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:06.790
going down the wrong road.

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:09.370
I go to the gifted meeting,
he's going down one road.

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:12.790
I go to the autism
meeting, and you've

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:14.290
got one situation
where a kid that

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:16.810
ought to be headed for
Google is put in a class

00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:18.440
with kids that don't talk.

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.940
Then I go to another
school system

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.356
and he's headed in the right
direction really beautifully.

00:54:22.356 --> 00:54:24.520
It's very, very, very variable.

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:27.330
But these two silos don't talk.

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:30.190
Because if I look at the book
table for the gifted meeting

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:31.865
and the autism
meeting, there might

00:54:31.865 --> 00:54:35.580
be a 5% overlap in the books.

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:39.630
There should be more like
a 25% overlap in the books.

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:42.300
They're not talking
to each other.

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:44.570
We gotta get people together.

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:47.910
As I say, one geek goes to
Google in Silicon Valley, maybe

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:49.190
JPL.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:53.099
There's another geek that goes
to Hollywood and that stuff.

00:54:53.099 --> 00:54:54.890
And unfortunately,
there's a brilliant geek

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:57.420
that is going to the basement
to play video games for 10

00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.630
hours a day and he gets
Social Security for it.

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:03.580
That's not where
I want him going.

00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:04.080
No.

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.810
We've got to reach
out, get to these kids.

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:07.560
And you know what?

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.300
We gotta hook them
in middle school.

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.100
Middle school is where
we gotta hook them.

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:17.960
And some states now are
putting skilled trades back in.

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.710
OK, I think that finishes
up what I have to say.

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:24.210
But I've got time for questions.

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:26.152
Always like to do
some questions.

00:55:26.152 --> 00:55:35.992
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:35.992 --> 00:55:38.815
AUDIENCE: I'm curious over
the course of your career,

00:55:38.815 --> 00:55:40.440
you've shared a lot
of the insights you

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.530
had about the experience of
animals in slaughterhouses.

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:44.113
I'm curious about
what kinds of things

00:55:44.113 --> 00:55:45.684
you learned over your career.

00:55:45.684 --> 00:55:47.100
Like where maybe
you can look back

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.974
on some of your earlier
work and see oh, this

00:55:48.974 --> 00:55:50.937
is what I understand so
much more deeply now?

00:55:50.937 --> 00:55:53.020
DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN: Well,
there's a lot of things,

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:55.514
I mean, for one
thing in the '70s,

00:55:55.514 --> 00:55:57.680
my first professional group
was the American Society

00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.221
of Agricultural
Engineering I thought

00:55:59.221 --> 00:56:00.880
I could fix the world
with engineering.

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.060
I absolutely believed
that everything

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.340
could be fixed with engineering.

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:09.290
I now realize only half of it
can be fixed with engineering.

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:11.980
And I had a major
equipment failure,

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:13.760
which was a real epiphany.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:18.080
I was hired by a company in
1980 to run the old slaughter

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:18.760
plants.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.670
The pigs had to walk
up to the third floor

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:22.185
in the real old plants.

00:56:22.185 --> 00:56:24.060
And they wanted me to
build a conveyor system

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:27.340
to put in the floor of the chute
to take the pigs up this ramp.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:30.880
And I said, I'll design that.

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:34.590
Well, the problem is it flipped
all the pigs over backwards.

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:36.810
And it did not work and
we had to tear it out.

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:39.210
But then I started
realizing now why

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:44.300
are some pigs not capable
of walking up this ramp?

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.710
Well, I start getting
the ID numbers off

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:48.770
of the different
pigs and I found out

00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:51.650
that all the pigs that a
problem came from one farm.

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:54.930
And they had a genetic problem
called spraddle leg, where

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:58.190
the hips are very, very weak.

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:00.830
What I should have done, by
trying to make a conveyor,

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:02.970
that was treating a
symptom of a problem.

00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:05.680
We should have gone
back to the source.

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:08.440
For a fraction of the cost
of this mess that we had,

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:12.560
we could have bought that
farm new boars-- five or six

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.385
new boars is all it
would have taken,

00:57:14.385 --> 00:57:17.360
just a few thousand
dollars-- and gotten rid

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.360
of that genetic problem.

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.905
Would have solved it.

00:57:19.905 --> 00:57:21.530
One thing I learned
from that is you've

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:24.070
got the treat problem
at its source,

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:26.640
rather than treating a
symptom of a problem.

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.140
Now I went into about a six
month depression over that.

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.180
That was not fun.

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:34.845
But I learned a really
important lesson from that.

00:57:34.845 --> 00:57:36.376
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:36.376 --> 00:57:38.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
we're out of time now.

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.570
So please everybody
join me in thanking

00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:42.330
Temple Grandin for
coming to Google.
