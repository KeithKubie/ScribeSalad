00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.290
-Well, welcome back
to the second half.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.360
We've gone from a cosmic
scale to gigalight

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.950
year scale, and
massive black holes,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.210
and now we're sort of
zeroing in on things

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.650
that are closer
to life on Earth,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.590
and things like star formation.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.360
So the next speaker
is Blakesley Burkhart,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.030
who got her PhD from the
University of Wisconsin in 2014

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.240
and does work on-- she's a
Fellow in the Submillimeter

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.950
Array Collaboration, and also
a fellow, an Einstein Fellow,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.430
in the Institute for
Theory and Computation

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.330
at the Center for Astrophysics.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.760
And she's going to talk
about star formation, which

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.390
is actually something
that, as a dilettante,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.410
am very interested to hear.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.260
So her talk is-- title
of her talk is "Galaxies

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.210
as Star Forming
Engines: Simulating

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.930
the Turbulent Birth of Stars."

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.310
And I remind you to
hold your questions

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.157
until after the
second speaker goes,

00:01:06.157 --> 00:01:07.865
and then we'll have
a panel up here where

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:08.990
you can ask your questions.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.864
OK, Blakesley.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.550
-So, yeah.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.422
I'm extremely happy to
be talking a little bit

00:01:20.422 --> 00:01:22.380
about my research to you
today, and to give you

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.900
some impressions on
what I've figured out.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.060
In this four panel series,
I must represent purgatory.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.500
So Cora and Salvatore are
representing the heavens,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.160
now we're moving
down, and so clearly,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.320
the scales of the galaxies,
we've now reached purgatory.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.570
So Sarah, you have a
big task ahead of you.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.900
And I want to leave
you with the feeling

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.040
that the 21st century physics
that we're getting into,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.450
galaxies represent
a huge enigma still.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.770
We still don't know things
like how a star is formed,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.440
or how galaxies
evolve in cosmic time.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.650
And so today I'll
be telling you more

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.460
on the lines of how
stars are forming

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.250
and some new progress
that we've made

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.957
in terms of simulations
and comparisons

00:02:13.957 --> 00:02:15.415
with state of the
art observations.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.970
So I'd like to take a step
back and start with a classic.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.920
Right, we gotta go
back to the classics,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.730
and that's Carl Sagan.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.800
Probably many of you
at least watched Cosmos

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.920
or heard of the Cosmos
program, the original one.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.820
Carl Sagan was the one to
say, first, that we're all

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.650
made of star stuff.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.990
What did he mean by that?

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.820
Well, going back to what Cora
was talking about with the Big

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.070
Bang, the Big Bang produced
hydrogen, helium, lithium,

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.570
and where did all the other
heavy elements come from?

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.090
Where did the carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, all the heavy elements

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.620
that make up most of the
world that we interact with

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.000
and indeed our own bodies?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.240
All of this was
synthesized within stars.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.470
And so without
generations of stars

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.570
that came before our own star,
before our own solar system,

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.390
we would not be here today.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.990
And so then it's a big
question about the nature

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.510
of our existence to ask
how do galaxies make stars.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.580
We know stars are
predominately made in galaxies,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.690
how does this work?

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.680
It's important for
us to find this out.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.590
And so we can take a
picture of a typical galaxy.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.860
This is one of many billions of
galaxies that we've observed.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.040
And we can ask
about how they get

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.560
gas, how they get gas in order
to make this gas and the stars.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.330
So first, we know that galaxies
don't exist in isolation.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.910
This galaxy here is
actually part of a network

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.850
of galaxies in the cosmos.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.490
Gas accretes onto this
galaxy through a cosmic flow.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.970
And then what
happens to this gas?

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.490
How does galaxy turn
this gas into stars?

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.620
There's a whole
cycle that this gas,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.540
once it falls onto the
galaxy, goes through

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.580
in order to become a star.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.940
So we can start with this
gas being very warm and hot.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.110
It sits sort of
outside the galaxy.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.500
And it cools via number of
different cooling processes

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.530
into colder and denser gas.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.200
Eventually, this cold
gas becomes dense enough

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.860
to start to collapse under
its own gravity, which

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.399
we call self gravity.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.130
And then forms these
very dense clouds,

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.600
sort of sitting in the
disc of the galaxy,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.170
that we call molecular clouds.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.000
They're dense enough,
they're cold enough

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.270
that they're able to start
sustaining molecules.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.000
And then at some point, we have
this process of star formation.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.830
So you know, if you just think
of gravitational collapse,

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.930
if you continue to
collapse your cloud, poof.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.820
Eventually you should collapse
it so much that a star forms.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.730
We don't actually know so
much about that process.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.660
But OK, once you
have a star, then

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.990
you can have solar systems.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.080
You can have stellar evolution.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.350
And eventually the star will
either disrupt its parent cloud

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.210
through its own winds
or feedback processes,

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.000
or eventually it will
explode as a supernova.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.050
And then this
cycle then repeats.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.290
OK, easy, right?

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.220
We also have in
the galaxy, again,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.770
it's not an isolated system.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.080
There is still outflows that
are returning this hot material

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.860
back to the
intergalactic medium.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.680
This part here you could
say is one big bottleneck.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.820
We still really
have no idea how we

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.650
go from the formation
of clouds, how

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.610
this cloud forms into a star.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.050
This is still a big mystery.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.970
But we do have some
evidence, from observations,

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.980
in particular, that
clouds are forming in what

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.750
we call dense molecular clouds.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.770
These are just a few
images, very famous images

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.900
from the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.660
A lot of these
images were produced

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.810
in the 1990s, when
I was growing up,

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.260
and I would say images
like these really got

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.610
me excited to be an astronomer.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.910
These sort of images just made
me want to study astronomy.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.355
Because we just-- there's so
much variety of structure,

00:06:02.355 --> 00:06:04.550
and that you can see here,
there's so much physics

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.040
going on.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.730
For example, in this one
here, you can see a bow shock.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.740
This is a triangle
shape here is a bow

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.880
shock that's being ejected
from a young forming star.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.500
All of this diffused
light material

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.990
here is actually
ionizing radiation

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.780
from young, forming stars.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.680
And then these dense
filamentary structures

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.160
are still the dense,
colder gas where stars

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.110
can continue to form.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.560
So there's a lot
of physics going

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.470
on here that we can already
see in the observations.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.520
We still don't
understand it very well.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.420
But we can start to
speculate, how would you

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.990
take these big clouds and
then collapse them down

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.670
to form a star?

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.770
Well, gravity's probably
a good start, right?

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.690
So you can come up
with a cartoon picture

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.830
of star formation, starting
with your dense cold molecular

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:51.950
cloud.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.960
Then you have some sort of
gravitational collapse, that's

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.800
radial, the cloud collapses in
on itself towards the center.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.860
At some point you
reach densities

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.670
that are high enough in order
to ignite nuclear fusion.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.290
That's what a star is, right,
so we now have fusion going on.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.010
There's some outflows, there's
still an accretion disc

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.550
from this original material.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.710
And eventually you start to
form planets, and a disc,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.920
and so forth.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.640
So this looks
pretty good, right?

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.870
I mean, this cartoon, I
feel pretty good about this.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.100
But unfortunately,
the theorists had

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.690
to come and ruin it for everyone
with just a simple calculation.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.370
So I'll walk you through this.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.130
So we can write
down the time scale

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.060
it would take for a cloud
of some density to collapse.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.600
This is called the
free fall time.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.790
The free fall time is
really just a function

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.410
of the cloud density,
assuming that the cloud is

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.450
a spherical cloud, like
I showed in my cartoon.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.100
So for some typical
densities of these clouds,

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.780
we can calculate a time
scale for collapse.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.690
This is something
like 8 million years.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.520
Now then I can say,
well, I know roughly

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.720
how much gas is in the galaxy.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.160
If I look out into the galaxy,
I look with the Hubble Space

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.990
Telescope, with
other telescopes,

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.815
I can calculate the
gas in the galaxy,

00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:14.450
and in particular, the dense
gas mass in the galaxy.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.670
Because we know stars form
in dense molecular clouds.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.560
And I can estimate a mass in
our own Milky Way galaxy of star

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.450
forming gas.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.160
So that I can just say,
well, I want to find out

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.520
the star formation rate, right.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.930
I can just divide the mass of
the molecular gas in the galaxy

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.110
by the collapse time, in order
to get a rate of conversion

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.880
of gas into stars.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.520
So if I do that, I
get a expected rate

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.660
of around 250 solar
masses per year.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.420
Now, what do we
actually observe?

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.420
This is what my theoretical
calculation would predict.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.970
The actual observed star
formation rate in the Milky

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.170
Way, is significantly lower.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.610
Something like three
solar masses per year.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.330
This is a big problem, right?

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.750
We have a big,
theoretical mismatch

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.770
between what the theorists
that are studying star

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.750
formation and the observers.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.210
And so something seems to be
slowing star formation down.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.470
So we really have an issue here.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.070
So how are we going
to solve this?

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.610
So really, the problem
of star formation

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.640
is not how we form stars, right.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.860
We know gravity eventually
wants to bring everything

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.760
together and form
a star, but really

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.880
the problem of star formation
is how do you not form stars?

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.620
How do you get such an
inefficient star formation

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.980
in our galaxy?

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.970
Well, it turns out the galaxy
is actually a complicated place

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.730
to live in, right.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.630
There's a lot of
physics going on here.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.860
This is why galaxies are
so fascinating to study,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.890
is because there's so
much going on here.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.270
In this galaxy here in this
picture, you've got dust.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.320
You can see these
dark dust slings

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.550
that are obscuring
the stellar light.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.720
Stars that are producing all
this bright blobs of light.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.980
You have supernovae
that are exploding,

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.960
that are creating extremely
bright areas within the galaxy,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.130
brighter than the
rest of the stars

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.280
all combined, of
course planets that

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.190
are around the stars
and then other,

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.520
more exotic physical phenomena
that you've maybe heard about,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.510
like cosmic rays.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.250
Right, so, high energy
particles that are produced

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.370
by things like black holes and
supernova, or magnetic fields

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.784
of turbulence, which I'm going
to touch on in this talk.

00:10:24.784 --> 00:10:26.950
So there's a lot of different
physics going on here.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.250
It's very complicated.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.960
So we can easily see how
in my cartoon picture,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.240
maybe we missed something.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.710
Maybe we weren't
thinking about something.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.960
Another complication,
unfortunately,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.470
is that a lot of the time scales
of galaxy evolution of star

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.380
formation are much, much longer
than our own human lifetimes.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.690
So I showed you
the free fall time,

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.170
that's the fastest
that you're ever

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.090
going to get one of
these clouds to collapse.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.110
It's still millions
of year time scales.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.220
And so human life times,
unfortunately, are not so long.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.670
So how are we going
to make progress here?

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.530
Well, I'd like to propose
to you that we really

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.120
should make progress in part
with numerical simulations.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.880
So these are simulations that
are done on a computer, where

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.810
we take some known
physics like gravity,

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.330
like the way fluid
motions work, et cetera,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.220
and then evolve them in space
and time using computers

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.180
in order to study
star formation.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.450
I'm showing you a movie here,
and I want to start it over.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.660
So we start with some
initial conditions.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.110
So in this case it's
a spherical cloud,

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.250
very similar to my
cartoon picture.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.260
And then we allow this
cloud to collapse,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.630
and we also include
other physics

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.570
that we think are important
in star forming regions,

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.280
like turbulence and gravity
and magnetic fields.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.170
We then evolve this is time.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.190
Now you'll notice that
time is running here.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.620
This, you're getting
a density image here

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.360
as it zooms in to the
collapsing region in the cloud,

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.070
because there's so many orders
of magnitude and spatial scale

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.550
and also in density,
this color bar

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.010
here, which is a long scale.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.670
So these are factors of
10, has to also zoom in.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.590
So another part
of the difficulty

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.090
of the star formation
problem is not

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.660
just the time scales involved.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:18.190
It's also the extreme range
of scales, ranges of density.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.330
So finally, we get down into
the kind of densities where

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.150
the star formation
can actually happen,

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.110
and then you can see
in the simulation

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.070
these star particles
are starting

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.850
to form in the simulation.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.350
So this is a very
difficult problem.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.740
But simulations can
help us understand it.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.290
OK, so if you're going
to make a simulation,

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.840
right, you need a cookbook.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.240
You need a recipe.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.850
It's up to you,
you can decide what

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.990
you include in your simulation.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.290
Well, what kind of recipe
would you come up with?

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.094
So obviously, we
need gravity, right.

00:12:50.094 --> 00:12:52.010
So gravity's going to
pull everything together

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.130
into collapse.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:57.310
And the movie I'm showing you
here is one such simulation

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.690
that I've been working with
with the Enzo Collaboration.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.610
So you can see that
these filaments form

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.930
at the start of the
simulation, and then

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.460
begin to collapse
in on themselves.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.730
So pick your favorite
part of the filament,

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.790
and you can follow
it in and see how

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.850
it's sort of pancaking together
as the simulation proceeds.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.130
So we need gravity.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.200
What other things would you
include in your simulation

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.010
of star formation?

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.950
How about turbulence?

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:29.100
So if you look at this initial
gas density distribution,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.510
it's very fractal.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.320
It's very non smooth.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.610
There's a lot of
discontinuities there.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.190
This is what we
mean by turbulence.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.080
And so, for the most part,
when we talk about turbulence

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.180
in our everyday lives, it's
usually an uncomfortable moment

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.872
on the airplane when the captain
comes on the PA, and says,

00:13:46.872 --> 00:13:48.830
you know, we're going to
experience turbulence.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.060
And you start bumping all around
and you wish it would stop.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.030
So this is random fluid motions.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.570
When we encounter
this in the airplane,

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.010
this makes the airplane, of
course, bump up and down.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.010
This is a very nice
picture by da Vinci

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.540
showing a turbulent flow.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.600
And a very similar
sort of thing is

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.620
happening in a molecular cloud.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.940
When we measure velocities
in these star forming clouds,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.330
we see that the velocities
are characteristic

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.170
of a turbulent flow, not
a flow that's very smooth.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.800
And so you wouldn't want to
fly an airplane through one

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.260
of these molecular
clouds, I can tell you.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.370
Now what does
turbulence do for us?

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:32.400
Why do I want to put it in my
simulation of star formation?

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.040
Well turbulence adds a
pressure term, right.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.590
So does anyone drink coffee?

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.000
Does anyone like
French press coffee?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.960
OK, when you stir the coffee
around in your French press,

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.230
you don't immediately
push it down, right.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.360
You need to wait, you need
to let it settle down.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.230
Try it.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.070
Next time you want to
drink a French press,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.990
stir the grinds around a lot,
and then try to push it down.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.690
It's very, very difficult.
You've induced turbulence

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.920
into the fluid,
and that turbulence

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.150
is providing an
additional pressure

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.930
term that's making
it harder for you

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.700
to push your French press down.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.409
So in some sense,
that's a similar thing

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:10.450
to what's happening here.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.820
The turbulent
motions in the cloud

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.420
are resisting the
gravitational collapse,

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.940
and it's not able to
push the cloud in.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.450
That's the main thing turbulence
is doing in the cloud.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.380
It's also doing some
other things, especially

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.930
on the small scales.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.795
It's actually allowing small
scales to collapse even easier.

00:15:27.795 --> 00:15:30.660
But for the most part, you're
adding a pressure term,

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.930
so that's going to slow
star formation down.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.860
Right, so ultimately
we want to figure out

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.240
how can we slow
star formation down

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.190
in order to match that three
solar mass per year number

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.220
that we've sort of
observed in the Milky Way.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.390
So turbulence will slow us down.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.020
What else?

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.050
Magnetic fields.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.900
I bet you wouldn't've
thought that.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.800
But these clouds are
actually magnetized,

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.860
and that means that we
have an additional pressure

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.970
term from the
magnetic field that

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.130
can also resist the collapse
and slow down the clouds.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:07.010
Now the funny thing is that
when you talk to astrophysicists

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.250
and you mention the
words turbulence,

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.630
and magnetic
fields, usually they

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.530
run away from you very quickly.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.950
And that's because these
things are very complicated.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.260
There's no full
theory of turbulence

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.510
from a fluid dynamics
standpoint of view,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.510
this is one of the
unsolved problems.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:27.970
And magnetic fields in a moving,
fluid plasma are also ugly.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.070
But we can also think of
some intuitive pictures

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.940
to understand why
magnetic fields might be

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.640
important for star formation.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.400
So for example, another
real life scenario.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.480
Think about a
rubber band, right.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.500
So if you stretch
out a rubber band,

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.680
a rubber band provides some
kind of tension, right.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.430
It wants to stretch back down.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.700
But with your rubber band,
which is like the magnetic field

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.390
lines, you can't really
move perpendicular to them.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.190
You can only move things
parallel to your rubber band,

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:56.690
right.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.310
So if I take something like
this, something stretchy

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.440
and rubbery, I can't
move my hand this way.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.750
I can only move
my hand this way.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.250
And so this is very similar
to what the magnetic field is

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.604
doing in a star forming cloud.

00:17:10.604 --> 00:17:11.770
So here's a picture of that.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.630
You have your spherical cloud,
and you have the red lines

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:18.020
here, being representing
the magnetic field lines.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:23.680
So the collapse is going to
only be able to proceed parallel

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.839
to the field lines.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.670
The field lines
are going to resist

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.820
the collapse perpendicular,
such that you will eventually

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.720
arrive at a situation
where you have the collapse

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.330
parallel to the field, and the
field being slightly pinched

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.430
along the
perpendicular direction

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.600
due to gravitational
contraction.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.970
This is observed, actually.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:48.510
So here's an observation with
the SMA telescope in Hawaii,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.410
looking at field lines
in a star forming object.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.040
And you can also,
even just by eye,

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.080
see this pinching effect of
the field line, perpendicular

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.870
to the collapse.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.790
This is called a so-called
hourglass morphology,

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.130
or an hourglass shape
in the magnetic field.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.430
And this indicates that the
magnetic field is strong.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.830
OK, what does strong mean?

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:15.550
Well, your fridge
magnet has a strength

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.650
of roughly 50 gauss or so.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.580
These fields are at the
microgauss scale, so 10

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.340
to the minus sixth.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.160
And that's a pretty
big difference,

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.280
but for a molecular cloud,
this is actually very strong.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.090
So in this case, we might expect
that the magnetic forces are

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.780
very strong, stronger than
things like turbulence

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.080
or maybe even the
gravity itself.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.430
So things look very ordered.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.270
However, in other
observations-- so this

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.800
is observations of
dust polarization

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.330
from the Planck satellite,
so similar to what

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.160
Cora was showing.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.400
But instead, we're actually
now interested in what's

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.970
happening in the galaxy.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.540
In this case, the fields
look very random, right.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.090
So you can see the field lines
here looking very chaotic.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.790
And this might be a situation
where things like turbulence,

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.920
which wants to
randomize the field,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.540
is stronger than
the magnetic forces.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.880
So how can we further study the
effects of the magnetic field

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.720
in star formations?

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.790
It's very complicated,
we need to go back

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.650
to our numerical simulations.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.080
And so I'm going to show you
some very, very recent state

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.120
of the art numerical
simulations that we've recently

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.700
performed in order to study the
effect of the magnetic field

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.120
in a collapsing
stellar environment.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.010
And we can do this sort
of in this typical way

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.630
where we observe some sort
of real world phenomenon.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:43.000
So as an example, I've shown
you this instability that

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.090
can actually form
in clouds, it's

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.160
called the Kelvin-Hulmholtz
Instability, where

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.280
you have two shearing flows.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.250
You say, I want to
try to simulate this.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.910
I want to include fluid dynamics
equations, mass conservation,

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.830
momentum conservation,
energy conservation,

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:02.490
and I want to try to simulate
this on a parallel computing

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:03.060
resource.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.080
We have a very nice one here
at Harvard called Odyssey.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.320
And then ultimately-- I'll
restart that movie for you.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.630
We use a particular numerical
simulation, so in this case

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.290
we've used the AREPO code,
which is a code where

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.510
the grid points
in the simulation

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.209
actually move with the fluid
and change with the fluid.

00:20:22.209 --> 00:20:24.000
So they're not static,
and you can actually

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.300
model very precisely
instabilities, turbulence,

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.460
et cetera.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.400
So this is the code we used.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.630
This code is unique, in
that we are able then to,

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.210
following the fluid flow
as it evolves with gravity,

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.960
we are able to follow it
down over many, many orders

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.480
of magnitude and scale.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.800
So going from 16 light years
down to 100 astronomical units.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.100
An astronomical unit is about
93 million miles, the distance

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.540
of the sun and the Earth.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.740
So this is a huge
range of scales.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.960
We're also able to go over
a huge range of densities,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.030
many orders of magnitude
of density going

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:05.120
from the diffuse cloud scales,
down to the very dense cores,

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.610
where the stars are forming.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.550
And the original
thing we've done here

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.530
and additional to that, is we
have four of the simulations.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.210
These simulations are very
computationally expensive.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.380
Four different simulations, each
with a different magnetic field

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.900
strength, so we
can really study,

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.560
in depth, the interaction
of the magnetic field

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.590
and the collapse of the cloud.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.535
So I'm going to show
you these simulations.

00:21:27.535 --> 00:21:29.160
I'm going to show
you all four of them,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.790
and just keep your eye
on the top of the screen.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.640
This is the magnetic field
strength in microgauss.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.220
Here's the first simulation.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.250
And I'm going to show you all
four in a very similar way.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.870
Just to give you some
idea of the scale here,

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.060
so this is about 15,
16 light years across.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.110
This is the cloud
scale, you can see

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:51.180
by eye the density structure
is very fractal, very

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.640
turbulent looking.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.900
And this panel here,
this inset here,

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.590
is one pixel, zoomed in one
pixel from this image here.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.450
So we're talking about
huge ranges of scales.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:07.270
And you can already see that
there's a filamentary structure

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.650
here, and then this panel
here is even further

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.520
zoomed in, a region where
a star would be forming.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.580
Now what does the
magnetic field look like?

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.910
This case has a very
weak magnetic field.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:23.070
And if I over plot the
orientation of the field lines,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.750
it looks pretty random.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:29.380
So the field is somewhat
ordered on the largest scales,

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.380
but as you go to the
smaller and smaller scales,

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.570
it's pretty random.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.160
It's changing its orientation
at every sort of step

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.580
that we go down.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.570
We expect that
because in this case,

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.370
we have a very weak field.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.930
Now if we increase the
field strength-- so again,

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.620
here's the density structure
that you're seeing,

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.380
and here's the magnetic field.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.120
It's already slightly a little
bit more ordered at each scale,

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.610
because we've increased
the field strength.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.240
And we can continue to
increase the field strength,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.245
so this is our second
most strong field case.

00:22:59.245 --> 00:23:00.620
You can see now
the large scales,

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.550
you have a very
uniform, ordered field,

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.230
and this somewhat persists
down to the smaller fields.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.360
However, in this case it
still looks fairly random.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.984
Finally, this is the
highest field strength.

00:23:12.984 --> 00:23:15.400
Things look actually quite
different from the other cases.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.890
So if you compare the
density fields, for example,

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:21.110
especially at the smaller scales
where stars are able to form,

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.540
now there's this very
nice filamentary structure

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.300
that's formed.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.990
In the case where
the magnetic field

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.400
is higher in terms of its
energy and then the turbulence

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.870
and the gravity.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.760
And if we look at the
corresponding field structure,

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.142
we said it's extremely ordered,
all the way down through all

00:23:39.142 --> 00:23:40.850
these different scales
of star formation.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.050
So once you get to
this very smallest

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.100
scales of star
formation, you actually

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.610
start to also see this very
nice hourglass morphology

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:53.360
that we predicted when gravity
was very strong, interacting

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.344
with a magnetic field.

00:23:55.344 --> 00:23:57.010
So this is what the
simulations tell us.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.760
They tell us that there are sort
of two modes of star formation.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.160
One where there's random,
turbulent energy that's

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.610
dominant over magnetic
energy, and another

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:10.150
where the magnetic field sort
of dominates the collapse.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.650
This is from simulations,
what can observations tell us?

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.980
How can we better compare
these two observations

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.480
and simulations?

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.424
Well, I've been harping on
the advance of the simulations

00:24:21.424 --> 00:24:23.090
that we can go through
all these scales,

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.714
include all these
physics, but actually

00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:26.520
the observations have
also been advancing.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.730
So meanwhile, we've
been able to go

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.690
from larger and larger
scales with the observations

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:32.550
to smaller scales.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.010
And so ALMA, the
ALMA telescope, which

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.090
is a millimeter wave
telescope in Chile

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:40.450
has really opened up a
very high sensitivity,

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:44.180
high resolution observations
for star forming regions.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.840
And so we can combine previous
generation instruments

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.500
like the CARMA telescope
and the JCMT telescope

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.760
to get different scales of the
star formation process as well.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.630
So the JCMT data is
giving large scales, so

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.760
sort of a tenth of a
parsec type scales.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.890
CARMA's scales and
ALMA's scales are giving

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.760
this medium and smaller scales.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.470
And so I'll show you
one particular object

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.440
from a recent study that
my collaborators at Harvard

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.380
and myself have performed
using these different data

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.040
sets of a particular
object called Serpens-8.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.920
Here's the JCMT data,
so this is something

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.100
like a tenth of a parsec,
down to the CARMA data,

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.800
down to this finest resolution,
which ALMA has just now opened

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.810
up for us.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:35.120
And all of these data
also have polarization,

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.270
so they all have magnetic field
orientation measurements, which

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.780
I'm showing you down here.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.910
And you can see that the
field looks very random.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:46.500
And it looks very random all
the way down towards the scales

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.490
of the ALMA data.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.630
So this is actually
very similar to what

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:55.470
we found in the simulations
where the field is very weak.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:00.760
And so it seems that this ALMA
scale magnetic field is not

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.260
following the field from
the very largest scales.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.530
That's in contrast to this
nice hourglass picture.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.160
So in some cases we
see an hourglass type

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.470
of morphology, that indicates
the field is very strong.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.410
In other cases,
like in Serpens-8,

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.440
we found that
turbulence is perhaps

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.360
more important in shaping
the field morphology.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.000
And this is in
contrast to decades

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.950
of theoretical and
observational works, which

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.480
say that you should always
form this hourglass.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.870
So in this case we
did not see that.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.580
So I would like to conclude,
going back to our quote

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.630
from Carl, "We are all
made of starstuff."

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.490
If we really want to
understand how we got here,

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.660
how our star was
formed, we really

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.880
have to take into all
the complicated galaxy

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.780
physics, including turbulence,
including magnetic fields.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.080
And so it's complicated.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.760
Simulations are
really going to be

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.590
key to answering a lot of
galaxy physics questions, star

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.460
formation just
being one of them.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.710
And I think really, in terms
of the star formation paradigm,

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.440
we're going to be able to move
towards a predictive theory

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.660
of star formation,
because we understand

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.020
the fluid dynamics better.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:17.160
Because we understand turbulence
and magnetic fields in a better

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.800
way.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.885
So thank you very much.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:29.360
-So our next speaker
is Sarah Rugheimer.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.460
She is originally from
Montana, got her doctorate

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:37.670
at Harvard 2014, and
is now a Simons Origin

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.870
of Life Fellow at St. Andrews.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:46.060
I should also mention that
Blakesley and Sarah do

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.840
podcasts, and do outreach work.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:54.110
And in fact I was listening
to one of Sarah's podcasts--

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.776
you also do this
with Sarah Ballard--

00:27:57.776 --> 00:27:59.380
so I was listening
to one of them,

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:04.280
and she was saying for the
mental health of an academic,

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.120
you should try to
keep your desk clean.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.650
And I looked at my desk
and I was thinking,

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.560
OK, well, I have
some work to go.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.275
-I don't think I
said that, though.

00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:11.570
-Oh?

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:12.420
-I think it was the other Sarah.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.730
-Oh, the other Sarah, OK.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:14.230
OK.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:16.270
-My desk is a mess.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.230
-I feel better now.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.990
OK.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:19.730
OK, so Sarah's going
to talk about how

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.111
detect life on another planet.

00:28:22.111 --> 00:28:22.610
-Thank you.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:27.739
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:29.530
-Well thank you for
inviting me here today.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:32.870
I'm really excited to be talking
to you about my research,

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.810
which, I'm interested
in this question

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:38.020
of how can we detect
life on another planet?

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:44.430
So I just wanted to start first
with a question to you guys.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.470
How many of you
think that we will

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:52.200
be able to detect life in the
next 10 years on an exoplanet?

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.132
Raise your hand.

00:28:53.132 --> 00:28:54.950
10 years.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.800
How many of you think it's
going to be more like 20 years?

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.210
Raise your hand.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:05.020
And how many of
you think 30 years?

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.470
30 years?

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:10.930
And like, say, greater than 30,
50 years, something like that?

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.117
Maybe never.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.559
All right.

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:17.100
Well, we're going
to talk about that.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.480
We're going to talk about
what makes this difficult.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.650
So I'm interested in this
question of are we alone

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:22.700
in the universe.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.257
And we've looked for
various signs of life

00:29:25.257 --> 00:29:27.340
before, with SETI, the
Search for Extraterrestrial

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.350
Intelligence.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:32.020
And you know, so far, we
haven't found anything.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.210
We've just really had silence.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.260
And so my question is still,
are there are aliens out there?

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.600
I want to know this.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:44.640
And we haven't yet had any sort
of greetings, earthlings sign,

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.170
and so we're still looking.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.700
And I want to be
really clear here,

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.440
that when I talk about
are there are aliens,

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.200
I'm not talking about aliens.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.620
I'm not going to be talking
about intelligent life today.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.990
I'm really only
talking about microbes,

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.370
like these single
celled organisms

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.120
that we might be able to
detect the signs of their life

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.040
in the atmosphere
of another planet.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.070
And so how could we do this?

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:11.950
Well, one of the thing to do is
by looking for biosignatures.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.810
And I would argue that
the strongest biosignature

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.400
is something like an
oxidizing and reducing gas

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.370
in combination.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.820
On Earth, that's something
like oxygen and ozone,

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.700
or ozone in combination
with methane.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.820
But individually, you can get
either of these abiotically.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:32.260
For example, UV light can
split water and carbon dioxide,

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.550
and you can be left behind
with oxygen or ozone,

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.010
and you get methane
from vulcanism

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.310
or from hydrothermal vents.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:44.850
And so these by themselves
are not good biosignatures.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.000
On Earth, though,
you have biology

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.660
giving large fluxes of both
gases, of oxygen the methane.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.630
But without biology,
these gases would

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.470
destruct in the atmosphere,
and you wouldn't necessarily

00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:00.180
see them together in the
atmosphere of an exoplanet.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.460
So this is why we go
back to that definition.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.220
Also, biosignatures
require context.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.230
Things like, can
we get constraints

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.290
on the surface temperature?

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.430
Is it a rocky planet?

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:17.080
Does it have bio vital
indicators like CO2 and water?

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.670
Now CO2 and water by themselves
are not biosignatures,

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:24.860
because they can be around
in the whole universe

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.040
just abiotically, but
they are useful for us

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.980
to detect because
they indicate food

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.500
and habitability and
greenhouse gas on the planet.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.520
Other biosignatures that you
might have heard talked about

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.230
are things like N2O,
methylchloride, or dimethyl

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:43.350
sulfide, and maybe ammonia in a
hydrogen dominated atmosphere.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.960
And these, though
they're produced

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.970
in much smaller abundances,
are useful to think about

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:53.140
because they don't have
any abiotic known source.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.800
So my research,
though, is how could we

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.230
detect these biosignatures
around other stars?

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.830
And I love this
pale blue dot image,

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:04.000
which I'm sure many of you are
familiar with, when Voyager

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.050
went out past the orbit of Pluto
and turned around, and took

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.160
this snapshot of our planet.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.920
And here it is.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:16.370
And in that image, you can take
a spectra the light from that

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.324
and see various signs
of life on our planet.

00:32:20.324 --> 00:32:21.740
In particular, you
would be seeing

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.390
that combination of methane
and oxygen and ozone.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:32.720
And also we have surface
vegetation signal as well.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.060
Right now, we're not there.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.601
I just want to be
clear we're talking

00:32:35.601 --> 00:32:37.120
about future observations.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.490
So we're in indirect
detection, not transmission,

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.040
but in direct
detection we're now

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.130
detecting hot, giant planets.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:48.340
And for transmission we're able
to do superearths, warm, really

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.310
warm or hot superearths.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.800
So really, these sorts of
observations are future.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.870
And this just shows
you the spectra

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.690
of three terrestial planets
that we all know and love,

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:01.460
the Earth, Venus, and Mars.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.710
And you can see that those
spectra are very different.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.400
And we expect the
universe to provide us

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.290
with an abundance of
different types of planets,

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.910
and we are hoping
that we're going

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:16.310
to be able to distinguish the
different types of planets

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:18.180
by looking at
something like this,

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.210
and getting spectra
from the planets,

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:24.400
and being able to tease out how
does one planet look different

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.810
from another.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:29.230
Our first opportunity
to be able to do this

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.450
is going to be with the
James Webb Space Telescope,

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:34.950
launching in 2018, as well
as with some of these large,

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.960
ground based observatories
like the GMT,

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.780
the E-ELT, and the TMT that
are being built in the 2020s.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.550
And even more so that
the next generation

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:49.480
of missions, something that
in the astronomy community we

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.320
term LUVOIR or HDST is
this future mission.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.540
Something that's more like a
12 meter space based telescope.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.320
This would be able to
get the direct light

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.770
from these planets, of
habitable, Earthlike planets

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:04.490
much more easily.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.790
And so that's kind
of the trajectory

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.570
of where our technology
is going and where

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:13.780
we're hoping to aim our
future research efforts.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.040
So my work, though, is
interested in how does the star

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.590
impact the atmosphere,
the spectral features,

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.210
and the biosignatures
around these planets.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:27.590
And so I'm going to talk a
lot about FGKM stars today,

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.002
particularly the M stars.

00:34:30.002 --> 00:34:32.210
By and large, you're going
from a high UV environment

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.550
for F stars, down to low
UV, though then M stars also

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:39.760
have a spike in UV environment.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.800
And these-- FGKM is,
again, just bigger, hotter

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.989
down to the cooler
ones for those of you

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.900
who are not familiar
with that terminology.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.530
And UV destroys
some biosignatures.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:55.179
So it could destroy,
say, methane

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:57.262
for example in the atmosphere,
and that might make

00:34:57.262 --> 00:34:58.800
it harder to detect for us.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.250
But on the other hand, UV
produces other biosignatures

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:05.810
like ozone, making that
one then easier to detect.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.900
So UV is kind of a
mixed bag in our ability

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.970
to detect the biosignatures
around these future planets

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.670
that we're going to observe.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.040
In addition to
that, it's the ratio

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.950
of the far UV, so the shorter
wavelength, higher energy UV,

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:25.830
to be near UV, or
the lower energy UV.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:26.880
That matters.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.740
And you can see this
in the reaction rates

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.190
for the production and
destruction of ozone.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:37.060
So here, you can see that
the production of ozone

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:42.630
is dependent on this
far UV energy photons.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:47.415
But the destruction depends
more on the near UV light,

00:35:47.415 --> 00:35:49.250
and can be produced that way.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.000
So it's not just how much
UV you have in general,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.570
it's where in the UV
spectrum you have.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.720
We want to have accurate
observations of the star UV

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:01.770
in order to understand
our future observations.

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.490
So I do modeling.

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:07.400
This is me, before
I dyed my hair red.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:11.930
And as Blakesley said,
we can learn a lot

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.390
from computer modeling.

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:16.710
This is the only time
I'll be like a movie star.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:24.490
And so we do this to model
these atmospheres of exoplanets,

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:26.690
and were interested in
particular questions

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:30.160
like what wavelengths
should we be looking at?

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.010
What resolution
should we be looking

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:36.520
to build our spectrometers
for to detect these features?

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.420
And how big of a
telescope do we need?

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.820
Do we need that LUVOIR
sized telescope?

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.040
Can we go, you know,
instead of 12 meters could

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.920
we do 10 meters?

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.190
You know, and these
sorts of questions

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.070
are the type of
questions that I hope

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:51.280
that my work will help answer.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.150
So I mentioned the FGKM stars,
and today just due to interest

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.720
of time, I'm going to really
focus on these M stars,

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.080
because these are very
interesting stars.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.710
So the M stars are the
coolest stellar type,

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.830
and they're much
smaller than our sun.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.490
But they make up
75% of the stars

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:15.150
in our universe and
solar neighborhood.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:20.080
So in the about the 300
or so closest stars to us,

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.830
246 of them are M stars.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:26.080
And so these are going
to be our nearest targets

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.770
and are just very common places
that we would expect to look.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.950
I love animation
by Elizabeth here,

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:36.190
where this is the night
sky as you normally see it.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:39.170
And then now, if you
turn on what it would

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:40.480
look like with the M stars.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.188
I don't know if you
can see the contrast.

00:37:42.188 --> 00:37:44.400
Now they're starting to
see more red dots there.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.660
You get to see how
many more stars we

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:50.410
would see if we could actually
see these M stars in the night

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:51.370
sky.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:54.610
M stars have a couple
of key advantages.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:38:00.230
One is because they're smaller,
a similarly sized planet

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:04.040
crossing in front is going to
make a bigger transit depth.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.170
That's very useful for us as
astronomers to detect planets.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.100
So you can see here is say an
Earth sized planet crossing

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.600
in front of an an
M star, it's going

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.340
to create much bigger depth than
an Earth like planet crossing

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.900
it in front of a star that
something similar to the sun.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.620
And so, this is
one reason why we

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.960
want to also look at M stars.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.686
In addition these
planets around M stars,

00:38:28.686 --> 00:38:30.060
because they're
cooler, are going

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.460
to be orbiting at
much closer distances.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.810
So that means their habitable
zones are closer, in right.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.960
And so this is a
diagram of stellar type

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.020
here, and the habitable zone.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.272
So here's say, our sun,
and here's the Earth,

00:38:42.272 --> 00:38:43.480
that's in the habitable zone.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.210
But for an M star,
the habitable zone

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.210
is much closer to that star.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:52.380
So it's orbiting maybe every
20 days instead of once a year.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.810
And if we're trying to add
up especially transits,

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:56.290
that's much more
convenient for us,

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:59.200
because we don't have to wait
for observations once a year.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.280
We can get them every
10, 20, 30 days,

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.520
depending on the star type.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.650
And the most exciting
thing, I think,

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:09.860
in one of the
discoveries recently

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.350
is that one in four M dwarfs
have a habitable planet.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.310
That's amazing,
because M stars are

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:17.950
the most abundant
stars in our universe

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.460
and in our solar neighborhood.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.700
And it appears that terrestrial,
earth like planets form

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.650
quite frequently around them.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:29.400
So they're good places
for us to follow up.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.080
They have some problems.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.510
One is they have
a lot of flares,

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.700
and they might be
pretty difficult places

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.400
to live around.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.200
In particular, early
M stars remain active,

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.250
even early M stars, which
are the hotter M stars here,

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:50.260
remain active for one
to two billion years.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.040
For comparison, our
sun remained active

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.980
for, say, half a billion years.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:59.100
And later M stars,
past M4 or so in type,

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.722
those later M stars
remain active for six

00:40:01.722 --> 00:40:02.680
to eight billion years.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.240
So this is the amount of
time that they remain active

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.910
with spectral type.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:11.780
And so that makes our follow
up and understanding what's

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.770
going on is going to
be more difficult.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.270
Also, M stars are just very
hard to characterize in general,

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.950
and there's a lot of
work being done on that.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:22.630
So I'm going to go through
kind of a little cartoon

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.530
drawing of the
differences between what

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:29.110
I'm going to call an active M
star and an inactive M star,

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.460
and then some of the
observations that we have,

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.370
and talk about how
that influences

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.760
our modeling of these planets.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.530
So this would be something like
an active M star spectrrum.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:44.230
And this is the theoretical
minimum limit of activity.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:48.280
So that's just assuming--
going back to Blakesley's point

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:52.710
that magnetic fields are really
hard-- the UV in a lot of stars

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.800
is driven by magnetic field
activity in the chromosphere.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.340
And say you didn't have
that around an M star,

00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.790
you only had just
the temperature

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.880
in the photosphere
radiating, then

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.630
this would be the minimum
amount of UV that you would get.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.720
But in general, when we
measure these older M stars,

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.770
we get something more like this.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.320
Something in the middle.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.980
And we actually don't yet know
what the floor of the UV is.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.470
How low can we go.

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:21.470
Because for some of
these stars, we only

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:23.190
have the emission
peaks observed.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:27.730
We actually don't know where
the floor of the continuum is.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.382
So for example, could it
be down here, or maybe

00:41:30.382 --> 00:41:32.090
it's all the way down
to the photosphere.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.190
We don't yet have
that, answer and we're

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.170
trying to-- we need more
observations of these stars

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:41.390
to probe the range
of expected UVs,

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.480
and particularly the
lower range of UVs

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.790
that we might expect to get.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:47.290
Also, I'm going to
talk a little bit

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:50.920
about the known false
positives for oxygen and ozone.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.190
So oxygen on Earth, all
21%, is produced by life,

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.190
but we have thought
about some ways

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.160
that you could create
it without life.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.610
And so these are just a handful
of the six or so commonly

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.420
talked about false
positive mechanisms,

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.300
and what's really
interesting about this

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:13.220
is about a majority of them
really are most common,

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.160
or we expect to be most
common, are only around planets

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.330
orbiting M dwarfs.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.640
So again, understanding
M dwarfs and their UV

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.700
is really important.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:26.420
And all of these mechanisms
revolve around the UV

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.080
environment of these stars.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.336
So I'm going to go
through one example

00:42:33.336 --> 00:42:36.510
of a false positive
generations of an M star.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:40.560
So M stars can be
really-- before they

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.902
join the main sequence,
they're really luminous.

00:42:42.902 --> 00:42:44.360
They have this
super luminous phase

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.920
that lasts quite a long time.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.060
They're very active.

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.520
And during that phase, if
the planet that's orbiting it

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:55.780
has water, that water is going
to be photolyzed from UV light

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.500
reaching it.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.990
And it's going to
break apart the water,

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:02.827
and the hydrogen is
going to escape to space,

00:43:02.827 --> 00:43:03.910
and it's going to be done.

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:06.410
And you're going to permanently
maybe desiccate that planet.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.440
It's going to turn
into like a Dune world.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.720
And unless you have later
water delivery, of course,

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.060
but this is a concern.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.050
And if you were to
observe such a planet,

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:20.130
you might see a buildup of
oxygen in that atmosphere,

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:22.070
depending on how
much of that oxygen

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:26.630
is going to then later
react with the surface.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.950
Which is something
that a lot of research

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:32.530
has been going on into
that problem as well.

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:33.960
Another example
of that, was this

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.459
was the first
example, I think, that

00:43:35.459 --> 00:43:38.640
proposed of abiotic
oxygen, was for planets

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.400
that are on just
on the inner edge--

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.560
before the inner edge
of the habitable zone,

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.990
so they're all a little
too hot, shall we say.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.520
And they go through a
runaway greenhouse effect.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.900
So you can imagine
this scenario,

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.410
it's basically the same thing.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:55.490
You have the UV light from the
star breaking apart the water,

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:59.170
and you get the hydrogen
escaping to space,

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.490
and your oxygen's left behind.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.700
So again, this goes
back to the point

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.185
that I made at the beginning,
is that to detect life

00:44:07.185 --> 00:44:08.560
on another planet,
is we're going

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.600
to need a combination of gases.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.750
One gas is probably
not going to be enough.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.750
We're going to need context
and multiple gases in order

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:19.160
to understand what we're seeing.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.010
And so this goes back to
the idea that was first

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:25.110
proposed a long time ago
with Lovelock and Carl Sagan,

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.080
and a lot of people
have talked about this

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.770
with the combination
of oxidizing

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:32.570
and a reducing gas, and
context to eliminate

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:36.550
these false positive mechanisms.

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:39.650
And in addition to this,
because most of these mechanisms

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:43.310
rely on the UV of the
host star, we really

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:48.670
need to use real UV
data in our modeling.

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:52.120
In particular, because of
the complex magnetic fields,

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:56.870
we can't yet predict what
that would be around a star,

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:58.520
so we rely on
these observations.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.060
So work is being done
on that as we speak.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:04.310
So here is the real data
instead of the cartoon,

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:07.080
where you have this is
a bright young flaring

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.490
star, AB Leo in the black line.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:15.780
And this green line is
typically quiet M star,

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.180
and then the red line is, again,
that lower theoretical limit.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:23.640
And we yet don't know how
low can this go, so to speak.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.110
And this difference is
10 orders of magnitude.

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:30.280
So understanding what the
lower floor of the UV is

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.060
is going to be really important
for us, especially since we

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:38.200
only have one UV telescope that
can make those measurement,

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.530
which is Hubble right now.

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.180
And Hubble's not going
to last forever .

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.890
So when we look at
these M star models,

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.740
these are for all the
different types of M stars,

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.080
going from the hotter M
stars to the cooler M stars.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.080
The only thing I want you
to take away from this

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.750
here is this is
on a linear scale,

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.820
and this shaded
region is the UV part.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.080
So it doesn't seem like it's
a large part of the flux,

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.340
but it's absolutely
dominating what's

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.930
happening in the atmosphere.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.860
Because all of
your photochemistry

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:10.370
only cares about
the UV light that

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:13.760
has enough energy to
break apart these bonds.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:19.900
So if we compare two extremes,
like most maximum amount of UV

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.810
that we would expect and the
most, absolute minimum, maybe

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:25.560
even less than we would expect
for an Earth like planet

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:29.250
orbiting an M5 star, you
can see that the spectrum

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.650
might look very different.

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:34.310
So this is the same planet just
put around two different stars.

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:37.310
So with different UV, it's
the exact same stellar type.

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:40.630
It's the same size
and otherwise star,

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:42.400
except for just different UV.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.220
And so on the black line,
you have flaring, young star,

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.870
and and in the red line you
have this theoretical minimum.

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:54.150
And different sorts of gases
build up in the atmosphere

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:56.320
and create different
features, and you could

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.330
have a very different spectra.

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:01.040
Which is why characterizing
the UV of these stars

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.990
is going to be vital
for us to interpret

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:06.450
the signs of biosignatures,
and understanding

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:10.390
the context of what we're
observing in the future.

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:13.520
So I hope I've convinced
you that stellar matters,

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.820
and that UV matters, and for
the second part of my talk,

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.860
I want to talk about
how planets change.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:24.290
So we know that planets evolve
through geology, through plate

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:27.200
tectonics, through
life, and we've

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.830
on Earth had many different
phases going from the Hadean--

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:34.785
Hell, as I promised I would talk
to you about-- to the Archean,

00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:38.100
to Snowball Earths, and
even Jurassic period.

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.030
Our planet has gone
through many changes.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:44.700
And I like thinking
about the history of life

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.690
on our planet to
understand the scale.

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:50.690
It's really hard for us to
wrap our head around the scale

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:52.380
of these timelines.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.310
So I'm going to present it as if
the whole history of our planet

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:57.900
was in one hour.

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:01.130
So we started at zero minutes
with the formation of Earth,

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:04.160
so that was 4.6 billion
years ago or so.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.480
Then you have the
origin of life.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.820
We don't exactly know when,
there's a big question

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:09.430
mark there.

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:13.110
But somewhere around 3.9
to 4.4 billion years ago.

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:16.020
That's roughly nine
minutes into the hour.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.290
Then you have the
oldest signs of life,

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:21.490
that's around 3.5 to 3.8,
depending on which papers you

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:23.750
believe, billion
years ago, around

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:26.670
14 minutes into the hour.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.420
You have oxygenic
photosynthesis,

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:33.140
definitely has been around since
around 2.7 billion years ago.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.410
That's 25 minutes into the hour.

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.000
But this always blows my mind
every time I think about this.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.020
Multicellular life, so anything
more than just one cell,

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.660
wasn't around until
one billion years ago.

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:46.300
Very recent.

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.280
That's 47 minutes into the hour.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.420
And land plants weren't around
until 0.5 billion years ago,

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.400
or 53 minutes into the hour.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.340
Humans, anatomically modern
humans, not hominids,

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.380
but humans, in our
anatomical form

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.360
have been around
250,000 years ago.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:09.914
So that's literally in the
last second of this timeline.

00:49:09.914 --> 00:49:11.330
And the atmosphere,
of course, has

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:13.300
changed through all of this.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:17.580
So here we have
no units, notice,

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.790
because we have very
poor constraints

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.380
on the early atmosphere.

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:24.860
But the time, this is Earth's
formation all the way up

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.300
to present, and just kind of a
cartoon of what we might think

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:28.890
has happened.

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:31.440
So we expect there was
more carbon dioxide

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.780
right after the planet
formed, and before oxygen

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:39.310
took hold there was methane as
methanogens kind of dominated

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:40.780
the planet.

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.190
But then once the
oxygen rose, the methane

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:45.560
started declining, because
again, those react together

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.380
and the lifetime of
methane goes down

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.160
from being 1,000
years to 10 years.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.340
Once you have oxygen around,
and then carbon dioxide

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:53.840
is decreased, and
now of course it's

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.890
increasing again due
to human activity.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:59.290
So that's sort of what
we have going on here.

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:02.770
And oxygen has rose kind of in
two distinct little steps here,

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:07.940
and there's been some other
complexities along the way.

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.090
But that's the broad picture.

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:13.040
And so I'm going to take a
look at sort of four time

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.683
points in this Earth history.

00:50:15.683 --> 00:50:19.200
From something that's a
pre-life sort of planet,

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.960
something that has no
necess-- just geological gases

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.730
in the atmosphere, to
something with 1% PAL.

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:30.750
So, this is Present
Atmosphere Level.

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:36.540
So that means 1% is 1%
of our 21% of oxygen,

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:39.510
not 1% of oxygen.

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:43.000
And then likewise,
10% PAL of oxygen

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.330
would be 2.1% percent
oxygen in the atmosphere

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:48.300
at 0.8 billion years ago,
and then the modern Earth.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.940
So those are four time points.

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:54.320
And this is where we get a
little bit into some graphs.

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.190
We have four slides, of a lot
of lines and a lot of graphs,

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:02.020
and then we'll get back to
some of the big picture stuff.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:10.030
So here is the pre-life
spectra of a planet orbiting

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.500
different types of stars,
going from the purple colors

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.767
to the red colors and
different stellar types.

00:51:14.767 --> 00:51:17.350
And I'm going to go through the
different geologically epochs.

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:21.990
This is the first rise of
oxygen, second rise of oxygen,

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:23.187
to the modern atmosphere.

00:51:23.187 --> 00:51:24.770
Now there's a lot
of lines there and I

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:27.350
don't expect you to take
it all in right now,

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.420
but I want to
highlight a few things.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:36.180
One is that the ozone level
pops out very early, actually,

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.990
for the planets orbiting
the hottest stars.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:39.720
For the planets
orbiting the F stars.

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.910
Because F stars have so
much more UV radiation,

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:48.180
that they make ozone
more efficiently

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:52.060
around those planets for
the same levels of oxygen.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:55.430
And then you see it starting
to form for all stars here,

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:57.390
and methane is of
course changing

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:00.040
as well in play
with how much oxygen

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.350
there is and, how much
flux we're assuming

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:03.970
is coming from biology.

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:07.810
And so it might be easier to
detect, for example, oxygen

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:09.730
or ozone in combination
with methane actually

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:13.620
earlier in history than
in our modern atmosphere.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.920
And then you have the
modern atmosphere.

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.490
So that's again where
we want a combination

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:23.790
ideally of something
like methane and oxygen.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:26.360
And this is easiest
to do in the IR,

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.260
though there's
also reasons why we

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.630
want to look in the visible as
well, which we'll talk about.

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:35.130
Also the CO2 feature
has changed as well.

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:39.080
So the amount of CO2, of course,
depends on the future strength.

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:42.890
But interestingly enough, you
look at the bottom panel here,

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:44.120
you have this peak.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.740
And that's due to our
temperature inversion.

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:49.800
So ozone heats the
stratosphere, and then that

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:54.600
causes an emission peak in
the center of the CO2 feature.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.830
This is something that we
might be able to observe,

00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:59.930
and then it can be like
a secondary indicator

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:02.960
of an inversion later, or
ozone in the atmosphere

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.890
of a terrestrial planet.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.236
So I wanted to highlight
the oxygen feature though,

00:53:07.236 --> 00:53:09.360
and this is in the visible,
because this is the one

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.156
that a lot of people talk
about and a lot of missions

00:53:12.156 --> 00:53:12.780
are focused on.

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.920
Can we detect oxygen
around the planet?

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.880
And whether we detect
oxygen, just as going back

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.930
to your question
about the media,

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:26.620
whether detecting oxygen as
a technological goal I think

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:28.660
is very valuable.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.970
But that's not necessarily
detecting life.

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:33.180
Because we need to keep
in mind that there's

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.630
a lot of false positives.

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:37.520
So this is something that I
hope the astronomy community is

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.780
going to do a very good job
as we start coming and getting

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.840
these first detections
of potentially

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.840
biosignature molecules in
the atmosphere of a planet.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.360
So here we have oxygen
going from pre-biotic

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.770
to the 1% again, PAL,
10% PAL to modern earth.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:58.870
This is just kind of the
absolute future strength.

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:01.020
But when we look
at what we would

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:05.370
see with our telescope, when
we add in all the fancy stuff,

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.980
it gets a little harder to see.

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:09.550
But in a clear sky model
you can still see those dips

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:11.180
pretty well, right.

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.030
Now the interesting
thing is with clouds,

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:14.140
it really disappears.

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.900
So there's a lot of lines here,
but I just want you to compare.

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.930
Look at, there's no real-- you
can't really tell the dip here

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:23.690
compared to here, and it's much
more minor there than there.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:25.707
Whereas for the modern
Earth atmosphere,

00:54:25.707 --> 00:54:27.790
you can tell no matter
what the cloud coverage is.

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:30.890
And so this is something
that my thesis work showed.

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:34.190
Is that clouds are really going
to be a confounding factor,

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:35.630
and yet we're
already seeing this

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:37.530
in observations of exoplanets.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:41.155
That clouds can really block
parts of the atmosphere,

00:54:41.155 --> 00:54:42.530
and this is going
to be something

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:44.670
that we're going to have
to try to figure out

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:46.080
how to get around.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.960
But it is a potential problem.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.280
And if we look in the
IR, though, clouds

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.260
are different, because
it's more based

00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:55.840
on the temperature difference
between the absorbing

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:56.720
and emitting layers.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:01.450
So if we look at ozone the IR,
you have the feature strength.

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:04.740
Again, this is just the
absolute absorption.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:09.321
Then you have the clear sky
model, versus the 60% cloud

00:55:09.321 --> 00:55:09.820
model.

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:12.770
They don't look, you know,
qualitatively all that

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:14.410
different.

00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:16.710
And so in some ways,
ozone would be much easier

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:21.170
to detect through
geological time than oxygen.

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:25.190
And so if you compare just
the oxygen versus the ozone,

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:31.252
again here, you can see that it
pops out much faster in ozone

00:55:31.252 --> 00:55:32.960
than it does for
oxygen. Though of course

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.626
once you get to modern
levels of oxygen,

00:55:34.626 --> 00:55:36.240
it's just it's just there.

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.380
And interestingly enough,
the feature for ozone

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:43.560
is actually deeper in the past
for some of the hotter stars,

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.140
because the hot stratosphere
actually washes out

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:47.719
the feature.

00:55:47.719 --> 00:55:49.510
So these are all sorts
of things that we're

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:51.390
going to need to keep
in mind when we're

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:54.640
looking for these features.

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:59.320
I just kind of want to end with
like this global sort of idea

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:02.865
of we're now at the stage, the
first stage in human history,

00:56:02.865 --> 00:56:04.240
that we're able
to start thinking

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.990
about answering this question
of are we alone in the universe.

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:09.870
And if we just think about the
history of humans in one hour,

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:11.660
we had the agricultural
revolution--

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.110
I'm starting there, I could've
started 250,000 years ago,

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:17.210
but then the clock
would be really skewed.

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:21.330
So we have the agricultural
revolution roughly 10,000 BC.

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:24.910
Then you have the first evidence
of metallurgy around 5000

00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:28.700
to 6000 BC, or 20
minutes into the hour.

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:34.350
Written language around 3200
BC, 34 minutes into the hour.

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:37.930
And then the Industrial
Revolution 1760, 58 minutes

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:39.990
and 43 seconds.

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:44.890
The internet in 1969, 59
minutes and 46 seconds.

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:49.340
And the first exoplanets
discovered in 1992 and 1995,

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.640
59 minutes and 54 seconds.

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.500
So we're really
approaching this time

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:54.460
where I think
we're going to find

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.418
a lot of interesting
things about our universe,

00:56:56.418 --> 00:56:58.210
as you've heard from
the previous talks,

00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:00.220
and hopefully about
our place in it.

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:04.834
We have TESS launching and
CHEOPS launching in 2017.

00:57:04.834 --> 00:57:06.000
These are going to be great.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.300
TESS is going to find
thousands of close by planets,

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:10.910
dozens of these are
going to be rocky

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:14.140
and in the habitable
zones of these cool stars.

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:16.970
CHEOPS is going to get
that accurate radii

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:17.760
of known planets.

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.301
And this is important
because then we

00:57:19.301 --> 00:57:21.200
can get the bulk
density, and start

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:24.660
to figure out what are these
planets actually made of.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.180
We've had some amazing
discoveries this summer.

00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:30.780
The first one was this temperate
planet, the TRAPPIST planets

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:34.930
you might have heard about
orbiting a very late M star,

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:36.020
or brown dwarf.

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:39.210
And these planets are
something that maybe we

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:41.400
could follow up with
JWST, and one of them

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.980
is potentially habitable.

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.130
And that was very exciting.

00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:45.950
And then I'm sure
you heard last month,

00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:48.090
there was even the
more amazing discovery

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:54.580
of the terrestrial habitable
planet around Proxima Centauri,

00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:58.700
the closest star to Earth,
which which is just amazing.

00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:01.660
And I'm so excited to see
what the future's going

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.220
to hold for that.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:06.400
Ultimately we want to be finding
these molecular fingerprints

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.520
of life orbiting other planets.

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.440
And it's a
technological challenge.

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:14.170
It's like looking for a firefly
in front of a spotlight.

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:15.970
Imagine that spotlight's
in California

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:17.400
and we're in Massachusetts.

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.820
It's really hard.

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:21.580
But we're going to try to do
it, and at the first opportunity

00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:23.830
we're going to have as with
James Webb Space Telescope

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:26.640
and with these large
ground based observatories.

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:29.960
And we live in a big galaxy,
and so I'm pretty hopeful.

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.600
We're one star
amongst billions, we

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.040
have a lot of
places we can look,

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.510
and we have billions
of galaxies.

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:40.550
And hopefully we're going to
find some planets like Earth,

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:43.320
and be able to characterize
those planets in the upcoming

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.050
decades, and finally answer
this question of are we alone

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:47.150
in the universe.

00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.650
Thank you.

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:56.690
-Hello.

00:58:56.690 --> 00:59:00.590
This might actually be a
little bit outside your topics,

00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:08.520
but from what I read, the
planet in the solar system

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.590
other than Earth is
most likely to have

00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:13.220
life is supposed to
be Europa, because

00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:15.650
of its water and
its internal heat.

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:17.780
But obviously that's not
in the habitable zone.

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:21.040
It's not Earth like,
obviously, so how

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.420
would that change--
like, you're not

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:27.650
looking for the same
kind of-- you're

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:30.100
not looking for a model
of Earth to determine

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.560
whether it has life.

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.350
So how does that
change the process

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:38.180
of looking for signs of life
on a planet like Europa,

00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.810
if we were going
to look for that?

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:42.650
I think we're launching
a craft over there

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:44.490
at some point in the future?

00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:46.760
-Yeah, I think that's
a great question.

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.310
It's actually a question
that's very insightful.

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:52.060
Because I would
say that where life

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.650
can exist in our own solar
system and in the universe

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:58.900
is much in much more
wide areas than where

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.490
we're planning to first target.

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:02.940
If you take the
example of Europa,

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.254
yes, I think it is a very
habitable environment because

01:00:05.254 --> 01:00:06.420
of the things you mentioned.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.410
There's water, you have
geothermal activity,

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.164
you have rocks and minerals.

01:00:11.164 --> 01:00:12.580
You have a very
stable environment

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.560
for billions of years.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.920
I'm very hopeful there.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.590
But it doesn't
have an atmosphere.

01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:19.280
It's not interacting
with-- like,

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.350
we couldn't observe that on
around another star system.

01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:24.100
That's way beyond our horizon.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.370
And so when we say
habitable zone,

01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:28.470
sometimes it's a
shorthand, I feel,

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:31.310
for the remotely
detectable habitable zone.

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:35.240
So if we can't remotely detect
life on Europa from Earth,

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.510
how could we ever
detect a Europa analog

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:39.810
around another star system?

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:42.210
It's just way too
difficult. So when

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:43.760
we're talking
about biosignatures

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.560
around other planets,
around other stars,

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:50.580
we're really talking
about planets

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.040
that have an active
biosphere that

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.400
is like Earth, where there's
just a lot of life on it.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.316
That's what we're hoping
to be able to detect.

01:00:57.316 --> 01:00:59.260
Whereas like Mars,
for example, you know,

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:01.620
also could be habitable,
but we can't even

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:04.550
tell if there's life on it yet,
and we've sent a lot of rovers

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:08.340
and we have observations of the
orbiters and stuff like that,

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.140
and we're still like [GROAN],
trying to figure all that out.

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.800
So I feel like for
these types of planets

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.850
that are outside the
traditional habitable zone,

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:18.620
they're certainly interesting
for our solar system search

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:22.040
to probe the where
life lives and how

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.230
does it arise in
different environments,

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.630
and can we tell if it's
a second origin of life

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:29.560
or if it was transferred
from meteorites

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.810
within our solar system.

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:33.280
All of these things
are fascinating

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.310
for our solar system, as
well as like with Titan,

01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.820
if we find life in the
liquid methane lakes.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.420
It's not based on water.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.660
So interesting, but
again, how would we

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.440
tell if that life-- what
are those biosignatures?

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.940
So that's why
we're first looking

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:49.666
for life that looks like ours.

01:01:49.666 --> 01:01:52.462
-So, I guess, does
that mean like-- so,

01:01:52.462 --> 01:01:55.120
let's say we are looking
on Europa just-- oh, I'm

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:59.550
sorry-- we are looking on
Europa or Titan, or Mars.

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:04.570
Does that mean' we're
kind of reduced to just,

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:07.420
kind of base soil samples,
like other than conjecture,

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.520
like, we we don't have
much else to work on,

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.140
since we're not working with
the Earth model as much?

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:15.130
[INAUDIBLE] an Earth model?

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:17.730
-I mean, we can go to
those planets and moons,

01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:18.550
which is amazing.

01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:25.180
And we can get samples there
and do measurements in situ,

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.970
and so that's what makes those
like much better targets.

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:31.940
And so it's kind of--
there's this kind

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:35.510
of exoplanet science for planets
outside of our solar system,

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:37.470
and that's for a
solar system planets.

01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:40.550
I think they're both two prongs
of very interesting questions,

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:42.910
and I'm excited about all of it.

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:44.260
-Are there other questions?

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.880
Dimitar.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:49.480
You'll have to get
the mic, though.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.110
-This is a question
for Blakesley.

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:56.390
Blakesley, I wanted to
ask you a question which

01:02:56.390 --> 01:03:00.020
combines a little bit of
your work with that of Sarah,

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.130
in the sense that
now that you've

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:07.980
shown that the magnetic field
difference really matters,

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:13.720
do you expect that there
will be serious differences

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.160
in the amount of mass in
those broad [INAUDIBLE] discs

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.930
around the young
stars that form when

01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:20.560
the magnetic field is stronger?

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:25.430
And do you expect this
will change the planets

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:28.100
architectures and what planets
form around said stars?

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.190
-So the answer is yes.

01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:32.280
Yeah, I mean, this is
still ongoing work,

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.070
and the simulations I showed,
sort of one of the first times

01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:41.460
that we've been able to do
multiple different magnetic

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.830
field strengths.

01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:44.650
Usually those
numerical simulations

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:47.650
are so expensive in terms
of the computing time

01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:49.570
you need to run them,
that it's very difficult

01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:50.800
to do a parameter study.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.560
So we're just now moving into
this area where we can actually

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.190
change all the
relevant parameters

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:56.860
and see how that affects things.

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:00.060
Like what kind of stars
will ultimately form out

01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.890
of those different simulations.

01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:05.050
And we suspect that in
the high magnetic field

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:07.620
strength, if you remember
you could see that filament,

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.320
that large filament,
so more mass

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.080
is concentrated
into that filament.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.470
That'll change how
the gas ultimately

01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:15.110
fragments into stars.

01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:17.840
And so you might get higher
mass stars in that case

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:21.140
than you would in the cases
where the field was weaker,

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:24.000
and you have more filamentary
structures, like smaller

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
filaments, more
fragmentation, you

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.100
might have smaller
stars forming.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:31.560
That will ultimately change
what kind of star you form,

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.350
which then leads
into what Sarah was

01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:37.610
talking about with these
different M dwarfs or G dwarfs

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:38.880
or K stars.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.000
That would then change to
have habitability as well.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.092
So the magnetic field matters.

01:04:46.092 --> 01:04:47.080
-It always does.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.670
-So one question for Sarah
and the other for Blakesley.

01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:56.290
For Sarah, I guess the question
of extraterrestrial life,

01:04:56.290 --> 01:04:58.560
it has multiple layers.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.800
Your signature of gas is
based on the assumption

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.170
that extraterrestrial
life has a similar biology

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:08.050
to that on the Earth.

01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:09.840
That's a big assumption.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.590
Unsubstantiated.

01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:16.700
Secondly, due to inflation in
the beginning of the universe,

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:20.480
there may be parts of the
universe in which there's

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.670
intelligent life,
but we will never

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.190
be able to communicate
with them, because

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:28.120
of the vast distance
separating them.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.853
Under current physical law,
there's no way to communicate.

01:05:31.853 --> 01:05:32.352
-Yes.

01:05:32.352 --> 01:05:37.605
-And for Blakesley, because you
didn't specify the time points

01:05:37.605 --> 01:05:40.620
over the evolutionary
course of the universe.

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:43.790
If you included the [INAUDIBLE]
and the [INAUDIBLE],

01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:46.480
I wonder if it would
make a difference

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.200
in the simulation of star
formation on a large scale.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.384
-You mean from, like,
cosmological scales, are?

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:54.883
-Yeah.

01:05:54.883 --> 01:05:55.611
Yeah.

01:05:55.611 --> 01:05:56.110
-Well.

01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:57.890
So I was talking
very specifically

01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:59.770
about star formation
in the galaxy.

01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:01.460
But you can also
think about how stars

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:06.290
form within galaxies as a
function of like longer time

01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:06.790
scales.

01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:09.560
We're talking about like
many, many gigayears.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.970
And actually the
universe, we know,

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:15.390
from measurements and
also from simulations,

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:20.380
the star formation rates were
much higher 5 billion years ago

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:22.690
than they are in the
present, you know,

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:25.700
modern Milky Way type galaxies.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:29.760
So the universe back then
was actually producing stars

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:33.810
at different rates, and we
really don't understand why.

01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:36.450
So there's a lot
of evidence that it

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:40.070
has something to do with
the accretion on to galaxies

01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:42.730
was higher in the
early universe,

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:45.410
but it's still an open question
about what kind of galaxy

01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:47.290
physics we need to
really consider in order

01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:50.600
to see the increase in
the star formation rate

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.440
at earlier cosmic times.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:58.174
-Right, and only face of
the universe [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.720
-I'm going to answer
the questions as well,

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.900
that you asked first.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:07.400
So, yeah.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.730
I think they're excellent
questions actually.

01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:13.350
Because why would we expect
to find similar biosignatures

01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:14.650
as what we find on Earth.

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:18.330
And a large part of this,
we don't know, first off,

01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:21.350
but a large part of this relates
to chemical energy gradients

01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:24.330
and things that we know work on
Earth that we might expect to,

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:26.680
through Darwinian
evolution, arise.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:32.760
So if we look at the path
of life on Earth and just

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.020
in the universe, I would quickly
mention that CO2 is abundant.

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.160
Water is abundant.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:41.100
So these sorts of, you
know, raw materials for life

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.810
are really common.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:46.220
Silicon is less common.

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:50.549
So these are sort of things
why we might expect life

01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:52.340
to use them, as well
as water has some very

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.550
interesting properties.

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:56.017
And we have literally a
lot of places to look.

01:07:56.017 --> 01:07:58.350
So we're going to look for
places that we can recognize,

01:07:58.350 --> 01:07:59.820
because I just
don't think we would

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.194
be able to tell
whether it's life

01:08:01.194 --> 01:08:03.289
or not if it's a totally
different biochemistry.

01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:04.830
But I want to go a
little bit further

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:08.170
into that is if you look
at oxygenic photosynthesis.

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:11.880
It relies on CO2 and
water and starlight.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.360
Those things are going to be
on other planets, you know,

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.189
because those are both common.

01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:21.149
And so it seems to
me likely that if you

01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:25.060
have some sort of life that's
able to take advantage of it,

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:25.560
it would.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.340
Because you have a lot of
energy source from the star,

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.760
and then you're using
things that we know

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.229
are common on other planets.

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:36.819
So that might lead
rise to oxygen.

01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:40.399
And then on the flip side of for
why oxygen is important for us,

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.819
you get twice the
amount of redox energy

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:48.340
from oxygen, about, as from
the next chemical gradient.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:54.140
So this is what led to the
rise of complex life on Earth.

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:58.992
As for the second question,
the vast distances, of course

01:08:58.992 --> 01:09:00.200
that's going to be a problem.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.810
Not just with other galaxies,
even within our own galaxy.

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:05.029
I mean, even talking to
Alpha Centauri is going

01:09:05.029 --> 01:09:08.500
to be a long conversation.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.791
-Up here.

01:09:09.791 --> 01:09:11.399
We have two questions
up here, we'll

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:16.300
start with one, yeah,
and then the other.

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.100
-First of all, thank
you both for the talks.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.410
Very enjoyable.

01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:23.859
Question for Sarah, and
I'll start from very far.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:27.649
As an Italian, we sent
Galileo to the trial.

01:09:27.649 --> 01:09:31.080
We have our own
history of believing

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.620
we are the center
of the universe,

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:36.660
and so I always kind of
rejected anthropocentrism.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:41.087
So for me the question which
was the last slide of your talk,

01:09:41.087 --> 01:09:41.920
it's kind of boring.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:44.270
Like, just
probabilistically I believe

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:45.630
there is life out there.

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:48.600
So I guess my question
is, what happens next?

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.271
So if you think of your
field in 10, 20 years,

01:09:51.271 --> 01:09:53.270
I guess that you don't
want to just put a check.

01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:56.460
OK, there is life, I'm
done, retire early.

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.590
So what can you do after that?

01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:03.320
What can we learn besides
a binary yes or no answer?

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.487
-OK, well first off, getting
the binary yes or no answer

01:10:06.487 --> 01:10:07.820
is going to be difficult, right?

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:10.620
Because with these
microbial signs of life,

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:12.555
are we going to know 100% sure?

01:10:12.555 --> 01:10:15.180
We're not sending a probe there
with a little microscope seeing

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:18.720
the things, you know,
swimming around in the ocean.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.030
So that's actually going to,
in and of itself, I think,

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:22.370
is going to be really difficult.

01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:25.500
Because we can only
maybe say, this planet

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.160
seems like it has life.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.010
We can't think of
any other reason

01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:32.080
through geology, chemistry,
and physics alone

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.340
that would make these sorts
of gases in the atmosphere.

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.686
So I think getting the binary
answer is already actually

01:10:38.686 --> 01:10:41.060
pretty difficult. And we're
only going to be able to say,

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:45.209
oh, maybe, we think this
is our best candidate.

01:10:45.209 --> 01:10:47.250
And then I think getting
that answer is exciting,

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:48.690
because we don't know, right.

01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:50.920
I mean, we think life is
common in the universe,

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.600
and I would say I base
my personal opinion

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.720
on that based on how
quickly life arose on Earth.

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.140
We have evidence of life
going back very far.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:01.350
So it seems that microbial
life started very quickly,

01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:04.270
and so this is why
I'm optimistic.

01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:07.590
But I'm very excited for
us to map out not just

01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:11.120
is there life out there,
but also getting back

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.680
to frequency, how common is it?

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.070
How common are planets
that have these sorts

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:19.696
of atmospheres or active
biosignatures or biospheres?

01:11:19.696 --> 01:11:21.570
All sorts of things that
we can do with that.

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:24.040
And then on the
future, future horizon,

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:27.530
I don't know, when we have
like Starship Enterprise,

01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:32.480
looking at maybe different
possibilities of biosignatures.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.390
And we're starting
that work on Earth

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:37.540
right now, with looking at
alternative biochemistry.

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.450
Stuff like what Steve
Benner is working on,

01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:42.657
to see what other types of
biochemistries could life use,

01:11:42.657 --> 01:11:45.240
and what kind of biosignatures
would those produce, and are we

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.489
going to all distinguish that.

01:11:46.489 --> 01:11:48.290
That's much more
difficult, but certainly I

01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:51.540
think that's a very
interesting area of research.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.620
-As a total outsider
to the field,

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:56.770
though, I can easily imagine
if we one day get to the point

01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:58.950
where we can travel to
one of these planets.

01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:00.720
And actually it's
going to happen,

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.690
I think, within our lifetimes
even, with Alpha Centauri,

01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:06.340
if Breakthrough Starshot works.

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:10.322
So if that's the case, we need
to be able to somehow know

01:12:10.322 --> 01:12:12.530
something about where we're
going before we go there,

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:15.330
because it still will take 20
years for Breakthrough Starshot

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:17.160
just to get to the
nearest star system.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.400
So you don't want to
somehow stop and turn

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:24.790
around, because you realize
that the planet is not any good.

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:26.440
We need to be able
to characterize

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.350
these planets from a distance.

01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:29.480
-Yes.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.502
Yes to all of that.

01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:36.650
-I have a question for Sarah.

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:40.130
So I was wondering,
obviously, how

01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:43.160
do you take the spectrum
of the planet's atmosphere?

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.687
Because from
earth's perspective,

01:12:44.687 --> 01:12:46.520
it's going to be right
in front of the star,

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.420
and obviously the star is
billions of times brighter.

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.246
So how can you tell
like that you're

01:12:51.246 --> 01:12:52.620
getting a spectrum
of the planet,

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:54.020
and not the start behind it?

01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:55.900
-It's a very good
question, because it's

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.970
a bit like you're getting
10 billion photons,

01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:01.427
and then you get one
photon from the planet.

01:13:01.427 --> 01:13:02.760
That's a very difficult problem.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.093
And when we're talking about
gravitational waves and all

01:13:05.093 --> 01:13:07.442
these other very
difficult measurements,

01:13:07.442 --> 01:13:08.900
this is why it's
difficult. This is

01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:11.620
why it's like looking for a
firefly in front of spotlight

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.840
across the continent.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.360
So there's a couple different
ways, really shortly, two ways.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.580
One is you take a picture
when the planet's in front,

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.705
you take it when it's
behind, you subtract the two,

01:13:24.705 --> 01:13:27.840
and you're left behind
with the starlight.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.490
You look at the light going
through the upper layers

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.810
of the atmosphere as
it's in transmission.

01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:36.360
And you can measure
how it appears

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.052
to change at different
wavelengths due to that.

01:13:39.052 --> 01:13:41.260
And we're already doing
that, actually, we're already

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:44.390
doing that for planets
that are superearth sized,

01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:46.030
and that are a bit
warmer than Earth.

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:48.670
So we're already
getting the measurements

01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:50.490
of atmospheres for
planets that are

01:13:50.490 --> 01:13:52.600
very close to what
we eventually want

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.850
to get for Earth like planets.

01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:56.730
So we're nearing that
technological capability.

01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:58.710
And then the next
way to do it, which

01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:01.190
will allow us to search for
even greater number of planets,

01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:02.606
is to just black
out the starlight

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:04.990
completely with like a
starshade, or something

01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:07.870
on the telescope to block
out the light, a chronograph.

01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:10.530
And then you just
directly get the light

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:13.406
from the planet that's
being reflected off.

01:14:13.406 --> 01:14:14.392
-Awesome.

01:14:14.392 --> 01:14:16.370
Thank you.

01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:19.154
-You have a question over here?

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:20.153
Two questions over here.

01:14:23.855 --> 01:14:25.730
-Can you give us
a little bit more

01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:30.280
of an idea of the time scale to
make the kinds of measurements

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.990
that you could even
be able to see,

01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:38.050
let's say an ozone line
in an Earth like planet

01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.550
at a distance of 10
light years or something.

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:44.280
I mean, we're talking about
500 orbits all stacked on top

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.140
of each other, and so forth.

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.290
And then I have a follow
up, if the answer's yes.

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:49.790
-Yes.

01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:53.400
So there's a couple of
papers, Deming, 2009,

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:58.500
and Kaltenegger, 2009, look
at calculating those features

01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.980
for wiht JWST.

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:03.350
And so we're looking at
hundreds of hours for say,

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:06.080
10 parsecs of telescope time.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:11.450
So adding up multiple
transits, maybe even looking

01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:14.080
at a planet for the entire
lifetime of JWST every time

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.900
it transits to get a
full characterization

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:17.870
of its atmosphere.

01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:20.080
So for JWST, we're
only going to be

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.780
able to do a handful of
these terrestrial planets.

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.967
We're going to be able to do a
lot of other planets with JWST,

01:15:26.967 --> 01:15:29.050
and it's going to be very
exciting for planetarian

01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:30.090
science in general.

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:33.686
But for habitable, Earth
like planets, you know,

01:15:33.686 --> 01:15:35.810
I think we're going to get
the first glimpse there.

01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:38.143
We're going to get another
glimpse with the ground based

01:15:38.143 --> 01:15:40.639
telescopes, and then really
the next generation with LUVOIR

01:15:40.639 --> 01:15:42.680
is going to be where we're
going to hopefully get

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.280
more statistical sample
of Earth like planets.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.930
-OK, thanks.

01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:51.340
-I would like to ask-- maybe
I didn't quite understand--

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:54.460
but you mentioned that for
the first 2 billion years

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:58.180
we didn't have any oxygenic
photosynthesis on Earth.

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:01.560
Would you be able to detect
life on a planet like that,

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.710
where there's no oxygen
in the atmosphere?

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:05.852
-Yeah, so, I mean.

01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:08.310
We might have had small amounts
of oxygenic photosynthesis,

01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:11.350
it just wasn't
widespread until, you

01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:13.070
know, especially the
first rise of oxygen

01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:15.640
2.4 billion years ago.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:20.350
People argue about when oxygenic
photosynthesis first started.

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:21.305
So it would be hard.

01:16:21.305 --> 01:16:22.930
I don't think we
would be able to tell,

01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:25.450
because if it was just
like methane and CO2

01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:28.210
and how much methane would
you expect from geology

01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:31.060
on a different planet, that's
going to be very difficult.

01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:38.420
So, you know, that's why it's
a combination of biosignatures.

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:40.880
The other gases, like
N2O, and methylchloride,

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.550
and dimethyl sulfide
and these things,

01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:45.400
they also might be around.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.810
But they're produced in
such smaller quantities,

01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:50.430
that they might need a much
more massive telescope to see,

01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:54.450
and they're very usually very
individual to certain organisms

01:16:54.450 --> 01:16:57.390
rather than kind of
more general to life.

01:16:57.390 --> 01:17:01.150
So yeah, I think it's
going to be difficult.

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:03.680
Certainly the easiest time
to detect life on earth

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.710
was after the rise of
oxygen when you also

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:10.140
had methane in the atmosphere.

01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:13.300
So, the last 2 billion years.

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.420
-Some other questions?

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:18.360
I guess that gives me the chance
to ask the last two questions,

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.910
if that's OK.

01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:24.857
So one for Blakesley,
and one for Sarah.

01:17:24.857 --> 01:17:26.940
So I'll just ask them both,
and you can take them.

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.930
So for Blakesley, I
guess the question

01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:34.410
about going back in time
to the earlier universe.

01:17:34.410 --> 01:17:38.090
I was thinking this the star
stuff, Carl Sagan quote,

01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:40.280
kind of pinged this in my mind.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.450
And I was wondering,
did the composition

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:45.990
of the protostar clouds, if you
change the composition in terms

01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:48.450
of the metallicity,
have you have

01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:53.070
you examined that dependency
and if so, what's the result?

01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:56.630
And then for Sarah,
you concentrate a lot

01:17:56.630 --> 01:18:02.860
on CO2-- I mean, on ultraviolet
as being a main bond breaking

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:07.260
driver, and I don't honestly
know about ionizing radiation,

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:10.090
but I was just curious
if ionizing radiation

01:18:10.090 --> 01:18:13.510
is a factor of the magnetic
fields of the planets

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:14.720
that you're looking at?

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.340
Or weak, or strong,
or what we know

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:20.430
about possibly the magnetic
fields of exoplanets?

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:23.211
So I don't know, so maybe
Blakesley, you can go first.

01:18:23.211 --> 01:18:23.710
-Yeah.

01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:25.570
So you raise a very good point.

01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:30.280
So if you think back to
this gas cycle, where you've

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.640
got warm gas
transitioning to cold gas,

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.830
transitioning to denser,
colder, self gravitating,

01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:39.700
and then at some point,
poof, a star is formed.

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:42.800
So the issue you raise
about the metallicity

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.090
affects that gas
cycle very strongly,

01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:47.650
because in order to go
from the warm, ionized gas

01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:50.660
to the colder, denser,
self gravitating gas,

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.410
you need some sort
of cooling channels

01:18:52.410 --> 01:18:54.850
in order to let
the gas cool down.

01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:57.990
And that is a strong
function of the metallicity.

01:18:57.990 --> 01:19:02.580
So metallicity being how
many heavier elements like

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:05.390
iron or carbon or
oxygen that you have.

01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:09.030
And so that, the
metallicity is a function

01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:12.420
of how many generations
of stars you've had.

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.320
And we know that in
the early universe,

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:18.340
we don't have a lot
of heavy elements.

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:20.370
We have mostly hydrogen
and a little bit

01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:21.670
of helium and lithium.

01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:26.900
So the very first stars, the
very first generation of stars

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:30.180
were probably extremely
different from the stars

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:33.640
in the present universe,
like or in the Milky Way.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:37.060
The first stars had to have
different types of cooling

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.760
channels, and most
likely they were

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.650
much more massive than
the types of stars

01:19:41.650 --> 01:19:44.020
that we can easily form today.

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:47.270
And so that would greatly
affect the types of simulations

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:48.340
that you would do.

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:51.510
So the simulations that I showed
today, the sort of parameters

01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:54.410
are very geared towards
local Milky Way type star

01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:55.440
forming regions.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.790
Sort of similar to the
Hubble Space Telescope images

01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:59.420
that I showed.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:02.060
There are other types of
simulations, other groups that

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:06.230
are performing simulations at
very, very low metallicities,

01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:09.480
so more towards the regime
of the early universe star

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.840
formation.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.090
Also a very active area
of research, and you

01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:14.880
get very, very different
types of stars.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:15.990
-Interesting.

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:17.077
OK.

01:20:17.077 --> 01:20:18.660
-So detecting magnetic
fields is going

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.493
to be very hard for
terrestrial-- especially

01:20:20.493 --> 01:20:23.120
terrestrial earth like planets.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.120
One mechanism for maybe
bigger planets and [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:30.330
would be like bow shock
for the stellar wind

01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:31.706
as it's coming
around in transit.

01:20:31.706 --> 01:20:33.954
But I think that's going to
be very hard to constrain,

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:36.310
actually, and that would
be so interesting to know.

01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:39.750
Because like you
said, also, the kind

01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:45.380
of protection from higher
energy particles and whatnot.

01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:47.090
As well as the
ionizing radiation

01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:52.560
that reaches the surface, if
you look at earth's history,

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:56.440
most-- the damaging radiation
would reach the surface

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.480
until you've built
up an ozone layer.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:01.270
And we know life still
flourished and arose,

01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:02.450
and it did fine.

01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:05.290
Whether that was under a
layer of water or soil, or we

01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:09.900
know also that UV drives some
important pre-biotic reactions,

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:11.220
as well as damaging others.

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:14.230
So I think UV is really complex.

01:21:14.230 --> 01:21:17.200
And ultimately though, at
detecting the magnetic fields

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:20.540
on planets is going
to be quite difficult.

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:21.630
-OK, well, thank you.

01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:28.630
So we're done with the session,
but we have a reception outside

01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:33.640
with refreshments and some
food, so please avail yourself,

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:38.056
and the speakers will hang out
and answer residual questions.

01:21:38.056 --> 01:21:38.930
So thanks for coming.

01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:40.480
