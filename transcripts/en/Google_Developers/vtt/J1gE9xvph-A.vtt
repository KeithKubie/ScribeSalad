With Flutter, it can be easy
to create a great-looking screen

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.430
full of awesome widgets.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.803
But how hard is it to create
a bunch of screens

00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:16.231
and let your user
swipe between them?

00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:19.422
If you use the <i>PageView</i> widget,
turns out it's not that hard at all.

00:00:19.422 --> 00:00:21.503
The first thing you need
is a <i>PageController</i>,

00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:24.482
which manages swipe detection
and provides the animation.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:27.663
Use the <i>initialPage</i> property
to set which page it starts on.

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:30.204
Then create your pages
using the <i>PageView</i> widget,

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:32.792
and give it the controller
and the pages to show.

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:34.553
What to scroll your pages vertically?

00:00:35.663 --> 00:00:38.032
Just set the <i>scrollDirection</i> to vertical.

00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:39.012
And that's it.

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:41.664
By using <i>PageView</i> and <i>PageController</i>,

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:43.611
your users can swipe through the screens

00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:45.202
to their heart's content.

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:48.132
