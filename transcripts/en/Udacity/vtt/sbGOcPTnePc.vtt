00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're here in Amsterdam. Today, a ship can travel at sea with relative safety.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But in the 17th century, many of the ships that left this harbor never came back.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The reason so many sailors' lives were lost is because the crew

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
answer a simple question--where are we.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In this unit, we'll learn about simple harmonic motion and in doing so,

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we'll learn one method for determining the position xe.
