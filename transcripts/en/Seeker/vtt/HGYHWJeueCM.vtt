00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.540
If you’ve ever been out in the world, you’ve
likely seen the word UNESCO and this weird

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.100
square in a circle all over the place.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.660
UNESCO is tasked with identifying, protecting
and preserving human heritage; buildings,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.070
landscapes, and monuments -- but in 2013,
they added something intangible: The “Mediterranean

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.070
Diet.”

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.300
You may have heard of the “Mediterranean”
diet, it’s a big fad in the United States

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.539
as of late, and it’s considered to be one
of the healthiest in the world!

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.779
But thanks to UNESCO, it’s not just healthy,
it’s also a piece of human heritage.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.730
Here’s hoping they give love to my Sunday
Pizza Tradition next year…

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.220
The Mediterranean Diet includes plant-based
foods, as well as “healthy” fats and so

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.220
on.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.860
Plus, and this is serious, limiting the amount
of red meat -- i.e. mammal meats.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.460
Grilled fish is a popular item, as are other
seafoods.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.530
AND, which is pretty rare, it offers an alcoholic
component -- a bit of red wine.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.220
The problem is, if you look at U.S. magazines
and blogs for the “Mediterranean Diet,”

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.329
as we see it.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.840
You’d find lists of restrictions and requirements
of what to eat, what not to eat, and how to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.079
prepare your meals.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.159
That’s how American’s see a “diet.”

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.329
In the U.S. “diet” doesn’t mean it’s
primary dictionary definition: “the kinds

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.141
of food that a person, animal, or community
habitually eats,” most of us think of the

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:19.350
tertiary definition, “a special course of
food to which one restricts oneself, either

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.869
to lose weight or for medical reasons.”

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.689
The “Mediterranean Diet” is the former
not the latter.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.240
It’s a way of living and eating, not a list
of restrictions and requirements.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.240
UNESCO writes, “The Mediterranean diet involves
a set of skills, knowledge, rituals, symbols

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.020
and traditions concerning crops, harvesting,
fishing, animal husbandry,” -- holy crap

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.229
-- “conservation, processing, cooking, and
particularly the sharing and consumption of

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.229
food.”

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.549
The foundation of the diet?

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.549
Eating together.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.810
Social exchange of communication during a
meal, neighborliness, affirmation, intercultural

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.490
dialog, hospitality.-- Whew --

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.359
You can’t buy this regional diet at a store
-- it’s literally about changing your life.

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.350
And of course, red wine helps with all those
things too.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.270
Better nutrition has been connected to longer,
healthier lives and even things like overall

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.170
height gains, better eyesight, and prevention
of heart disease and Alzheimer's -- to name

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.170
a few.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.020
The Mediterranean Diet adds heart health to
that as well, lowered levels of stress and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.020
anxiety.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.420
And it’s not just about what you’re eating
or not eating!

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.940
Numerous studies have shown social interaction
and support make people physically and mentally

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.940
more healthy.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.920
The concept of ‘Social buffering’ is part
of this diet -- where people get together

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.040
and socialize, interact and share.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.420
On top of that, Greece -- one of the countries
in the Mediterranean for the geographically

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.200
challenged -- incorporates intermittent fasting
into their lifestyle diet thanks to the number

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.210
of religiously motivated fasting days in the
Greek Orthodox tradition.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.040
We actually have a whole video about the science
of fasting.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.130
It seems to me, incorporating even a few of
these things into our lives would likely benefit

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.130
us all.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.790
The “mediterranean diet” doesn’t mean
going to the Greek restaurant down the street

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.860
a lot, but maybe invite your friends over
to eat some vegetables you grew (or, like

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.640
me, found at a farmer’s market)!

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640
Talk!

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640
Use some olive oil!

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.910
-- And of course, make them bring the red
wine.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.150
We can't do episodes like these with support
from our sponsors.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.690

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.030
a bunch of celery to just to take it home
and then cut up one stock and then leave the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.030
rest in the fridge…

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.930
How do you feel about hummus?

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.410
It’s just chickpeas, but, damn.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.410
I love it.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.819
I could drink wine, eat veggies and a little
fish every day -- but what about you?

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.470
Want more on how to learn about your body?

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.990
