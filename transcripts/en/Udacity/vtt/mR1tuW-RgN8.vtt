Renee asks should all the locations be
listed in the sidebar all the time,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.145
should the list of locations
depend on the user input?

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:14.950
Or should my model have my locations and
that is that?

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.719
&gt;&gt; Good questions to boot,
so the list you should

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:21.486
have all the locations when
nothing's been searched for you.

00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:24.216
When you begin searching for something,

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:27.500
that's when the the list
view begins filtering.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.470
So the list of locations will depend
on what the user is searching for.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.755
So like in my example,
when I searched for sushi,

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:42.434
it filtered out all the restaurants that
didn't have sushi either in the name or

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:46.920
you can also maybe get creative and
add categories for

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.726
all your places and you can filter
through the categories, as well.

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:54.274
Whatever you're searching for,

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:57.580
that's the only thing that
should show up in the list view.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.804
So your list you write is getting
information from your model.

00:01:01.804 --> 00:01:06.009
Your search is basically looking through
your model to figure out what to turn on

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.250
and off.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.650
And your map is looking at your model
to decide where to put markers.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.568
So the models kind of control
controlling the models kind of what's

00:01:18.568 --> 00:01:22.453
deciding what gets populated and
everything and what

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:27.210
everything sort of filtering through
&gt;&gt; That's more like,

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.070
what are the data that is required for
my application so

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.970
the model decide your
content of the application?

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.300
So list is a chosen subset of model and
markers are a matching subset of model.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.910
&gt;&gt; The list in the markers should
be the same subset of the model.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.060
So when I search for something

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.290
my markers are reflecting that
search as well as the list view.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.965
So anything that disappears on my list
view is also disappearing on my markers.

00:02:05.965 --> 00:02:10.293
To think of it like, if you had a Google
Map and it had a markers, you search for

00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:14.089
a restaurant that gave you all
the markers all the restaurants, and

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.421
then you search for
burger restaurant and

00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:18.966
the like half of those
markers would go away.

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:21.465
And they would just be
the burger restaurants left.

00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:26.800
And then, right on your list you'd
have a big list of restaurants.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.600
And then when you major
filter a little bit stronger,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.170
put it like burger restaurant,
that would filter down as well.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.543
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
to follow her question so she asked,

00:02:38.543 --> 00:02:41.060
and what are set by the search?

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.900
Yes, actually your list and
your markers are set

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.150
by your search function, whatever you
search has to show up on your list,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.870
has to reflect on your markers, as well.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.558
The result of your search function and
sometimes the list might have 1 or

00:02:58.558 --> 00:03:03.170
2 things listed and other times 10 or
15 depending on the search.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.420
Exactly, that's right.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.200
When you're not searching for anything,
you can show all the places that

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.740
you have actually
displayed in your mouth.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.790
When you're searching for
something you might focus that

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.740
list into a subset of
whatever the keyword.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.700
Or the character that you are entering.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.210
And this should reflect in your markers,
as well.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.936
In addition to Knockout
can be used jQuery UI

00:03:29.936 --> 00:03:33.340
widgets such as the autocomplete widget.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.298
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can feel free to
use the jQuery UI widgets.

00:03:38.298 --> 00:03:42.061
Just make sure that you kind of
understand what's going on with like

00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:44.769
what the autocomplete
which is actually doing,

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.929
is it can get a little tricky when
there's some functionality built into it

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:50.930
that you don't really know about.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.430
But I don't see any problem with
using those along with Knockout.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.365
But we do require that you use
Knockout so try not to rely too

00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:07.226
much on sort of pre-built widgets and
things like that.

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:10.680
You can actually,
that's actually really, really simple.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.030
Fortunately, Chrome makes debugging and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.209
testing all aspects of
your site really easily.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.829
If you actually go into your developer
tools, there's a little emulator

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.120
icon and in here you can emulate
like a bunch of different devices.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.970
So this is a great place to test
things like responsiveness and

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.540
making sure it displays
well on different devices.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.440
And Chrome is usually pretty good about
making sure these devices are up to

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.710
date, but next to this sort of
Device tab is also a Network tab.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.910
And in here there's all sorts of
options, so I can sort of test how my

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.250
website is going to load on tons of
different sort of connection speeds.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.620
And one of them happens to be offline,
so if I wanted to test what happens

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.410
if my website is trying to be accessed
offline, or I can refresh and see like,

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.120
God, nothing loads because I'm offline
and I'm trying to reach Google Maps.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.060
Or I can test it on Wi-Fi and
see everything loads really quickly.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.012
You can also do other kinds of
throttling like just testing it on

00:05:18.012 --> 00:05:19.902
your local connection.

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:23.320
Good, regular, dial-up whatever.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.730
So this is a really cool suite of tools
that Chrome has developed for us.
