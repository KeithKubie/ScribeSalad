00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
 . 

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.080
 Let us solve a set of graph representation issues of linear equations 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.280
 There is a set of methods that allow you to graphically represent equations 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.560
 What we will do in this presentation is to use the basic method 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.790
 Where we will assign a set of values ​​and then 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.750
 We get points 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.830
 You see what I'm doing 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.460
 Here I have an equation, a linear equation 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.990
 I will rewrite it because this line is too small. y = 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.330
 2x + 7 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.180
 I want to represent this linear equation 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.730
 Before I extracted the graph sheet, what I could do 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.450
 Is to set a table 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.840
 Where I will choose a set of x values ​​then I will be able to find 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.180
 Y value that corresponds 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.980
 With values ​​for x 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.450
 For example, if x = - I start with a low value - 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.670
 If x = -2 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.310
 What is the value of y? 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.620
 Well, we make up -2 in the equation 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.200
 It becomes 2 × 2 + 7 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.060
 = -4 + 7 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.270
 This is equal to 3 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
 If x = - I chose x values ​​in a random way 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.209
 It can be a checker - maybe I'll put three or four 

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.190
 Points here 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.470
 What happens when x = 0? 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.390
 The y will equal 2 × 0 + 7 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.530
 Which equals 7 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.410
 what about 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.870
 I will make their value higher by 2 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.270
 You can choose a higher number by 1 or 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.840
 You choose to prepare in a random way 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.600
 When x = 2, how much is y? 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.090
 It will be 2 × 2 + 7 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.070
 Ie 4 + 7 = 11 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.990
 I can continue to set points if you want 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.630
 We have to get enough points to be able to represent them 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.700
 In fact, to represent any line, we will need only two points 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.130
 We have one redundant 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.530
 Let me do one more solution until you clarify that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.050
 This is a line 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.750
 So what happens when x = 4? 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.670
 In fact, so as not to rise by 2, let's say that x = 8 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.600
 Select any random number 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.400
 And y will be 2 x 8 + 7, ie - well 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.010
 Maybe it will come out of the graph sheet which we have - but 2 × 8 = 16 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.139
 + 7 = 23 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.940
 Now let us represent it 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.580
 Let me put the y axis here 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.050
 This is the y axis 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.550
 Let me put the x axis 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.220
 I have many positive values ​​here, if we need a large extent 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.540
 On the positive y axis 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.200
 This is x axis 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.540
 Then I will use x = -2 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.420
 Which is -1 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:42.440
 If 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.800
 Those are x values 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.430
 Then we can move to the top on the Y axis 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.190
 I will do something different because it is 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.630
 The numbers will grow quickly 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.690
 I will probably put it into 2 multiples 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:06.800
 It is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.370
 I can stay here, though 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.030
 Let us identify these points 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.540
 My first point is x = -2, and y 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.770
 = 3 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.770
 I can write the axes 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.945
 The point will be 2,3- 

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:20.990
 x = -2 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.320
 y = 3 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.810
 3 Its location is here 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.990
 If this point is first, 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.050
 Then the next point 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.640
 0.7 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.600
 I'll give it that color 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.950
 0.7 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.880
 x = 0 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.340
 Y = 7 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.330
 Here 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.980
 0.7 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.200
 We have these green in here 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.340
 Point 2.11 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.075
 2.11 will be here 

00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:53.000
 2.11 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.560
 Then another point - these actually will fall 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.080
 Of graphic representation 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.440
 8,23 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.410
 You will be here at the top somewhere 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.230
 If you can see what I do 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.650
 It's 8,23 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.090
 If we get points, you'll see that the line consists of a line. Let me 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.000
 The origin of these points 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.380
 I painted them manually as it is obvious so maybe this will not be 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.390
 The line is finely straight 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.290
 If you have a computer, use it, where the line will be straight 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.029
 You can continue to choose x values ​​and find 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.920
 Y values ​​that correspond to it 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.520
 In case y is an association of x values 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.200
 If you keep setting each point, you'll get a line 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.220
 If you select all the possible x values ​​and set them all, you will get 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.400
 Each point on the line 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.400
 Let's solve another issue 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.240
 At the airport, you can change your currency from 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.490
 Dollars to euros 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.850
 From dollars to euros 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.360
 The service cost is $ 5 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.380
 For every dollar, you get 0.7 euros 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.630
 For every dollar, you get 0.7 euros 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.470
 Make a table of this and assign the pairing to the graphic representation 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.430
 Use the graphic representation to determine how many coins in euros you will receive 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.320
 If you give the office $ 50 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.380
 I will write EUR = - Let us see if, will convert 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.710
 To dollars 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.040
 And even if you get euros you have to give them the dollar 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.600
 And even if you get euros you have to give them the dollar 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.290
 If they take $ 5 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.320
 If $ 5 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.430
 This service costs $ 5 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.480
 All that remains is this 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.620
 The rest - you'll get 0.7 euros for every remaining dollar 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.410
 You'll get 0.7 for everything left 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.590
 If this is the relationship 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.770
 Now we can assign points - we can answer the 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.750
 Their question 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.190
 If you give them $ 50, we do not have to look at the graphic representation 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.280
 But we'll look at the graphic representation later 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.190
 If you put EUR = - if you give them 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.030
 $ 50-- will be 0.7 x 50-5 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.350
 I gave them 50 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.160
 They took 5 for the service 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.000
 If $ 45 remains, it will be 0.7 x 45 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.060
 I will do this here 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.270
 45 x 0.7 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.480
 7 x 5 = 35 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.660
 4 × 7 = 28, + 3 = 31 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.800
 Then we have only one number left behind the comma 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.810
 This is only 7 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.880
 If output is 31.5 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.530
 If you give them $ 50, you get € 31.5 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.300
 EUR, not dollars 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.010
 If we answer the question, but let us 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.610
 We represent it graphically 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.330
 Let's draw a table 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.340
 Maybe I'll pull out the calculator 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.580
 I'll point out something to him 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.230
 Let's put the dollars you gave them 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.140
 Dollars 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.200
 How many euros did you get? 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.810
 I will set a random set 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.100
 If you give them $ 5, they will 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.580
 $ 5 of them for service 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.620
 You will receive $ 5 - 5, ie 0 × 0.7 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.600
 If you do not get anything in return 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.570
 So there is no good reason to do this 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.520
 Then if you give them $ 10 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.860
 What will happen? 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.630
 If you give them $ 10, 10 - 5 = 5 x 0.7 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.790
 You'll get $ 3 - or maybe I should say € 3.50 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.430
 You will get € 3.50 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:26.690
 Now what happens if you give them $ 30? 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.840
 Or actually let me say 25 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.420
 If you give them $ 25, 25 - 5 = 20 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.620
 20 x 0.7 = $ 14 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.470
 I will put another value 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.460
 Let's say you gave them $ 55 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.650
 This makes the calculation simpler for you 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.790
 5 will be subtracted from the issue 

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:53.170
 55 - 5 = 50, × 0.7 = $ 35 

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.260
 Is this true? 

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.230
 Yes thats right 

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.890
 You will get 35 euros 

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:58.500
 All in euros 

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.820
 I just kept telling the dollar 

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.610
 Let us help them 

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.620
 All these values ​​are positive, if only I should 

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.240
 Draw the first quarter here 

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.900
 All these values ​​are positive 

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:17.540
 If the dollar - let us put staging multiples of 5, ie 5, 10, 15 

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:27.720
 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.070
 I have drawn a x axis a little shorter than I needed 

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.390
 This is up to 55 

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.890
 Then y axis 

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.090
 Staging will be a 5-fold multiplication 

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:45.550
 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.330
 Well, that's more than I need 

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.220
 35 

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.230
 Now let us identify these points 

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.200
 I will give them $ 5 

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.440
 Get 0 euros 

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.070
 This euro 

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.176
 This is the dollar 

00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:00.930
 The dollar is an independent variable and we have found 

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.670
 The euro through it 

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.530
 Or that the euro depends on 

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.330
 The dollars I have 

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.790
 If I gave them $ 10, I would get € 3.50 

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.430
 3.50 - Difficult to read 

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.850
 Maybe 3.50 is located here 

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.040
 If I gave them $ 25, I would get 14 euros 

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.650
 25,14 Located here 

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.090
 As it is clear, so this fee is manual, so it will not be 

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.230
 Very accurate 

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.460
 If I give them $ 55, I'll get 35 euros 

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.900
 If 55,35 fall here 

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.450
 If you want to connect points, you have to get something 

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.410
 Looks like a font 

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.340
 If you do this - if you are a computer 

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.150
 The line will be exact 

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.650
 It looks very good 

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.400
 Then we can observe what we are required to do 

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.750
 We use graphic representation to determine how many euros we will get 

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.590
 If the office is given $ 50 

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.660
 The 50 here 

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.270
 We will start if 

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.020
 I will make a graph 

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.900
 The age we go all this way - in fact, I painted another 

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.170
 Point on the graph incorrectly some thing 

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.420
 Let me 

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.660
 Let me 

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.670
 35 is located here 

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.940
 Let me redraw that point 

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.870
 35 is located almost here 

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.160
 If 55,35 fall here 

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.900
 Let me redraw the line 

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.880
 It will look - I have forgotten 25 

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.470
 25,14 Located here 

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.670
 I will make the Baidu chart so 

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.010
 That's my best 

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.350
 Now let us answer the question 

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.190
 Here we gave them $ 50 

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.480
 We go up, up, to $ 50 

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.030
 He will get a 

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.430
 We continue to go on the left side 

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.550
 This is approximately 31.50 

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.370
 We created it using the formula 

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.830
 But you can see, you can observe it from the graph and 

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.860
 Find any value for the dollar 

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.540
 If you give them $ 20, we'll go all this 

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.860
 the path 

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.090
 And you'll find it must be - well, $ 20 must be equal 

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.540
 7.50 

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.465
 The inaccuracy in the official graphic makes it 

00:10:58.465 --> 00:11:00.030
 Less subtle 

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.330
 When you say 20 - 5 = 15 

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.230
 15 × - in fact it will be a little more 

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.640
 From $ 10, this is true 

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.480
 You will be here 

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.670
 If you put $ 20 here, 20 - 5 = 15 

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:18.340
 15 x 0.7 = $ 10.50, which is located here 

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.850
 You can look at any point in the graphic representation and find 

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.250
 The number of euros you will receive 

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.130
 Let us represent these while we do 

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.270
 Read the graph 

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.730
 Graph - I think we were told to use the chart below 

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.420
 Oh, the graph illustrates converting the representation to 

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.420
 Conversion between weight per kilogram 

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.990
 Weight in pound unit 

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.710
 Use it to convert the following measurements 

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.050
 We have a kilogram here and a pound here 

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.270
 If required 4 kg per pound unit 

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.820
 If we look at this here, 4 

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.640
 Kg here 

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.150
 We follow the chart 

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.610
 If 4 kg to a pound, it will look, I do not know 

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.210
 Just below 9 lbs 

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.035
 Less than - then 

00:12:05.035 --> 00:12:07.930
 I will write about 9 lbs 

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.270
 You can not see it exactly 

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.310
 It is less than 9 pounds slightly 

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.370
 4 kg. To 9 kg, we go here 

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.310
 9 kg. We go to the top 

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:24.700
 It looks like it's about 20 pounds 

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.570
 Here we have 12 pounds to convert to kilograms. In fact 

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.030
 The kilogram is a mass, but I do not want to get it accurately 

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.120
 12 lbs 

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:32.670
 We go here 

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.460
 pound 

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:40.390
 12 pounds per kilogram, it looks like 5 1/2 

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.090
 Approximately 5 1/2 

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.040
 Then 17 lbs to kg 

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.390
 If 17 here 

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:58.120
 17 lbs to a kilogram, it looks like 7 1/2 kg 

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.910
 Anyway I wish these examples made you 

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.550
 It is somewhat comfortable with the representation of equations graphically and reading representations 

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.290
 For equations 

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.450
 See you in the next view 

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:09.066
 .
