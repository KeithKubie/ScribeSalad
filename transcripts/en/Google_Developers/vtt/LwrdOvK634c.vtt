00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.550
DAN GALPIN: Hi, and welcome
back to the Developer Shows

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.080
coverage at GDD India.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.110
I'm Dan Gaplin here talking
to Nasir Khan about running

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.750
in the background on Android.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.890
Now, Nasir, what do
you mean when you

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.665
say running in the background?

00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:20.040
NASIR KHAN: As I
said in my talk,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.331
it could mean different things
to different developers.

00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:24.810
It could mean running
off the main thread,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.280
running on a background thread.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.950
It would also mean running
a background service

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.790
or running off a broadcast
receiver being called.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.900
Or it could mean
reacting to FCM method.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.520
It could mean different things.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.395
DAN GALPIN: Isn't this
a problem that's been,

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:38.640
you know, really well solved?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.710
NASIR KHAN: You're
right, it's been solved.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.376
It's been solved in
many different ways,

00:00:41.376 --> 00:00:44.790
and there are many use cases and
[INAUDIBLE] already out there.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.285
But Android platform
also has been changing.

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:48.660
The first changes
were introduced

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.417
in Marshmallow and [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.500
And over time, there have
been progressive changes

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.200
which have been changing the
way background processing works.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.840
The most significant of them
has been the Oreo background

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.700
restrictions on
free-running services

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.361
and implicit broadcasts.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.860
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
how does Android O

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.770
change, then, what
developers have to consider?

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.320
NASIR KHAN: So I
think you must have

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.460
heard of [INAUDIBLE] background
restrictions in Oreo.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.668
I would like to call it an
opportunity for developers

00:01:11.668 --> 00:01:13.574
to take a step back
and look at their apps

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.990
and see how they can optimize
their app to be more battery

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.640
efficient with these changes.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.139
DAN GALPIN: Is there
anything that O

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:21.105
is offering that can
actually help developers?

00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:22.230
NASIR KHAN: Actually it is.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.760
So there have been
changes on one hand

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.870
to restrict the
background services.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.450
But on the other hand, we are
introducing new constructs

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.900
like a job intern service,
which actually makes it really,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.400
really easy for developers to
write the similar kind of code

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.110
they were writing
before, but handle it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.240
in a way which is better
handled on all devices.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.970
So that, and also
there have been

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.470
new changes in the
scheduler API as well,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.190
where they can actually see
more new constraints, like

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.690
does the device
have enough storage?

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.481
Does the device have
enough battery to run?

00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:51.419
So they can be more mindful
of the device state as well.

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:52.710
DAN GALPIN: Well, that's great.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.459
Now, where can developers
go to learn more

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.190
about the changes
in O and how to help

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.524
adapt what their apps are doing?

00:01:57.524 --> 00:01:58.981
NASIR KHAN: I would
say they should

00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:00.920
start at developer.android.com.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.087
There is a lot of narrative
documentation around it.

00:02:03.087 --> 00:02:04.711
There's also good
reference [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:06.640
that has been recently
updated in these areas.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.223
They can also refer
to some block code

00:02:08.223 --> 00:02:11.355
that we wrote around
background restrictions lately.

00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:13.480
DAN GALPIN: Thank you,
Nasir, for joining us today.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.850
Now visit the description
below if you'd

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.891
like to find out more
about background processing

00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:18.770
on Android and Android O.
