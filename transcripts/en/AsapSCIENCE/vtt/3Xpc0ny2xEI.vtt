00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.140
We all get stressed whether it be from work, school, or relationships.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.020
But with 80% of adults in the U.S. reporting daily stress,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.700
what's this chronic stress doing to all of us?

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.340
What happens when you're stressed every day?

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.160
Within seconds of any stressor,  your body goes into

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.420
fight-or-flight mode.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.785
First your eyes and ears send information to your

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:24.660
amygdala, the emotional processing center of the brain. Then from your amygdala the information moves

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.060
to your hypothalamus which communicates with your

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.440
autonomic nervous system and adrenal glands.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.740
These glands then release a burst of the

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.200
neurotransmitter adrenaline.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.400
This causes the classic feeling of stress:

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.100
increased heart rate, increased

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.400
blood pressure, and faster breathing.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.080
The adrenaline also triggers the release of the stress hormone cortisol.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.360
We always hear about the danger of cortisol,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.160
but it's actually released to protect your brain from the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.860
nerve damage associated with trauma.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.200
Within 10 minutes of being stressed,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.680
behavioral changes likely take place including increased aggressive behavior. Around 30 minutes,

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.700
you may become forgetful, as stress can decrease long-term memory and impair

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.940
concentration. And after days of consistent stress, your sex drive will likely decrease.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.580
Why? From an evolutionary perspective getting out there and mating would increase the odds of predation.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.720
So, one theory is, we may have evolved to decrease our sex drive when stressed to avoid potential threats.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.860
But after months of being stressed your cognitive function will really start to decline.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.040
Longitudinal studies of employees in stressful work environments show increased incidences of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.320
depression and poor circulatory health. A study on rats showed that six months after being chronically stressed,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.980
the rats had increased levels of anxiety and decreased abilities to navigate a maze.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.940
This was due to changes in their hippocampus all linked to increased levels of cortisol.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.260
This highlights that, although we know cortisol is meant to protect your brain from trauma,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.780
long-term exposure to it can be detrimental.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.740
With all this in mind. It's no surprise that chronic stress has been linked to many diseases such as obesity,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.920
depression, and heart disease.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.940
And, suppression of the immune system with increased susceptibility to colds, sleep issues, GI issues,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.060
fertility issues, memory problems, and even cancer.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.520
So trying to minimize your stress might be a good idea.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.340
But what can you even do to lower your stress levels?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.500
Our latest podcast goes into some tactics that you can do to reduce your stress right now

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.520
based on studies and some of our own personal experiences.
