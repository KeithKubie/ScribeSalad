00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.870
One of the most delightful and thrilling aspects
of the early days of a love affair is the

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.870
sense that our lover likes us not only for
our obvious qualities – perhaps our looks,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.760
or our professional accomplishments – but
also, and far more touchingly, for our less

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.820
impressive sides: our vulnerabilities, our
hesitations, our flaws. Perhaps they are particularly

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.110
taken by the gap between our two front teeth
which, while it wouldn’t impress an orthodontist,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.461
charms them distinctly. Or perhaps they are
taken by our shyness at busy parties or are

00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:42.030
powerfully drawn to that old pair of pyjamas
with the bear prints which we put on on cold

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.089
winter nights and which would win no fashion
award. This creates a beguiling prospect of

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:54.559
what love might be – but one which also
sets up a catastrophic and unfair expectation:

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.309
the belief that really loving someone must
mean endorsing every aspect of them, their

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.020
good sides, but also, more particularly, their
weaknesses too. This pleasant vision may last

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.670
a few months into a relationship but eventually,
something is likely to disturb it. We will

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.539
notice something about the lover which is
both a flaw and not especially charming. Perhaps

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.860
it’s their rather bovine way of eating cereal,
their habit of not hanging up towels or their

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.539
maddening tendency to withhold crucial bits
of bad news from us. But because of the belief

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.359
that love means complete endorsement, there
is likely to be an incensed hurt response

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:39.049
from a partner. What is feedback doing in
the hallowed realm of love? ‘If you loved

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.079
me, you wouldn’t criticise me’ can be
love’s all too common wounded rallying cry.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.070
This protest against teaching from a lover
is so ubiquitous that we forget to notice

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.619
its strangeness. It represents a very particular
approach to love and not necessarily the wisest.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.240
For a more helpful take, we might look back
to the Ancient Greeks, who had a strikingly

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.409
different philosophy of feedback within love.
For the Greeks, love is not meant to be an

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.900
emotion centred on just anything at all about
the partner. Rightly understood, it is a very

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.250
specific feeling that targets what happens
to be accomplished, perfect, virtuous and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.690
intelligent. Around the other less impressive
things, one must be tolerant and understanding

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.150
of course – but one isn’t expected to
love. The word love is restricted to a particular

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.270
sort of admiration for perfection. Connected
to this for the Greeks is a sense that the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.870
point of a relationship is to be a forum in
which two people can help each other to increase

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.200
the number of admirable characteristics they
each possess: it is to help them become the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.440
best version of themselves. The Greeks held
to a fundamentally pedagogical view of love;

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.730
they understood that a relationship gives
us a ringside seat on one another’s flaws

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.760
and potential – and therefore believed that
both partners should take it in turns to act

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.040
in the role of teacher and student – attempting
to educate the other to become a finer person

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.100
within the safe and encouraging confines of
love’s classroom. All this is likely to

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.470
sound incredibly strange to modern ears. The
notion that the point of love is to help to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.730
teach the lover to become a better version
of themselves, and therefore that one might

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.890
legitimately deliver lengthy lectures to one’s
partner on how their character might be improved

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.840
sounds like a freakish, dictatorial betrayal
of the true nature of love. Yet, in truth,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.320
there is a lot of wisdom in the Greek position
– for we can interpret many of the struggles

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.010
people have in relationships as being, in
essence, failed teaching moments; moments

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.930
when one or the other party attempt to get
something across, possibly a very well-founded

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.190
point, but see their lessons rejected in bitter
and hurt tones. The reason why the lessons

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.640
we try to impart in love’s classroom tend
to go so wrong is that we are respectively

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.511
very bad teachers and very bad pupils. And
part of the reason is that we don’t – in

00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:13.290
the role of teachers – have any real sense
that we are even allowed to teach, which makes

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.930
us panicky and defensive. Furthermore, what
helps someone to be a good teacher is a relaxed

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.129
sense that it doesn’t in the end matter
so much if the lesson is learnt or not. A

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.800
good maths teacher wants to get the basics
of trigonometry across to the class, but if

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.330
they are being obtuse, they can be calm; there’ll
be another student cohort along next year.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.550
But love’s classroom finds us in a far more
agitated state – because at the back of

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.949
our minds as we try to teach a point is an
utterly panic-inducing thought: that we may

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:50.080
have committed ourselves to an idiot who will
continue in a range of erroneous ways for

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.680
the rest of our days. It’s on this basis
that we start to swear, belittle and insult

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.830
our lover. Which is understandable but very
unfortunate, for it seems that sadly no one

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.819
has ever learnt anything under conditions
of humiliation. By the time one has made the

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:13.259
partner feel like a fool, the lesson is over.
It seems that a good relationship should be

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.449
a forum in which we teach each other many
things and gracefully learn in turn. If we

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.130
understand ourselves properly, we will know
that there are so many sides of us that need

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.949
improvement. For that reason, we should learn
to see love a little as the Ancient Greeks

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:36.259
did: as a safe arena in which two people can
gently teach and learn how to grow into better

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.879
versions of themselves. Teaching and learning
doesn’t symbolise an abandonment of love;

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:48.699
it’s the very basis upon which we can develop
into better lovers and, more broadly, better people.
