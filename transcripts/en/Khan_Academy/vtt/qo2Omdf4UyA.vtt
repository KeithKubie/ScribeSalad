00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.520
Welcome back.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.680
We're now on problem
number 11.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:10.630
Let's see, at the top they
write z, w, y, x.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.910
And they say, the sequence above
may be changed in either

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.330
of two ways: either two adjacent
letters may be

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.690
interchanged, or the entire
sequence may be reversed.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.790
So either I could switch
w and y, or I could

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.680
just switch the order.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.000
What is the least number of
changes needed to put the

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.260
numbers into alphabetical order
from left to right?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.210
So, what is alphabetical order
from left to right?

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.180
Let's do our goal, because it's
been a while since I've

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.160
sung my alphabet.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.705
So it's w, x, y, z, this
is our goal, right?

00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:50.450
So let's see what we can do.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.330
w x, y, z,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.100
So we need to get w at the
opposite end from-- So let's

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.710
see, if I could switch these
two, then I would

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.890
get z, w, x, y.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.500
No, no, no, no, no, I want to
get the w at the opposite end.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.040
So what we want to do is
switch w and y, right?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.710
And we would get z, y, w, x.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.090
Then you could switch x and w.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.250
You would get z, y, x, w.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.680
And then the other option we
can do is just reverse, and

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.450
then we can reverse.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.315
And when we reverse it,
we get w, x, y, z.

00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:37.350
And that's our goal.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.080
So that took us one step,
two steps, three steps.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.140
So that's choice B.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.530
I'm not sure if that's
the right answer.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.140
Let's see if I can do
it in two steps.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.750
Let's see, if I reversed
it-- well reversing

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.360
doesn't really help you.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.060
The bottom line is you have to,
before you reverse w, x,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.250
y, z-- I mean, to move the z all
the way over to the other

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.040
end, no, you want
to just reverse.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.980
If you reverse this, and you
reverse this, and you switch,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.250
I think that's the fastest
possible way.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.800
No matter what you do, you have
to move the w two steps

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.950
away from the z.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.250
You have to do that, right?

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.750
Because the w is on the opposite
end from the z, so

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.750
you have to move the w twice.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.040
That's going to take you
at least two steps.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.600
And then you've got to
switch the order.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.850
That's the third step.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.430
And it would be even worse if
you didn't switch the order

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.890
and wanted to move the z.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.630
The other option is you could
just flip the z and the w, and

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.090
you would get w, z, y, x.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.270
And then you could switch-- no,
that's going to take you--

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.326
you could switch the x and the
y and you'd get w, z, x, y.

00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:06.590
Now that's going to take you
three or four steps, so I'm

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.940
pretty sure we got
the right answer.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.670
Write me a little note
if I didn't.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.650
Next problem.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.676
The bottom line with that one,
you have to realize you have

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:20.560
to move the w at least three
away from the z, and then

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.330
you've got to reverse it.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.580
So it's going to take you
at least three steps.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.050
Problem number 12.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.570
I hope I'm right on that one.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.590
How many cubicle blocks, each
with edges of length 4

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.460
centimeters, are needed to fill
a rectangular box that

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.185
has inside dimensions-- So each
of my initial blocks--

00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:46.350
I'll draw my cube as best as
I can-- are 4 by 4 by 4.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.660
And that is how many
cubic centimeters?

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.730
These are centimeters, right?

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.740
So 16 times 4 equals 64
centimeters cubed, or 64 cubic

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.980
centimeters.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.830
And we want to fill a box that
has inside dimensions-- this

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:12.730
is my big box, let's see--
20 by 24 by 32.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.500
So there's a couple of ways
you could do this.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.290
You don't even have to do
this first step I did.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.329
You could just say well, how
many of these small boxes are

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.250
going to fit in this
direction?

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.220
How many are in this direction,
and how many in

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.610
this direction, and
then multiply.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.370
And that's actually the
fast way to do it.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.020
So instead of drawing it that
way you could-- let me redraw

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.880
that big box-- but instead of
giving it in centimeters, let

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.430
me give it in how many of these
boxes are going to go in

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.000
this direction.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.725
So it's going to be, these are
4 centimeters each and the

00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:41.980
base is 20, so it's going
to be 20 divided by 4.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.040
It's going to be 5 in
this direction.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.750
It's going to be 6 in this
direction, 24 divided by 4.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.700
It's going to be 8 in
this direction.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.740
So then you can just multiply,
5 times 6 is 30, times 8 is

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.610
240 of the boxes.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.450
The other way to do it is you
could have multiplied 20 times

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.620
24 times 32.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.280
You could have said this equals
20 times 24 times 32,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.000
and then divided by 64.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.630
That would have been the other
way of doing it, and then it

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.680
would have just required
more math.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.430
And hopefully that comes out to
the same thing as 240, and

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.680
that's choice D.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.400
If you ever find yourself on the
SAT doing something that's

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.930
really hairy or taking a
lot of time, you're not

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.230
necessarily doing it wrong, but
there's probably a faster

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.810
way to do it.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.580
Because they want you to be able
to do these questions in

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.970
less than 30 seconds.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.385
I think you have time
to do them in a

00:05:37.385 --> 00:05:39.400
little over a minute.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.170
Thirteen, if 0 is less than n
which is less than 1, which of

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.430
the following gives the correct
ordering of square

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.550
root of n, n, and n squared?

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.280
Do you know what the easiest
thing to do when they give you

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.290
a problem like this is?

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.250
Just try out a number.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.740
Well do you know what a good
number is here, because we're

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.810
going to have to take the
square root of it?

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.460
Let's take n equals 1/4, because
it's easy to take the

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.070
square root of 1/4.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.940
So if n is equal to 1/4, then
what are these values?

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.340
Square root of n is equal
to 1/2, right?

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.420
It actually equals plus or minus
1/2, but they probably

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.120
mean the positive 1/2.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.540
n is 1/4, right?

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.310
And what's n squared?

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.650
n squared is 1/16.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.730
I'm assuming that they mean the
positive square root when

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.000
they write it like that.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.460
So what's the order of these?

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.040
They want to do it from the
smallest to the biggest, so

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.640
the smallest is n squared.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.080
Then the next biggest
is square root of n.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.680
No sorry, then the
next one is n.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.920
And then the next one
is square root of n.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.031
And that is choice E.

00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:58.810
And another way to think about
it is, when you have a

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.050
fraction-- and essentially
that's what they're saying,

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.120
that you have a fraction less
than one, or you have a

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.860
decimal point-- it becomes
bigger when you take the

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.450
square root, and it becomes
smaller when you square it.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.910
That's the realization.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.920
So the squaring is going to be
smaller than the number which

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.980
is smaller than the
square root.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.570
That's the underlying theme
when a number is

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.090
between 0 and 1.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.280
But if you didn't want to think
too abstractly about it,

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.940
just try out a number
that works.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:34.780
Let's see, next problem,
problem number 14.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.365
OK, so this is going to
involve some drawing.

00:07:37.365 --> 00:07:40.336
Let me see if I can draw
this pretty fast.

00:07:40.336 --> 00:07:42.890
So that's my y-axis.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.460
That's my x-axis.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.120
Then there's a bunch of lines.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.950
There's a, b, c.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.870
OK, so they all intersect
at 3.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:08:03.590
And then these are 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.960
And let me draw out
all the lines.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.640
So the first line goes
something like

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.160
this, it goes there.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.320
Then all the other ones--
and let's see, the

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.570
next one goes to 3.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.800
The next one goes to 4.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.160
The next one goes to 5.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.820
They all go to y equals 3.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.440
And the last one goes to 6.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.600
OK.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.340
And they're saying in the figure
above, what is the

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.330
median of the slopes
of all of those

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.789
lines, oa, ob, oc, right?

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:44.030
They write A, B, C, D, E.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.180
What is the median?

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.440
So this isn't the average.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.870
Median is easier.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.310
Median is just what's the
middle slope, right?

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.610
So we could say well this-- let
me just switch colors--

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.600
line A has the highest slope.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.090
Line B is a little bit lower.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.280
Line C is a little bit lower.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.430
The slope is getting a little
bit lower as we go out, right?

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.080
And you could figure that
out by rise over run.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.700
The rise is the same in every
case, and the run just gets

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.350
bigger and bigger, right?

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.740
The change in x gets
bigger and bigger.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.670
So this has the highest slope.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.980
This has the lowest slope.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.410
And this has the middle
slope, C.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.070
Pretty easy.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.880
Oh, the median of the slope.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.910
So they want you to
figure it out.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.380
So what is the slope
of 3, of this one?

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:35.850
So it's change in y is 3 over
change in x, which is 4.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.860
So it's 3/4, so that's
choice C.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.840
If you got this wrong, maybe by
accident you took the mean,

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.970
or the average, which would
probably have wasted a lot of

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.330
time as well.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.300
I'll see you in the
next video.
