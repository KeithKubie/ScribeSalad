00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:03.115
- Let's say that I had two compartments of water,

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:06.621
and they're separated by a semipermeable membrane.

00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:09.570
Now what do I mean by semipermeable membrane?

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.079
That means they allow some things

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.192
to go through and not other things.

00:00:13.192 --> 00:00:15.468
Let's say this semipermeable membrane,

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:18.254
it does allow water molecules to pass,

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:20.437
and in a few seconds we'll talk about what it does not allow

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.991
to pass, which makes it semipermeable.

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:24.755
Let's just think about what would happen if we just had

00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:26.910
water molecules on either side.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.696
We've already talked about it in the videos on diffusion.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.041
The water molecule, since we have an equal concentration

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:35.060
on either side, the probability that one of these

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.844
water molecules goes this way in a certain amount of time

00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:41.608
is equal to the probability that a water molecule

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:45.044
goes from right to left in the same amount of time,

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.925
and that's because we have equal concentrations.

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:48.968
And these things are all bouncing around

00:00:48.968 --> 00:00:53.171
in all different ways, they all have, they all are,

00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:55.260
they all have different velocities.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.675
They have different speeds and in different directions.

00:00:57.675 --> 00:00:59.300
We just sort of think about it probabilistically.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.019
The probability of going from left to right

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.155
through one of these gaps is going to be equal

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:04.966
to the probability of going right to left

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.172
in any given period of time.

00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:09.540
But now let's make this interesting.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.257
Let's treat our water as solvent,

00:01:12.257 --> 00:01:14.741
and let's put some solute in it.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.249
So let's dissolve some solute.

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:20.221
So let's throw some solute particles here.

00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:23.087
And I'm gonna make them bigger so you can see they would

00:01:23.087 --> 00:01:26.118
physically have trouble passing through these gaps.

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.022
There's other ways where you could have semipermeable

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:30.251
membranes that use charge to allow certain things

00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:31.714
to pass through and not others,

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:35.824
but it's easier to visualize the size.

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:37.217
Thinking about the membrane as only allowing

00:01:37.217 --> 00:01:39.748
certain things of certain size to pass through.

00:01:39.748 --> 00:01:42.139
So let's throw some solute there,

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:44.322
and I'll actually throw a little bit of solute here too.

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:49.453
I'll do one or two particles right over here,

00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:51.265
but I'm going to do many more.

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:55.374
I'm going to do many more over there on the right hand side.

00:01:55.374 --> 00:01:56.953
So we have a higher concentration

00:01:56.953 --> 00:02:00.018
of solute on the right hand side,

00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:01.922
and this is a semipermeable membrane.

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:04.546
You can see even from the size where I drew these gaps

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:06.589
these big particles aren't going to be able

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:08.191
to go through the membrane.

00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.269
They aren't going to be able to diffuse.

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.420
If they were allowed to diffuse,

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.626
then they would just go down their concentration gradient

00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:14.994
and, in any given moment of time, you would have

00:02:14.994 --> 00:02:17.014
a higher chance of one of these big particles moving from

00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:19.185
the right to the left than from the left to the right,

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:21.135
'cause you just have more on the right hand side.

00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:23.407
But this is a semipermeable,

00:02:23.407 --> 00:02:24.804
this is a semipermeable membrane.

00:02:24.804 --> 00:02:25.894
These things aren't just going

00:02:25.894 --> 00:02:28.008
to be allowed to naturally diffuse.

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:29.749
Now all of these big particles,

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:35.275
they all have their own unique velocities.

00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:38.387
So they all have their unique velocities.

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.103
What do we think is going to happen?

00:02:41.103 --> 00:02:42.682
Let's just think about the problem.

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:44.192
We know that the big particles can't

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:45.515
diffuse from one side to another,

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:47.674
but what's going to happen to the water molecules?

00:02:47.674 --> 00:02:50.275
The water molecules on the left hand side,

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:52.075
they're not going to be stopped.

00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:53.409
If they are bouncing in the right way,

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.453
they can bounce from the left to the right, or they could

00:02:55.453 --> 00:02:58.587
move from the left to the right through one of these gaps.

00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:01.234
But what about the ones on the right side?

00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:04.462
Well, if things are, if they're the just right conditions,

00:03:04.462 --> 00:03:05.971
if they're the just right conditions

00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:08.918
maybe this character could move through this,

00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:09.895
so you're definitely going to have

00:03:09.895 --> 00:03:12.356
water molecules going back and forth,

00:03:12.356 --> 00:03:14.957
but I'd argue that ones on the right hand side,

00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:17.000
there's a lower probability of water molecules

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.997
from the right hand side moving to the left

00:03:18.997 --> 00:03:21.388
as from the left hand side moving to the right.

00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:22.712
And why is that?

00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:24.802
There's all this interference that play

00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:27.565
from these big molecules that aren't able to diffuse.

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:29.213
These are going to be bouncing around.

00:03:29.213 --> 00:03:30.421
Sometimes they're going to be even,

00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:33.819
sometimes you can imagine them even blocking,

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.685
they're going to be blocking the approach to these openings.

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:42.083
If this membrane wasn't here, they wouldn't block

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:44.097
the approach, they would just keep on going,

00:03:44.097 --> 00:03:45.443
but since that membrane is there,

00:03:45.443 --> 00:03:47.626
they might block it, or they might ricochet off,

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:50.017
and while they ricochet off they might push on

00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:52.432
some water molecules, they might push on some

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:55.985
water molecules going in this direction right over there.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:59.212
So an argument can be made that these water molecules,

00:03:59.212 --> 00:04:01.372
some of them will still make it from right to left,

00:04:01.372 --> 00:04:03.833
but you have a lower probability of going from right to left

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:06.364
as you have from going to left to right.

00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:09.553
So because of this you would have a net inflow of water

00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:13.608
from this area where you have a low solute concentration.

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:14.839
Remember the solute is the thing

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:16.998
that's dissolved in the water.

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:18.623
In general, we always consider the solvent

00:04:18.623 --> 00:04:20.434
to be whatever there's more of.

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:21.526
In this case, it's water,

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:24.892
and water is probably the most typical solvent,

00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:26.866
and the solute is whatever there's less of.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.327
So the solute is dissolved in the solvent,

00:04:29.327 --> 00:04:33.764
and so we have a net migration of the water molecules

00:04:33.764 --> 00:04:36.897
from this solution that has a low solute concentration

00:04:36.897 --> 00:04:39.567
to one that has a higher solute concentration.

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:42.725
This phenomenon we call osmosis.

00:04:42.725 --> 00:04:45.627
We call this osmosis.

00:04:45.627 --> 00:04:47.608
There's other arguments for osmosis.

00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:50.433
It's something that we've observed many, many, many times.

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:52.500
If you put something that's used to fresh water,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.331
and if it has skin or it has membranes

00:04:56.331 --> 00:05:00.609
that allows water to pass through it, put it salt water.

00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:03.674
The kind of famous things like slugs

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:05.804
will not do well in the presence of salt

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:09.310
because the water inside the slug will do exactly

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.748
what is happening in this diagram.

00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:13.513
This mechanism that I just talked about,

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:17.182
the molecules that cannot pass through the membrane,

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:19.712
blocking the water molecules from going right to left,

00:05:19.712 --> 00:05:21.849
ricocheting off and maybe causing the ones

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.333
that are on the right side to maybe move

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.516
in this direction when they bounce into them.

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:27.839
That's one explanation.

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.602
Another possibility is many times the solute

00:05:30.602 --> 00:05:32.297
that's being dissolved in water

00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:34.108
has some charge associated with it.

00:05:34.108 --> 00:05:37.034
When we think of, say, regular table salt

00:05:37.034 --> 00:05:42.449
you have sodium, you have sodium ions.

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.487
Regular table salt is sodium chloride,

00:05:44.487 --> 00:05:46.809
but when you put it in the water you have sodium ions

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:51.104
and you have chloride ions, and you have chloride ions.

00:05:51.104 --> 00:05:52.916
These are negatives, the chlorides are negative.

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:56.805
The sodium ions are positive.

00:05:56.805 --> 00:06:00.021
Above and beyond doing some of the mechanical blockage

00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:02.575
that I just talked about, there's also the idea that

00:06:02.575 --> 00:06:07.149
possibly because they are ionic they have charge,

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:08.913
and water has partial charges,

00:06:08.913 --> 00:06:11.282
they also might stick to more of the water,

00:06:11.282 --> 00:06:13.441
so the waters that stick to them aren't

00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:16.715
going to be available to move through the membrane.

00:06:16.715 --> 00:06:19.536
So what I mean by the water's going to stick to them?

00:06:19.536 --> 00:06:23.727
Well, when we think about a water molecule, it's an oxygen.

00:06:23.727 --> 00:06:26.072
It's an oxygen then you have a partially negative charge,

00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:28.402
and then you have two hydrogens,

00:06:28.402 --> 00:06:31.575
two, let me write it this way, you have two hydrogens.

00:06:31.575 --> 00:06:35.360
Right over here, there's a partially positive charge.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.659
So there going to be this oxygen end,

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:39.518
away from the hydrogens, is going to be attracted

00:06:39.518 --> 00:06:42.627
to the sodium molecule, and it's going to be less.

00:06:42.627 --> 00:06:44.160
The sodium molecule can't make it through.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.994
This guys going to want to stick to the sodium molecule.

00:06:45.994 --> 00:06:48.920
You can kind of imagine all of these water molecules

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.218
sticking to the sodium molecule,

00:06:51.218 --> 00:06:53.517
which would make it less likely that these would pass

00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:55.282
from right to left than the ones

00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:57.255
that are passing from left to right.

00:06:57.255 --> 00:07:00.903
Similarly, if you have a negatively charged ion like this

00:07:00.903 --> 00:07:03.107
then you can orient the water the other way,

00:07:03.107 --> 00:07:07.240
where the partially positive charged hydrogen ends are going

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.396
to be attracted to the chloride ion right over here.

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:13.950
Since the chloride ion might not be able to get through,

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.829
well, then these molecules that are stuck to it

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:19.083
are going to be less likely to flow through.

00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:21.891
These molecules are going to be more attracted

00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:24.724
to the chloride or more attracted to the sodium ions

00:07:24.724 --> 00:07:26.308
than they would be to other water molecules

00:07:26.308 --> 00:07:27.626
that only have partial charges.

00:07:27.626 --> 00:07:31.054
These have full charges, so these can't get through.

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:33.315
Then maybe it's a lower probability that these

00:07:33.315 --> 00:07:35.102
are going to get through as well.

00:07:35.102 --> 00:07:37.703
But the combined effects of all of these,

00:07:37.703 --> 00:07:39.444
and I'd love if any of y'all to point me to a nice

00:07:39.444 --> 00:07:41.023
simulation or maybe we'll create one on the

00:07:41.023 --> 00:07:43.879
Khan Academy computer science program to show this,

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:45.574
is that you're going to have a higher probability

00:07:45.574 --> 00:07:47.826
of the water molecules over here going from left to right

00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:50.172
than the water molecules over here going right to left,

00:07:50.172 --> 00:07:53.190
from mechanical blockage and or these big molecules

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.558
ricocheting off and pushing them in the wrong direction,

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.787
or because they're just stuck to the big molecules

00:07:57.787 --> 00:08:00.388
because the big molecules are charged.

00:08:00.388 --> 00:08:02.031
And that is osmosis.
