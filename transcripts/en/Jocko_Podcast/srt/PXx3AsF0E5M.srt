1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,900
This is Jocko podcast number
85 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,180
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,540
I was given a very old man who could not
or would not keep up with this country

4
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:24,040
man because he repeatedly fell
and then simply lay there.

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,640
I regularly had to lift him
up and drag him forward. Thus,

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,820
I only reached the execution site
when my comrades had already shot.

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,790
They're Jews at the site of his
country, men who had been shot.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,450
My Jiu threw himself on the
ground and remained lying there.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,820
I then cocked my car being and shot
him through the back of the head

10
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,860
because I was already very upset from the
cruel treatment of the Jews during the

11
00:00:55,861 --> 00:01:00,660
clearing of the town and was
completely in turmoil. I shot too high.

12
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,810
The entire back of the skull of my
Jew was torn off and the brain exposed

13
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,440
parts of the skull flew into
Sergeant Steinmetz, his face.

14
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,480
This was grounds for me.

15
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,900
After returning to the truck to go to the
first sergeant and ask for my release,

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,550
I had become so sick that
I simply couldn't anymore.

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,140
I was then relieved
by the first surgeon.

18
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,013
Okay.

19
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,830
Systematic murder.

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,160
That's what we're talking about.

21
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:57,970
This is the Nazis final solution,

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,040
which was not always carried out
in the relatively detached method.

23
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:09,610
Often fond of when we
think of the Holocaust

24
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,420
cause when we think of the Holocaust,

25
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,790
a lot of times we think of this
big mechanism we think of trains,

26
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,140
we think of gas chambers,
we think of process.

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,680
We think of a massive bureaucratic
machine that is doing the killing

28
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:33,900
in in.

29
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,900
Maybe that in some way is easier for us
to understand and that's where we focus

30
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:43,300
on that piece.
It's easier for us to accept that,

31
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,040
but it wasn't all like that.

32
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,220
Many lives were taken many
murders committed by hand,

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,800
close range,
point blank,

34
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,620
so what kind of

35
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,340
monsters
committed.

36
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,830
Those are trustees,

37
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:28,831
those personal atrocities up close
and personal murders that covered the

38
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:36,940
murderers in the blood of their victims.

39
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,920
What?
What kind of men were those

40
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,740
and how did they end up there

41
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,430
and what can we do

42
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,070
to prevent it from occurring again

43
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,800
now to answer or at least try
and come to some understanding.

44
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,900
We're going to explore a book
that is called ordinary men,

45
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,940
reserve police battalion 101 and the
final solution in Poland written by

46
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,380
Christopher are browning.

47
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,610
And that first excerpt that I read is
from that book and it's from a soldier in

48
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:51,250
the police battalion named August Zorn.
And that's actually a, a pseudonym.

49
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:54,220
The names were changed for
some of the Nazis in the book,

50
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,240
but the book is

51
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,340
incredibly detailed in what happened
and where these men were from and

52
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,040
what unfolded.

53
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,050
And obviously this is going
to be a graphic episode

54
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,610
and you,
you know,

55
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,480
I actually wish I didn't
have to talk about this.

56
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,800
I do. I really do. I wish I
could talk about nicer things.

57
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,180
I wish I could talk about pleasant
things and we could just forget about all

58
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,040
this horror.

59
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,260
But Aye,
there's the rub because

60
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,790
even though it would be easier and more
pleasant to talk about something nice,

61
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:59,900
the problem is that if we
forget about these things,

62
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,870
then we forget about these things

63
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,780
and if we forget,
we don't learn.

64
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,480
And if we don't learn about what humans
can do and why they do what they do,

65
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,920
then we can repeat our mistakes in.

66
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:24,990
That is awful.

67
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,883
Yeah,

68
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,830
so yeah,

69
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,540
we go because we have to go.

70
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,140
Can we go back to the book?

71
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,273
Okay.

72
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,790
Just as the sky was beginning to lighten
the convoy halted outside yourself,

73
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,600
it was a typical Polish village of modest
white houses with thatched straw roofs

74
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,740
among its inhabitants war 1800 Jews.

75
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,560
The village was totally quiet.
The men of Reserve Police Battalion,

76
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:17,760
one o one climbed down from their trucks
and assembled in the half circle around

77
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:20,940
their commander,
Major Ville helm trap,

78
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,270
a 53 year old career policemen,

79
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,420
affectionately known by
his men as papa trap.

80
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,410
The time had come for trap to address the
men and inform them of the assignment.

81
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,640
The battalion had received

82
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,690
Pale and nervous with choking
voice and tears in his eyes

83
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,890
trap visibly fought to control himself.
As he spoke

84
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,250
the battalion,

85
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,840
he said plaintiff Lee had to perform
a frightfully unpleasant task.

86
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,090
This assignment was not to his liking.
Indeed, it was highly regrettable,

87
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,460
but the orders came from
the highest authorities.

88
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,470
If it would make the task any easier
than men should remember that in Germany

89
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,200
the bombs were falling
on women and children.

90
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,180
Then he turned to the matter at hand.

91
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,620
The Jews had instigated the American
boy cop that it damaged Germany.

92
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,170
One policeman remembered trap saying

93
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,100
there were Jews in the village of
Yosef Ove who were involved with the

94
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:32,950
partisans.
He explained according to two others,

95
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,820
the battalion had now been
ordered to round up these Jews,

96
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,220
the male Jews of working age where to
be separated and taken to a work camp.

97
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,950
The remaining Jews,
the women,

98
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,020
children and elderly were to be
shot on the spot by the battalion.

99
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,870
Having explained awaited his men trapped
made them an extraordinary offer.

100
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,800
If any of the older men among them did
not feel up to the task that lay before

101
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:07,530
them,
he could step out.

102
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,420
Trap paused,
and after some moments,

103
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,320
one man from third company,
Aldo,

104
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,590
Julius Schimke,
stepped forward.

105
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Captain Hoffman who had arrived in
Yosef directly from Zaccaro with third

106
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:38,361
platoon of third company and had not been
part of the officers' meetings the day

107
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,660
before was furious that one of his
men had been the first to break rakes.

108
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,970
Hoffman begin to Berate Schimke,

109
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,920
but trap caught him off after he had
taken Schimke under his protection.

110
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,010
Some 10 or 12 other men
stepped forward as well.

111
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,830
They turned in their rifles and we're
told to await a further assignment from

112
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:02,664
the major,

113
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,220
so we'll go into this,
but you've got to

114
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,980
a battalion three companies,

115
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,720
there's probably 500 men and we have,

116
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,260
they get this s savage order that
they're going to go and shoot

117
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,150
the women,

118
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,180
children and elderly on the spot in this
village with pretty white houses and

119
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:37,680
the commander, this guy trap who
obviously isn't comfortable with it,

120
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,900
he's got tears in his eyes when
he's given this order. He says, Hey,

121
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:44,070
if anybody doesn't want to participate,

122
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:47,850
you can step forward now and like 10
or 12 people out of 500 step forward.

123
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,490
The rest of them hold the line.
In this case,

124
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,830
going back to the book,

125
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,010
trapped then summoned the company
commanders and gave them the respect of

126
00:10:59,011 --> 00:10:59,551
assignments.

127
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:04,380
The orders were relayed
by the platoon commanders,

128
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,220
two platoons, a third company
where to surround the village.

129
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,270
The men were explicitly ordered
to shoot anyone trying to escape.

130
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,020
The remaining men were to round up the
Jews and take them to the marketplace.

131
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,230
Those too sick or frail to walk to the
marketplace as well as infants and anyone

132
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:26,100
offering resistance. We're attempting
to hide where to be shot on the spot.

133
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,153
Thereafter,

134
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,220
a few men of the first company were
escorted where do escort the work Jews who

135
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:38,550
had been selected at the marketplace
while the rest of first company was to

136
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:41,460
proceed to the forest
to form firing squads.

137
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,130
The Jews were to be loaded onto battalion
trucks by second company and Third

138
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:51,210
Platoon of third company and shuttled
from the marketplace to the forest,

139
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,460
and that's for executions.
Yeah.

140
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,880
After making the assignments trap.

141
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:03,330
Spent most of the day in town either
in a schoolroom converted into his

142
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:08,100
headquarters at the homes of the Polish
mayor and at the local priest at the

143
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,430
marketplace or on the road to the forest,

144
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,740
but he did not go to the forest
itself or witness the executions.

145
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,780
His absence.

146
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:23,070
There was conspicuous as one
policeman bitterly commented.

147
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,930
Major trap was never there.

148
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,000
Instead of you remained in Yosef wove
because he could allegedly could not bear

149
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:30,834
the sight

150
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,720
we met were upset about that and
said we couldn't bear it either.

151
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,673
Indeed,

152
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,010
traps distress was a secret
to no one at the marketplace.

153
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,900
One policeman remembered hearing
traps wrote, say, Oh God,

154
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,560
why did I have to be given these
orders as he put his hand on his heart,

155
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,880
another policeman witness
Tim at the schoolhouse today.

156
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:59,120
I can see exactly before my
eyes made your trap in the room,

157
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:01,970
pacing back and forth with
his hands behind his back.

158
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,500
He made a downcast impression and spoke
to me. He said something like, man,

159
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,850
such jobs don't suit me,
but orders are orders.

160
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,770
Another man remembered vividly how trap
finally alone nor room sat on a stool

161
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,370
and wept bitterly.
The tiers really flowed.

162
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,410
Yeah.

163
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,011
Can you hear that?

164
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:32,630
That idea that orders
are orders doesn't stand,

165
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,400
doesn't work.
Back to the book.

166
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,860
As the roundup neared completion,

167
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:43,190
the men are first company were withdrawn
from the search and give them a quick

168
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:45,620
lesson in the gruesome
task that awaited them.

169
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,810
They were instructed by the battalion
doctor and the company's first Sargent,

170
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,720
and this is a quote from one of the men.

171
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,080
I believe that at this point all the
officers of the battalion were present,

172
00:13:57,081 --> 00:14:00,740
especially our battalion physician,
Dr Schoenfelder.

173
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,080
He now had to explain to us precisely how
we had to shoot in order to induce the

174
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:10,870
immediate death of the victim.
I remember exactly that.

175
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:15,400
For this demonstration, he'd you or
outlined the contours of a human body,

176
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,510
at least from the shoulders upward and
then indicated precisely the point on

177
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:22,990
which the fixed bayonet was to
be placed as an aiming guide.

178
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,130
So we have the battalion doctor who's
instructing some of the men and you're

179
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:36,170
going to see that it wasn't all
of them to take the bayonet,

180
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,350
which is on their rifle,

181
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,280
put it on the back of the
neck as an aiming guide to
know where exactly where to

182
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:44,784
shoot.

183
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,513
Okay.

184
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,810
Back to the book.

185
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,130
First Sergeant Camer had taken the
initial contingent of shooters in first

186
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:59,590
company to a forest several
kilometers from Yosef.

187
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,100
The truck's halted on a dirt road that
ran along the edge at a point where a

188
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:10,870
pathway led into the woods. The men
climbed down from their trucks and waited.

189
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,840
When the first truck load of 35 to 40
Jews arrived and equal number of policemen

190
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:22,950
came forward and face to face
were paired off with their victims

191
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,040
led by or the policemen and Jews
marched down the forest path.

192
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,050
They turned off into the woods at
a point indicated by captain Wolof,

193
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,340
who busied himself throughout the day,
selecting the execution sites.

194
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,650
Camera then ordered the
Jews to lie down in a row.

195
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,310
The policeman stepped up behind them,

196
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,420
place their bayonets on the backbone
above the shoulder blade as instructed

197
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,470
earlier and on cameras
command fired in unison.

198
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,260
In the meantime,

199
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,860
more policemen of first company had
arrived at the edge of the forest to fill

200
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:07,570
out a second firing squad.

201
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,320
As the first firing squad marched out
of the woods to the unloading point,

202
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,980
the second group took their victims
along the same path into the woods.

203
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,390
Well,
half chose a site a few yards farther on,

204
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:22,930
so the next batch of victims would
not see the corpses from the earlier

205
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:23,764
execution.

206
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,390
These Jews were again forced to lie
face down in a row and the shooting

207
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:30,770
procedure was repeated.

208
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,170
Thereafter,

209
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,410
the pendulum traffic of the two firing
squads in and out of the woods continued

210
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:45,060
throughout the day
except for a midday break.

211
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,300
The shooting proceeded without
interruption until nightfall.

212
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,930
At some point in the afternoon,

213
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:55,260
someone organized a supply
of alcohol for the shooters.

214
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,500
By the end of the day of
nearly continuous shooting,

215
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,630
the medic completely lost track of how
many Jews they had each killed in the

216
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:10,610
words of one policeman. It was,
in any case, a great number.

217
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,590
So clearly this is not what we think
of when we think of the Holocaust.

218
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,410
Go Ben being paired off with their victims
to take out in the woods and shot in

219
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:28,610
the back of the head.

220
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,880
Yeah,

221
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,930
and going through this
procedure the entire day.

222
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,030
Back to the book.
In contrast to first company,

223
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,390
the men of second company received no
instruction on how to carry out the

224
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:50,040
shooting initially bay,

225
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:54,780
and that's we're not fixed as an
aiming guide and as herder noted,

226
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,470
there was a considerable number of
missed shots that led to the unnecessary

227
00:17:58,471 --> 00:17:59,820
wounding of the victims.

228
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,220
One of the policemen and
hurts unit likewise noted
the difficulty the men had an

229
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:09,000
aiming properly. At
first, we shot free hand.

230
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,650
When one aim too high, the entire
skull exploded. As a consequence,

231
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,720
brains and bones flew everywhere.

232
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,860
Thus we were instructed to place
the bay in that point on the neck.

233
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,100
According to hergert.
However,

234
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,460
using fixed bayonets as an
aiming guide was no solution.

235
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,830
Through the point blank shot though the
point blank shot that was thus required,

236
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,990
the bullet struck the head of the victim.

237
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,900
It's such a trajectory that
often the entire skull,

238
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:44,901
or at least the entire rear skullcap
was torn off and blood bone splinters in

239
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:48,990
brain sprayed everywhere and
[inaudible] to the shooters.

240
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,790
Her group was so in phatic that no one
had first platoon was given the option of

241
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,080
withdrawing beforehand,

242
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,100
but once the executions began and men
approached either him or sheer because

243
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:08,190
they could not shoot women and children,
they were given other duties.

244
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:13,770
This was confirmed by one of his men
during the execution word spread that

245
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:16,140
anyone could not take it
any longer could report.

246
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,590
He w he then went on to note,

247
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,220
I myself took part in some 10 shootings
in which I had to shoot men and women.

248
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,030
I simply could not
shoot at people anymore,

249
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:35,270
which became apparent to my sergeant
hergert because at the end I repeatedly

250
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:39,690
shot past. For this
reason, he relieved me.

251
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:46,310
Other comrades were all so relieved sooner
or later because they simply could no

252
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:47,850
longer continue.

253
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,313
So

254
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,460
obviously there's mixed emotions about
this whole thing from the top of the

255
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:08,490
chain of command right down
to the frontline shooters
that are only able to do

256
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:11,850
this so many times.
Some of them opt out of it initially,

257
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,330
but let's remember that it's still
taking place and no one's stopping it.

258
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,810
No ones. Some I'm saying some people
are excusing themselves from it,

259
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,790
but there's no one saying, Hey, what
the hell are we doing right now?

260
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,710
Back to the book,

261
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,090
some of the men who hurried at their
tasks shot far more Jews than others who

262
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:40,050
delayed as much as they could.
After two rounds,

263
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,400
one policeman simply slipped off and
stayed among the trucks at the edge of the

264
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:45,234
forest.

265
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,600
Another managed to avoid taking turn with
the shooters all together and here's a

266
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:50,434
quote from him.

267
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,210
It was in no way the case that those who
did not want to or could not carry out

268
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:58,660
the shooting of human beings with their
own hands could not keep themselves out

269
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:02,890
of the task. No strict control
was being carried out here.

270
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,550
I therefore remained by the arriving
trucks and kept myself busy.

271
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:11,260
At the arrival point. In any case, I
gave my activity such an appearance.

272
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,720
It could not be avoided.

273
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:18,220
That one or another of my comrades
noticed that I was not going to the

274
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:20,860
executions to fire away at the victims.

275
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,260
They showered me with remarks such as
shit head and weakling to express their

276
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:28,100
disgust,

277
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,930
but I suffered no
consequences for my actions.

278
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,430
I must mention here that I was not
the only one who kept himself out of

279
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,350
participating in the executions.

280
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,210
So guys,
like I said,

281
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,260
had figured out that they can not
participate if they don't want to

282
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,940
and they're getting called cowards
weaklings by the guys that are actually

283
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,870
cowards and weak links that are
going out and executing people.

284
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,743
Okay.

285
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,680
Back to the book.
As with first company,

286
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:12,710
alcohol was made available to the
policemen under Drucker and Steinmetz who

287
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,970
stayed in the forest
and continued shooting

288
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,170
as darkness approached at the end of a
long summer day and the murders task was

289
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:24,950
still not finished. The shooting became
even less organized and more hectic.

290
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,160
The forest was so full of dead bodies
that it was difficult to find places to

291
00:22:31,171 --> 00:22:32,610
make the Jews lie down.

292
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,083
Okay.

293
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,740
So they complete this massacre and they
head back to their barracks and here we

294
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:56,810
go back to the book.
When the men arrived back at the barracks,

295
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,040
they were depressed,

296
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,100
angered in bittered and shaken the
eight little but drink heavily generous

297
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:10,220
quantities of alcohol were provided.
And many of the policeman got quite drunk.

298
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,980
Major trap made the rounds trying to
console and reassure them. And again,

299
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:18,590
placing the responsibility
on higher authorities,

300
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,220
placing responsibility on
higher authorities. You're
not allowed to do that.

301
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,810
Yeah,

302
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,810
but neither the drink nor
traps constellation could
wash away the sense of shame

303
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:37,180
and horror that pervaded the barracks.

304
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,803
So

305
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,390
that was the first police
action that they did this with.

306
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:48,680
This took place in Poland.

307
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,020
It was the first time that the group
had deployed to Poland and to give you,

308
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,190
you know, when you, we
hear what they did. Yeah.

309
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:02,360
You hear some people that that had a hard
time with it, but still, like I said,

310
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,380
that was a small percentage that was like
10% maybe 15% of people that said, no,

311
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:08,230
I'm not going to do her to that.
That he had or,

312
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,820
or made themselves busy with other things.

313
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,210
Most of the guys just went ahead
and did what they were told to do

314
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,920
and you think to yourself,
okay, well who were these guys?

315
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,460
Were they hardened combat veterans from
the front line where they were they

316
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,750
young sort of brainwashed
Nazi youth that were that.

317
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:34,910
That's what they believed
in and they just, they,

318
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:39,020
their minds just saw that as the reality
that they had to go through with,

319
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,790
and this is the strange thing about
this book is that that's not what it is.

320
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,880
That's not who these guys were.

321
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,460
And now I'll go to the book to
talk about who they actually were.

322
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,260
For the most part,
reserve reserve police battalion,

323
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:58,970
one o one was now composed of men without
any experience of German occupation

324
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:01,520
methods and eastern
Europe or for that matter,

325
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,240
with the exception of the very oldest
tool in world war one, veterans,

326
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,020
any kind of military service. Most of
these guys aren't even from the military.

327
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,470
The battalion consisted of 11 officers,

328
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,640
five administrative officials in charge
of financial matters relating to play in

329
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:18,950
political, uh, provisioning, lodging,

330
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:22,250
etc. And 486 noncommissioned
officers and men.

331
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,550
The battalion was divided
into three companies,

332
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:28,070
each of approximately 140
men when it full strength.

333
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,850
Two companies were commanded by police
captains and the third by certain senior

334
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:33,260
reserve lieutenant in that battalion.

335
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,220
Each company was divided into three
platoons to them commanded by reserve

336
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:40,430
lieutenants and the third by
a platoon senior sergeants.

337
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:42,650
So this is kind of a
normal military makeup.

338
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,850
The battalion was commanded by
53 year old, major Wilhelm trap,

339
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,740
World War One veteran and recipient
of the iron cross first class.

340
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:01,330
Now we know World War One obviously
was a brutal war and he's a survivor of

341
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:02,290
that,

342
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:07,040
awarded the Iron Cross first class
and fought for Germany and lost.

343
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,060
What do you do after the war?
Back to the book. After the war,

344
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:13,550
he became a career policemen
and rose through the ranks.

345
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,970
He had recently been promoted from
captain of second company and this was his

346
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:20,210
first battalion command.

347
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Though trap had joined the Nazi party
in December of 1932 and thus technically

348
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:31,760
qualified as an old party
fighter or alter comfort.

349
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:37,510
He had never been taken into the ss or
even given an equivalent ss rank in spite

350
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:43,440
of the fact that Himmler and Heidrick
consciously tried to merge and intertwined

351
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:44,100
to state and

352
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,680
party components of their ss police.

353
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:50,760
Empire trap was clearly
not considered ss material.

354
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,370
So the, and, and you're going
to see this, these guys, I mean,

355
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:57,204
there's a war going on.

356
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,590
So why are these guys in a police
battalion as opposed to being on the front

357
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:02,424
lines fighting the war?

358
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,460
The reason is because they're not quite
the right material to go out and fight.

359
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,560
And by the way, this is, you know,

360
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,910
we're going to get to a point as soon in
the war where there's some 14 year old

361
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:16,980
to Hitler youth going out to fight, but
these guys aren't, aren't being selected.

362
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,400
Back to the book. He was soon to come
into conflict with his two captains,

363
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:27,960
both young ss men who even in their
testimony more than 20 years later made no

364
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:32,670
attempt to conceal their contempt for
their commander as weak unmilitary and

365
00:27:32,671 --> 00:27:35,640
unduly interfering in the
duties of his officers.

366
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,900
So he's got a couple police captains
that were a little bit more hardcore.

367
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,250
Let me tell you about them.
Wolf Gang Hoffman.

368
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:50,150
He was born 19 1416 years old.

369
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:55,521
He was in Hitler youth in
1932 at 18 he was in the SS,

370
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,630
graduated from Gymnasium,

371
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,100
which is a college preparatory high
school in 1934 during the police force in

372
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:10,101
1936 I entered the Nazi party in 1937
same year completed police training was

373
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:15,891
commissioned as a lieutenant and now he's
in the reserves in 1942 reserve police

374
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:22,140
battalion one on one. So He'd, he'd come
up through the ranks, you know, as a Nazi,

375
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,780
but still, even him, I
mean, his formative years,

376
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:32,430
he's born in 1914 so, you know,
it's not like it's all he knew.

377
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,010
You know,
he went from 1914 until what,

378
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:39,960
1933 1930 so he was 16 years old.
He had been formed,

379
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,530
you know, lived as a normal German
before the Nazi party was around.

380
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,650
We're not talking a brainwashed,
complete Nazi youth.

381
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:51,750
Same thing with the other guy.
Born in 1913 this is Julius Wolff off.

382
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,890
Also graduated from Gymnasium,

383
00:28:55,891 --> 00:29:00,480
joined the Nazi party
in 1933 1936 became ss.

384
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,160
So these guys are more, you know,

385
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,200
they're more engaged in the whole Nazi

386
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,120
party and obviously toeing
the line along that now.

387
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,090
So that's the two police captains
that are in charge of a couple of the

388
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,380
companies inside the battalion.
Now let's talk a little bit about the men.

389
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,910
The men aged generally
from 33 to 48 years old.

390
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,700
Uh,
five were party members.

391
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:35,640
None of them belong to the
SS of the back of the book.

392
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,640
Of the 32 noncommissioned officers
on whom we have information.

393
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:42,010
22 were party members and
seven were in the SS. They

394
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,370
ranged in age from 27 to 40 years old.

395
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,450
Their average age was 33 and a half.
They were not reservists,

396
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:54,400
but rather prewar recruits to
the police of the rank and file.

397
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,720
So now we're just
talking about the troops.

398
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:57,970
The 400 plus troops of the rank and file.

399
00:29:57,971 --> 00:30:00,160
The vast majority of war
from the Hamburg area,

400
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,930
63% were working class background,
but fewer skilled laborers.

401
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,830
The majority of them held typical
Hamburg working class jobs,

402
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:11,650
dock workers and truck
drivers were most numerous,

403
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,340
but there are also many warehouse and
construction workers, machine operators,

404
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,270
seaman and waiters.
About 35% were lower middle class,

405
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:21,250
virtually all of them
white collar workers,

406
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,730
three quarters of them
were in sales of some sort.

407
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,680
The other one quarter form various office
jobs in both government and private

408
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:30,370
sector.

409
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,840
The number of under the number of
independent artisans and small businesses,

410
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,870
businessmen were very small.
Only a handful,

411
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,760
2% where middleclass profession
professionals and very
modest ones at that such

412
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:44,530
as drug tests and teachers.

413
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,790
The average age of the men was 39

414
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,580
over half were between 37 and 42 a
group considered too old for the army,

415
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:58,750
but most heavily conscripted for reserve
police duty after September, 1939.

416
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,230
So these guys, so the,
the men are, are there,

417
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,640
they're 30 40 years old,
35 40 years old.

418
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:11,240
These guys is if fully developed,
right? They're not, they're not. Yeah.

419
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,030
They're not impressionable guys that
are just raised inside the nautical too.

420
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,500
Cause I mean, let's face it,
if you're raised in any, uh,

421
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,910
cultish religion scenario,

422
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,490
there's a really good chance that if
that's what you're going to believe in and

423
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:28,990
you don't understand any other
way of thinking. So you can

424
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,440
know if you can be a good excuse,

425
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:37,020
but it's understandable how
you end up that way. Yeah.

426
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,360
Back to the book,

427
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,150
the men of Reserve Police Battalion were
from the lower orders of German society.

428
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,880
They'd experienced neither social nord,

429
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:48,040
geographic mobility by
virtue of their age.

430
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,800
And here's what we're just talking
about. By virtue of their age, of course,

431
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,090
all went through their formative
period in the pre Nazi era era.

432
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:59,710
These were men who had known political
standards and moral norms other than

433
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:03,850
those of the Nazis,
most came from Hamburg by reputation,

434
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:06,130
one of the least not to
find cities in Germany.

435
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,870
And the majority came from a social
class that had been Anti Nazi in its

436
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:11,800
political culture.

437
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:17,710
These men would not seem to have been
a very promising group from which to

438
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:22,711
recruit mass murderers on the half on
behalf of Nazi vision of a racial utopia

439
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,400
free of Jews.
And I think

440
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,010
that title list book is
ordinary men and that's why,

441
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,740
because that's what we're talking about
here. Ordinary men. I mean that's, that's,

442
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,090
that's about it.
Uh,

443
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,580
clear cross section of society
then you could come up with,

444
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:46,490
I mean you'd come up with the same cross
section of society in America once you

445
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:50,180
guys are working as construction
workers, waders, truck drivers,

446
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:54,440
dockworkers I mean that's what,
that's what people do. Oh,

447
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:57,050
what age are they? They're
35 40 years old. Okay.

448
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,290
Is that the group that you think is going
to be all you're gonna be able to take

449
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:04,070
out and get him to murder thousands
and thousands of people face to face.

450
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,563
Okay.

451
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:14,170
Now there's a section here
is the reflections on the
massacre itself and it's

452
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:19,460
talking about this first,
like I said,

453
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:23,300
this first thing that
took place in Yossef Wolf,

454
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,980
it was that their first big
action as a group. So here we go.

455
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:31,580
Back to the book at your associate at USF.
Amir doesn't,

456
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:35,210
men out of nearly 500 responded
instinctively to major traps,

457
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:38,810
offered a step forward and excuse
themselves from the impending mass murder.

458
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:44,710
Why was the number of men from the
beginning declared themselves who from the

459
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:49,180
beginning declare themselves unwilling
to shoot so small? Any kind of offers,

460
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,080
an explanation here.
It's like the suddenness of it.

461
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,870
And if people are kind of surprised
and I, I can make sense of that, right?

462
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,570
Like if I gave you time to
think, if I was like, hey echo,

463
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,270
we got to go do this thing right now,
you'd probably be like, okay, cool,

464
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:04,460
let's go do it. But if I said, hey, echo,

465
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,300
then we're going to go do something
tomorrow, tomorrow, you know,

466
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,580
I'll pick you up at 10 30,
let me know,

467
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:18,050
well now you have time to contemplate.
So he surprised him with it. Uh,

468
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,040
there's also,
obviously there was peer pressure,

469
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:27,070
right to conform and you know that
that's going to play a role in,

470
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,910
and we'll talk about that more later.
Going back to book, back to the book.

471
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,541
Nonetheless,

472
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:37,541
the act of stepping out that morning in
Yossef off meant leaving one's comrades

473
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:42,500
and admitting that one was too weak
or cowardly. Who would've dared?

474
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:47,150
One policeman declared emphatically to
lose face before the assembled troops.

475
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,980
If the questions posed to me why I shot
with the others in the first place,

476
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:55,460
said another who subsequently asked
to be excused after several rounds of

477
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:59,750
killing, I must answer that no
one wants to be thought a coward.

478
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,380
It was one thing to
refuse at the beginning.

479
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:07,040
He added and quite another to try
and shoot but not be able to continue

480
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,080
another policeman more aware of what
truly required courage said quite simply,

481
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,400
I was cowardly. So that person
gets it. Yeah. You know,

482
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:22,160
these people are that the shooters are
saying, hey, I don't want to be a coward,

483
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,090
so I wanted to go shoot when
actually to stand up and say no.

484
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:29,540
That's what would have taken real
moral core courage at these points and

485
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:34,520
obviously these guys knew what
they were doing was wrong.

486
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,590
They knew it. That's why they're,
some of them weren't able to continue.

487
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,950
Now,
speaking of cowardly,

488
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,520
here's a little section that I thought
you should be pointed out and we were

489
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:53,490
talking about this before the podcast,
how people rationalize things. Yeah.

490
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,320
Well listen to this rationalization.

491
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,760
Perhaps the most astounding
rationalization of all
was that of a 35 year old

492
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:03,630
metal worker from Bremerhaven quote,

493
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,940
I made the effort and it was possible
for me to shoot only children.

494
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,310
It's so happened that the mothers
led the children by the hand.

495
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,850
My neighbor then shot the mother and
I shot the child that belonged to her

496
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,450
because I reasoned with myself
that after all, without its mother,

497
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,760
the child could not live any longer.

498
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,290
It was supposed to be so to speak.

499
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,890
Soothing to my conscious
to release the children,

500
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,110
unable to live without their mothers.

501
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:43,010
And actually he goes in here and talks
about the German word for release also

502
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:46,530
means to like redeem or save.

503
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,820
So this guy's really twisted
things up in his head.

504
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,910
The dangers of rationalization
right there. Good God.

505
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,880
Back to the book with few exceptions,

506
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:04,740
the whole question of antisemitism is
marked by silence. So this is interesting.

507
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,840
This is very interesting. He the, as they,

508
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,090
and I should have
pointed this out earlier,

509
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:17,091
but this book is based on all these
different interviews and witness accounts,

510
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,160
mostly of the policemen
themselves. Now, and again,

511
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:24,360
I should have pointed
this out in the beginning.

512
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,820
Of course people are making
witness statements and
there's all kinds of problems

513
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:32,160
with those, right? They don't
remember things correctly.

514
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,220
They're trying to protect themselves,
they're trying to protect her friends,

515
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:39,150
they're trying to indict certain people
and make them look like the bad guy.

516
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,460
They might be trying to make themselves
look good. So there's all these

517
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,000
kind of angles that you have to listen
to the, you have to understand this with.

518
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,060
Yeah.
But this is interesting.

519
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:55,770
As they interview these guys back
to the book with few exceptions,

520
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:58,860
the whole question of
antisemitism is marked by silence.

521
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,750
What is clear is that the men's concerned
for their standing in the eyes of

522
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:07,860
their comrades was not matched by any
sense of human ties with their victims.

523
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,180
The Jews stood outside their circle of
human obligation and responsibility.

524
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,960
Such a polarization between us and them,

525
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:20,190
between one's comrades and the
enemy is of course standard in war.

526
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,143
And it is indeed.

527
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,830
But I guess what surprised me is these
guys weren't going in there with thinking

528
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:27,060
themselves,
okay,

529
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:29,760
these are the Jews that are doing us
wrong and we're going to get our chance.

530
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,400
They were just kind of
saying, well, they're not us,

531
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,250
so we'll do what we have to do.
Yeah,

532
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,800
back to the book,
even 20 or 25 years later,

533
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,900
those who did quit shooting along
the way overwhelmingly cited sheer,

534
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:52,770
physical revulsion against what
they were doing as the prime motive,

535
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,030
but the not express any
ethical or political principles
behind this revulsion.

536
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,530
So That's interesting.

537
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,500
These guys were stopping because it made
them feel sick and they weren't saying,

538
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:09,000
look, I need, so I am actually,
what I've been saying is like, Hey,

539
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:12,600
these guys knew it was wrong. Oh,
well they didn't think of it as wrong,

540
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:17,070
or at least this is explaining
that they weren't thinking, oh,

541
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:19,710
this is so wrong that their thinking was,
I'm going to be sick.

542
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:24,711
Now any rational person can figure out
that if something makes you sick to do,

543
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:32,060
then you've got some deep seeded
knowledge that what you're doing is wrong.

544
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,950
Yeah. Yeah. It seems like that that
was like the, the moral part of it,

545
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,100
right or wrong and stuff. That wasn't
the primary, the primary. It was just,

546
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,250
I can't take the blood and guts, man.
I can't take the blood and guts. Yeah,

547
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,530
you're exactly right. Now, like I said,

548
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,720
there's a connection and I don't
think he makes it in the book,

549
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:49,920
but in my mind there's a connection.

550
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,670
If you're doing something that
makes you feel sick. Yeah.

551
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,960
It's not just the making you feel sick.
That's should be bothering you.

552
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,060
What's should be bothering you is the
fact that you're doing something that

553
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:02,460
makes you feel sick. There's a
reason why it makes you feel sick.

554
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:08,060
There's a reason why human beings feel
sick when they're laying down children

555
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:11,850
shooting in the back of the head. There's
a reason for that. That's an, that's a,

556
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,080
that's a, it's like a, like a
survival instinct, right? For your,

557
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,590
for your species to carry on.
Yeah.

558
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,100
You have to make the other members
of your species survive. Yeah.

559
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,740
Especially if, if, just like,
are you saying they were,

560
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:30,490
there wasn't like some enemy kind
of feeling towards, you'd be like,

561
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,280
girl felt like, oh, we're defending
ourselves against this enemy. You know?

562
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:33,821
It wasn't that.

563
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:38,740
It was just that it was essentially
the minimum requirements and go against

564
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:41,980
somebody. They're not us and he's going
to go into this a little bit, but yeah,

565
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,680
you're right. It's not, it's not like
there's, yeah. He says, Hey, there's,

566
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,890
there's women and children being
bombed back in Germany right now,

567
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,520
but there's no direct correlation.
They're not saying, hey, look,

568
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,670
these Jews are fighting us. They're
gonna, they're gonna take over.

569
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:57,670
They've got ground in, you
know, on our borders. No,

570
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,290
not saying that they're actually in
total control of the Jews at this point,

571
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,690
or they're not total control,
but they're getting really close.

572
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,220
Getting really close.

573
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,520
Yeah.

574
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,180
Back to the book,

575
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,600
the resentment and bitterness in the
battalion over what they had been asked to

576
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:19,410
do, and Yosef was shared
by virtually everyone,

577
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:21,120
even those who had shot the entire day,

578
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,920
the exclamation of one policeman to first
sergeant camera of the first company

579
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,780
that I'd go crazy if I had to do that
again, express the sentiments of many.

580
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:37,890
But few went beyond complaining
to extricate themselves
from such a possibility.

581
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,870
So I said, hey, I bet why never
have to do that again. Yeah.

582
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,560
But very few of them said actually made
a stand the most dramatic back to the

583
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:50,980
book. The most dramatic response again
was that of Lieutenant Buckman who asked

584
00:41:50,981 --> 00:41:54,640
trapped to have him transferred back
to Hamburg and declared that short of a

585
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:58,330
direct personal order from trap,
he would not take part in Jewish actions.

586
00:41:59,290 --> 00:41:59,891
In the end,

587
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:04,570
he wrote to Hamburg explicitly requesting
a recall because he was not suited to

588
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:09,040
certain tasks, alien to the police that
were being carried out by his unit.

589
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,360
And Poland Buckman had waited,
had to wait until November,

590
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:16,030
but his efforts to be transferred
were ultimately successful.

591
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,680
So there's a guy that, that's one guy
that they're citing that actually said,

592
00:42:20,681 --> 00:42:22,390
dude,
I'm not going to do this

593
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,750
now. It was bad enough and did have
a bad enough effect on the men.

594
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:32,570
And they complained about it
enough that there was some changes.

595
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:36,320
So here we go back to the book and
subsequent actions to vital changes were

596
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:40,310
introduced,
hence forth with some notable exceptions,

597
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:45,370
adhere to first most of the future
operations of the Reserve Po Police

598
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:46,650
Battalion,

599
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:51,650
one o one involved ghetto clearing and
deportation not outright massacre on the

600
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:52,544
spot.

601
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,190
The policemen were thus relieved of the
immediate horror of the killing process,

602
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:03,460
which for deportees from the northern
Logan district was carried out in the

603
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:06,740
extermination camp at Treblinka.

604
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,920
So now we're not going to,
you don't have to go shoot him.

605
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,200
You just got to gather them up and get,
uh,

606
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,500
get them shipped off to
the extermination camp.

607
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:23,560
Second while deportation was a
horrifying procedure characterized by the

608
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:28,120
terrible coercive violence needed to
drive people onto the death trains,

609
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:31,780
as well as the systematic killing of
those who could not be marched to the

610
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:32,530
trains.

611
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:37,530
These actions were generally undertaken
jointly by units of Reserve Police

612
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,920
Battalion,
one on one and the tro Tro,

613
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:44,921
Nikki's ss trained auxiliaries from the
Soviet territory's recruited from the

614
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,770
Russian POW camps and usually assigned
to the very worst parts of that ghetto

615
00:43:50,771 --> 00:43:54,310
clearing and deportation.
So imagine this group,

616
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:59,311
you get a group of thugs that are
from Russian pow camps and you say,

617
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:02,770
Oh yeah, we'll let you out of this
pow camp and you can come work for us.

618
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:03,683
Mm,

619
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,300
yeah. And they're trained by the SS. No,

620
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:10,490
not exactly a friendly crew of guys.

621
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:17,060
In fact, that's like, I can't imagine
a worse group of people to come in and

622
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:22,550
come after you. Yeah. Back to the book.

623
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,090
The bulk of the killing was to be
removed to the extermination camp and the

624
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:30,950
worst of the, on the spot dirty work
was to be assigned to the [inaudible].

625
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,780
This change would prove sufficient to
allow the men of Reserve Police Battalion

626
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,650
One on one to become accustomed to their
participation in the final solution.

627
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,610
When the time came to kill again,
the policeman did not go crazy.

628
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,600
Instead they became increasingly
efficient and catalyst executioners.

629
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,510
So a couple of changes.

630
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,940
It was obviously it was a little too
much for them to actually do all the

631
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:00,780
killing themselves.

632
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:05,781
Now they got some people to help them
out and or they are just going to gather

633
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:09,180
them up and ship them away and they hold.
Now the only plan,

634
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:12,960
a little piece in the, in the,
in the, in the machine, right.

635
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,340
Just a little piece of machine.

636
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:18,990
So it's a lot easier to detach
from what's actually happening.

637
00:45:18,991 --> 00:45:22,860
Back to the book that Jews have low
Mazi where to be the target of reserve

638
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:27,540
battalion. One on ones.
First joint killing action
with a unit from the Truckee

639
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,030
second company was to provide the
bulk of the manpower for the roundup.

640
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,360
The primary function of the tourniquets
was unit was to provide the shooters,

641
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:44,970
thus alleviating the chief psychological
burden the German policemen had

642
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:46,780
experienced at Yoseph.

643
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:55,320
And here the,
the orders come out,

644
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:58,080
they're going in and

645
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,580
now there's another term
that comes up. It's, it's,

646
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,440
it has to do with the tourniquets,
but it's he Weise and it's short.

647
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,630
I forget what the German words are,

648
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,350
but he always is short
for two big German words.

649
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,440
One of them that means a willing
and one of them that means helper.

650
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,090
So they called these,

651
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,050
these sort of people that had come
to the German side and we're not,

652
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:26,310
they called them [inaudible] and it's
like I said, it stands for willing helper.

653
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,530
It's like,
it's like using,

654
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,570
you ever heard the term Spec war for
that stance where special warfare,

655
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:38,130
this is the same thing with German to
German words that mean willing helper.

656
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,880
So here we go. Back to the book,
the NCO is, we're told that the,

657
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:45,480
he always from trawniki
would do the shooting,

658
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:49,860
so the policeman would for the
most part be spared. Nonetheless,

659
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:52,860
the roundup was to be conducted
as had been done before,

660
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:57,660
which is to say that infants and the old
sick and frail who could not be easily

661
00:46:57,661 --> 00:47:00,300
taken to the assembly point
where to be shot on the spot.

662
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,680
So not out of all the killing
according to one squad leader,

663
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:08,950
however most children will once again
brought to the assembly point as in Yosef,

664
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:14,370
the men encountered not only German
Jews but specifically Hamburg Jews.

665
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:15,810
During the clearing action,

666
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,790
the Jews quickly filled the school yard
and overflowed into the adjoining sports

667
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:22,590
field with some shooting.

668
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,310
The roundup was finished
in two short hours.

669
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,050
So that's it.

670
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:34,530
That's a real sort of a one sentence
and if you can just try and imagine what

671
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:40,090
the hell is going on there. These
soldiers, these Russian soldiers,

672
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:42,850
these German soldiers are coming
in and rounding people up.

673
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:44,260
They're using violence,

674
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,000
shooting people to get all
the Jews into the school yard.

675
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,290
This is a nightmare scenario that they,
that you know,

676
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:54,700
he puts into a sentence here,

677
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,260
back to the book,
the 1700 Jews of Lumosity,

678
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,480
we're then forced to sit and wait.

679
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,720
A group of 60 to 70 young
men were selected out,

680
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,220
given shovels and spades loaded
onto trucks and driven to the woods.

681
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:17,170
Several of the young Jews jumped from
the moving trucks and made good their

682
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:20,620
escape.
Another attack to German corporal,

683
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:25,090
the battalion boxing championing champion
who promptly knocked his desperate

684
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:29,260
assailant senseless
in the woods.

685
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,080
The Jews were set to digging a mass grave

686
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,810
back in low Mazi.

687
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:39,730
The weight of the doom Jews and their
police guard stretched into hours.

688
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:45,120
Suddenly a contingent of 50 he weaves
from [inaudible] marched into town,

689
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,410
led by German ss officer.

690
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,130
I can still remember it exactly.

691
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,240
One policeman testified that immediately
after the arrival of these Trani keys

692
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:58,450
took a break. After their arrival,
the tourniquets took a break.

693
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,880
I saw that in addition to food,

694
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,350
they also took out bottles of vodka
out of their packs and drank from them,

695
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,290
the SS officer and Nad.
This is a guy that arrived on the scene.

696
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:14,710
Now grenade began
drinking heavily as well.

697
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,250
The other NCO smelled of alcohol,

698
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:21,520
but unlike the two commanders
were not visibly drunk.

699
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:27,100
So these guys are are drinking vodka and
they know what they're about to have to

700
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:31,240
go do. Now we're talking about
this guy, lieutenant nade.

701
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:36,470
Lieutenant Nade was a Nazi by
conviction and an anti Semite.

702
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,190
He was also unpredictable,
affable,

703
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:42,700
and approachable at times of
brutal and vicious at others.

704
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:49,720
And here's an eyewitness account from
one of those soldiers back to the book.

705
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,820
Even before the shooting began.

706
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:56,821
First Lieutenant Nade had personally
picked out some 20 to 25 elderly Jews.

707
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,910
They were exclusively
men with full beards.

708
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:05,650
Nade made the old men crawl on the
ground in the area before the grave,

709
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,920
before he gave them the order to crawl.

710
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:14,370
They had to undress while the
totally naked jewel Jews crawled,

711
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,680
first lieutenant made scream to those
around where my noncommissioned officers,

712
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,550
don't you have any clubs yet?

713
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,890
The noncommissioned officers
went to the edge of the forest,

714
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:31,190
fetched themselves clubs,
and vigorously beat the Jews with them.

715
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,173
They

716
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:46,410
get the mass grave dug,

717
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,410
and here we go.
Immediately.

718
00:50:50,411 --> 00:50:53,890
Large numbers of Jews were
driven into the grave and the,

719
00:50:53,891 --> 00:50:58,150
he always took their position on the
walls that had been thrown up. From there,

720
00:50:58,151 --> 00:51:02,000
they shot the victims.
As the shooting continued,

721
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:06,190
the grave began to fill.
The Jews who followed,

722
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:07,780
had to climb on and later,

723
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,960
later even clamber over those shot
earlier because the grave was filled with

724
00:51:13,091 --> 00:51:15,370
corpses almost to the edge.

725
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,090
The ncls decided that the execution
should continue with two firing squads on

726
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,680
opposite sides of the grave.

727
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,490
The Jews were forced to lie down
in rows alongside each other,

728
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,540
each side of the grave and were shot by
the police standing on the opposite wall.

729
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:41,470
Men from all three platoons were formed
into squads of eight to 10 and were

730
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:45,430
relieved by others in a rotation
after five or six shots.

731
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,890
After about two hours,

732
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:52,840
the he weaves were ry roused from their
stupor and resumed shooting in place

733
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,980
that Joe and policemen,

734
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
the shooting was finished around 7:00
PM and the work Jews who had been kept

735
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,140
aside covered the grave.

736
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,470
The work Jews were then shot as well.

737
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,970
The thin covering of the
overfill grave continued to move.

738
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:23,260
So you got people that are not dead,
that are now buried alive

739
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,560
and there was a part that I didn't cover.
Basically the,

740
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:35,420
he always got too drunk to continue on
and the the police had to go and take

741
00:52:35,421 --> 00:52:39,470
their place for awhile and then they
kind of recovered. But this is this,

742
00:52:39,471 --> 00:52:41,480
this is the situation
that we're talking about.

743
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:46,900
Just a complete nightmare
back to the book.

744
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:51,910
One other factor sharply distinguished
at low Mazi from Yosef wove and may well

745
00:52:51,971 --> 00:52:54,640
have been yet another kind of
psychological relief for the men,

746
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:59,790
namely and this is important from from
a psychological and from a leadership

747
00:53:00,371 --> 00:53:01,204
perspective.

748
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,580
One, so I'm going back through
to get one other factor.

749
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:12,350
Ma sharply distinguished low Mazi from
Yosef OEF and may well have been yet

750
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:15,410
another kind of psychological
relief for the men.

751
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:20,470
Namely this time they did not bear the
burden of choice that trap had offered

752
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:23,360
them so starkly on the
occasion of the first massacre.

753
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,920
No chance to step out

754
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,220
was given to those who did
not feel up to the shooting.

755
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,950
No one systematically excused.

756
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:35,490
Those who were visibly
too shaken to continue.

757
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:39,630
Everyone assigned to the firing
squad took his turn as ordered.

758
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,303
Therefore,

759
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:45,540
those who shot did not have to live with
clear awareness that they had what they

760
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:47,580
had done had been unavoidable.

761
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:52,320
So that's a big difference.
The big difference.

762
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,010
And from a leadership perspective,
that's something that I've,

763
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,230
I've actually talked about this before.
Um,

764
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:06,420
it's interesting. When we
were in Ramadi, you know,

765
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:11,220
we tasking at bruiser, we kind of
decided what we were going to do, right.

766
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:14,040
You know, we, we weren't
getting told go do this.

767
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,410
And so everything that we did,
we did because we decided that it was,

768
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:23,880
we could mitigate the risk and we could
take as good a good operation and we

769
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:27,660
could, there was an area that
we could do a good job in.

770
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:32,660
So we had a lot of control
over our fate and that's,

771
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:39,290
that's actually can be psychologically
heavier because if something goes wrong,

772
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,280
it's all, it's all on
you as the leader. Yeah.

773
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:47,330
Whereas the leadership team or even
as the guys that are on the front leg,

774
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,030
the point man, the point man
selecting his own, you know,

775
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,110
going down to the front row,
the frontline troops,

776
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,650
the point man is selecting the route.
If he hits an IED,

777
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,400
sure you know it's, it's
the enemy's fault. But,

778
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:03,990
but he's thinking to himself to why
did I choose that route? Now the army,

779
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,370
they did have some control but
they had more often than not,

780
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:09,210
they'd be getting told to,

781
00:55:09,211 --> 00:55:10,890
hey you're going to go on a
patrol down this road or hey,

782
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:11,880
you're going to go hit this building.

783
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:16,881
So they were relieved oftentimes
have that freedom of choice.

784
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,180
Yeah. So the freedom of choice
can be a little bit of a burden.

785
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:25,530
And so what happened here was the
freedom of choice was taken away and that

786
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:28,170
burden was there for taking my look.
You're going to get shut up and do this.

787
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:30,450
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

788
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:34,200
Cause you have like if you have that
choice like in back to the part where the

789
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,080
12 guys stepped up.
Right.

790
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,630
And Yeah,

791
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:43,200
we can look at it as the guys who
stepped out and have more courage because

792
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:45,690
they're are not essentially,

793
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:52,350
there's two things to be kind of scared
of or have courage against. Right. One is,

794
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:57,050
okay, I'm not scared to kill these
people. Pulled the trigger, you know,

795
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:01,380
and then there's, I'm not scared
to go against the norms. Yeah.

796
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:05,790
Which is bigger kind of thing
or much harder. Yeah. And that,

797
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:09,420
and you have the choice, which
one are you going to do? You know,

798
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,060
if they give you the choice, I'll
key, you can step out if you want.

799
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:14,400
What are you going to do? And
everyone's looking at you like, okay,

800
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:18,570
are you going to, I wonder
what the tipping point would
have been in other words,

801
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:23,190
like he chose to do it. No. If, if 10
people, but then what if it was 30? Yeah.

802
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,200
What if it was 40? And you see
that anytime in a crowd. Yeah.

803
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:29,470
You've seen that stupid, uh,
video where there's like one guy,

804
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,530
he's dancing by himself and it's,

805
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:35,590
it's like some viral videos that
kind of old school, I don't know,

806
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:38,800
but it's a stupid viral video. You
don't have to go and watch it yourself,

807
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:42,550
but I'll explain what happens. There's a
guy there like some kind of a concerts.

808
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:45,970
I'm kind of an outdoor concert.
There's a guy dancing by himself. Yeah.

809
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,830
He's dancing by himself for a
long time and that's why I saw it.

810
00:56:49,831 --> 00:56:52,320
But his company was talking about
like group or they use this as an,

811
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:56,380
as an example of group psychology. The
guys dancing by himself for a long time.

812
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,640
And what they're actually saying is
that the person that has the courage is,

813
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,240
is actually the second person
that joins him. Uh, so anyways,

814
00:57:04,241 --> 00:57:08,760
the one person dancing is dancing by
himself for several minutes. Yeah.

815
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:14,590
Then another port person joins him.
Once the other person joins him,

816
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,090
then all of a sudden five
people and then it's 20 people.

817
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,890
And then the next thing you know,
everyone is dancing.

818
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:25,300
And I wonder what the tipping point
would have been here. You know,

819
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:30,340
you get 10 people out of 500 that
wasn't enough. Yeah. But you know what?

820
00:57:30,341 --> 00:57:33,880
If all of a sudden 15 2030 40
people would have stepped forward,

821
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:37,360
then all of a sudden does it just
everyone says, hey, we're not doing this.

822
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,210
Yeah. Yeah. I think if they knew,

823
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:42,210
I wonder if they knew for sure
that there wasn't going to,

824
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,320
cause some guys were getting called names.

825
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:44,751
Well yeah,

826
00:57:44,751 --> 00:57:47,420
and I think it was the suddenness
that that he talked about in the book.

827
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:51,290
You know, if, if you'd have said, okay,
listen tomorrow. Yeah, we're going to do,

828
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,300
where do you want to kill a
bunch of women and children?

829
00:57:53,301 --> 00:57:56,810
Point blank range in the woods. Yeah.
You're going to have to shoot them all.

830
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:00,090
Yeah. Let me know if you're down.
Yeah. And then if you had done that,

831
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,410
but then giving them hours to sit there
and think about it and then the next

832
00:58:04,411 --> 00:58:06,620
guy's like, hey, what are you
going to do with it? Then the,

833
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:11,430
then it may have spread, but that
peer pressure was hardcore, hardcore,

834
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:16,080
so that, yes, especially with, like I
said, they're scared of the authority.

835
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:19,710
It's like, okay, the tipping
point is going to be more
for sure. But like, you know,

836
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:23,980
you do something like, you
know, your example or, or
year you ever see, you know,

837
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:26,340
you see this all the time
where you say you're on stage,

838
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:29,100
you say something kind of cool not,
you know,

839
00:58:29,101 --> 00:58:30,630
it's not the end of your presentation.

840
00:58:30,631 --> 00:58:33,180
You say something kind of cool and
then one guy starts clapping and then

841
00:58:33,181 --> 00:58:34,330
everyone starts clapping. Right. You know,

842
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,680
it's kind of that thing where this is no
consequence to clapping. So it's like,

843
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,530
all right, oh shoot, that's what
we're doing. Okay. I, I all clap,

844
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,900
I feel good about clapping, I'm going
to do it, you know, kind of thing.

845
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,720
There's no real resistance. So the
tipping point is going to be one guy.

846
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:48,360
That's the tipping point. But you get
something where there's going to be,

847
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:52,170
there might be some resistance, some
risk, you know, of, of pain or you know,

848
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:55,440
whatever kind of punishment. Yeah. The
tipping point's going to be more, I think.

849
00:58:55,441 --> 00:58:58,320
Yeah. I wonder what that is
man. Because it's not like,

850
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:04,150
like the Nazi regime was very
understanding. No, no, no,

851
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:06,900
no. I mean, no,

852
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:07,670
you know,

853
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:12,260
pretty much you can say that most
military units aren't very understanding.

854
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:16,380
Uh, you know, there's, there's going
to be a certain level of like Adt,

855
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:21,500
there's discipline in place for a
region reason and you can get, you know,

856
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:22,760
I talk about all the time,
you know, I said, look,

857
00:59:22,761 --> 00:59:25,540
you can't just order people to do
things. It only lasts for so long. Yeah.

858
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,480
But how long did it need to last year?
It only needed the last night.

859
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:32,100
If you can get everyone to do what you
need them to do tonight, you know, we'll,

860
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:37,070
okay, we got through our
mission and now I'll let them,

861
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:40,570
you know, what did he do? He actually
let them go get drunk and you know,

862
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:45,350
talk to them and, and built up some more
leadership capital cause he expended,

863
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,860
he expended it a bunch of his leadership
capital to get this mission done and

864
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:50,920
now he's got to rebuild it and read,

865
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:54,140
kind of get developed this
relationship again with the guys and,

866
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,550
and bring in some other changes.
Hey look,

867
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,600
we're not gonna do all the killing
this time. So yeah, it's crazy. It's,

868
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:07,490
I thought it was pretty surprising and
I'd be kind of a few kind of cycle saying

869
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:10,760
refreshing to know that they
didn't get that much punishment

870
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:16,520
aside from some name calling. You know,
cause you don't think of it like that.

871
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:18,890
I think when you, when you think
of that like all this in it,

872
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:24,070
you know the guy you're saying you're
saying, yeah people, there you go. Yeah.

873
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:25,560
All that guy was named called.
Yeah.

874
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:28,700
And that's another thing that they proud
that that might've changed the tipping

875
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:32,030
point when they realized, you know,
that those guys have stepped forward.

876
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:34,340
They might've thought they get put
in the ditch because there are some,

877
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:35,800
and I didn't cover this part,
but there's,

878
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:37,310
there's definitely some
parts where guys like, Hey,

879
01:00:37,311 --> 01:00:41,180
we'll put you in the ditch that's actually
get up here and do your job. Yeah,

880
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:46,340
but I think that reveals the
discomfort of the overall situation.

881
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:49,220
Yet they weren't looking at their buddy
saying, no, I'm going to kill you now.

882
01:00:49,221 --> 01:00:51,320
They were like, Hey, we're
actually, I kind of agree with you,

883
01:00:51,321 --> 01:00:53,570
but you just stay over
there and we'll go forward.

884
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:57,801
Okay.

885
01:00:57,801 --> 01:01:01,940
So the next situation that they get
into are these deportations to Treblinka

886
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,680
death camp.
And here we go back to the book.

887
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:09,890
While the policeman did not know precisely
where the Jews were being sent or

888
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:11,300
what was being done with them,

889
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:17,530
it was all clear and well known to all
of us as Heinrich Steinmetz admitted that

890
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:24,860
for the Jews effected these
deportations meant the path to death.

891
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:30,640
We suspected that they would be
killed in some sort of camp spared.

892
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,990
Direct participation in the killing,

893
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:38,170
the men of Reserve Police
Battalion one-on-one seem
scary to have been disturbed

894
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:39,650
by this awareness.

895
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:45,520
Even though there were more victims in
the deportations than in Josefa or low

896
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:51,011
mousay massacres combined out
of sight was truly out of mind.

897
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,980
So now they're in this mode of
they're just doing the deportations.

898
01:01:55,130 --> 01:02:00,130
Now I say just doing the deportations
and I don't want to make that sound like

899
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:05,150
it wasn't a brutal,
vicious exercise that they were doing.

900
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,720
Here we go back to the book driven
by the he always and policemen,

901
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:12,590
thousands of Jews steamed
into the marketplace, streamed
in the marketplace here.

902
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,750
They had to sit or squat
without moving or getting up.

903
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:19,410
As the hours passed on this very hot
August of the late summer heatwave,

904
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,250
many Jews

905
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,620
fainted and collapsed.
Moreover,

906
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,830
beating and shooting
continued in the marketplace,

907
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:30,750
and I don't know if I quoted this in here
or if I'll get to it, but these guys,

908
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:33,780
they, they're shooting people.
They also bring out whips,

909
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,530
so they're whipping people.
It's brutal. Back to the book.

910
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,220
One final horror was reserved
to the end for the train.

911
01:02:41,221 --> 01:02:46,221
Cars now had to be loaded while the he
wheeze and security police packed 120 to

912
01:02:46,711 --> 01:02:48,600
140 Jews into each car.

913
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:53,930
The reserve policemen stood guard and
observed as one remembered when it didn't

914
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:58,500
go well. They made use of
writing, whips and guns.

915
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,600
The loading was simply frightful.

916
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:05,490
There was an unearthly cry from these
poor people because 10 or 20 cars were

917
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:10,320
being loaded simultaneously. The entire
freight train was dreadfully long.

918
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:12,440
One could not see all of it.

919
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,530
It may have been 50 to 60 cars,
if not more.

920
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:21,780
And after a car was loaded,
the doors were closed and nailed shut.

921
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:24,960
Once all the cars were sealed,

922
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:30,230
the men of reserved police
battalion one-on-one quickly
departed without waiting

923
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:32,100
to see the train pull away.

924
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:41,790
These guys did their little part of the
job and they're gonna walk away now.

925
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:47,430
But
yeah,

926
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:52,680
it's, it's an, again,
it's a nightmare scenario.

927
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:54,990
Continuing on.

928
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:59,520
Shortly before the deportation program
resumed in northern security zone reserve

929
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:03,330
police battalion one-on-one was
involved in several more mass shootings.

930
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:09,990
So there's a couple of times that they
don't get the help that they had before

931
01:04:09,991 --> 01:04:12,870
going back to the book without
the experience to help of the,

932
01:04:12,871 --> 01:04:15,140
he always will haul off,

933
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:19,170
organize the executions
along the lines of Yosef,

934
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:24,171
of of the Osa folks shooting the groups
of 20 to 30 Jews which had been marched

935
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:25,111
out of town.

936
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:29,030
It's succession to gravel pits were turned
over to an equal number of Peter's in

937
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,380
year x commandos.
Thus,

938
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:36,420
each policemen once again faced the
individual Jew he was going to shoot.

939
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:42,780
The Jews were not forced to undress,
nor was there a collection of valuables.

940
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,080
There was also no selection for Labor.
All the Jews,

941
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,750
regardless of age and sex were to be shot.

942
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,040
So you know,

943
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:56,430
in the earlier ones they were stripping
him down and collecting their valuables

944
01:04:56,431 --> 01:04:57,151
and not even doing that.

945
01:04:57,151 --> 01:05:00,300
And I bet they're not doing
that because when you do that,

946
01:05:00,301 --> 01:05:02,340
you're getting some kind of interaction.

947
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,970
You're seeing their personal items
and they didn't want any of that.

948
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:09,870
Just take them out and shoot him.
Easiest psychological way to do it.

949
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:11,641
Back to the book.

950
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:15,630
The policemen and the shooting commandos
marched their juice to the crest of one

951
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:18,880
of the mountains of waste material.
The area of the gravel pits,

952
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:24,580
the victims were lined up facing a six
foot drop from a short distance behind

953
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:27,790
the policemen fired on order
into the next of the Jews.

954
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:32,710
The body's tumbled over the
edge following each round.

955
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:37,690
The next group of Jews was brought up to
the same spot and thus had to look down

956
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:42,810
at the growing pile of corpses of their
family and friends before they were shot

957
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:44,913
in turn.

958
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:50,440
Only after a number of rounds
did the shooters change sites.

959
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:58,483
Okay.

960
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:06,600
All right. Here's some more
deportation operations.

961
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,660
They're back to doing
deportations back to the book,

962
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:14,160
but even the most unfettered violence
could not overcome the shortage of train

963
01:06:14,161 --> 01:06:18,720
cars and when the doors were
finally forced, shot about 150 Jews,

964
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:23,190
mostly women and children,
but also some men remained made.

965
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:28,470
This was that same lieutenant sadist
summon Drucker and told him to take these

966
01:06:28,471 --> 01:06:31,980
Jews to the cemetery.
At the cemetery entrance.

967
01:06:31,981 --> 01:06:36,981
The policemen chased away the eager
spectators and waited until first Sergeant

968
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:40,500
Austin arrived in a truck with a
supply of vodka for the shooters.

969
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:47,560
Oschman turn to one of his men who had
hitherto avoided shooting and chided him

970
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,780
drink up.
Now Pfeiffer,

971
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:58,700
you're in fort this time because
the Judases must be shot.

972
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:02,660
You've gotten yourself out of it so far,
but now you must go to it.

973
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:08,640
An execution squad of about 20
men were sent into the cemetery.

974
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:14,840
The Jews were brought in groups of 20
men first and then women and children.

975
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:21,850
They were first to lie down
near the cemetery wall and
then shot from behind the

976
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:22,684
neck.

977
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:29,240
Each policemen fired seven or
eight times at the cemetery gate,

978
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,180
one do spring at Drucker with a syringe,
but was quickly subdued.

979
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:37,850
The other Jews sat quietly
awaiting their fate.

980
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,860
Even after the shooting began.

981
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:45,560
They were quite emaciated and
looked half starved to death.

982
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,910
One guard remembered.

983
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,253
Okay,

984
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:01,920
the it, it's, it's covered in here.

985
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:06,720
Not In the kind of detail
we should cover it, but

986
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,010
you know, these Jews that
were now getting rounded up,

987
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:14,430
they were already in most of the,
well in some of the case in the book,

988
01:08:14,431 --> 01:08:16,100
they were in these

989
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:21,100
ghettos, Jewish ghettos, like they had
been forced into these ghettos there.

990
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:25,490
Now just living, they're
starving, but they're living and,

991
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:29,990
and then the Germans didn't, no
more Jews. They want of the areas,

992
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:35,330
I think the word was Juden free was like
free of Jews. So now even these people,

993
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:39,530
and by the way, there were some, some of
the Germans that complained like, Hey,

994
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:42,530
those are my laborers. You can't come
my laborers now we're killing everyone.

995
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:45,770
So even again,

996
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:49,370
it's not like this is
an enemy with a threat.

997
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:53,360
These people were now completely
subdued living in these,

998
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,780
in these call them guest ghettos.
They're like prison ghettos.

999
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:01,160
They're living in there. They've no
fret to anybody, but they round them up,

1000
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:05,090
take them out and kill them.
Now,

1001
01:09:05,091 --> 01:09:07,340
one of the interesting points
that they bring up in the book,

1002
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:09,680
and I want to cover the whole thing,
but it's worth mentioning,

1003
01:09:09,681 --> 01:09:13,430
is that this Guy Hoffman, one of the,
well it can, one of the captains,

1004
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:19,420
he has this strange stomach illness
like he gets upset to his stomach,

1005
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,710
so here we go.

1006
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:28,280
He misses some of the actions,

1007
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:31,760
or at least he's not their president
where the executions are taking place and

1008
01:09:31,761 --> 01:09:36,761
whatnot and it just painted a picture
of the kind of leader that he is.

1009
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,260
So going back to the book uniformly,

1010
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,610
Hoffman's men offered a
different perspective,
meaning it's not just like Yo,

1011
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:47,270
he's sick to his stomach and blah,
blah blah. By their UBS observation,

1012
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:49,700
his alleged bouts of stomach cramps,

1013
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:54,850
confining him safely to bed coincided
all to consistently with company actions

1014
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:58,190
that might involve either
unpleasantness or danger.

1015
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:03,290
It became common for the men to predict
upon hearing the night before a pending

1016
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:07,340
action that the company chief
would be bedridden in the morning.

1017
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:13,430
Hoffman's behavior rankled as men even
more because of too aggravating factors.

1018
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:17,090
First, he'd always been
strict and on approachable.

1019
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:22,300
A typical base officer who liked his
white collar and gloves wore is ss in

1020
01:10:23,481 --> 01:10:27,610
Sydney on his uniform and demanded
considerable difference. So that's,

1021
01:10:27,611 --> 01:10:29,000
that's the one thing
you heard about the guy.

1022
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:34,510
This is just paint the worst picture
of just such a horrible human being.

1023
01:10:36,141 --> 01:10:40,370
He loves wearing his rank. He loves
being the guy, a base officer.

1024
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:45,170
Now there's, there's a, a
term for that. They have,

1025
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,930
I think we made up in the,
not we,

1026
01:10:47,931 --> 01:10:52,931
but the US current war
fighting soldiers and marines.

1027
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,260
It's a far bit Bob Fob.

1028
01:10:56,410 --> 01:11:00,630
So you get something called a forward
operating base overseas and the forwarding

1029
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:03,680
on an operating basis can actually be,
you know, they're pretty nice there.

1030
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:06,080
They're relatively secure.

1031
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:11,560
And so the fob it right is the leader
that just wants to stay on the fob.

1032
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,010
They didn't want to go out.

1033
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,090
So this guys, but of course the fob,
it's always running around, you know,

1034
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,200
wanting to be respected and demanding,
respect,

1035
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:26,880
demanding deference of this guy's
a far bit. The other thing is,

1036
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:31,881
and this is very typical of this kind
of wretched human back to the book.

1037
01:11:32,761 --> 01:11:37,761
Second Hoffman tried to compensate for
his immobility by intensified supervision

1038
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:41,700
of his subordinates, so
he's not around, but he's,

1039
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:46,380
he's going to be more of a jerk and impose
himself more onto the, onto the men.

1040
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,190
Now they're continuing with a another,

1041
01:11:55,530 --> 01:12:00,090
another ghetto that had to be
cleared back to the book. By October,

1042
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:04,740
the order was for real placards announced
that all Jews who did not go to the

1043
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:06,090
ghettos would be shot.

1044
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:10,830
The shooting order was made
part of regular company
instructions to the men and

1045
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:13,800
given repeatedly, especially
before they were sent on patrol.

1046
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:19,080
No one could be left in any doubt that
not a single Jew was to remain alive in

1047
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:22,620
the battalion security zone.
In official jargon,

1048
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:27,860
the battalion made forest patrols for
suspects as the surviving Jews were to be

1049
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:32,520
tracked down and shot like animals.
However,

1050
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:37,290
the men of reserved police battalion
one-on-one unofficially dub this phase of

1051
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:40,890
the final solution.
The Jew hunt

1052
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:44,970
that you hunt took many forms,

1053
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:49,920
most spectacular or two battalion sweeps

1054
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:57,080
and here's some George Leffler of
third company talking about that.

1055
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:59,550
What those sweeps were
like back to the book.

1056
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,850
We were told that there were
many Jews hiding in the forest.

1057
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:06,540
We therefore searched through
the woods and a skirmish line,

1058
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:10,530
but we could find nothing because
the Jews were obviously well hidden.

1059
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,020
We combed the woods the second time.

1060
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:18,080
Only then could we discover individual
chimney pipe sticking out of the earth.

1061
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:22,710
We discovered that Jews had hidden
themselves in underground bunkers.

1062
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:27,330
Here they were hauled out
with some resistance and
only one monk or some of the

1063
01:13:27,331 --> 01:13:30,360
comrades climbed down into this
bunker and hauled the Jews out.

1064
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:32,790
The Jews were then shot on the spot.

1065
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:37,710
The Jews had to lie face down on the
ground and were killed by a neck shot.

1066
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:41,940
Who is in the firing squad?
I don't remember.

1067
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:47,660
I think it was simply a case where the
men standing nearby were ordered to shoot

1068
01:13:48,151 --> 01:13:48,984
them.

1069
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:53,610
Some 50 Jews were shot including men
and women of all ages because entire

1070
01:13:53,611 --> 01:13:55,320
families that hidden themselves,
they're

1071
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:59,730
shooting took place quite publicly.

1072
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:04,940
No cordon was formed at all for a
number of polls from [inaudible].

1073
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,370
We're standing directly
by the shooting site.

1074
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,950
They were then ordered
presumably by Hoffman

1075
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:16,240
to bury the Jews who had been
shot in a half to finish bunker.

1076
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,830
So again,

1077
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:23,650
you've got some of the Jews
had been consolidated in
these ghettos and now there

1078
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:26,400
anyone that's not any Jew, that's not
the ghetto, they're out hunting them.

1079
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:28,350
Here's another version of it.

1080
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:32,850
In cases where the farm yard and the
Jewish lodgings could be reached quickly,

1081
01:14:32,851 --> 01:14:35,910
I drove into the farm yard at high
speed and the police spring out in

1082
01:14:35,911 --> 01:14:39,300
immediately rushed to the Jewish
lodgings than all the Jews.

1083
01:14:39,301 --> 01:14:43,590
President at the time were driven out
and shot in the farm yard near a haystack

1084
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,510
potato pit or dung heap.

1085
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:50,760
The victims were almost always naked and
were shot in the neck where while lying

1086
01:14:50,761 --> 01:14:51,594
on the ground,

1087
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:52,893
okay,

1088
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,200
now,
even as this was taking place,

1089
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:06,400
there's still people that are
trying to avoid the shooting.

1090
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,421
Back to the book,

1091
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:12,421
the tactic of keeping one's distance
was invoked by Heinrich Feucht

1092
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:19,470
to explain how he avoided shooting on all,
but one occasion.

1093
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:23,190
One always had a certain freedom
of movement of a few meters.

1094
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:27,360
And from experience I noticed very quickly
that the platoon leader almost always

1095
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:30,460
chose the people standing next to him.
I,

1096
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:34,020
those always attempted to take position
as far as possible from the center of

1097
01:15:34,021 --> 01:15:34,854
events.

1098
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,960
Others likewise sought to avoid
shooting by staying in the background.

1099
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:46,840
So there's still guys that are not,
no,

1100
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:47,351
they're trying,

1101
01:15:47,351 --> 01:15:50,560
they're doing their best
not to participate again or
they do anything to stop it.

1102
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:55,360
No, but this, this was a
great kind of a wrap on the,

1103
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:59,710
on the g one and what this was like
back to the book that you hunt was not a

1104
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:00,880
brief episode.

1105
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:06,750
It was a tenacious remorseless ongoing
campaign in which the hunters tracked

1106
01:16:07,571 --> 01:16:11,740
down and killed their prey in
direct and personal confrontation.

1107
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,830
There was not a passing phase,

1108
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:20,050
but an existential condition of constant
readiness and intention to kill every

1109
01:16:20,051 --> 01:16:22,000
last Jew who could be found.

1110
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:33,870
Now we're good to cover this last
massacre

1111
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:40,500
that took place.
And Jews had been sent

1112
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:47,150
from a two to a prison camp to be
executed and and they were rounded up,

1113
01:16:47,941 --> 01:16:51,150
I think it was a place
called the lake lay back and

1114
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:58,170
they were sent to be executed and the
police battalion is now acting as kind of

1115
01:16:58,171 --> 01:17:01,070
guards and accessories to this too,

1116
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:03,690
to make sure that the executions,

1117
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:06,900
these mass executions
take place correctly.

1118
01:17:06,901 --> 01:17:10,280
Going back to the book as
the pass between the chain

1119
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:15,280
of reserve policemen into the camp music
blared from two loudspeaker trucks,

1120
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:19,730
despite the attempt to
drown out other noise,

1121
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,700
the sound of steady gunfire
could be heard from the camp.

1122
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:28,820
The Jews were taken to the last row
of barracks where they undressed arms

1123
01:17:28,821 --> 01:17:32,840
raised, hands clasped behind
their next totally naked.

1124
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:37,370
They were led in groups from the barracks
through a hole cut in the fence to the

1125
01:17:37,371 --> 01:17:39,470
trenches that had been
dug behind the camp.

1126
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:45,160
This route was guarded by men from the
Reserve Police Battalion one-on-one

1127
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,220
stationed only 10 meters from the graves.

1128
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:54,700
Heinrich Boll cult of first company
witnessed the killing procedure quote.

1129
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:56,750
From my position.

1130
01:17:56,810 --> 01:18:01,340
I could now observe how the Jews were
driven naked from the barracks by other

1131
01:18:01,341 --> 01:18:02,660
members of our battalion.

1132
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:08,810
The shooters of the execution commandos
who sat on the edge of the graves

1133
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:13,811
directly in front of me were members of
the SD and the SSD is like the SS Intel

1134
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:17,533
Intelligence Group.
The SD,

1135
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:23,210
some distance behind each shooter stood
several other SD men who constantly kept

1136
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:27,650
the magazines of the submachine guns
filled and handed them to each shooter.

1137
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,300
A number of shooters were
assigned to each grave.

1138
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:36,680
Today I can no longer provide
details about the number of graves.

1139
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:41,450
It is possible that there were many
such graves were shooting took place

1140
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:42,470
simultaneously.

1141
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:46,280
I definitely remember that the naked
Jews who are driven directly into the

1142
01:18:46,281 --> 01:18:50,540
graves and forced to lie
down quite precisely on top
of those who had been shot

1143
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:51,374
before them,

1144
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:56,540
the shooter than fired off a
burst at these prone victims.

1145
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:02,120
How long the action lasted.
I can no longer say with certainty.

1146
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:08,060
Presumably it lasted the
entire day because I remember
that I was relieved once

1147
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:09,020
from my post.

1148
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:14,360
I can give no details about
the number of victims,

1149
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,030
but there were an awful lot of them.

1150
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,330
It's it's,

1151
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:29,230
it's almost incomprehensible to imagine
that you're one of these Jews getting

1152
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:33,980
forced. You're naked. Lay
down, go into this pit,

1153
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:38,240
lay down on top of those other people
that were just shot so you can be shot to

1154
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:44,180
another witness.
Martin Detmold quote,

1155
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,940
because I was a group leader in
could move about more freely.

1156
01:19:46,941 --> 01:19:51,230
I went once directly to the execution
site and saw how the newly arriving Jews

1157
01:19:51,231 --> 01:19:53,450
had to lie down on those already shot.

1158
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,560
They were then likewise shot
with burst from submachine guns.

1159
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,320
The SD men took care of that.

1160
01:20:00,321 --> 01:20:05,210
The Jews were shot in such a way that
there were inclines in the piles of

1161
01:20:05,211 --> 01:20:09,750
corpses enabling the newcomers to lie
down on the corpses piled as much as three

1162
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:10,620
meters high.

1163
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:18,070
The whole business was the most gruesome
I have ever seen in my life because I

1164
01:20:18,071 --> 01:20:23,071
was frequently able to see that after
a burst of a burst had been fired,

1165
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:27,340
the Jews were only wounded
in those still living.

1166
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:32,490
We're more or less buried alive beneath
the corpses of those shot later without

1167
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:36,780
the wounded being given.
So called the mercy shots.

1168
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:43,460
I remember that from out
of the pile of corpses.

1169
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,520
The SS men were cursed by the wounded.

1170
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:53,283
Yeah,

1171
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,200
and that was sort of the final

1172
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:04,870
participation of one on one battalion.

1173
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:10,410
And here we get to there how it kind of
wrapped up at the conclusion of the ernt

1174
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:15,160
fest massacres.

1175
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:18,880
The district of Lublin was
for all practical purposes,

1176
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,150
Utan free free of Jews,

1177
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:27,050
the murderous participation of Reserve
Battalion Reserve Police Battalion One on

1178
01:21:27,051 --> 01:21:32,051
one in the final solution came to an end
with a conservative estimate of 6,500

1179
01:21:33,461 --> 01:21:38,461
Jewish shot during earlier actions like
those that Yosef Oaf and low Mazi and

1180
01:21:39,521 --> 01:21:44,521
1000 shot during the Jew hunts in a
minimum estimate of three thousand thirty

1181
01:21:45,490 --> 01:21:48,850
thousand five hundred juice shot
at [inaudible] and Pony Trois.

1182
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:54,690
The battalion had participated in the
direct shooting deaths of at least 38,000

1183
01:21:55,961 --> 01:21:56,794
Jews

1184
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:05,840
with the death camp deportation
of at least 3000 Jews from Mites,

1185
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:08,070
Iraq.
In early May,

1186
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:12,900
1943 the number of Jews they had
placed on trains to drew Blanka

1187
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:19,460
had risen to 45,004 battalion
of less than 500 men.

1188
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:26,470
The ultimate body count
was at least 83,000 Jews.

1189
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:36,153
Yeah,

1190
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:42,410
unbelievable.

1191
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:50,590
And here he asked the question back to
the book of why did most men and reserve

1192
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:55,591
police battalion one-on-one become killers
while only a minority of perhaps 10%

1193
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:57,970
and certainly no more than 20% did not.

1194
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:04,370
A number of explanations have been invoked
in the past to explain such behavior.

1195
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:09,130
Wartime brutalization,
racism, segmentation,

1196
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,850
and routinization of the task,

1197
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:17,880
special selection of the perpetrators
careerism obedience to orders,

1198
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:21,460
deference to authority,
ideological, Indra,

1199
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,500
indoctrination and conformity.

1200
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:27,190
These factors are applicable
in varying degrees,

1201
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:31,450
but none without qualifications or
he's trying to now figure out why these

1202
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:34,360
people did what they did.
And those,

1203
01:23:34,361 --> 01:23:39,361
that's a list of all the kinds of excuses
or reasons I should say of why these

1204
01:23:40,151 --> 01:23:41,530
men behave this way.

1205
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:48,030
Talks a little bit about
overall kind of war crimes here.

1206
01:23:48,131 --> 01:23:51,280
Back to the book, many of the
most notorious wartime atrocities,

1207
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,160
the Japanese rampage through Manila,

1208
01:23:54,161 --> 01:23:57,370
the American slaughter of prisoners and
mutilation of corpses on many of the

1209
01:23:57,371 --> 01:24:01,990
Pacific islands and the massacre at me
lie involved the kind of battlefield

1210
01:24:01,991 --> 01:24:06,991
frenzy soldiers who inert and who were
a nerd to violence numb to the taking of

1211
01:24:08,171 --> 01:24:08,950
human life.

1212
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:12,970
They embittered over their own casualties
and frustrated by the tenacity of an

1213
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:17,971
insidious and seemingly inhuman enemy
sometimes exploded and at other times

1214
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:21,910
grimly resolved to have their
revenge at first opportunity.

1215
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:25,630
So that's one type of,
for me,

1216
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:30,490
what's that called when you like
non premeditated murder, right?

1217
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,180
Like just,

1218
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:35,890
you know the guy comes home and his wife's
with some other guy and boom, he goes,

1219
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,830
he goes, battlefield frenzy.
Yeah. That's one kind.

1220
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:43,720
Now we talk about this premeditated back
to the book, other kinds of atrocity,

1221
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:48,280
lacking the immediacy of the battlefield
frenzy and fully expressing official

1222
01:24:48,281 --> 01:24:53,281
government policy decidedly
weren't standard operating
procedures firebombing of

1223
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,430
German,
Japanese cities,

1224
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:02,140
the enslavement of and murderous
maltreatment of foreign laborers in German

1225
01:25:02,141 --> 01:25:06,640
camps, in factories or
along the cm Burma Railroad,

1226
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:11,920
the reprisal shooting of a 100 civilians
for every German soldier killed by

1227
01:25:11,921 --> 01:25:15,190
partisan attack and Unical Slavia
or elsewhere in eastern Europe.

1228
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:20,290
These were not the spontaneous explosions
or cruel revenge of brutalized men,

1229
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:24,400
but the methodical executed
policies of government.

1230
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:30,580
Both kinds of atrocities occur in
the brutalizing context of war,

1231
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:35,410
but the men who carry out
atrocity by policy aren't in
a different state of mind.

1232
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:39,970
They act not out of frenzy,
bitterness and frustration,

1233
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,650
but with calculation,

1234
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:46,810
clearly the men of Reserve Police
Battalion One on one and implementing the

1235
01:25:46,811 --> 01:25:51,811
systematic Nazi policy of exterminating
European Jewry belong in the second

1236
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:53,314
category

1237
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,270
except for a few of the oldest men who
were veterans of World War One in a few

1238
01:25:58,271 --> 01:26:02,080
[inaudible] who had been transferred
from Poland to Poland from Russia.

1239
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:05,870
The men in the battalion had not seen
battle or encountered a deadly enemy.

1240
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:12,130
Most of them had not fired a shot in
anger or even been fired upon much less

1241
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:16,610
lost comrades in fighting at their side.
Voss.

1242
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:19,910
Wartime brutalization
through prior combat,

1243
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,140
was not an immediate experience directly
influencing the policemen's behavior

1244
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:28,340
add Yoseph of once the killing began.
However,

1245
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:33,110
the men became increasingly
brutalized as in combat.

1246
01:26:33,111 --> 01:26:38,111
The horrors of initial of the initial
encounter eventually became routine and

1247
01:26:38,451 --> 01:26:41,360
the killing became premise
progressively easier

1248
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:46,250
in a sense. In this sense,
brutalization was not the cause,

1249
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:50,300
but the effect of the men's behavior.
So he's kind of saying, look

1250
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:53,720
like what you said,
these guys aren't fighting an enemy.

1251
01:26:53,721 --> 01:26:55,670
They hadn't lost their buddy,
they're not revet. You know,

1252
01:26:55,671 --> 01:26:59,690
they're not avenging their buddy that got
killed next to them blown up by an IED

1253
01:26:59,691 --> 01:27:03,050
and now they're going to take it out on,
on this group that they capture.

1254
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:04,413
And I like that

1255
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:08,591
back to the book.

1256
01:27:08,591 --> 01:27:12,920
As John Dour has observed the
dehumanization of the other contributed

1257
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:17,410
immeasurably to the psychological
distancing that facilitated killing,

1258
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,380
distancing,
not frenzy.

1259
01:27:20,381 --> 01:27:23,740
And brutalization is one of the keys to
the behavior of the reserve position.

1260
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:24,603
Police Battalion,

1261
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:29,610
one-on-one war and negative racial
stereotyping or to mutually reinforcing

1262
01:27:30,491 --> 01:27:34,030
factors in this distancing.
So in order to kill these people,

1263
01:27:34,031 --> 01:27:37,540
you've got to distance yourself from them.
You can't, you can't see them as human.

1264
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:38,770
You can't see them as people.

1265
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,910
Many scholars of the Holocaust,
especially Raul Hilberg,

1266
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:49,770
have emphasized the bureaucratic and
administrative aspects of the destruction

1267
01:27:49,771 --> 01:27:52,230
process.
This is very interesting.

1268
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,800
This approach emphasizes the degree to
which modern bureaucratic life fosters a

1269
01:27:57,991 --> 01:28:02,490
functional and physical distancing in
the same way that war and negative racial

1270
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:06,510
stereotype promote a psychological
distancing between perpetrator and victim.

1271
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:11,750
So you formed this bureaucratic machine
that you're only a little piece of it.

1272
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,170
Your all you're doing
is collecting people.

1273
01:28:15,171 --> 01:28:18,270
Are you doing just putting me on trains?
You're not killing anybody. Yeah, you're,

1274
01:28:18,271 --> 01:28:19,320
all you're doing is rounding them up.

1275
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:21,840
All you're doing is guarding as
they're getting pushed down to the,

1276
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:26,130
into the graves. That's
not you. Yeah. It's a big
bureaucratic machine. You're not,

1277
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:29,970
you're just a little piece of
it. Back to the book. Indeed.

1278
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:34,170
Many of the perpetrators of the Holocaust
were so called desk murderers who's

1279
01:28:34,171 --> 01:28:34,651
rolled in.

1280
01:28:34,651 --> 01:28:38,490
The mass extermination was greatly
facilitated by the bureaucratic nature of

1281
01:28:38,491 --> 01:28:39,480
their participation.

1282
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:43,980
Their drops frequently consistent of
tiny steps in the overall killing process

1283
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:46,290
and they performed them in routine manner,

1284
01:28:46,291 --> 01:28:51,291
never seeing the victims at their
actions affected segmented routine,

1285
01:28:52,951 --> 01:28:57,210
ISED and depersonalized the
job of the bureaucratic,

1286
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:59,460
the bureaucratic or specialist,

1287
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:04,080
whether it involved confiscating
scheduling trains, drafting legislation,

1288
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:08,820
sending telegrams are compiling less
lists could be performed without

1289
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:11,610
confronting them.
Reality of mass murder.

1290
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:17,250
Such a luxury of course was not enjoyed
by the men of reserve police battalion,

1291
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:21,030
one o one who were quite literally
saturated in the blood of victim shot at

1292
01:29:21,031 --> 01:29:22,170
point blank range.

1293
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:26,850
No one confronted the reality of mass
murder more directly than the men in the

1294
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:31,590
woods of Yosef of segmentation
and routinization.

1295
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:36,000
The depersonalizing aspects
of the bureau bureaucratic,

1296
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:42,000
the bureaucratic caused killing cannot
explain the battalions initial behavior

1297
01:29:42,631 --> 01:29:45,570
there. So again, he's saying,
look, that makes sense.

1298
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,850
You turn this into a
big bureaucratic thing,

1299
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:49,590
but that's not what happened
here with these guys.

1300
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:55,500
The facilitating psychological effect
of a division of labor for the killing

1301
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:58,230
process was not totally negligible.
However.

1302
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:03,440
So then he talks about the fact that
they did make those adjustments and take

1303
01:30:03,871 --> 01:30:05,610
the killing out of their hands somewhat

1304
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:12,330
and that did make it easier for
them. Now he talks about, you know,

1305
01:30:12,331 --> 01:30:14,310
one of the things that he mentioned
early on and why this happened.

1306
01:30:14,311 --> 01:30:17,010
He talks about the special
selection of the right people.

1307
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:23,010
Well that doesn't really hold true either
because here we go back to the book.

1308
01:30:23,011 --> 01:30:27,210
The case for special selection of officers
is even more difficult to make by SS

1309
01:30:27,211 --> 01:30:29,700
standards.
Major trap was a patriotic German,

1310
01:30:29,701 --> 01:30:34,701
but traditionally and overly sentimental
what and not Nazi Germany was

1311
01:30:35,071 --> 01:30:38,640
scornfully considered
both weak and reactionary.

1312
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,200
So you can't say it was
the selection of people.

1313
01:30:43,201 --> 01:30:46,200
And we already talked about all the
different types of normal people that were

1314
01:30:46,201 --> 01:30:47,340
doing this. They, they didn't,

1315
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,190
they didn't pull some truck driver
in Hamburg out and said this,

1316
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:54,040
that's 38 years old and say this guy's
going to be the perfect Miletich.

1317
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:58,080
They didn't do that.
Back to the book reserve.

1318
01:30:58,081 --> 01:31:03,081
Police battalion was not sent to Lublin
to murder Jews because it was composed

1319
01:31:03,271 --> 01:31:07,230
of men specifically selected or dean
particularly suited for the task.

1320
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:08,723
On the contrary,

1321
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:12,930
the battalion was the dregs
of the manpower pool available
at that stage of war.

1322
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:17,550
It was employed to kill Jews because it
was the only kind of unit available for

1323
01:31:17,551 --> 01:31:19,260
such behind the line duties.

1324
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:24,750
Many studies of Nazi killer suggested
a different kind of selection,

1325
01:31:24,751 --> 01:31:29,751
namely self selection to the party and
the ss by an usually violence prone

1326
01:31:30,301 --> 01:31:34,140
people.
Shortly after the war,

1327
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:39,200
Theodore Adorno and many others and
others developed the notion that there's

1328
01:31:39,571 --> 01:31:42,810
the, uh, an authority
authoritarian personality.

1329
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:48,090
So they started looking at the,
there's certain people that have that,

1330
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:52,350
that are susceptible to having
this type of personality.

1331
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:57,690
They made up something called the f scale,
which is,

1332
01:31:57,750 --> 01:32:00,550
is like your propensity
to have a authoritarian

1333
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:04,900
personality.
Here's some of the ingredients there.

1334
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:08,820
Back to book of rigid adherence
to conventional values.

1335
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:12,990
Submissiveness to authoritary
the to authority figures,

1336
01:32:13,230 --> 01:32:17,400
aggressiveness toward outgroups,
opposition to introspection,

1337
01:32:17,401 --> 01:32:21,870
reflection and creativity. A tendency
to superstition in stereotyping,

1338
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:25,200
preoccupation with power and toughness.

1339
01:32:25,830 --> 01:32:27,540
Destructiveness and cynicism.

1340
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:32,350
So these are the kinds of things that
they're saying that these types of

1341
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:37,210
personalities would become Nazis because
that's the type of personality they

1342
01:32:37,211 --> 01:32:38,044
have.

1343
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:43,870
There's another kind of kind of to
make this as simple as possible.

1344
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:48,430
A guy named Zygmunt Bauman has summed
up the, this approach as follows.

1345
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:53,290
Nazi-Ism was cruel because Nazis were
cruel and the Nazis were cruel because

1346
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:56,950
crew people tended to become Nazis.
Again,

1347
01:32:56,951 --> 01:33:01,951
these are theories but I don't think you
can apply that to a truck driver from

1348
01:33:02,021 --> 01:33:05,380
Hamburg that got row that got drafted.

1349
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:08,890
They didn't even sell self select for
they got drafted. Yup. Told, okay,

1350
01:33:08,891 --> 01:33:12,550
you need to be in the, in the army here.
Yeah, we're in the police battalion.

1351
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:17,020
It's almost like, it's
not necessarily, you know,

1352
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:22,090
a person being a truck driver
is like, uh, you know this,

1353
01:33:22,091 --> 01:33:24,730
this exclusionary occupation.

1354
01:33:24,731 --> 01:33:28,600
It's more like just cause they're a truck
driver. It just doesn't mean anything.

1355
01:33:28,601 --> 01:33:32,080
It's like that's not enough factor. The
truck driver. Now anything with Eddie,

1356
01:33:32,170 --> 01:33:33,640
when they talked about all
these people from Hamburg,

1357
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:36,100
anything that they talked about,
none of those.

1358
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:40,090
It's not like we got a
bunch of guys that were uh,

1359
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:43,420
that worked at a slaughter
house. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1360
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:45,760
We're going to recruit all these
people from a slaughterhouse. No,

1361
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:49,970
we didn't recruit hunters. We didn't
know. They didn't recruit, um,

1362
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:54,010
football players because
they're aggressive. No, just
rate. It was just random.

1363
01:33:54,011 --> 01:33:55,720
Any job.
And they showed up there.

1364
01:33:55,900 --> 01:34:00,070
So we know basically what I'm getting
out of this is he saying like, no,

1365
01:34:00,071 --> 01:34:02,440
it's like you can't really
say it's that either. Right?

1366
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:04,630
Because it's just a
waiter in a salesperson.

1367
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:09,400
But at the same time the guy who is a
waiter could have these other qualities,

1368
01:34:09,401 --> 01:34:10,990
you know, like how you're talking. Yeah.

1369
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:14,680
But you take 500 people from Hamburg
between the ages of 35 and 40.

1370
01:34:14,681 --> 01:34:15,730
You're not going to find that.

1371
01:34:15,731 --> 01:34:20,731
It's like all these guys had those kind
of fascist qualities boundman right.

1372
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:23,080
Not Happening. Yeah, man. That's great.

1373
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:31,680
Some people become,
this is Eric or sorry.

1374
01:34:31,770 --> 01:34:35,820
Evan Staab accepts the notion that some
people become perpetrators as a result

1375
01:34:35,821 --> 01:34:36,750
of their personality.

1376
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:41,900
They are self selected and he says
that under particular circumstances,

1377
01:34:43,351 --> 01:34:47,100
most people have a capacity for extreme
violence and the destruction of human

1378
01:34:47,101 --> 01:34:49,890
life.
It's an interesting one.

1379
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:54,240
Under certain circumstances,
everyone has a propensity for violence.

1380
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:59,750
I'm sure there's that would argue that in
all different directions. But you know,

1381
01:34:59,751 --> 01:35:00,584
you take a

1382
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:06,590
a middle aged woman that's never been
in a fistfight before and you have

1383
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:11,000
somebody attack her child that's going
to kill or harm their child and they can

1384
01:35:11,001 --> 01:35:14,370
see it propensity for violence and
from a lot of them. Yeah, yeah.

1385
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,860
Maybe even a v You know what?
99%,

1386
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:25,860
I'm going to say 99% I'll go with
that too. Yeah. Yeah. 99% if you're,

1387
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:30,950
if it's a middle aged woman who has
someone that's about to severely hurt or

1388
01:35:31,531 --> 01:35:35,280
kill their child and their way to
stop it is with a pistol. Right.

1389
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:39,600
My assessment is we're going to 99%.

1390
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:44,570
Yeah. Of that perpetrators
getting guild like with,

1391
01:35:44,571 --> 01:35:47,600
with um,
specific

1392
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:54,260
effort towards like the violent part of
it. You know, like, um, you know, I don't,

1393
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:58,190
I'm not saying not a movie necessarily,
but you know, that'll think,

1394
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:02,660
well let's say imagine a scenario like
that where the lady's gonna shoot this

1395
01:36:02,661 --> 01:36:05,900
guy because the guy is attacking the
kid or something. It won't be like, Oh,

1396
01:36:05,901 --> 01:36:08,540
let me do the bare minimum force,
you know,

1397
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:11,300
dish to eliminate the threat.

1398
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:16,250
She's probably going to be kind of shows
the overboard killing that guy going to

1399
01:36:16,251 --> 01:36:17,930
kill him extra. Yeah. Yeah.

1400
01:36:17,931 --> 01:36:20,510
Because that's kind of the
violence coming out of someone.

1401
01:36:20,511 --> 01:36:22,550
It's one thing to do it because
I'm scared and oh my gosh,

1402
01:36:22,551 --> 01:36:26,450
get away from me kind of thing.
That's not violence. Yeah. So it's,

1403
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:29,180
that's really the question when you
consider a million middle aged girl,

1404
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:30,463
you know?

1405
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:34,050
Yeah. Having a propensity provider, I
don't think she's going to do extra.

1406
01:36:34,051 --> 01:36:37,200
I think she's going to kill him and go
and go grab her kid and make sure a kid

1407
01:36:37,201 --> 01:36:41,850
safe. Right. I don't see
this extra level, you know,

1408
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:44,520
desecration of the body or anything
like that. I just say, Hey,

1409
01:36:44,521 --> 01:36:46,580
I'm going to say make my kids safe.
Yeah.

1410
01:36:46,581 --> 01:36:51,210
So you're saying the propensity for
violence in that case is just the mere act

1411
01:36:51,211 --> 01:36:54,750
of killing the guy. Yeah. Well
yeah, that's that's, that's it.

1412
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:57,650
Yeah. You know, like

1413
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:00,950
I'm thinking of a movie,

1414
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:04,010
whatever reason, cause that's all,
that's all your brain is filled with

1415
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:09,800
television in general. But you
know, the girl, she's like scared.

1416
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:12,410
It's all done out of
fear, you know? And sure.

1417
01:37:12,411 --> 01:37:14,270
It's almost like the violence
is just happenstance.

1418
01:37:14,271 --> 01:37:17,090
It's not her propensity for violence
necessarily, but it's just the money.

1419
01:37:17,091 --> 01:37:19,940
But I'm just saying if you
set up an experiment yes.

1420
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:24,680
Where you took a middle aged
group of women had children. Yeah.

1421
01:37:24,681 --> 01:37:28,940
Like when you put them in a scenario
where, you know, w was either the,

1422
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:33,620
either the kid dies or they
kill the perpetrator. Right.
You know, not like a, hey,

1423
01:37:33,621 --> 01:37:37,430
I might be able to debate them out of it.
Know that the ax is in the air.

1424
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:39,790
It's going to be swung down
on the kid. Right, right.

1425
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:43,090
You have to press this button to go
to kill that guy. We're violence.

1426
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:46,850
Violence is a choice. Yeah. I think
the prevents that. He's going to be 99,

1427
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:48,580
and yeah, I'm going to
go even higher. Agree.

1428
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:54,140
So this then he gets into,
um,

1429
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:58,470
some of these real experiments,
kind of sociological experiments.

1430
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:04,110
One of them is the Zimbardo's
Stanford prison experiment.

1431
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,130
I'm sure you've heard of that.

1432
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:09,960
Everyone's heard of that
where they basically take
people and divide them up and

1433
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:10,711
just randomly,

1434
01:38:10,711 --> 01:38:14,280
and actually I didn't know this cause I
never did any deep research on the study,

1435
01:38:14,281 --> 01:38:19,281
but they kind of do a prescreening
to make sure that there's no extreme

1436
01:38:19,921 --> 01:38:23,820
personalities. Everyone that
everyone knows. Like, I mean
what, however you could,

1437
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:25,380
you could frame the word normal.

1438
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,500
The people that participate in the
experiment or just like normal people,

1439
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:30,120
they didn't have any
extreme personalities.

1440
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:35,340
Well those kind of semi normal people,
they put them in that prison experiment.

1441
01:38:35,550 --> 01:38:38,970
And sure enough,
some people were made guards,

1442
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,450
some people were made prisoners and they
had to get him to do certain things.

1443
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:45,990
And there's a certain number.
I mean it didn't take long for the guards.

1444
01:38:45,991 --> 01:38:50,310
I think it took six days. Some of
the guards turn sadistic evil. Right?

1445
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:54,870
Uh, and here we go back to the book most
dramatic and distressing to us was the

1446
01:38:54,871 --> 01:38:59,100
observation of the ease with which
sadistic behavior could be elicited in

1447
01:38:59,101 --> 01:39:01,530
individuals who are not sadistic types.

1448
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,950
The prison situation alone,

1449
01:39:05,130 --> 01:39:10,130
Zimbardo concluded was a sufficient
condition to produce apparent antisocial

1450
01:39:11,701 --> 01:39:15,690
behavior.
That's from the gardens from the guards.

1451
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:20,870
So this is pretty scary that another fact
here pointed out about that only to I

1452
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:27,220
less than 20% emerged as good guards who
did not punish prisoners even as they

1453
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,850
end even did small favor from.

1454
01:39:29,010 --> 01:39:33,390
So those numbers are pretty in line with
this really small percentage of people

1455
01:39:33,391 --> 01:39:36,000
that just, they're just
good people, right?

1456
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:39,900
It's only 10 to 20% of actual good people.

1457
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:42,480
How's that make you feel about
the human race and not real good?

1458
01:39:44,850 --> 01:39:47,980
Not real good.
All right.

1459
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:54,150
Another thing put out here, back to the
book, among the perpetrators, of course,

1460
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:59,400
orders have traditionally been most
frequently cited explanation for their own

1461
01:39:59,401 --> 01:40:01,080
behavior. So remember orders, orders,

1462
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:05,790
orders were orders and no one in such
a political climate could be expected.

1463
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:09,630
Disobey them. They insisted this is
the, this is the guards. I mean, sorry,

1464
01:40:09,631 --> 01:40:11,550
this is the the police to
battalion saying, look,

1465
01:40:11,551 --> 01:40:13,350
we're getting order to do the stuff
we were just following orders.

1466
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:14,700
We hear that all the time.

1467
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:21,020
Disobedience surely meant
the concentration camp if
not immediate execution

1468
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:25,160
possibly for their families as well.
So they're saying, look, if we would,

1469
01:40:25,161 --> 01:40:27,570
we would ended up in the concentration
camps ourselves if this didn't happen.

1470
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,930
Now he pointed this out back to the book.

1471
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:33,870
There is a general problem
with this explanation. However,

1472
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:36,390
quite simply in the past 45 years,

1473
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:41,510
no defense attorney or defendant in any
of the hundreds of postwar trials has

1474
01:40:41,521 --> 01:40:46,521
been able to document a single case in
which refusal to obey an order to kill on

1475
01:40:47,281 --> 01:40:52,281
armed civilians resulted in the
allegedly inevitable Dyer punishment.

1476
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,290
So no precedent for that. Now I, I,

1477
01:40:57,410 --> 01:41:02,410
I don't think that these guys out there
in the battalion are sitting there

1478
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:06,000
thinking about this with like legal
perspectives. So actually there,

1479
01:41:06,001 --> 01:41:07,810
there's no precedent for,
you know,

1480
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:10,120
punishment being carried out
on people that have been on.

1481
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:11,830
I think that's a stretch.

1482
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:15,040
I think that's a stretch when you're
talking about like maybe someone

1483
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:20,260
contemplating using these guys that
were saying I couldn't refuse the orders

1484
01:41:20,261 --> 01:41:21,160
cause I would get punished.

1485
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:26,430
And he's saying that there's no precedent
that you actually will get the severe

1486
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:29,150
punishment.
But how has the,

1487
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:32,620
you know when someone out in the
field going to know that that's a,

1488
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:36,810
that's a precedent. You don't,
you just think I don't want
to get in trouble. Yeah.

1489
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:41,110
You're not thinking about the time you
remember the guy that you've heard of

1490
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:44,200
getting killed. Yeah. You're not
thinking of that. You're thinking about,

1491
01:41:44,201 --> 01:41:47,320
you're not even more so you're not
thinking about the fact that you've never

1492
01:41:47,321 --> 01:41:51,820
heard of that before.
[inaudible] all right. Now,

1493
01:41:51,821 --> 01:41:54,310
so we're talking about obedience of
orders and here we go back to the book.

1494
01:41:54,311 --> 01:41:58,480
A full obedience to orders out of
fear of dire punishment is not a valid

1495
01:41:58,481 --> 01:41:59,051
explanation.

1496
01:41:59,051 --> 01:42:04,051
What about obedience to authority in
the more general sense used by Stanley

1497
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:09,970
Milgrim deference simply as a product
of socialization and evolution,

1498
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:15,360
a deeply ingrained behavior tendency
to comply with the directives of those

1499
01:42:15,521 --> 01:42:18,460
positioned hierarchically above them.

1500
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:24,360
Even to the point of performing repugnant
actions in violation of universally

1501
01:42:24,371 --> 01:42:28,990
accepted moral norms. So you've
heard of the Milgram experiments?

1502
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:33,160
No. No, these are, these are kind of
like the Stanford prison, pretty famous.

1503
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:37,420
And what he did was he set up
these experiments where he had,

1504
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:41,470
you could see these
actors were behind a wall,

1505
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:46,060
but they were getting asked questions.
And the the,

1506
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:47,680
if they answered the question wrong,

1507
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:51,310
they would get a little electric shock
that was done by the person that was

1508
01:42:51,311 --> 01:42:55,570
being experimented on. So, you know,
I would be, they'd say, okay Jocko,

1509
01:42:55,571 --> 01:42:57,270
you've got this guy, his name
is echo, he's over there.

1510
01:42:57,271 --> 01:42:59,410
We're going to ask them a question.
If he gets it wrong,

1511
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:03,190
you hit him with the shock. I
can't see you, but I can hear you.

1512
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:07,810
So when I shock you and,
and every question that you get wrong,

1513
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,690
I have to escalate the level of shock.

1514
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:12,670
So it's getting worse and
worse and worse and worse.

1515
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:16,420
And your reaction is more and more
horrific as these things escalate.

1516
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:19,890
But you're the guy, the experiment,
the experiment is on me. No,

1517
01:43:19,891 --> 01:43:22,870
you're just knocked it. There's no
ratchet, we'll shock. Okay, Gotcha. So,

1518
01:43:22,871 --> 01:43:27,871
and you're actually going through
a series of complaints and I'll,

1519
01:43:28,341 --> 01:43:29,320
I'll,
I'll read this here.

1520
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:34,570
There was an escalating series of fake
electric shocks upon a Vic act or victim

1521
01:43:34,571 --> 01:43:38,530
who responded with carefully programmed
voice feedback on escalating series of

1522
01:43:38,531 --> 01:43:41,920
complaints, cries of pain, call for help.

1523
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:44,980
And finally,
fateful silence.

1524
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:47,830
In the standard voice feedback experiment,

1525
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:52,880
two thirds of Milgram's subjects were
obedient to the point of inflicting

1526
01:43:52,881 --> 01:43:54,410
extreme pain.

1527
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:59,540
Several variations on the experiment
produce significantly different results.

1528
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:04,520
If the actor slash victim was shielded
so that this subject could hear and see

1529
01:44:04,521 --> 01:44:07,340
no response.
Obedience Muslim was much greater.

1530
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:10,610
So if I couldn't hear you and I just
knew that I was shocking the hell out of

1531
01:44:10,611 --> 01:44:11,840
you,
I was good with it.

1532
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:15,950
If the subject had both
visual and voice feedback,

1533
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,980
compliance fell to the
compliance to the extreme,

1534
01:44:18,981 --> 01:44:23,981
fell to 40% so down from 66% to 40% if
the subject had had to touch the actor

1535
01:44:26,091 --> 01:44:30,440
slash victim physically by forcing his
hand onto an electric plate to deliver

1536
01:44:30,441 --> 01:44:34,820
the shocks, obedience
dropped at 30%. Now this is,

1537
01:44:34,821 --> 01:44:39,410
this is fascinating.
If a non authority figure gave orders,

1538
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:44,240
obedience was nil. So if
some guy was like, hey,

1539
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:49,040
you know, am bill, I'm running the
experiment, um, hey, shock this guy.

1540
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:53,450
If the guy was no authority, the
they got no, they got no, none,

1541
01:44:53,451 --> 01:44:57,020
no obedience. So that shows you, and
that's from a leadership perspective,

1542
01:44:57,021 --> 01:44:58,910
that's very important to understand.

1543
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:01,610
It's important to understand how much
influence you have when you're in a

1544
01:45:01,611 --> 01:45:02,390
leadership position.

1545
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:06,380
And I run in this all the time and I
ran into and they seal teams when a guy

1546
01:45:06,381 --> 01:45:11,381
doesn't recognize the power of his rank
and he doesn't recognize that just by

1547
01:45:12,591 --> 01:45:15,560
wearing his rank. When he says something,
people kind of like going to do it,

1548
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:17,360
they're good to go.
Well they want to do it.

1549
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:24,230
So then going back to the book here,

1550
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:29,290
if the naive subject performed a
subsidiary or accessory task but did not

1551
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:34,280
personally inflict the electric shocks,
obedience was nearly total.

1552
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:37,640
So that goes down to the
division of Labor. Again, if
it was just me saying, okay,

1553
01:45:37,641 --> 01:45:38,361
I asked him a question,

1554
01:45:38,361 --> 01:45:40,850
you'd have to shock him again and
some other guy was shocking you,

1555
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:44,890
I'd go straight to a hundred
straight to you all hundred.

1556
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:48,540
In contrast,
if the subject or pure was part of an,

1557
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:52,970
if the subject was part of an act or
pure group that staged carefully planned

1558
01:45:52,971 --> 01:45:56,300
refusal to continue to follow
directions of the authority figure,

1559
01:45:56,510 --> 01:45:58,370
the vast majority of subjects,

1560
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:03,350
90% joined their peer group
and desist and desist as well.

1561
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:06,890
So that's the tipping point thing.
If there was other, so if it was,

1562
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:09,800
if it was three of us that were conducting
the experiment on you and the other,

1563
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,670
I was the, the the naive guy that
doesn't know what's going on.

1564
01:46:13,671 --> 01:46:16,520
I'm the one that they were
actually doing the experiment on

1565
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:20,510
and there's two guys,
two actors that are in the room with me,

1566
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:22,460
and they're going to be like, hey
man, we shouldn't be doing this,

1567
01:46:22,461 --> 01:46:24,260
and the other guy goes, yeah man,
that looks like it's really hurting,

1568
01:46:24,261 --> 01:46:27,290
but we should stop this. 90% of the
time I go, yeah, you guys are right.

1569
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,240
Psychology group psychology.

1570
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:35,840
If the subject was given
complete discretion as to
the level of electric shock

1571
01:46:35,841 --> 01:46:40,841
to administer all but a
few sadists consistently
delivered a minimal shock when

1572
01:46:41,901 --> 01:46:44,120
not under direct surveillance
of the scientist.

1573
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:48,020
Many of the subjects cheated by
giving lower shocks than prescribed,

1574
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:52,860
even though they were unable to confront
authority and abandon the experiments.

1575
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:55,080
So they'd give lower shelves,
but they wouldn't walk away from it.

1576
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,640
They wouldn't just say, I'm
not going to do this. Yeah.

1577
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:02,760
It took her through their phones.
Re Really? You know what it is.

1578
01:47:02,761 --> 01:47:05,400
We're all just on the
edge, man. In a way. Yeah,

1579
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:10,020
and we kind of need each other in that
way to wellness. It's, again, this is,

1580
01:47:10,021 --> 01:47:11,430
you know,
this is about leadership.

1581
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:16,460
It's amazing how influential or
how influenceable people are.

1582
01:47:17,490 --> 01:47:20,550
They're so ready for influence are
so ready to be told like, hey man,

1583
01:47:20,551 --> 01:47:22,980
we shouldn't be doing this.
It's the same thing we saw with the,

1584
01:47:22,981 --> 01:47:24,870
with the podcast on the meal,
I'm asker.

1585
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:28,830
All it took was one officer saying stop
killing and everyone, okay, stop killing.

1586
01:47:28,890 --> 01:47:31,770
Right. Everyone just, they just need
to get nudged in that direction.

1587
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:34,320
And by the way, they had already
been nudged in the other direction,

1588
01:47:34,321 --> 01:47:35,940
which is kill everyone. And they
said, all right, cool. We'll go out.

1589
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:37,230
And that's what I mean by on the,

1590
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:39,000
I don't mean on the edge
of like sanding nothing.

1591
01:47:39,001 --> 01:47:40,740
I mean on the fence you're on the fence.

1592
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:44,340
That's why leadership is so important
because you are walking around with people

1593
01:47:44,341 --> 01:47:46,650
all over the world and,
and whatever position you're in,

1594
01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:50,190
regardless if it's in a work environment,
if it's a social environment,

1595
01:47:50,191 --> 01:47:51,810
if it's with your friend
or your peer group,

1596
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:56,640
you have so much power over people just
by being a leader and by using that

1597
01:47:56,641 --> 01:48:01,620
influence to work people one way or the
other. Yeah, that's crazy, man. Yeah.

1598
01:48:01,770 --> 01:48:02,603
It is crazy.

1599
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:10,140
Going back to the book to what were the
vast majority of traps men responding to

1600
01:48:10,141 --> 01:48:12,090
when they did not step out?

1601
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:17,370
Was it the authority as represented
by either trap or his superiors?

1602
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:20,850
Were they responding to trap?
Not primarily as an authority figure,

1603
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:22,080
but as an individual,

1604
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:27,140
a popular and beloved officer who they
Missumi who they would not leave in the

1605
01:48:27,691 --> 01:48:29,670
lurch.
What about other factors?

1606
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:34,910
Milgrom himself notes that far that people
far more frequently invoke a 40 then

1607
01:48:37,621 --> 01:48:41,520
conformity to explain their
behavior for the only,

1608
01:48:41,521 --> 01:48:46,521
the former seems to absolve
them of personal responsibility
and he quotes here.

1609
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:52,010
Subjects denied conformity and embrace
obedience as the explanation of their

1610
01:48:52,111 --> 01:48:55,500
actions, so people don't like to say
everyone else is doing it, so I get it.

1611
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,630
People don't like to say
that because that, that,

1612
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:01,050
that means I'm responsible for it. People
don't like to take ownership of things.

1613
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,630
It's probably have a book
called extreme ownership.

1614
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:07,200
People don't like to take ownership of
things, right? Instead, they want to say,

1615
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:09,490
as soon as I blame something on my
Boston, this is one of the, you know,

1616
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:11,700
big things in extreme ownership
leading up the chain of command.

1617
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:16,320
It's so easy to blame your boss
because how can I control my boss?

1618
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:18,810
I was following, I was following
orders, Boston way to do this.

1619
01:49:18,811 --> 01:49:19,621
That's why we failed the mission.

1620
01:49:19,621 --> 01:49:21,830
I was told to do this mean he didn't
give me the right gear. That's,

1621
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:25,830
we hear this all the time and,
and, and Milgrom says it too.

1622
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,720
No one wants to say, Hey, you know what?

1623
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:30,030
I decided I was just going to
do what everyone else was doing.

1624
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:33,660
That's my decision. Instead, they put that
decision on the other guy on the boss,

1625
01:49:33,661 --> 01:49:35,030
man.
Yup.

1626
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:41,940
Another exploration here,
back to the book,

1627
01:49:41,941 --> 01:49:45,750
direct proximity to the horror of killing
significantly increased the number of

1628
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:48,580
men who would no longer comply.
On the other hand,

1629
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:52,630
with the division of labor and removal of
the killing process to the death camps,

1630
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:57,580
the men felt scarcely any responsibility
to offer for their actions. Same thing.

1631
01:49:57,581 --> 01:50:00,430
MILGROM figured out. No,
I got someone else that's
pressing the button over there.

1632
01:50:00,431 --> 01:50:02,770
The shocking you. I'm good
with it. Yeah. Keep Rolling.

1633
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:08,830
Now, one thing that Milgrom
kinda talks about is his,

1634
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:13,330
the kind of indoctrination
or what kind of,

1635
01:50:13,331 --> 01:50:17,230
what kind of ideological justification
did he give to his people?

1636
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:19,720
It's really just preexisting
in Milgram's experiment.

1637
01:50:19,721 --> 01:50:20,950
These are just kind of normal people.

1638
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:25,270
So what about with the Nazis and what
kind of indoctrination did they get?

1639
01:50:25,271 --> 01:50:26,530
Brainwashed,
right.

1640
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:31,570
We have talked about this a little
bit already, but back to the book,

1641
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:36,520
all order police battalions were to be
strengthened in character and ideology.

1642
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,940
One topic for the first week, they went
through like a school and education,

1643
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:40,990
ideological education.

1644
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:46,140
One topic for the first week was race as
the basis of our worldview followed by

1645
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:50,710
the second week maintaining
the purity of blood.

1646
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:55,600
So there you go.
These guys are being indoctrinated.

1647
01:50:55,601 --> 01:51:00,601
But the reason that that argument doesn't
really hold much weight is because of

1648
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:05,260
the way who the people were.
And back to the book,

1649
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:07,000
whatever the merits of such an argument,

1650
01:51:07,001 --> 01:51:11,030
it clearly does not hold
for the predominantly middle
aged men of reserve with

1651
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,780
leap police battalion one on one.
They were,

1652
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:18,550
they were educated and spent their
formative years in the pre 1933 period.

1653
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,350
Many came from a social may,

1654
01:51:20,351 --> 01:51:25,090
Lou that was relatively
unreceptive to national socialism.

1655
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:26,230
They were,

1656
01:51:26,230 --> 01:51:29,570
they knew perfectly well the moral
norms of German society before the Nazi.

1657
01:51:29,571 --> 01:51:34,480
So you can't really blame it
on them being brainwashed.

1658
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:39,430
So
here's how,

1659
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:44,680
here's how a browning wraps up this book.

1660
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:45,700
I'm going to close it out.

1661
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:52,120
The behavior of any human being is
of course a very complex phenomenon.

1662
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:57,720
And the historian who attempts to explain
it is indulging in a certain arrogance

1663
01:51:59,230 --> 01:52:04,230
when nearly 500 men are involved to
undertake any general explanation of their

1664
01:52:05,891 --> 01:52:08,260
collective behavior is
even more hazardous.

1665
01:52:09,670 --> 01:52:14,530
What then is one to conclude,
most of all,

1666
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:19,030
one comes away from the story of Reserve
Police Battalion One on one with a

1667
01:52:19,031 --> 01:52:20,950
great unease.

1668
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:26,350
This story of ordinary men
is not the story of all men.

1669
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:31,530
The reserve policemen faced choices and
most of them committed terrible deeds,

1670
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:38,860
but those who killed cannot be absolved
by the notion that anyone in the same

1671
01:52:38,861 --> 01:52:42,430
situation would have done as
they did for even among them.

1672
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:45,920
Some refuse to kill and others stopped.
Killing

1673
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:52,130
human responsibility is
ultimately an individual matter.

1674
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:56,180
At the same time,
however,

1675
01:52:56,390 --> 01:53:01,190
the collective behavior of Reserve
Police Battalion One o one has deeply

1676
01:53:01,191 --> 01:53:03,170
disturbing implications.

1677
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:09,700
There are many societies afflicted by
traditions of racism and caught in the

1678
01:53:11,091 --> 01:53:15,530
siege mentality of war or Fred of war

1679
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:19,910
everywhere society conditions,

1680
01:53:19,911 --> 01:53:24,911
people to respect and defer to authority
and indeed could scarcely function

1681
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:30,550
otherwise everywhere people
seek career advancement

1682
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:34,040
in every modern society.

1683
01:53:34,190 --> 01:53:39,190
The complexity of life and the resulting
bureaucratic ization and specialization

1684
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:45,400
attenuate the sense of
personal responsibility of
those implementing official

1685
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:46,453
policy

1686
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:51,950
within virtually every social collective.

1687
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:57,190
That peer group exerts
tremendous pressures on
behavior and sets moral norms.

1688
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:07,270
If the men of Reserve Police Battalion
One on one could become killers under

1689
01:54:07,911 --> 01:54:09,620
such circumstances,

1690
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:13,730
what group of men cannot

1691
01:54:21,530 --> 01:54:24,560
and there you have it and
I think those are some

1692
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:32,830
extremely important warnings
that are laid out there.

1693
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:38,180
I mean, obviously the first
one, we have to be aware of

1694
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:44,300
traditions of racism
and the threat of war,

1695
01:54:44,301 --> 01:54:47,870
and I think those are pretty obvious
and stand out pretty clearly. Yeah.

1696
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:54,330
I think the other ones are a
little bit trickier, right?

1697
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:55,640
I think we've got to watch out

1698
01:54:57,390 --> 01:55:02,390
for the fact that we are conditioned
to respect and defer to authority.

1699
01:55:03,530 --> 01:55:08,270
I say to that, no, and I actually,
you know, I, when I grew up,

1700
01:55:08,271 --> 01:55:13,271
I was a rebellious kid and I listened to
rebellious music and I was a rebellious

1701
01:55:16,731 --> 01:55:17,564
kid.

1702
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:23,440
I talk about that and I think that was
very beneficial for me in my military

1703
01:55:24,051 --> 01:55:24,884
career

1704
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:29,780
and explained that all the
time that I asked questions.

1705
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:32,480
If I don't believe in something, I'm
going to ask questions. And by the way,

1706
01:55:33,290 --> 01:55:37,010
I don't, I want the people
that work for me or with me.

1707
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:38,990
I want them to ask questions to,

1708
01:55:38,991 --> 01:55:42,500
I don't want to be surrounded by yes
men and I'm not going to be yes ma'am.

1709
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:47,430
Never was. Nope, I haven't met.
Let me, let me caveat that.

1710
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:51,000
Not that I never was because
sometimes you've got to be a yes man.

1711
01:55:51,001 --> 01:55:54,210
In order to get the inner circle
where you can actually have influence.

1712
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:58,200
So have I played that game before?
Yes, I have. Yeah. Yeah. Boss.

1713
01:55:58,201 --> 01:56:01,230
That sounds like a good plan. Yeah. Boss
yet that says good plan. Oh I trust Jocko.

1714
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:05,460
He agrees with me all the time. Hey boss,
you're going off the rails over here.

1715
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:08,490
He stop it. Oh I'm going to listen
to Jocko cause he listens to me.

1716
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:11,220
So have I played that game
before? Yes, of course I have.

1717
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:17,180
So we need to be careful that we
don't submit always to authority.

1718
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:22,210
It's a hard thing to raise your
kids with too. Right? Cause you,

1719
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:24,960
cause you want your kids to submit to your
authority, but you don't want them to,

1720
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:29,760
yeah. I have to always remind
myself when they rebel against me,

1721
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:31,290
I have to say to myself,
good.

1722
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:36,060
Because I want them to ask questions.
I want them to question authority.

1723
01:56:36,061 --> 01:56:39,510
I don't want them to just obey.
Right. Yeah. And it freaks people out.

1724
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,680
It freaks people out when
you say w w you know,

1725
01:56:42,690 --> 01:56:45,750
I'll go and work with a company and I'll
be saying like, no, I want your people.

1726
01:56:45,751 --> 01:56:47,880
You want your people to ask questions.

1727
01:56:48,330 --> 01:56:52,080
If you want to just order them around
and they're just going to obey you,

1728
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:53,273
first of all,

1729
01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:56,610
I'm not going to help you there because
that's not a system that's functional.

1730
01:56:56,790 --> 01:57:00,120
It will be functional for a week.
It'd be functional for two weeks,

1731
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:03,540
but eventually you will have people that
don't understand why they're doing what

1732
01:57:03,541 --> 01:57:04,110
they're doing.

1733
01:57:04,110 --> 01:57:06,600
They don't put their effort to and they
can't make decisions on their own and

1734
01:57:06,601 --> 01:57:08,100
you end up with a bad team.
Yeah.

1735
01:57:08,910 --> 01:57:13,910
We don't want that kind of authoritarian
leadership anywhere and certainly not,

1736
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:19,710
not, not anywhere. Again, does it work for
five minutes? Does it work for week? Yeah,

1737
01:57:20,330 --> 01:57:20,590
it does.

1738
01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:23,700
Is it sometimes needed because people
gotta we gotta get something done right

1739
01:57:23,701 --> 01:57:24,450
now.
Yeah,

1740
01:57:24,450 --> 01:57:28,560
but you better follow that up with
some non authoritarian leadership with,

1741
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:31,590
with explaining and building
relationships with people. Yeah.

1742
01:57:31,591 --> 01:57:35,070
That ex explanation thing that you
guys didn't talk about all the time.

1743
01:57:35,110 --> 01:57:38,220
We're explaining why.
Explain why I'm telling you to do this.

1744
01:57:38,221 --> 01:57:40,990
It's important because
of this x, Y, Z man. It,

1745
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:44,640
and I'm speaking from a
perspective of being a parent,

1746
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,870
how effective that is. You just
say, this is why you're doing it.

1747
01:57:48,871 --> 01:57:53,010
That's effectively how old is your
daughter now it's already affected with a

1748
01:57:53,011 --> 01:57:56,820
four year old. Yeah. And even maybe some
mornings you can always rationalize it.

1749
01:57:56,821 --> 01:58:00,770
A four year old. Sometimes they just want
that cookie careers. Know why about it?

1750
01:58:00,771 --> 01:58:05,210
It was strangely with the, um, we, we
have a situation right now where I'm,

1751
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:07,920
her cousin is in and um,
you know,

1752
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:12,380
he put in a nutshell, his
diet isn't quite it. Um,

1753
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:15,300
as she's not on the, but he's not
on the program, on the program,

1754
01:58:15,301 --> 01:58:18,600
like how my daughter is program,
but you know,

1755
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:23,520
he'll eat junk food or whatever. Right.
And it's kind of part of the experience.

1756
01:58:23,521 --> 01:58:24,840
I understand where,
you know,

1757
01:58:25,170 --> 01:58:28,920
hey cousins in from out of town and
it's a little bit more festive. Yeah.

1758
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:32,700
So after awhile I started realizing like,

1759
01:58:32,810 --> 01:58:36,420
cousin show up at my house and getting
on the program. It should be like that.

1760
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:39,640
So after awhile I was like,
Hey, the, you know, we just,

1761
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:44,180
there's too many treats going
on these days, you know,

1762
01:58:44,190 --> 01:58:46,750
for the psycho had to drop the
head to intervene a little bit.

1763
01:58:46,810 --> 01:58:50,830
And so when I told my daughter,
I was like, no, you know,

1764
01:58:50,831 --> 01:58:53,740
we're not going to do this. And I
explained why you could tell she didn't,

1765
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:57,940
she wasn't happy with it, but she
totally understood four years old where,

1766
01:58:58,330 --> 01:59:02,060
and I did it in a way where it wasn't
like you referenced way of the Warrior Kid

1767
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:06,460
always. Dude, she was wearing that
shirt to school today too, by the way.

1768
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:11,020
Coincidentally when right. They're
using millennia. But um, it was,

1769
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:15,010
it w I didn't scare her. You
no idea. I wasn't like, Ooh,

1770
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:18,160
then you're going to be a loser or
something. You know, something like that.

1771
01:59:18,161 --> 01:59:19,840
My kids say to each other,
oh,

1772
01:59:19,841 --> 01:59:23,050
you might as well just go out and
volunteer for type two diabetes.

1773
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:27,180
They get crazy and they
learn that from, yeah. Yeah,

1774
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:30,520
I know exactly where they learned,
but it was just the kind, you know,

1775
01:59:30,521 --> 01:59:33,160
like where the older kids do it.
To my younger daughter,

1776
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:36,540
you're going to get type two
diabetes on the peer pressure.

1777
01:59:37,870 --> 01:59:40,320
She thinks she's going to get it
today. Yeah. That's messed up.

1778
01:59:40,321 --> 01:59:44,950
You know it is most effective
or ineffective though,
right? That's your thing.

1779
01:59:46,050 --> 01:59:50,670
No, but anyway, the point being it is,
it is effective. Especially, I mean, yet,

1780
01:59:51,190 --> 01:59:53,830
you know like how you say to,
you don't have to be a dick about it.

1781
01:59:53,831 --> 01:59:57,400
It's not a scolding. It's not nothing
like that. Yeah. It's cool on explanation.

1782
01:59:57,401 --> 02:00:02,070
Actually understanding contrary to that,
it's the other end of the spectrum. Yeah.

1783
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:05,980
Yeah. We're using, I'm talking to you
is because I care about you so much,

1784
02:00:06,140 --> 02:00:09,150
but I want you to be healthy. Yeah.
That's the only reason I'm talking to you.

1785
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:13,330
You ever get like your parents say that?
Say those exact words.

1786
02:00:13,331 --> 02:00:14,920
I do this because I care about you.
Meanwhile,

1787
02:00:14,980 --> 02:00:18,430
they're yelling at you versus banking.
You employers do it.

1788
02:00:18,431 --> 02:00:21,260
Two bosses do that too. Yeah, no.

1789
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:24,160
The first thing they do is I want to
jump down someone's throat and then

1790
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:28,030
everyone's reactions to the same to that.
Yeah. One likes it. No one likes it.

1791
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:31,600
Whereas if you take a different
approach and you say, Hey, echo,

1792
02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:34,840
do you know why I'm talking to you right
now? It's not because I'm mad at you.

1793
02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:38,560
Right. It's because I'm actually, I
see nothing but potential with you.

1794
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:41,410
That's what I see. And when I,
when I see that you're not making,

1795
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:46,510
you're not making many videos. It's not,
it's not, cause I'm, I'm thinking myself,

1796
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:48,160
oh,
I want more videos.

1797
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:52,180
The reason I'm thinking it's because I
actually see how much potential you have

1798
02:00:52,330 --> 02:00:56,590
and you could really do some powerful
stuff and have some huge influence Tang,

1799
02:00:56,620 --> 02:00:59,460
but you're still right, Jocko. So. Right.

1800
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:02,290
As opposed to you better make more videos.
Yeah.

1801
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:05,200
Or else I'm going to have my kid do it.

1802
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:09,910
We'd be lazy. Exactly. Then you'd
be like, fine, I it could do it.

1803
02:01:09,911 --> 02:01:12,010
They won't be as good as mine. She
was saying. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1804
02:01:12,011 --> 02:01:14,260
So that's not what we wanted. That's
not the game we're playing here. Yeah.

1805
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:17,530
I do see a lot of potential in you then.
I think you could make more videos.

1806
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:20,380
Thank you so much.
So

1807
02:01:22,090 --> 02:01:24,070
you gotta Watch out for Oh,

1808
02:01:24,071 --> 02:01:29,071
being a 40 you've got to question
authority all the time and you've,

1809
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:33,910
then he talks about people
seeking career advancement.

1810
02:01:34,370 --> 02:01:38,980
That was another big one and this is
another big one I say no to right.

1811
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:44,380
There's such a much better way to get
career advancement and that is by doing a

1812
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:46,400
good job.
Yeah.

1813
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:51,290
That's how you get career advancement by
instead of seeking career advancement,

1814
02:01:51,291 --> 02:01:54,500
seeks, do good job, seek to make a
difference to seek to do what is right.

1815
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:59,330
The career is going to come in one form
or the other. Now my you get passed up.

1816
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:03,860
Might some other guy that tooted
his own horn and took the credit,

1817
02:02:04,010 --> 02:02:08,720
might that happen? Yes, it might happen.
You might, you might get delayed,

1818
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:12,900
but that guy is going to continue to
build that reputation and they're,

1819
02:02:12,910 --> 02:02:15,980
the bosses missed it on the first
round of advancements. So he got it.

1820
02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:19,340
Maybe even gets the second
round by the third round.

1821
02:02:19,341 --> 02:02:22,580
They're looking at him going,
this guy has a self serving loser.

1822
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:25,040
We need to get them off the team.
And by the way,

1823
02:02:25,190 --> 02:02:27,800
we realized that the guy that's been
behind all his work is echo over there,

1824
02:02:28,730 --> 02:02:30,920
so we're going to promote him now.
Now you're going to win.

1825
02:02:30,921 --> 02:02:34,810
Now you've got a really solid reputation.
You'll broke so you can't. But the, the,

1826
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:36,860
the idea of seeking career advancement,

1827
02:02:36,861 --> 02:02:38,030
you see that in the military all the time.

1828
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:40,070
There's people that are just trying to
get advanced, trying to get advanced,

1829
02:02:40,071 --> 02:02:43,190
trying to get, don't cares who's backed
or stepping on, and I'm telling you,

1830
02:02:43,191 --> 02:02:45,670
I said,
I saw some of those guys get advanced in,

1831
02:02:45,671 --> 02:02:47,840
in my community that advanced
up through the ranks.

1832
02:02:47,841 --> 02:02:49,910
They were stepping on
people's backs to get there.

1833
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:53,660
The reputation eventually was so
bad that it didn't get them propel.

1834
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:56,810
They didn't propel as far as
they want it to look. Great guys,

1835
02:02:57,140 --> 02:03:00,200
the guys that were really truly just
trying to do the best for the community,

1836
02:03:00,201 --> 02:03:02,750
those guys got promoted and
aid would make it, you know,

1837
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:07,751
the furthest because their reputation
was so solid and everyone knew that these

1838
02:03:08,721 --> 02:03:10,070
guys were doing the right
things for the right reason,

1839
02:03:10,071 --> 02:03:14,150
not so they could get promoted, but they
ended up getting promoted. Yeah. Yeah.

1840
02:03:14,151 --> 02:03:19,150
Promotion is more for like a, like
an eventuality. Eventuality. Yeah.

1841
02:03:19,151 --> 02:03:20,000
It's just like Jujitsu.

1842
02:03:20,330 --> 02:03:23,510
If you're just trying to get your belt
and that's what you're trying to prove,

1843
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:25,850
that's not gonna work out well for you.
Getting mad when the,

1844
02:03:25,851 --> 02:03:29,090
the game like emoted you might get your
blue belt before some other white belt

1845
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:30,800
because you're showing off all the time,

1846
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:34,190
but eventually you're showing off all
the time and the coach goes, hey man,

1847
02:03:34,191 --> 02:03:37,490
why don't you help everyone? Or
the coach goes, Hey, I see you.

1848
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:40,220
I see you're tapping a lot of people out
that are the same level as you all the

1849
02:03:40,221 --> 02:03:41,780
time, but you're not going with
anyone that's harder than you.

1850
02:03:41,781 --> 02:03:43,850
Cause you wanna prove to me that you're
tapping and went out and long move.

1851
02:03:43,851 --> 02:03:47,020
You know what you might see
sometimes it's, you know,

1852
02:03:47,030 --> 02:03:50,840
like you know when you come up through
the Jujitsu ranks you, you, you just,

1853
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:55,070
you just find a certain mood
move or handful of moves
and you just, those moves,

1854
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:57,440
you get better. I'm still there. Yeah.

1855
02:03:57,470 --> 02:04:02,390
I think we all kind of are in one
way or another. And so this is,

1856
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:03,050
this is what,

1857
02:04:03,050 --> 02:04:08,050
if you're pursuing the belt is what you
do on instructors around only do your

1858
02:04:08,421 --> 02:04:11,000
good moods. Do you want to look
good? Yeah. You want to look good.

1859
02:04:11,001 --> 02:04:14,300
That's all you do. You know, and you did.

1860
02:04:14,301 --> 02:04:18,080
And when you say it will show
itself later, you know, so what you,

1861
02:04:18,081 --> 02:04:21,680
what can happen is you get your blue belt,
you get your purple belt.

1862
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:25,180
Cause like you show off to your
instructors or whatever the tournaments to

1863
02:04:25,610 --> 02:04:30,110
realize. I just realized something about
myself. I just had a rude awakening.

1864
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:34,730
Huh. But what will happen is
later on you ever get, okay.

1865
02:04:34,731 --> 02:04:37,830
So this might be, it might have been a
long time for you, but maybe not. So,

1866
02:04:39,210 --> 02:04:44,120
okay. So I'm taking, I'm
training with, uh, in, Oh,

1867
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:45,240
I'm sorry.
I went to class.

1868
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,790
Jeff Glover is teaching the class and
Jeff Glover was like, Hey, let's do this.

1869
02:04:47,791 --> 02:04:49,710
And he does some crazy
kind of advanced move,

1870
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:53,610
but it takes like if you're an advanced
person, you know how to, you know,

1871
02:04:53,611 --> 02:04:56,800
how to move your body in Jujitsu
kind of in an advanced way.

1872
02:04:56,801 --> 02:04:59,370
You can do the move even though you've
never done the movie before. You know,

1873
02:04:59,371 --> 02:04:59,790
that kind of went.

1874
02:04:59,790 --> 02:05:03,270
So was that kind of movie was one where
you got to like go between the guy's

1875
02:05:03,271 --> 02:05:07,140
legs, lift up into he'll hook or
whatever, like locked you choose.

1876
02:05:07,230 --> 02:05:11,370
So I don't do that move at all.
And I've been training,

1877
02:05:11,371 --> 02:05:15,410
I've been in this game for a long time,
so I go and I do it and not,

1878
02:05:15,450 --> 02:05:19,410
I don't want to say I was surprised,
but like I could do it. I can totally.

1879
02:05:19,630 --> 02:05:23,160
But Jeff was like, oh, kind of like Dang,
cause I'm a bigger guy too, you know?

1880
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,360
And that made me think of this
kind of thing where some guys,

1881
02:05:27,361 --> 02:05:30,000
they can be a black belt
and they'll say, hey, hey,

1882
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:31,800
show this move real quick
and it'll be a black man.

1883
02:05:31,801 --> 02:05:34,290
They can't do it because
they've avoided that.

1884
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:36,870
And not to say that this
is the case all the time.

1885
02:05:36,871 --> 02:05:41,580
I'm just saying that's like an example
of how you can avoid getting better and

1886
02:05:41,581 --> 02:05:43,980
only show off like x,
Y,

1887
02:05:44,030 --> 02:05:48,540
Z to get you to that kind of next
specific level. Yeah. I don't,

1888
02:05:48,541 --> 02:05:51,600
new belt or whatever is
a similar thing maybe.

1889
02:05:51,870 --> 02:05:53,820
But I realized when you
were talking about this,

1890
02:05:54,210 --> 02:05:59,190
what I'll do is both
with Jean and with Jeff,

1891
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:03,720
if I do, if I'm doing something
that they showed me, I'll like,

1892
02:06:04,050 --> 02:06:09,030
I'll like call them out like a
little kid. I'll be like, yeah,

1893
02:06:09,031 --> 02:06:13,560
I'd be like, oh you like that one.
That New Orleans, I do it with Dean,

1894
02:06:13,561 --> 02:06:17,370
with my kids when my kids are training,
you know,

1895
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:20,840
I'll say 18 dean, check, look at that,
look at that. He's going to get it.

1896
02:06:20,841 --> 02:06:23,210
You know what I mean?
Of like all happy. Yeah.

1897
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:25,920
I'm just happy that I'm learning
or that they're learning.

1898
02:06:26,750 --> 02:06:30,110
It's pretty cool when you can pull off
what you just learned. Right? Yeah.

1899
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:32,950
That's cool. And it's cool for
a teacher. I always, I'm still,

1900
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:34,890
when somebody does something
that I showed them big time.

1901
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:39,070
So I guess the differences if in fact
this isn't even the difference, um,

1902
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:41,070
is why did you do that?

1903
02:06:41,190 --> 02:06:46,190
It's not to get your kid promoted to get
me promoted cause I can't get you kind

1904
02:06:46,451 --> 02:06:49,410
of can't get promoted right
now. Yeah. So I guess,

1905
02:06:50,340 --> 02:06:52,170
I guess it's sort of like maybe,
maybe,

1906
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:56,570
maybe the negative aspect would be like
I'm looking for some credit for calling

1907
02:06:56,580 --> 02:07:00,720
off of the little guy move totally
differently. No, I don't think it's,

1908
02:07:00,721 --> 02:07:05,040
I think it's pretty bad. I liked it.
I think I'm pretty lame for that.

1909
02:07:05,850 --> 02:07:09,750
Um, yeah. So watch out for that.

1910
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:13,110
Watch out for their career advancement.
Don't let that be the folks, your life,

1911
02:07:13,111 --> 02:07:16,830
man. It's God's not going to make you,
it's not going to get you what you want.

1912
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:17,873
Now again,

1913
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:23,340
are there instances where you play the
game so that you can move up so that you

1914
02:07:23,341 --> 02:07:25,950
can have more control? Yes,
I did that. I look, I be,

1915
02:07:25,951 --> 02:07:29,550
I went from enlisted to officer.
That's the ultimate in, Hey,

1916
02:07:29,551 --> 02:07:31,560
I'm going to play the game. I'm
going to get more. I want to,

1917
02:07:31,561 --> 02:07:33,660
I want to be in charge of more stuff.
So how am I going to do that?

1918
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:36,130
I'm going to be, I'm going to skip all
these ranks. Become an officer. I did

1919
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:40,180
that. Yeah. I played that
game. I was about my career,

1920
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:43,270
but I was about my career
so I could make you know,

1921
02:07:43,271 --> 02:07:45,850
15 guys in a seal platoon happy.
Yeah.

1922
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:50,240
Cause I was happy when I had a
good leader in my seal platoon. Um,

1923
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:55,710
the other one he talks about here
is this bureaucrat as a nation and

1924
02:07:56,431 --> 02:08:01,420
specialization attenuating the
sense of personal responsibility.

1925
02:08:01,421 --> 02:08:05,050
This is another thing that
we have to be careful of.

1926
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:10,180
Just because you're part of a
system doesn't mean you should just,

1927
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:14,140
you know, blame the system when
something goes wrong. You know,

1928
02:08:14,141 --> 02:08:16,180
if you're working somewhere
and something isn't going, hey,

1929
02:08:16,181 --> 02:08:18,070
that's the way we do it. Hey, that's
the way the system works. Hey,

1930
02:08:18,071 --> 02:08:20,890
we can't change that.
And I never accepted that as an answer.

1931
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:26,800
And I'll tell you what,
when you come up against that,

1932
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:31,510
you can't eat the way you fight it
when you come up against as you build a

1933
02:08:31,511 --> 02:08:35,680
relationship. Right. So any you ever,

1934
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:36,573
you ever have a,

1935
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:41,700
you're trying to deal with some customer
service or something and you're getting

1936
02:08:41,710 --> 02:08:46,420
that, sorry, we can't help you. Yeah. And
you go down to the store and like, Hey,

1937
02:08:46,421 --> 02:08:49,810
what's going on? Hey Bill, I am Jocko
man. I called you earlier. I just,

1938
02:08:50,110 --> 02:08:53,070
I got to get this thing resolved.
Here's what's going on. You don't,

1939
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:55,840
you don't go down there and say you
need to take care of this. No. You say,

1940
02:08:55,841 --> 02:08:59,050
hey bill, what's going on?
Hey, I'm Jocko. Yeah man.

1941
02:08:59,051 --> 02:09:02,290
I really liked the piece of
gear, but man, it worked good.

1942
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:04,960
There was a couple issues I have with
everyone trying to get them resolved

1943
02:09:04,961 --> 02:09:07,150
because you know, my daughter's
birthday's in two weeks and I need them.

1944
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:09,470
You know what I mean? Yeah.
Former relationship with them.

1945
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:14,800
Let's get the bureaucratic, don't let them
stay in their big bureaucratic system.

1946
02:09:14,930 --> 02:09:17,100
Yeah. We don't want to let
that happen because then the,

1947
02:09:17,290 --> 02:09:19,900
then the bureaucratic machine,
then they're, they're not,

1948
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:22,720
they're not the ones that are
offending you. It's the machine.

1949
02:09:22,721 --> 02:09:24,130
They can't control the machine.
It's not their machine.

1950
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:25,590
There's part of the machine.
Right.

1951
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:29,740
You want to you and where this concept
fundamentally is the same as this,

1952
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:34,180
you know, when you're in
traffic, you know, and you're
trying to get over kind of,

1953
02:09:34,470 --> 02:09:38,230
yeah, yeah, yeah. And you want to
get into the lane, but you know,

1954
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:41,050
from the other guy's perspective
or the other car's perspective,

1955
02:09:41,170 --> 02:09:45,730
this car is trying to cut me off this car.
This car's going to get in my way.

1956
02:09:45,731 --> 02:09:48,400
Right. But you get your,
whoever you're riding with,

1957
02:09:48,401 --> 02:09:50,200
all you gotta do to get
them rolled down the window,

1958
02:09:50,980 --> 02:09:55,300
make eye contact with a person and be
like, Hey, just wave at them or something.

1959
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:59,740
Look, I'm a person. You're a person. We're
not standing in line. What else? Any,

1960
02:09:59,741 --> 02:10:02,770
like we're just, we're hoping the themes,
we're not machines, we're not much.

1961
02:10:02,771 --> 02:10:07,370
You can just give them the
hint of a personal element.
Let you right in the wave.

1962
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:10,680
You in, you weight back. You
guys are friends that and before,

1963
02:10:10,830 --> 02:10:14,070
keeping in mind two seconds before that
you were pissed. Yeah. They're like,

1964
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:15,940
discuss the plot to get in front of me.

1965
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:18,010
And there's no reason to be
mad about that, by the way.

1966
02:10:18,011 --> 02:10:19,630
It's not like you're sitting
in some way to get there.

1967
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:23,670
He's gotta be some more to the
same direction in the rush. Yeah,

1968
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:27,760
but you got to put it on your deal. Same
thing. Step out of the machine, man.

1969
02:10:27,770 --> 02:10:30,340
The machine of trust. Step out.
Hey, I'm a person. You're a person.

1970
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:33,830
Make the personal relationships up and
down the chain of command throughout your

1971
02:10:33,831 --> 02:10:38,700
company. Don't let the, don't let
the finance department, right? Yeah.

1972
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:42,030
The department, the finance department
is shot us down on this thing. Yeah.

1973
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:44,700
Give me the name. Who did that? I'm
going to walk down there and Tim,

1974
02:10:45,030 --> 02:10:48,830
I'll see what the marketing department
won't give us any more than, okay, cool.

1975
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:51,780
Let's find out who that is.
That's not a bureaucratic maze.

1976
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:55,060
It's not a marketing department
machine. No, it's bill.

1977
02:10:55,210 --> 02:10:58,040
Bill's in there 100% when bill
knows what you're trying to do,

1978
02:10:58,310 --> 02:11:00,380
I noticed that you are trying
to make something happen.

1979
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:04,250
You make that connection and we're good
to go. Bill is going to take care of you.

1980
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:08,060
I don't even no reason to freak out.
The other thing,

1981
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:11,510
finally here is this,
this idea of this peer group,

1982
02:11:11,511 --> 02:11:15,440
this social collective,
pure pressure.

1983
02:11:15,710 --> 02:11:20,450
We all know it exists and that's fine,
but make it good,

1984
02:11:21,010 --> 02:11:22,880
right?
Peer pressure is powerful.

1985
02:11:22,881 --> 02:11:26,780
It's powerful and the good thing is you
get to control it in both directions.

1986
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:31,310
You need to recognize it when it's
happened to you in a negative way and then

1987
02:11:32,210 --> 02:11:33,290
you need to use it

1988
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:38,900
in a positive way to help people do
good things. Jews, peer pressure,

1989
02:11:39,020 --> 02:11:41,900
peer pressure is legit for
making people do positive things.

1990
02:11:42,650 --> 02:11:46,070
What you don't want to do is use peer
pressure to make people do negative things

1991
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,000
and there's a lot of that in the world.
Then I'll tell you why.

1992
02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:53,780
There's a certain part of people that
don't like to see other people succeed.

1993
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:58,280
Yeah. So they go, man, just
come out tonight dude. But dude,

1994
02:11:58,281 --> 02:11:59,870
I kind of work in the
morning to just come out,

1995
02:12:00,030 --> 02:12:03,260
which is going to get a couple of drinks.
Here's another one. Let's do shot.

1996
02:12:03,350 --> 02:12:07,770
You're always on that diet. Yeah. The
people, hey, loosen up. Lighten up. Yeah.

1997
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:09,650
They want to say there's a,

1998
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:14,740
there's a certain part of people
that want to see everyone else fail.

1999
02:12:15,530 --> 02:12:18,240
And if you're, you've got to pay
attention to that to yourself. Yes.

2000
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:23,210
You got to pay attention to that in
your own self because if you don't,

2001
02:12:23,540 --> 02:12:25,730
you won't realize it.
But you actually,

2002
02:12:25,850 --> 02:12:29,900
I've seen people give other people
bad advice because they're jealous.

2003
02:12:30,830 --> 02:12:33,020
They're jealous.
Certain programs,

2004
02:12:33,230 --> 02:12:36,230
I seem to go with a gut friend of mine
was going for a certain program in the

2005
02:12:36,231 --> 02:12:40,190
military and he came to me, he said,
man, I'm just going to try this program.

2006
02:12:40,191 --> 02:12:44,420
But a couple of guys were telling
me I shouldn't. And I said, Bro,

2007
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:48,680
that is the dumbest thing I've ever
heard. They are jealous. They're jealous.

2008
02:12:48,681 --> 02:12:50,900
They don't want you to do this program
cause it's gonna make you more successful.

2009
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:55,550
Go do the program. Huh? And
he said, okay. And he did it.

2010
02:12:56,550 --> 02:13:01,220
[inaudible] that's who I want to give
peer pressure of goodness out of badness.

2011
02:13:01,790 --> 02:13:03,590
And, and the thing is, I mean,

2012
02:13:03,591 --> 02:13:07,910
I guess you could look at peer
pressure in a way is it's leadership,

2013
02:13:08,180 --> 02:13:12,710
whether you're standing up to it or
whether you're spreading the positive peer

2014
02:13:12,711 --> 02:13:16,160
pressure. And that's leadership. And
that's what we're here to do, man. Yeah.

2015
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:20,960
We're here to do, we're here to lead.
And when you use that in a positive way,

2016
02:13:20,961 --> 02:13:25,730
you can prevent this kind of,
he's kind of sick,

2017
02:13:25,731 --> 02:13:27,290
sadistic,
horrible,

2018
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:31,010
horrific events like this,

2019
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:34,670
like we read about today from
happening. I mean, it just, it's,

2020
02:13:34,671 --> 02:13:37,890
it's crazy that this,
that this occurred. Yeah.

2021
02:13:38,190 --> 02:13:41,520
And it's crazy that it,
you know,

2022
02:13:41,521 --> 02:13:44,100
even even throughout the book and

2023
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:46,823
it,

2024
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:49,370
it's just referring to the Jews,
right?

2025
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:53,270
It's just referring to the Jews
and the Jews. The Jews lined up,

2026
02:13:53,271 --> 02:13:57,890
the Jews laid down, the Jews gotten,
got shot in the back of the neck.

2027
02:13:58,100 --> 02:13:59,660
The Jews, the Jews, the Jews.

2028
02:14:01,550 --> 02:14:05,030
Let's remember that every
single one of those Jews

2029
02:14:06,860 --> 02:14:10,930
was, her name was a person,
right. Was bill was, you know, we,

2030
02:14:10,931 --> 02:14:13,150
we do the same thing.
We're putting them in a,

2031
02:14:13,151 --> 02:14:16,700
in a sort of big chunk of
machinery. Yeah. That they're just,

2032
02:14:16,910 --> 02:14:19,940
they're part of the product of
what's happening over here and

2033
02:14:21,970 --> 02:14:26,290
yeah, don't do it on either side. Yeah.
Or don't try and have it on the new side.

2034
02:14:26,350 --> 02:14:30,400
Don't let it happen. And traffic. Don't
let it happen in your life. Don't do it.

2035
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:38,100
That's what leadership is about.
It really is. And leadership,

2036
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:43,520
the thing about leadership is
leadership is happening at all times.

2037
02:14:44,780 --> 02:14:48,000
W W we, the minute you are
interacting with another person,

2038
02:14:48,030 --> 02:14:50,820
leadership is taking place. You're
either being led, which is fine,

2039
02:14:51,030 --> 02:14:55,590
or you're leading, which is fine as long
as you're going in the right direction.

2040
02:14:56,550 --> 02:15:00,210
But if you constantly think you're any
and you're leading yourself, by the way,

2041
02:15:00,270 --> 02:15:02,940
of course you're leading yourself,
you're constantly leading yourself.

2042
02:15:03,570 --> 02:15:05,270
But the minute you meet with someone else,
you,

2043
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:06,720
there's a leadership situation happening.

2044
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:11,670
You either leading that person or
you're being led and that's okay.

2045
02:15:11,820 --> 02:15:14,160
It's okay to be led as long as you're
being led in the right direction.

2046
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:17,610
If you start seeing yourself being led in
the wrong direction and you go with it,

2047
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:21,240
you're at fault. Yeah. You're at
fault. You can't blame that person.

2048
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:27,150
You went along with it. Yeah.
You're culpable for your actions.

2049
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:31,570
So again,
I know it's a brutal,

2050
02:15:32,330 --> 02:15:36,520
brutal topic to cover and I'm sure
we'll be back at it again at some point.

2051
02:15:38,150 --> 02:15:39,370
But yeah,

2052
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:42,400
let's not,
let's not forget that these,

2053
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:46,270
that this happened and
that if we're not careful,

2054
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:48,273
it can happen again.

2055
02:15:49,110 --> 02:15:53,010
Yeah. And you get little things
I can way lower levels. Yeah.

2056
02:15:53,011 --> 02:15:56,630
That stuff happens all the time. You know,
like little rights breakout, you know,

2057
02:15:57,060 --> 02:16:01,110
normal people just drawing cars because
that's kind of what everyone's doing.

2058
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:06,030
You know, one guy that's like, hey,
stop, we gotta to stop and be like, okay,

2059
02:16:06,090 --> 02:16:10,260
let me stop. Yeah. The
peer pressure thing,

2060
02:16:10,261 --> 02:16:15,150
that's why people will, you get a
workout buddy, you know, or, or you, you,

2061
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:19,680
you joined. That's why crossfit in
a big way is like, really? Okay.

2062
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:23,220
It's a good group thing because
everyone's like, hell yeah. You know,

2063
02:16:23,460 --> 02:16:25,260
like the true you want,
you can't, in a way,

2064
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:28,710
you look forward to just linking up with
the group and the group stuck in about

2065
02:16:28,711 --> 02:16:29,850
like, you know, doing good stuff.

2066
02:16:30,230 --> 02:16:33,470
Yeah. Working out. And you're
right. And as a matter of fact,

2067
02:16:33,471 --> 02:16:37,580
there's a whole new phenomenon
in the fitness world,

2068
02:16:37,610 --> 02:16:41,510
which is basically all stems from
crossfit and they call it just grew up

2069
02:16:41,511 --> 02:16:44,870
exercise, right? Yeah. Hey, we've
got group exercise classes X. Yeah.

2070
02:16:44,940 --> 02:16:47,840
Group exercise classes because hey,
I want to work out with other people.

2071
02:16:47,841 --> 02:16:49,790
I want to have, you know, Echo,
call me up and be like, hey,

2072
02:16:49,791 --> 02:16:52,890
you gonna make it to class tonight. I'm
kind of feeling lazy. Come on Bro. Yeah,

2073
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:56,870
yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, okay. I
don't want to be weak. You know,

2074
02:16:56,960 --> 02:17:01,100
you're pressuring me to be strong.
That's good. Yup. True Story.

2075
02:17:01,130 --> 02:17:04,880
So use that in a positive way.

2076
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:09,750
Yeah. Yeah. You ever, you
ever been? Well you probably,
well yeah, you probably have,

2077
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:14,370
come on, we can be honest here. You
know the kind where you're like, okay,

2078
02:17:14,371 --> 02:17:17,790
I'm going to link up with whoever to
go train or to go work out or whatever,

2079
02:17:18,210 --> 02:17:21,210
and you're like, Dang, I don't really,
when the time comes you're like, Dang,

2080
02:17:21,211 --> 02:17:24,240
I don't really feel like it.
I in the back of my mind,

2081
02:17:24,241 --> 02:17:27,250
I hope that they call and cancel.
I hope,

2082
02:17:28,890 --> 02:17:33,720
and then they call, they don't cancel.
They call to confirm and you go,

2083
02:17:34,290 --> 02:17:37,600
you didn't want to go. You go at the
end of the workout, you're like, Dang,

2084
02:17:37,710 --> 02:17:39,810
I almost didn't,
I almost didn't make it today.

2085
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,820
Good thing you know that's common man.

2086
02:17:41,850 --> 02:17:44,370
And that happens and I'll tell you,
people ask me about this a lot.

2087
02:17:44,890 --> 02:17:46,680
You've got to recognize,

2088
02:17:46,710 --> 02:17:50,580
you've got to start to memorize that
good feeling that comes after a good

2089
02:17:50,581 --> 02:17:51,414
workout.
Yeah.

2090
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:55,530
So that you don't have to force
yourself through it in anticipation.

2091
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:58,860
Such a good way to put it,
memorize the feeling,

2092
02:17:58,861 --> 02:18:03,600
memorize the feeling of like I memorized
two feelings. One is I remember eyes,

2093
02:18:03,630 --> 02:18:05,670
how good it feels when you're done.
And two,

2094
02:18:05,671 --> 02:18:09,060
I memorized how bad it feels when you're
weak. You don't, when you say no. Yeah.

2095
02:18:09,630 --> 02:18:11,880
So that, that's a horrible,
I hate that feeling.

2096
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:16,980
I hate that feeling of
like I didn't do it. Yeah.

2097
02:18:17,220 --> 02:18:20,610
It makes me feel like junk junk.

2098
02:18:21,180 --> 02:18:25,410
I was just on the road and
it was like,

2099
02:18:25,710 --> 02:18:29,340
don't do it. I just feel like man, I
squeezed in a couple of workouts at night.

2100
02:18:29,370 --> 02:18:32,130
Pretty weak workouts but just to get
them done and you know what I mean?

2101
02:18:32,130 --> 02:18:35,890
Just to move. The worst thing
you can do is be sedentary. Yeah.

2102
02:18:35,891 --> 02:18:40,010
And I was moving during the day cause
we were in the water and whatnot. Yeah.

2103
02:18:40,090 --> 02:18:44,010
It's a little bit different. Yeah.
But you got to get them done. Yeah.

2104
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:47,550
So memorize the feelings that there's
nothing worse than the feeling of I slept

2105
02:18:47,551 --> 02:18:52,290
in. Well, like I said, it works for you.

2106
02:18:52,291 --> 02:18:53,890
That's probably as long statement.

2107
02:18:54,630 --> 02:18:57,750
I don't like the feeling of I slept
in and now behind the power curve.

2108
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:02,430
Don't like that feeling at all. Yeah.
Like you memorize that feeling. Yeah.

2109
02:19:02,550 --> 02:19:06,690
And then run from it.
Speaking of memorize,

2110
02:19:06,691 --> 02:19:09,270
are you going to go over everything that
everyone has memorized you saying at

2111
02:19:09,271 --> 02:19:12,000
this point where you talk about how
they can support the podcast picture?

2112
02:19:12,270 --> 02:19:12,850
Actually,

2113
02:19:12,850 --> 02:19:16,360
I'm going to go in and do, Amen. I'm
going to go Ian, at a different angle.

2114
02:19:16,630 --> 02:19:19,510
I'm going to say,
speaking of peer pressure,

2115
02:19:20,590 --> 02:19:23,650
because this is really what it is.
The group, you peer pressuring me,

2116
02:19:23,651 --> 02:19:25,090
you peer pressure.
Everyone else is listening.

2117
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:28,910
We collectively peer pressure each
other and this is what we're doing.

2118
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:32,810
We're working out. There's no reason
not to work out today. Nowadays, not.

2119
02:19:32,811 --> 02:19:36,230
I mean this day today, today could be your
recipe. You should work out today too.

2120
02:19:36,290 --> 02:19:40,340
You should have. Yes. Yeah.
You should later. Even if
you haven't already. Anyway,

2121
02:19:41,330 --> 02:19:44,940
this is what we're doing.
We're working out. Yes.

2122
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:48,350
If we have weight to lose, we
know if we're overweight, we do.

2123
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:53,300
Even if we're for like five
pounds overweight, think
of like your ideal weight.

2124
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:56,330
Think of that.
If you're not that 150 pounds

2125
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:03,620
when you roll with someone, that's
massive. Yeah. And you think, boy,

2126
02:20:03,621 --> 02:20:06,590
I wish I was this massive.
I wish I was, you know,

2127
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:11,000
450 pounds because then you
just smash everyone. Yeah.

2128
02:20:11,090 --> 02:20:15,230
But that might get in the
way in other aspects of life,

2129
02:20:15,290 --> 02:20:19,970
like if you're 450 pounds, that would mean
what, how tall? Like what, six eight? No,

2130
02:20:19,971 --> 02:20:23,210
I would want to be like
eight foot nine. Yeah. Okay.

2131
02:20:23,211 --> 02:20:26,590
So surfing is going to be an
issue for you, so, okay, so,

2132
02:20:26,810 --> 02:20:31,430
so kinda say goodbye to your
current knowledge or your
current Schema of surfer.

2133
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:34,300
Say Goodbye to that. Good point. Good
point. That's just one thing, man.

2134
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:37,940
There's other things. So you're just
thinking Jujitsu lies. I understand.

2135
02:20:38,060 --> 02:20:39,950
I was just your hand
and just MMA over the,

2136
02:20:39,970 --> 02:20:42,290
you'd be out of the way
classes though. Yeah. Yeah.

2137
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:45,570
So you'd have to fight in these weird
cop shoots, whatever I'm saying,

2138
02:20:45,571 --> 02:20:49,100
look at big picture.
I'll just be what I am actually,

2139
02:20:49,101 --> 02:20:53,420
you know what bow 700 feet do you bro,
if you want to be that big,

2140
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:58,010
that's your ideal weight. You go
with that. The 750 pounds, 10 on the,

2141
02:20:58,011 --> 02:21:00,530
and that's really the point. The
point is, you know, your ideal weight,

2142
02:21:00,531 --> 02:21:04,640
you do not me. You know, I don't have
an ideal weight for you. Maybe I do,

2143
02:21:04,641 --> 02:21:09,530
but it serves my interim 100 towns.
Exactly right.

2144
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:13,400
Um, and be with less mentally
strong, but for everyone else,

2145
02:21:13,401 --> 02:21:17,240
we all know how much we want a way
or you know, whatever, whatever.

2146
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:22,280
So this is what we're doing. Pure
pressure. We're going to do that.

2147
02:21:22,281 --> 02:21:24,500
We're going to pursue that.
We're working out,

2148
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:29,950
we are getting control of our ego
temper and other various weaknesses.

2149
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:37,900
Also to facilitate that,
we taking krill oil in for joints.

2150
02:21:37,910 --> 02:21:40,060
A story. That's what we're
doing. We're problem solving.

2151
02:21:40,070 --> 02:21:43,340
Ultimately it's just one big problem
solving thing, you know? So look,

2152
02:21:43,341 --> 02:21:46,760
joints us or Krill oil, boom joints not
sore anymore. Moved to the next thing.

2153
02:21:47,290 --> 02:21:50,690
So what I'm saying,
so krill oil from on it.

2154
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:53,360
You want 10% off the Krill oil,
saved money,

2155
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:57,560
financial discipline equals
financial freedom. Boom.

2156
02:21:58,060 --> 02:22:00,440
We'll kind of put that
right in the whole equation.

2157
02:22:00,530 --> 02:22:04,460
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash chocolate
10% off and support the podcast.

2158
02:22:04,461 --> 02:22:07,520
You know, we're all in this thing
together, kind of thing. You know,

2159
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:13,490
other stuff on it. I took some
new mood today. Interesting.

2160
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:17,840
I'm not necessarily in a new mood.
I think I'm in the same mood,

2161
02:22:17,841 --> 02:22:20,510
but I don't think that's what it is.
I think it's more than just, you know,

2162
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:22,770
balancing out your whole stuff.
Yeah.

2163
02:22:23,090 --> 02:22:26,340
I just took it because he was there and
that's the of thing that I won't take.

2164
02:22:27,030 --> 02:22:30,060
You don't want to be balanced.
I won [inaudible] current mood.

2165
02:22:32,300 --> 02:22:36,660
Yeah, I'm currently, what if you're
feeling angry? Good, then I'm good to go.

2166
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:41,310
I'm fairly certain it's for brain health,
you know, any, I think the new mood,

2167
02:22:41,311 --> 02:22:46,190
like mood part of it is more of like a
kind of a happenstance kind of cool thing

2168
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:50,220
like you know. Anyway, maybe it took
some of that. I have some of that.

2169
02:22:50,250 --> 02:22:54,330
I'm down for that. There's a bunch of
other stuff, performance stuff, you know,

2170
02:22:54,510 --> 02:22:57,720
so if you're like, hey, I'm getting after
it. I want performance supplementation.

2171
02:22:57,750 --> 02:23:01,560
That's what we're doing too.
We're doing all this stuff as a group.

2172
02:23:02,950 --> 02:23:05,940
So was Jocko our current leader.

2173
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:11,400
I think this is a group without a
leader until someone tells him to stop,

2174
02:23:11,430 --> 02:23:13,050
then we're all stuck in anyway.

2175
02:23:13,710 --> 02:23:18,710
Also good way to support and this is just
support yourself and support the group

2176
02:23:18,841 --> 02:23:22,380
really. Cause you know, okay, so this
book, these books, all these books,

2177
02:23:23,970 --> 02:23:28,710
we read these books. Sure we listen to
go over it and it's dope. But you know,

2178
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:30,600
you want to get the book.
If you want to get the book,

2179
02:23:30,601 --> 02:23:33,930
you don't need the whole thing. I'm
reading less than 10% of the books. Yeah,

2180
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:36,600
5% it's like a book report.

2181
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:40,080
Although I might've gone a little bit
crazy with Sydney Jerry last week. Yeah.

2182
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:43,620
I just want to do it.
If I'm just full on the audio book,

2183
02:23:44,850 --> 02:23:49,170
just start and I'll stop. Seven
hours later. Three and a half. Yeah,

2184
02:23:49,290 --> 02:23:52,920
that's it. So got some good
lessons though. Yeah, they're all,

2185
02:23:53,070 --> 02:23:57,330
they're all good lessons. How many
people see, you know, podcast,

2186
02:23:57,450 --> 02:24:01,380
three hours and 27 minutes and go,
come on JOC, come on for, yeah.

2187
02:24:01,770 --> 02:24:04,600
And how many people actually know
what they say. Come on. Echo.

2188
02:24:05,060 --> 02:24:06,930
You talked about actually
talk to you about,

2189
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:11,190
you talked about supports
for two hours and 27 minutes.

2190
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:15,270
Come on. That's not my fault.
That's the machine. You know,

2191
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:20,310
I just did a small little party
guilty. Anyway, if you want the books

2192
02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:25,130
or one or whatever, uh, our website Jocko,

2193
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:28,440
podcast.com there's a section,
a page if you will,

2194
02:24:29,580 --> 02:24:33,450
menu on the top, says books from podcast.
Boom, click on that. Click through there,

2195
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:35,160
take you to Amazon,
purchased the book.

2196
02:24:35,190 --> 02:24:39,960
That's a good way to support and
you get the book. Boom. Um, also,

2197
02:24:39,990 --> 02:24:42,390
yeah, if you're going to do any other
shopping on there, hey, feel free.

2198
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:47,280
That's a good way to support any solid
way. And that's what we're all doing.

2199
02:24:48,330 --> 02:24:51,690
Straight up seats. Now you're throwing
this real heavy peer pressure on everyone.

2200
02:24:51,691 --> 02:24:55,200
Yeah, but this is good peer pressure.
You said good peer pressure is good.

2201
02:24:55,470 --> 02:24:59,280
Well that is good because we're not, you
just, you're just helping your podcast.

2202
02:24:59,281 --> 02:25:04,110
It doesn't cost anything. Exactly.
Right. Boom. And that's what we're doing.

2203
02:25:04,290 --> 02:25:08,490
Also what we're doing is subscribing.
And what were you going to say?

2204
02:25:08,790 --> 02:25:12,370
I was going to say continue talking.
All right, there you go. I will add,

2205
02:25:12,380 --> 02:25:14,340
so subscribe to the podcast.
That's what we're all doing.

2206
02:25:14,341 --> 02:25:18,570
I'm subscribed to the podcast
and I'm on, you know. Yeah.

2207
02:25:18,571 --> 02:25:20,990
Well obviously we're all going to do it.
Um,

2208
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:24,640
subscribe to the podcast if you
haven't already. Also on Youtube,

2209
02:25:24,641 --> 02:25:28,970
subscribe to the Allen. That's a good one.
That's where you make all those videos.

2210
02:25:29,540 --> 02:25:31,440
Tell me you're doing three
videos a week. Yeah, man,

2211
02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:36,160
if I had not seen this in
the future podcasts, video,

2212
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:37,273
video format,

2213
02:25:39,350 --> 02:25:44,350
so doing one podcast video and one and
then two excerpts to excerpts minimum.

2214
02:25:45,350 --> 02:25:47,350
This is what I'm saying.
Okay. That's kind of,

2215
02:25:47,410 --> 02:25:52,180
so we should have a lot of excerpts
up there and they grow every week.

2216
02:25:52,270 --> 02:25:54,700
Um, you know, so the,
and the benefit to those,

2217
02:25:54,701 --> 02:25:58,120
by the way you make you make your extra
shorter. Why? Cause they're too long.

2218
02:25:58,630 --> 02:26:02,120
A 12 minute excerpts, not even an expert.
The expert. That's just another body

2219
02:26:03,800 --> 02:26:05,590
that's the same.
That goes back to the same problem.

2220
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:10,620
It's essentially an order you need to do
edit them. Yeah. Yeah. Get the meat. Dang.

2221
02:26:10,920 --> 02:26:14,470
Yeah. Amazing isn't it?
She'd just be like boom.

2222
02:26:14,471 --> 02:26:16,990
So much to be able to listen to it in
30 seconds and be like, oh I got the,

2223
02:26:16,991 --> 02:26:19,330
got the deal here. Yeah. So, okay,

2224
02:26:19,331 --> 02:26:22,840
so the problem is with
you as you enjoy the,

2225
02:26:23,350 --> 02:26:25,990
you enjoy the arc of the conversation.
Yeah.

2226
02:26:25,991 --> 02:26:28,000
See people want to hear the
arc of the conversation.

2227
02:26:28,001 --> 02:26:29,260
They just listen to the whole podcast.

2228
02:26:29,261 --> 02:26:32,020
Maybe I've been hanging around with
you too though because last week,

2229
02:26:32,021 --> 02:26:35,170
the way you were feeling when you couldn't
hand it out, just that whole, you know,

2230
02:26:35,171 --> 02:26:37,890
45 minutes of whatever,
same thing you get in.

2231
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:43,030
So part of that is a joke. That part of it
is a series. So you know how like, okay,

2232
02:26:43,031 --> 02:26:43,751
I'm listening,

2233
02:26:43,751 --> 02:26:47,150
I'm listening to your whole little
segment and I'm going to cut it right.

2234
02:26:47,180 --> 02:26:48,550
I'm gonna be like, okay, I'm
going to cut it right here.

2235
02:26:48,551 --> 02:26:50,770
And then your little
followup comment is cool.

2236
02:26:50,890 --> 02:26:53,380
And then maybe I say something
which is like, Eh, whatever.

2237
02:26:53,381 --> 02:26:56,650
I can cut myself out easily. But then
your followup to me is kind of cool.

2238
02:26:56,650 --> 02:26:59,160
I'm like, Hey, that's important too.
I should leave that part in it slowly.

2239
02:26:59,290 --> 02:27:02,440
It just turns into this thing mineral,
a minute excerpt,

2240
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:06,910
fuck time whenever. That only has the
word Jocko chicken, Mick, half chicken

2241
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:12,850
breast with fine leg.

2242
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:16,330
They're not mcnuggets anymore.
No, actually they are,

2243
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:18,950
but you know that's an exception.
Sometimes they're 12 minutes. Hey Man,

2244
02:27:18,980 --> 02:27:19,481
there's 10 minutes.

2245
02:27:19,481 --> 02:27:23,050
The other thing we could do is we could
act actually reshoot the like rerecord,

2246
02:27:23,051 --> 02:27:26,540
just the pertinent parts of, you can
edit it out without like, yeah, not,

2247
02:27:26,550 --> 02:27:31,000
I don't know that. That's a step back.
Quirts I think I'm just making repetitive,

2248
02:27:31,001 --> 02:27:35,200
you know. Anyway, that's a good way to
support subscribe that Youtube Channel,

2249
02:27:35,230 --> 02:27:38,890
boom, shareable stuff on there
in the event of the excerpts,

2250
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:43,000
not being taught minutes in them. In the
event of them being three minutes or so,

2251
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:48,430
you can share them more sharable.
In fact,

2252
02:27:49,270 --> 02:27:54,250
I saw what it was like right after I
posted it and then I think he was like,

2253
02:27:54,290 --> 02:27:57,820
oh, I'm going to effing Brady. Maybe
he shares it and then I watched it.

2254
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:02,350
That's how shareable it is. I just
posted it. He shared it and I watched it.

2255
02:28:02,380 --> 02:28:05,080
You did it, cut it, edited it,

2256
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:09,500
posted it and then got shared back to
you and you still watched it. Yeah,

2257
02:28:09,501 --> 02:28:13,510
we'll technically wasn't
sure to me directly actually
technically it was a work.

2258
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:18,730
That's such a good accent though.
So good.

2259
02:28:18,731 --> 02:28:22,290
How I cut the beginning and the end
of that. Anyways, stopping start

2260
02:28:25,740 --> 02:28:29,450
anyway. Subscribed pee
tube. That's the point.

2261
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:33,740
That's what we're doing also,
Jack was a store.

2262
02:28:34,230 --> 02:28:39,230
It's called Jocko store Jocko store.com
so what's on here is clothing items if

2263
02:28:43,041 --> 02:28:47,750
you will, new shirt out. Okay, so here's
the thing. This is what we're doing.

2264
02:28:47,810 --> 02:28:50,930
We're wearing Jocko podcast shirt. That's
what we're doing. This what I'm doing,

2265
02:28:50,931 --> 02:28:55,040
the peer thing, I'm telling you it's
good. Beer pressure looks who she,

2266
02:28:55,041 --> 02:28:56,840
this shirt Jocko is wearing right now.

2267
02:28:56,990 --> 02:29:01,820
Even this has become a Jocko podcast
shirt because we now manufacturing victory

2268
02:29:01,821 --> 02:29:06,530

Jocko store.com I guide.

2272
02:29:19,401 --> 02:29:21,950
The master had this tee shirt on.
Yeah,

2273
02:29:22,010 --> 02:29:25,010
and the [inaudible] and at first I was
like, you know, I just like, Oh man,

2274
02:29:25,011 --> 02:29:28,940
somebody say three guy and then I'll say,
oh even cooler. He's not an actor guy,

2275
02:29:28,941 --> 02:29:31,970
but he's representing.
Representing. Yep. That's all.

2276
02:29:32,390 --> 02:29:35,660
That's what we're doing
representing big time. And if you,

2277
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:39,260
I'm not saying buy a shirt,
I never say buy a shirt.

2278
02:29:39,830 --> 02:29:41,540
I'm saying chocolate store.com.

2279
02:29:41,541 --> 02:29:46,541
Check it out if you'd like one or
more of the items on there including,

2280
02:29:46,971 --> 02:29:50,150
but not limited to shirts.
Get something.

2281
02:29:50,780 --> 02:29:52,130
There's also rash guards.

2282
02:29:52,580 --> 02:29:56,510
Hoodies kind of like got to
replenish those. I understand.

2283
02:29:56,870 --> 02:30:01,430
But some rash guards on there and the
next hoodies are going to be thick and

2284
02:30:01,431 --> 02:30:05,510
heavy Alaskan style.
Okay. Minnesota style.

2285
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:11,270
You know what else thinking on Tana
stuff, not, not, not Hawaii. Hawaii style.

2286
02:30:11,470 --> 02:30:15,260
Hang.
Well we could to both because look,

2287
02:30:15,290 --> 02:30:18,240
you can't exclude the calm.
I know. Oh come on him.

2288
02:30:18,300 --> 02:30:20,960
And it means it means the people.

2289
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:23,510
Technically when you think about it comma,

2290
02:30:23,810 --> 02:30:28,370
[inaudible] comma I n means
land. So people the land. Yeah,

2291
02:30:28,430 --> 02:30:32,060
I got a pretty good guests right
there. Yeah, there you go. So anyway,

2292
02:30:32,300 --> 02:30:34,250
you can't neglect those folks.
Okay,

2293
02:30:34,380 --> 02:30:39,290
well we need to make your style
one and a and the north northerner.

2294
02:30:39,620 --> 02:30:41,870
Sure. Style. Yeah. Yeah. The
two sides of the spectrum,

2295
02:30:42,290 --> 02:30:46,430
everybody wants to represent or
that's what we're all doing, you know,

2296
02:30:47,210 --> 02:30:51,380
representing, um, anyway, yes. Some rash
guards on there. Like I said, the, okay,

2297
02:30:51,381 --> 02:30:54,080
what I was gonna say is Jack Jack was
the start and we've mentioned it before.

2298
02:30:54,110 --> 02:30:55,520
Jack was a shirt.
Now,

2299
02:30:57,020 --> 02:31:00,090
well technically he designed a shirt,

2300
02:31:02,660 --> 02:31:07,490
varying levels of acceptance on my end.
It's the echo shirt.

2301
02:31:08,210 --> 02:31:12,380
Some people call it the Dang shirt, the
echo shirt. There's some layers there.

2302
02:31:12,590 --> 02:31:13,850
You might be able to figure him out.

2303
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:16,550
Technically there's more layers on
this shirt than any other shirt.

2304
02:31:16,710 --> 02:31:20,070
Really the most layered shirt.
And the fact that I made

2305
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:24,950
it as a layer in its own right. Uh, but I,

2306
02:31:24,990 --> 02:31:28,320
my evaluation is, it's interesting.
He was actually impressive.

2307
02:31:28,321 --> 02:31:31,650
That design is impressive, like
the layers and stuff. Anyway,

2308
02:31:31,980 --> 02:31:34,470
designed exclusively by Jocko.

2309
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:40,390
So now I'm a fashion designer.
Correct. Artists, fashion designer.

2310
02:31:40,790 --> 02:31:43,470
Who would have thunk?
I'm neither

2311
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:48,630
technically your bull. I'm
not neglecting either. Anyway,

2312
02:31:48,631 --> 02:31:52,290
that one's on there right now.
Right this very moment.

2313
02:31:52,570 --> 02:31:54,510
Don't ones on there if you want to
check it out. I'm not saying to buy.

2314
02:31:54,570 --> 02:31:55,830
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying checking.

2315
02:31:55,850 --> 02:31:59,940
I think the shirt it's going to be popular
with your head on it is by the way it

2316
02:31:59,941 --> 02:32:01,950
has echoes head on it because

2317
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:08,520
there's a layer in you gotta see it.
You got to see it.

2318
02:32:08,521 --> 02:32:13,521
You know what I'm saying is though is
somebody that somebody that like doesn't

2319
02:32:13,831 --> 02:32:16,110
want to just be forthcoming.
Like for instance,

2320
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:19,020
a lot of the shirts that we
have that have layers to them,

2321
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:22,170
you don't know exactly what
like no, the darkness, right.

2322
02:32:22,210 --> 02:32:26,550
No one knows what the hell a lot has to
do with, yeah. The Jocko podcast shirt,

2323
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:29,310
the one that says Jocko podcast
on, okay. We know there's, there's,

2324
02:32:29,790 --> 02:32:30,990
there's some layers there,
but it's pretty,

2325
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:33,460
it's also pretty forthcoming
what it means. Yeah. This,

2326
02:32:33,650 --> 02:32:37,170
the shirt that I made for
you with your head on it,

2327
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:38,790
no one's going to have
any idea what that is.

2328
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:43,710
It's so people automatically have some
good layers there just by wearing that.

2329
02:32:44,730 --> 02:32:47,310
It's not you. No one's going
to have any idea what this is.

2330
02:32:47,400 --> 02:32:52,260
Why is that PR human's head on your chest?
You're saying external people.

2331
02:32:52,470 --> 02:32:56,430
Yes. People who absolutely. Yeah,
absolutely. People in the game,

2332
02:32:56,431 --> 02:32:58,050
they're going to get the whole
thing and they're going to be like,

2333
02:32:58,051 --> 02:33:02,820
holy Taco is on.
Like if you listen to a band and you just,

2334
02:33:02,821 --> 02:33:04,710
you have a shirt that doesn't
say the band name on it,

2335
02:33:04,711 --> 02:33:09,010
but it's got the album cover. Yeah,
and people know. People that know,

2336
02:33:09,011 --> 02:33:13,350
know people that listen. If they listen,
they know. Same thing with this shirt.

2337
02:33:13,410 --> 02:33:15,780
If they don't listen, they're not
going to know. If they listen.

2338
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:16,910
You're going to get credit.

2339
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:23,930
Yeah. That's a good one. Anyway,
chocolate store.com that's a good one.

2340
02:33:24,380 --> 02:33:28,340
That's what we're doing. Also what
we're doing straight up is in the,

2341
02:33:28,580 --> 02:33:33,320
in the moments of weakness that we may
or may not have someone else have them

2342
02:33:33,770 --> 02:33:37,490
more than others. But what we do is
we turn to psychological warfare.

2343
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:38,271
If you didn't know what that is,

2344
02:33:38,271 --> 02:33:43,250
is what is psychological warfare is
an album with tracks, tracks, dig it.

2345
02:33:43,790 --> 02:33:45,230
And these tracks,

2346
02:33:45,231 --> 02:33:50,231
what they do is they give you a spot with
any weakness or weak moments you have.

2347
02:33:53,720 --> 02:33:58,430
So if you're waking up early every single
day and that one day comes or whatever

2348
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:02,630
that you're like, Dang, that alarmed
seller that my bed is extra comfy, I'm,

2349
02:34:02,631 --> 02:34:05,930
you know, maybe I'll sleep in.
You don't want to have slept in.

2350
02:34:05,931 --> 02:34:09,260
But that's how you feel at that moment,
that moment of weakness,

2351
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:14,120
play one of the tracks,
wake up and get after it.

2352
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:17,650
I don't use that particular track of
use the workout once. So it's different,

2353
02:34:18,310 --> 02:34:21,820
but it will help you through it. I'll
give you that spot. Just like when you're,

2354
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:25,150
and I said this before and this makes
perfect sense. This is what we're doing.

2355
02:34:25,670 --> 02:34:30,670
And when we jump onto the bench and we
take on lofty challenges on the bench

2356
02:34:31,151 --> 02:34:34,150
press,
we're going to grab a guide to spot us.

2357
02:34:34,270 --> 02:34:38,380
Not to say he's going to touch the bar
and not to say any of that, but we,

2358
02:34:38,450 --> 02:34:43,390
we have a lofty challenge. So we got
the, the spot to ensure our success.

2359
02:34:43,870 --> 02:34:47,710
So to me,
if you're not doing anything,

2360
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:50,170
if you're not pursuing anything,
then this isn't for you.

2361
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:54,520
You just got to get up and whatever at
whatever time you get up and go to where

2362
02:34:54,550 --> 02:34:57,670
you do whatever you do, come home,
do your thing, which is cool.

2363
02:34:57,730 --> 02:35:01,660
That's not what we're doing
though. So I say, wow,

2364
02:35:01,661 --> 02:35:05,470
we do our big things.
We're going to get our spot.

2365
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:08,320
It's called psychological warfare. I'm
not even saying to use it, I'm saying,

2366
02:35:08,321 --> 02:35:11,320
but if you need it,
you got it to ensure your success.

2367
02:35:11,890 --> 02:35:16,550
It's okay. That's good. Thank
you. Appreciate that one. Yeah,

2368
02:35:16,580 --> 02:35:20,540
well done. Yeah, thanks. Uh,

2369
02:35:22,100 --> 02:35:23,390
also,
uh,

2370
02:35:23,750 --> 02:35:27,890
you can get Jocko white tea on Amazon.

2371
02:35:28,370 --> 02:35:29,240
Get some,
if you want.

2372
02:35:29,241 --> 02:35:34,241
Some also origin main.com if you're
getting into Jujitsu or if you're into

2373
02:35:36,111 --> 02:35:40,460
Jujitsu already and you
need a g or a rash guard,

2374
02:35:41,420 --> 02:35:46,420
I recommend you go to origin main.com
it's a my brother Pete Roberts up there in

2375
02:35:47,781 --> 02:35:49,880
Maine where they make everything,
which is awesome.

2376
02:35:49,970 --> 02:35:54,770
They weave the fabric so it's stitching
it, embroider it, send it out.

2377
02:35:55,490 --> 02:35:57,560
Jeez.
Rash guards,

2378
02:35:58,430 --> 02:36:03,430
shorts made in America and and yes we
are getting in league with origin Maine,

2379
02:36:06,751 --> 02:36:10,670
so there's a little bit of a
perfect storm kind of brewing.

2380
02:36:11,330 --> 02:36:13,430
Got Somebody that makes
something in America,

2381
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:16,400
something that I like in your
neck of the woods too, by the way,

2382
02:36:16,401 --> 02:36:17,660
in my neck of the woods.

2383
02:36:17,720 --> 02:36:22,720
So we're getting on the warpath with
origin Maine and we're going to get after

2384
02:36:23,421 --> 02:36:25,100
it.
So check them out.

2385
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:29,660
Then weigh the warrior kid,

2386
02:36:30,590 --> 02:36:32,840
make a kid's life better,

2387
02:36:33,710 --> 02:36:37,910
get him or her this book so
they can get better, faster,

2388
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:42,940
stronger and before you give
it to them little advice.

2389
02:36:43,221 --> 02:36:47,480
Read it yourself. Uncle Jake has
something for all of us, that's for sure.

2390
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:51,590
Also, discipline equals
freedom. Feel manual.

2391
02:36:52,550 --> 02:36:54,740
I brought like a rough copy.
I forget what they,

2392
02:36:54,741 --> 02:36:57,510
there's some name that they
called us or I've called it.

2393
02:36:58,040 --> 02:37:00,860
This will be my third book up published.
I still don't understand the publishing,

2394
02:37:00,861 --> 02:37:05,240
like they have certain words and stuff.
They use terms. Sure. As our skin,

2395
02:37:05,241 --> 02:37:08,090
we're going to do this, blah, blah,
blah. And I say, what does that mean?

2396
02:37:09,020 --> 02:37:13,790
But this is the book. This is the book
inside the cover. So a couple things.

2397
02:37:14,120 --> 02:37:18,560
Does this have a cover that's going to
attract you know people to buy it? No,

2398
02:37:18,620 --> 02:37:23,270
it doesn't. It's got an all black
cover flat. That's what it's got.

2399
02:37:23,900 --> 02:37:25,390
Is it got some,
you know,

2400
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:28,220
some interesting fluff in there for
you to feel good about yourself? No,

2401
02:37:28,221 --> 02:37:29,630
that stuff's not in there either.

2402
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:34,360
Does it have these incredible life hacks
that are going to teach you how to rise

2403
02:37:34,750 --> 02:37:39,290
and fulfill your dreams through
simple things that you can do? No,

2404
02:37:39,291 --> 02:37:40,250
those aren't in there either.

2405
02:37:42,100 --> 02:37:44,870
It's called a discipline
equals freedom field manual.

2406
02:37:45,170 --> 02:37:48,140
It's about discipline and if you follow
it, you're going to find freedom.

2407
02:37:48,410 --> 02:37:52,490
Pretty simple. There you go. If you're on
youtube, there's the book right there. Oh,

2408
02:37:52,491 --> 02:37:55,490
what does it look like?
Hard to see against the black background?

2409
02:37:55,580 --> 02:37:58,790
Cause it's black. Yeah, it's
stuff. So you can see the cover.

2410
02:37:58,820 --> 02:38:02,260
That's not what the book's for.
No, no. Bovill the covered does.

2411
02:38:03,590 --> 02:38:08,240
Yeah, it's actually pretty. That's to
be honest. That's that you can order.

2412
02:38:08,241 --> 02:38:09,590
That comes out October 17th.

2413
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:15,770
The assumption is you might want to order
it now so you get a copy when it first

2414
02:38:15,771 --> 02:38:16,490
comes out.

2415
02:38:16,490 --> 02:38:21,200
Otherwise people will have discipline
before you and that's not gonna work out.

2416
02:38:21,201 --> 02:38:25,880
Good for you. Uh, extreme ownership. Of
course you have it by the way you have it.

2417
02:38:25,881 --> 02:38:26,301
That's good.

2418
02:38:26,301 --> 02:38:29,210
But get it for your team because I will
make your life easier if you want to do

2419
02:38:29,211 --> 02:38:33,620
that. We also have echelon
front consulting me, Leif Babin,

2420
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:35,330
JP Denelle,
Dave Burke.

2421
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:41,770
Get your team aligned so your
leadership can crush your enemies.

2422
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:46,100
And by the way, don't try and
book us through a Speaker's agent.

2423
02:38:46,101 --> 02:38:48,620
If you know what that is, if you
know what that is, don't do it.

2424
02:38:49,490 --> 02:38:54,470
Don't look online and find our
literary agent and try and book.

2425
02:38:54,471 --> 02:38:56,300
Don't do that.
We have a company,

2426
02:38:56,540 --> 02:39:01,540
it's called Echelon Front book through
the company info@echelonfront.com email

2427
02:39:02,361 --> 02:39:07,310
that. That's how you get us to come
and work with your company. The muster,

2428
02:39:08,450 --> 02:39:12,290
we just got done with one. The next one
is September 14th and 15th in San Diego.

2429
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:17,060
It is going to sell out just factual.
It is going to sell out.

2430
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:18,013
It is factual.

2431
02:39:18,350 --> 02:39:22,250
It is going to sell out because all
three of the first ones I've sold out.

2432
02:39:22,730 --> 02:39:24,380
This one's going to sell out to register.

2433
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:26,810
Go to extreme ownership.com
if you want to come to it.

2434
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:30,440
If you don't want to come stay at
home, that's fine too. Cool. Whatever.

2435
02:39:31,830 --> 02:39:32,663
It also,

2436
02:39:32,750 --> 02:39:36,080
if you train Jujitsu or if you don't
train and you want to start training.

2437
02:39:36,830 --> 02:39:39,830
Speaking of origin Maine,

2438
02:39:39,950 --> 02:39:43,550
we're doing the origin immersion
Jujitsu camp up in Maine.

2439
02:39:43,820 --> 02:39:48,260
Echo and I are going to be their
training and cruising super hard.

2440
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:50,113
Uh,

2441
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:54,830
the will be there the last day of the
first session and the and the first day of

2442
02:39:54,831 --> 02:39:55,880
the second session.

2443
02:39:56,450 --> 02:40:00,470
The sessions are August 20 through 23rd
for the first session in 24th through

2444
02:40:00,471 --> 02:40:05,240
the 27th for the second session.
Come on up. We're going to be there.

2445
02:40:05,330 --> 02:40:08,120
If you want to train some Jujitsu,
it's going to be a good time.

2446
02:40:08,121 --> 02:40:10,310
And what I like about
it is that the muster,

2447
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:15,300
the muster is tight schedule from four
o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock

2448
02:40:15,301 --> 02:40:19,740
at night, 10 o'clock at night, where
we're moving this thing where to do what,

2449
02:40:20,610 --> 02:40:25,170
five hours, six hours of Jujitsu a day.
Sure. And then the rest of the time,

2450
02:40:25,171 --> 02:40:29,000
what do we do with the other 18 hours a
day? Yeah, you can say total, right? Yeah,

2451
02:40:29,570 --> 02:40:32,340
yeah, yeah. I'm saying two hours in
the morning and two hours at lunch.

2452
02:40:32,341 --> 02:40:35,700
Two hours in the afternoon.
I mean maybe not training the whole time,

2453
02:40:35,701 --> 02:40:39,510
but learning to move. Did you see that
doing Jiu Jitsu showing like, Hey,

2454
02:40:39,511 --> 02:40:42,240
can you go over this with me? Hey,
I got a question for you. Hey Echo,

2455
02:40:42,241 --> 02:40:45,060
can you teach me that mount escape
that you got? Like whatever.

2456
02:40:45,090 --> 02:40:47,760
You know those things that we're going
to do, we're gonna do that. Yeah.

2457
02:40:48,530 --> 02:40:52,770
So that's six hours and then we sleep
for four hours. So that's 10 hours.

2458
02:40:52,771 --> 02:40:53,521
That's 14 hours.

2459
02:40:53,521 --> 02:40:56,500
This is a 14 hours is going to be just
walking around in circles going BTF BTF

2460
02:40:56,501 --> 02:40:58,050
it. That's what we're gonna
do is we're going to hang out.

2461
02:40:58,440 --> 02:41:01,560
So if you want to come train some Jujitsu,
hang out,

2462
02:41:01,950 --> 02:41:06,150
come to that camp up in Maine, it's
gonna be awesome. We're going to, uh,

2463
02:41:06,480 --> 02:41:11,480
we're gonna have a good time up there and
until then we'll be rolling in another

2464
02:41:12,151 --> 02:41:14,550
place. Victory MMA. Yes.

2465

2479
02:42:16,950 --> 02:42:21,950
leading yourself and the people
around you in the right direction.

2480
02:42:24,030 --> 02:42:27,150
Forward towards the goal,

2481
02:42:28,830 --> 02:42:32,700
towards the light,
toward a better place.

2482
02:42:34,320 --> 02:42:38,760
Setting the example
and getting after it.
