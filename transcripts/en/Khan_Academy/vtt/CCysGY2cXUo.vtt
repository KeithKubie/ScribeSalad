00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.420
Mario has a fish tank that
is a right rectangular prism

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.730
with base 15.6 centimeters
by 7.2 centimeters.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.970
So let's try to imagine that.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.685
So it's a right
rectangular prism.

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:16.935
Since it's a fish tank, let
me actually do it in blue.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.620
That's not blue, that's orange.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:29.910
One of the dimensions
is 15.6 centimeters.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.360
And then the other dimension
of the base is 7.2 centimeters.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.580
So this is the base right over
here, so let me draw this.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.450
Try to put some
perspective in there.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.830
And of course, it is a
right rectangular prism,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.320
this fish tank that Mario has.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.990
So it looks something like this.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.230
So this is his fish tank.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.530
Try to draw it as
neatly as I can.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.250
And that's top of the
fish tank just like that.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.000
I think this does a decent,
respectable job of what

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.660
this fish tank might look like.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.280
And let me erase this
thing right over here.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.290
And there we go.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.824
There is Mario's fish tank.

00:01:15.824 --> 00:01:16.782
There is his fish tank.

00:01:16.782 --> 00:01:18.448
And we can even make
it look like glass.

00:01:18.448 --> 00:01:20.190
There you go, that looks nice.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.670
All right, the bottom of the
tank is filled with marbles,

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.160
and the tank is then
filled with water

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.850
to a height of 6.4 centimeters.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.600
So this is the
water when it's all

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.370
filled up-- 6.4 centimeters.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.164
So let's draw that.

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:44.916
And I'll make the
water-- well, maybe

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:47.040
I should have made it a
little more blue than this,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.959
but this gives you the picture.

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:50.750
So the height of the
water right over here.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.980
Actually, let me do
that in a blue color.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.480
The height of the water right
over here is 6.46 centimeters.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.150
So that means that the
distance from the bottom

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.120
of the tank to the
top of-- not the tank,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.465
but to the top of the
water is 6.4 centimeters.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.950
Fair enough.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.819
So that's the top of the water.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.860
When the marbles are
removed-- and it started off

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.500
with some marbles on the bottom.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.480
They don't tell us
how many marbles.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.970
When the marbles are
removed, the water level

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.105
drops to a height
of 5.9 centimeters.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.900
From 6.4 to 5.9 centimeters.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.520
What is the volume of the
water displaced by the marbles?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.940
So when you took
the marbles out,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.320
the water dropped
from 6.4-- so it

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:04.210
dropped from 6.4 centimeters
down to 5.9 centimeters.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.550
So how much did it drop?

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.910
Well, it dropped
0.5 centimeters.

00:03:14.541 --> 00:03:16.290
So what does that tell
us about the volume

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.430
of water displaced
by the marbles?

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.630
Well, the volume of water
displaced by the marbles

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.260
must be equivalent to
this volume of this--

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.520
I guess this is another
rectangular prism.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.600
That is, where the
top area is the same

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.250
as the base of this water
tank, and then the height

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.270
is the height of the water drop.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.330
When you put the marbles
in, it takes up more volume.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.990
It pushes the water up by
that amount, by that volume.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.040
When you take it
out, then that water,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.680
that volume gets replaced
with the water down here.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.530
And then that volume
goes back down.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.272
The water level goes
down to 5.9 centimeters.

00:03:55.272 --> 00:03:56.730
So we're essentially
trying to find

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.610
the volume of a
rectangular prism that

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.710
is equal to-- so it's going
to be 15.6 by 7.2 by 0.5.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.230
And I haven't drawn
it to scale yet,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.150
but I wanted to see
all the measurements.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.000
So it's going to be 15.6
centimeters in this direction,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.710
it's going to be 7.2
centimeters in this direction,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.140
and it's going to be
0.5 centimeters high.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.490
So we know how to find volume.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.370
We just multiply the
length times the width

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.060
times the height.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.702
So the volume in
centimeter cubed.

00:04:37.702 --> 00:04:39.910
We're multiplying centimeters
times centimeters times

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.530
centimeters.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.380
So it's going to be
centimeters cubed.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.850
So let me write this down.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:53.650
The volume is going to be
15.6 times 7.2 times 0.5,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.910
and it's going to be in
centimeters cubed-- or cubic

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.030
centimeters, I guess
we could call them.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.300
Well, let's first
multiply 7.2 times 0.5.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.874
We can do that in our head.

00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:05.290
This part right
over here is going

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.140
to be 3.6, essentially
just half of 7.2.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.130
So then, this becomes
15.6 times 3.6.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.580
So let me just multiply
that over here.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.570
So 15.6 times 3.6.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.960
So I'll ignore the
decimals for a second.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.700
6 times 6 is 36.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.010
5 times 6 is 30, plus 3 is 33.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.490
1 times 6 is 6, plus 3 is 9.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.965
And then, let's place a 0 here.

00:05:36.965 --> 00:05:39.000
We're down in the
ones place, but I'm

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.620
ignoring the decimals for now.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.270
3 times 6 is 18.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.250
3 times 5 is 15, plus 1 is 16.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.500
3 times 1 is 3, plus 1 is 4.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.240
And then we get 6.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.330
3 plus 8 is 11.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.790
16.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.040
5.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.830
Now if this was 156 times
36, this would be 5,616.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.700
But it's not.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.250
We have two numbers to the
right of the decimal point--

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.440
one, two.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.420
So it's going to be 56.16.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.290
So the volume-- and we
deserve a drum roll now--

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.530
is 56.16 cubic centimeters.
