00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.000
If you only remember one name in the entire
history of modern biology, it should be…

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
two names.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.620
Because the first biologists were a pair of
freaky intellectual twins, just like Newton

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.930
and Leibniz.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.040
But with more barnacles and monkeys.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.840
Let’s meet Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel
Wallace.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.280
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.599
In the early 1800s, England was already moving

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.950
away from the traditional way of thinking
about life, which was then called “natural

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.950
theology.”

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.970
In this belief system, the living world was
created by a kindly but hands-off God.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.149
And there were four aspects of Creation:
One, there was a divine Creator.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.140
But simply believing in God didn’t prevent
you from asking how life works.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.200
Two, there were species that didn’t change,
ever.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.309
This idea was known as the fixity of species.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.660
But keep in mind, the French had already worked
out that species do change over time and

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.090
go extinct.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.480
They just hadn’t figured out how.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.420
The third aspect of natural theology was a
short creation, in which the world was only

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.369
about six thousand years old.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.409
But geologists had pushed the age of the earth
back to millions of years.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.140
And the fourth idea was the one that was still
contentious in 1800—a perfect design for

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.509
each species.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.010
The idea went: if God made, say, a turtle,
he knew what he was doing.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.790
Even if that turtle was stupid or ugly, it
was still a designed-by-God original, and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.860
there wasn’t too much sense trying to understand
the mechanism, the how, of that design process.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.600
(Note: we here at Crash Course love turtles!

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.620
There are no stupid ugly turtles!)

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.900
Today, natural theology is associated with
philosopher William Paley,

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.940
perhaps because he wrote a book in 1802 called... Natural Theology.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.030
This book influenced a young scholar named
Charles Darwin.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.280
But wanted to understand the “how.”

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.210
Young Chuck originally wanted to become a
physician, but he hated the sight of blood.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.039
So he went to Cambridge to study beetles but
skipped a lot of lectures.

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.770
He earned Gentleman’s Cs and graduated at
twenty two with no direction in life, just

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.560
a huge collection of beetles.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.780
Which, to be honest, is more than I had.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.831
So Chuck’s family did what any rich family
with a beetle-obsessed son would do: they

00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:26.120
sent him to South America on a ship with a
cute name: The HMS Beagle.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.580
Chuck was seasick the entire five years.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.750
But the voyage was more than worth the lost
lunches: it turned Darwin from a mere collector

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.849
into an extraordinary theorist.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.050
For one, the voyage gave Darwin time to read
the geological theories of Charles Lyell and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.260
think about gradual change over long ages.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.510
Wouldn’t it be nice to like get on a boat
with a couple of books and just think for

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.610
5 years, and puke a lot?

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.640
Near Concepción,
Chile, Darwin saw a volcano and felt an earthquake:

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.890
he got to live through Lyell’s theory of
how geological changes happen!

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.549
The voyage also gave him lots of opportunity
to collect and compare fossils.

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.290
For instance, Darwin found fossils of a species
that looked like a giant sloth, one like a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.060
giant capybara, and
one like a giant armadillo.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.420
And Darwin thought, what if these giant creatures
did not just coincidentally look like modern

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.840
animals, like sloths, rodents, and armored
mammals, but were actually ancestors of them?

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.100
But the main thing the voyage did was give
Chuck access to hundreds of specimens from

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.599
similar-looking species that lived close to
each other, but in slightly different environments.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.709
The most famous examples, of course, come
from the Galapagos Islands off the coast of

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.530
Ecuador, home to land and marine iguanas,
diverse mockingbirds and thrushes, tortoises

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.159
by the dozen, and—say it with me—finches!

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:52.080
Like beetles before and barnacles later, finches
became an absolute obsession for Chuck.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.170
He had to catch them all.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.510
Lucky for him, the people who lived near the
Galapagos even explained to him that the different

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.579
species seemed to vary according to island.

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.010
This turned out to be one in a number of clues
that would lead Chuck to developing the theory

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.010
of evolution by natural selection.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.939
When he got back to London, Darwin wrote up
his meticulous fieldnotes.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:18.310
He published the Zoology of the Voyage of
HMS Beagle in volumes from 1838 to 1843.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.510
This alone made Darwin a serious naturalist.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.910
His generous sharing of specimens made him
not only a member of the London scientific

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.590
world, but a leader in it.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.110
He sent specimens to naturalists including
John Gould, who helped Darwin confirm that

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.720
his finches were actually different species,
and not just varieties of one species.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.720
Major clue!

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.410
And then Darwin read the Essay on the Principle
of Population by a cranky reverend named Thomas

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.520
Robert Malthus.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.460
Malthus argued that population increases geometrically,
but food only increases arithmetically: the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.780
logical result must be famine.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.760
This was the final clue—a relationship between
the environment and the reproduction of populations.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.010
Darwin reasoned that living beings compete
over resources, and only the most fit for

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.730
a given region survive.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.310
It’s as if nature selects them.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.130
Hence his choice of the term “natural selection,”
for the primary mechanism of evolution.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.830
Compare this to natural theology: there’s
no Creator involved.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.070
Species aren’t fixed.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.470
The process takes aeons.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.110
And design—what design?

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.160
Useful traits emerge over time.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.760
At the same time that he was solving the biggest
problem facing the study of “what is life?”,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.960
Darwin was also busy performing Victorian
gentleman-ness: he married his cousin, Emma

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.410
Wedgwood, in 1839.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.320
He had babies and moved to a manor in Kent.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.980
He got REALLY into billiards.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.230
But, what Darwin was not doing?

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.310
Publishing a complete theory of evolution.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.400
What was Darwin’s next move?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.550
Pigeon fancying.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.330
He bred pigeons in order to understand artificial
selection, or how humans design organisms.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.500
Because breeding pigeons is a lot faster than
watching finches change over millennia.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.500
And then?

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.270
Eight years studying barnacles.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.410
He worked on his theory, writing to his friends
for advice about it.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.200
But he didn’t publish it.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.320
Darwin wanted to wait until he had incontrovertible
proof.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.230
Then in 1858, Darwin received a letter from
one Alfred Russel Wallace.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.030
Wallace had also discovered natural selection.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.590
He sincerely wrote to Darwin for advice: would
he be interested in, uh, an evidence-based

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.670
theory explaining how organisms evolve?

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.870
Darwin’s mentor, Lyell, told him that he
had no choice now.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.380
So Darwin and Wallace published a joint letter
in the Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.580
Society of London.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.180
And then Darwin wrote a compelling, five hundred-page
book detailing his theory.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.330
In one year.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.350
In 1859, On the Origin of Species by Means
of Natural Selection, or just “the Origin,”

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.990
debuted as a modest edition of twelve hundred
copies but soon became a smash hit.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.190
It was a scientific bestseller, intended for
a wide audience.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.190
No footnotes!

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.150
The book explained how “descent with modification”
or “transformism” actually works.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.421
In any population of the same species, you
can see a natural variation in traits: some

00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:12.420
finches have longer beaks; some have shorter
beaks.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.660
Over time, small changes in the environment
add up, favoring some traits over others.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.650
Natural selection modifies the population:
the fittest survive and reproduce, passing

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.650
on their traits.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.440
Say, the long beaks get to more food and survive
when food becomes scarce.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.200
Unfit species die out.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.000
Populations diverge into new species!

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.060
Darwin’s writing, influenced by Malthus,
shifted away from a harmony of nature and

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.540
toward a competition for resources—a war.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.720
But Darwin’s theory wasn’t perfect.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.080
In fact, he included a chapter on the “difficulties”
facing natural selection.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.770
These included a lack of transitional forms
in the fossil record: how do we get from fish

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.150
to amphibians?

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.640
Even more basically, where do variations come
from?

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.300
How are they passed on from one generation
to the next?

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.590
We have answers to these questions today—stayed
tuned!—but Darwin didn’t, and he admitted

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.590
as much.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.590
This was… refreshing.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.870
He didn’t claim to be a genius.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.940
He didn’t bash earlier theories.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.010
The Origin didn’t even mention God, much
less where humans come from.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:20.240
Instead, Darwin focused on what he knew: variation
in beetles, finches, pigeons, barnacles, and

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.730
fossil animals.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:30.100
His theory, backed by so much evidence, accounted
for how new species evolve.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.520
Even more importantly, Darwin united many
branches of natural history into a single

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:40.100
synthetic theory and proposed a bunch of clear
and important questions for future research.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:45.280
In fact, Origin marks a kind of evolution
of natural history, which was focused on observation

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.680
and description, into biology, which is more
focused on testing theories about living things.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.740
Darwin’s skill as a writer is one reason
his name eclipsed Wallace’s.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.130
Another is that my dude was rich!

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.330
Like, born rich, invested well, married rich…

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.410
He was doing all right.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.570
And Wallace?

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.190
Introduce him, ThoughtBubble:

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.700
Al was born to a family with money problems.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.400
He quit school at sixteen to work surveying
canals with his brother.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.110
And at twenty, he quit surveying to teach.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.460
Wallace read Malthus.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.230
He also read Darwin’s details of his American
voyage and became a lifelong fan.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.760
Wallace met Henry Walter Bates in 1844.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:26.360
They became science besties and decided to
figure out how evolution works in order to

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:32.260
apply that knowledge to human society and
save people from greed and individualism.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:37.640
Wallace and Bates went to the Amazon from
1848 to 1852 to collect specimens for museums

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.740
in London.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.560
And he was super successful… until he set
off back to England.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.180
His boat, brimming with specimens, caught
fire and sank.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:51.220
Wallace watched from his lifeboat as all of
his hard work—his carefully trapped and

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.750
cataloged monkeys and his parrots—sank into
the dark waves.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.130
He was not rescued for ten days.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.530
But, like Galileo after his trial by the Inquisition,
Wallace never gave up.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:08.220
In debt, Wallace decided to continue collecting
more specimens to pay the bills, this time

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.000
in Southeast Asia in 1854.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.710
He sent specimens back regularly, developing
a brilliant reputation.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.170
And Wallace was doing a more than collecting:
traveling from island to island across what

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:24.530
is now Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore,
he observed that different environments seem

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:29.650
to produce different populations of organisms…
perhaps even new species.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:36.210
While sick in bed in 1858, Wallace suddenly
recalled the essay on populations by Malthus,

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.380
and an entire theory clicked into place.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:44.220
In his words: A “self-acting process”
meant that, for any species, “the fittest

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.250
would survive.”

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.270
The colleague he thought would most appreciate
this wild new theory?

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.920
A slightly older naturalist in London…

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.590
Thanks ThoughtBubble.
After the joint paper with Darwin, Wallace

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.370
continued working in Southeast Asia until
1862.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.400
He published his major work, The Malay Archipelago,
in 1869.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.500
Wallace observed that there is a sort of invisible
line—“Wallace’s line”—in Indonesia:

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.100
to the west, species resemble those in Asia.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.840
To the east, they resemble those in Australia.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.930
In fact, Wallace invented the discipline of
biogeography, or the study of plants, animals,

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.900
and geological formations together.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:23.140
So, between them, Darwin and Wallace were
reaching a lot of people with their ideas.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.560
And it’s true that some people with conservative
religious values were outraged at the public

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.870
acceptance of a Creation that had no elegant
design, just random variation.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.780
But the reaction to natural selection was
mostly acceptance.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:41.260
Darwin’s writing, and the depth of his and
Wallace’s evidence, settled the matter for

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.260
many readers.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.790
In fact, in some ways, Darwinism was accepted
too easily.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:49.450
Darwinism quickly became equated with the
term “survival of the fittest,” which

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:55.480
was coined in 1864 by biologist Herbert Spencer
and appeared in the fifth edition of Origin.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.870
This term isn’t a bad summary of natural
selection, in terms of animals and plants.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:05.071
But it was increasingly applied to human society,
as “social Darwinism,” in a way that Darwin

00:12:05.071 --> 00:12:07.170
and Wallace would not have approved of.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.740
An Industrial Revolution has just brought
radical change to England.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.671
A new class of capitalists saw themselves
as more “fit” to govern the world than

00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:19.190
the nobles they replaced or the workers they
controlled.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.330
Next time—Darwin’s cousin, Frank Galton,
will try to apply Chuck and Al’s theory

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.410
to society.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.500
Yes, it becomes strange, and even tragic.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.690
So be sure to come back.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.250
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.120
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.120
Thought Cafe.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.890
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.570
