00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.660
Writers, directors, and main cast members
are often credited for a movie's success of

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.340
failure, but countless professionals leave
their mark on every feature film.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.590
However, from time to time, those marks are
a bit more literal.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.000
Certain directors, special effects gurus,
and editors have been known to insert hidden

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.870
messages into fan-favorite films.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.640
In honor of these sly moviemakers, we've compiled
a list of our favorites.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.280
We�re focusing on frames, text, and audio
that is literally hidden in each movie � not

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.050
simple easter eggs (like the Egyptian etching
of R2-D2 and C-3PO in Raiders of the Lost

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.550
Ark or the The Bride's "F*** You" sneaker
soles in Kill Bill, Vol. 1).

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.980
Here are our favorite hidden messages in famous
movies.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.980
1.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.980
The Lion King (1994)

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.980
When Simba flops down on a cliffside, a cloud
of dust is pushed up into the air � and

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.980
three controversial letters appear.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.980
For years, the frame was scrutinized as a
subliminal message intended to promote sexuality

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.980
to children.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.980
However, the film's animators have since claimed
the letters were intended to spell SFX - a

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.980
nod to the Lion King's special effects department.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.980
Disney could have devised the SFX explanation
after the fact in order to quell outrage from

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.980
concerned parents, but it's equally possible
that the SEX controversy took-off simply because

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.980
it's the more scandalous headline - especially
in popular kids movie.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.980
2.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.980
I Am Legend (2007)

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.980
During the Times Square hunting sequence in
I Am Legend, Will Smith passes a billboard

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.980
advertising a Superman and Batman team-up
film set to open on May 15, 2010.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.399
Given the 2007 I Am Legend release, had the
tongue-in-cheek easter egg come true, the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.000
film would have likely featured Brandon Routh
(whose Superman Returns was released in 2006)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.390
and Christian Bale (who debuted as Batman
in 2005).

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.940
Of course, Warner Bros. has since put together
an actual Batman V Superman crossover in their

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.970
Man of Steel sequel, starring Henry Cavill
and Ben Affleck in the iconic roles.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.570
So, I Am Legend really did include a hidden
message from Warner Bros. � speficially:

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.510
they've wanted to cash-in with a World's Finest
team-up for more than half a decade.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.510
3.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.510
Fight Club (1999)

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.510
Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt) reveals
that while working as a film projectionist,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.710
he would splice images of male genitalia into
films - which were nearly imperceptible to

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.710
moviegoers.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.710
For the Fight Club movie, director David Fincher
took a similar approach � splicing in a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.710
penis picture as well as four brief flashes
of Durden in scenes prior to the character's

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.710
official introduction.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.710
According to Fincher, the purpose of the subliminal
frames was to show that "our hero is creating

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.710
Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point
he exists only on the periphery of the narrator's

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.710
consciousness."

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.710
Fincher also foreshadowed the film�s twist
with a blink-and-you�ll miss it label on

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.710
a pay phone the Narrator uses - which reads
"No Incoming Calls Allowed."

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.710
Moments later, Tyler Durden calls the pay
phone.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.710
4.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.710
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.710
Veronica Corningstone (played by Christina
Applegate) visits a Mexican restaurant with

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.710
other women from KVWN Channel 4 to punish
Ron Burgandy and the �News Team� for their

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.710
sexist views.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.770
The restaurant the ladies visit is the �Escupimos
en su Alimento� - which, when translated

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.760
in Spanish, actually means �we spit in your
food."

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.810
Given the talent behind Anchorman (including
Judd Apatow and Will Farell), it shouldn't

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.979
come as a complete surprise that one of the
funniest gags (in an already hilarious film)

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.050
is also one that most American moviegoers
will miss entirely.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.560
5.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.200
The Matrix Reloaded (2003)

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.340
Typically in movies, license plates are designed
to blend into the scenery without a second

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.340
thought.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.659
But in the Matrix trilogy, many of the vehicle
plates are shorthand references to religious

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:20.659
scripture.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:26.420
At the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded, Agent
Smith's license plate reads "IS5416," which

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.129
corresponds to Isaiah 54:16: "Behold, I have
created the smith, who blows the fire of coals,

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.219
and produces a weapon for its purpose.

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.900
I have also created the ravager to destroy."

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.639
During the highway chase sequence, Trinity's
Cadillac plate reads "DA203," which corresponds

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.469
to Daniel 2:03: "He said to them, 'I have
had a dream that troubles me and I want to

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.469
know what it means.'"

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.569
Of course, license plates aren't the only
references to religious texts in the Matrix

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:55.569
series.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.920
The name of Morpheus's ship, the Nebuchadnezzar,
was also a Babylonian King � and not-so-coincidentally

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.040
the speaker chronicled in the aforementioned
Daniel 2:03 text.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.420
6.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.849
King Kong (2005)

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.019
Most movies rely on character dialogue to
explain non-verbal and non-visual information

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.359
to viewers � but audiences rarely think
twice when watching an actor receive a message

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.359
through morse code.

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.659
We accept that the coded message actually
matches what characters are reporting onscreen.

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.620
But in the case of Peter Jackson's King Kong
remake, the director included a tongue-in-cheek

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.529
message for savvy moviegoers who actually
took the time to translate.

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:35.430
Just before reaching Skull Island, SS Venture's
Captain Englehorn intercepts a coded message

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.339
calling for the arrest of Carl Denham.

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:41.870
Yet, the audible code does not actually say
anything about an arrest, and instead reads:

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.389
"Show me the monkey!"

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.959
A campy hidden message in honor of the film's
famous ape, and one that will probably make

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.069
readers think twice the next time they hear
morse code in a movie.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.069
7.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.980
Sunshine (2007)

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.849
While on a mission to the Sun, the Icarus
II crew receives a distress signal from the

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.580
long-missing Icarus I and decides to rendezvous
with the ship.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.930
When the group board the Icarus I, their flashlights
periodically shine directly into the camera

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.120
(and out at the audience).

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.369
Each time, roughly 49 minutes into the film,
director Danny Boyle spliced in hidden frames

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:18.380
of the now deceased Icarus I crew members.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.519
What makes the hidden message especially creepy?

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.710
The pictures are from a happy Hawaiian-themed
party that took place prior to the demise

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.740
of Icarus I�s crew.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.610
One character even encounters the full group
photo (from which each flash is taken) later

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.789
on in the film.

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:36.780
Boyle hasn't discussed the hidden frames officially
but the flashes definitely work as a subliminal

00:04:36.780 --> 00:05:14.710
way of setting audience members on edge without
directly revealing 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:35.150
the fate of 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:59.539
the Icarus I crew.

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:07.639
8.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.139
Cloverfield (2008)

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.189
In the final moments of Cloverfield, Rob and
Beth seek refuge from the creature under Central

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:15.490
Park's Greyshot Arch.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.189
Moments later, an air raid strike buries the
couple (and the camera) in rubble from the

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.370
bridge - presumably killing the Cloverfield
monster.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.560
But following the film credits, director Matt
Reeves included a brief, 5-second piece of

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:34.819
garbled audio that hints at a different outcome.

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.840
When reversed, the audio recording (which
sounds like a military mission report) clearly

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:46.280
states: "It's Still Alive".

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.979
This indicates that the creature wasn't killed
in the airstrike while also setting the stage

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:53.500
for a possible, though yet to be released,
Cloverfield 2.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.699
Furthermore, the post-credits audio message
isn't the only secret in Cloverfield - as

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:02.659
the film also contains three hidden frames
from classic monster movies: Them!, The Beast

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:04.880
from 20,000 Fathoms, and King Kong.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.910
Conclusion

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.470
Those are our favorite hidden messages in
movies.
