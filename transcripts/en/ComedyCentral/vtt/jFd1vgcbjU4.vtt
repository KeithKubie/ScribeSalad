(whimsical music)

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:07.907
- [Dave] Hey, Chris.

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:08.742
- Yeah?

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:09.909
- Check this out.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.312
I just Dextered this cilantro.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.747
- You think that's Dextering?

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.181
I'll show you how to Dexter.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.683
- Where you goin'?

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.884
- Huh?

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:18.818
Dextering.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:22.288
(determined music)

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.189
- Yo, Dave.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.558
Dextered the bike.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:26.393
- [Dave] Nice.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:27.227
Meet me at the park.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:29.896
(playful music)

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.540
- I'm the dark passenger now.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.475
- Why'd you Dexter Nana?

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:16.743
- She loved it.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:17.677
- See?

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.146
I can't help myself either.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:24.184
- Uh, you wouldn't happen to
have like some keys on ya?

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:25.118
- I do.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.052
What do you need them for?

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:28.254
- Uh, I might need some help.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:32.225
(ominous music)
