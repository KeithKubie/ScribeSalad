00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.298
JEFF: Well, thank you
guys for joining us again

00:00:02.298 --> 00:00:04.230
for another guest chefs at LA.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.890
Today, I think we're all
very excited to have Chef Jet

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.876
Tila here with us
who's going to show us

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:14.020
how to master the perfect Pad
Thai and some drunken noodles.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.520
You guys who may
have seen Chef Jet,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.490
we were talking a
little bit earlier

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.945
about the YouTube videos.

00:00:17.945 --> 00:00:19.885
You may have seen
him on Iron Chef.

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.795
You may have seen him on
Chopped, Cutthroat Kitchen.

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:24.411
And when you can't
find him there,

00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:26.610
I think you can find him at
the Charleston in Santa Monica,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.060
So--

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.510
JET TILA: That's right.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.260
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.275
Thank you, Chef Jet.

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:30.525
JET TILA: Thank you very much.

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:31.471
You can clap, it's OK.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.460
Very much, Jeff.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.280
Appreciate it.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.320
This has been six
months in the making,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.140
but I'm here because of
that chef right there.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.939
So, all right, what
are we doing here day?

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:45.480
I'm Jet Tila.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.460
Let me give you short and
dirty bio-- am I in trouble?

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.150
No I'm not, OK.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.820
Let me give you the
short and dirty CV.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.020
I was really fortunate.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.690
I was born into the first Thai
food family in America, right?

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.200
My family immigrated here
in the '60s from Thailand

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.150
by way of China.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.479
So ethnically, I am
Chinese by way of Thailand.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.520
We opened the first Thai
market, Thai restaurant,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.650
Thai import company,
Thai produce company

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.960
in the history of this country.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.430
So every Thai dish
today in America

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.670
ties directly back to my family.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.930
So, birth luck.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.910
It's all it was, man.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.360
It's all it was.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.910
From then on in my early 20s,
I dropped out of high school

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.200
to go to culinary school.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.991
And I've worked for
some phenomenal people.

00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:29.950
So the short accolades are, I
was the Asian executive chef,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.320
Asian dining encore for Nguyen.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.420
I was at Mountain View.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.880
I opened the first Asian cafe
called the Pacific Cafe like

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.504
in '04 at Google Mountain View.

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:42.920
I've got five world records
under my belt, do a ton of TV.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.870
I don't tell you this
to toot my own horn.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.565
I tell you this to
put you at ease.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:48.080
You are with the guy.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.036
You know the other
guys that sometimes you

00:01:50.036 --> 00:01:52.410
go to demos you see, and you're
like, that's not the guy.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.910
I'm the guy, all right?

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.405
I'm that guy.

00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:57.780
First of all, before we get
rolling, let's stay in touch.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.532
It's @jettila.

00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:00.740
You can just search Jet Tila.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.500
I'm not douchey and put
"chef" in front of my name.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.185
Except for my website, because
I couldn't get jet.com.

00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:07.640
Someone jacked it already.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.240
So for the website,
it's Chef Jet.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.781
But everything else
is just Jet Tila.

00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:12.530
Instagram, Facebook, Twitter.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.490
And I'm accessible.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.620
So if you guys need a
recipe, if you need advice,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.350
where to eat Thai
food, I'm that guy.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.060
So let me know.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.270
Dialogue, OK?

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.300
It's not a monologue.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.950
Let's talk.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.080
If you you guys have any
questions, let me know.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.330
We're doing two of my
favorite dishes today.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.010
One is Pad Thai.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.270
Pad Thai is this
mystical, magical dish

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.290
in which when I hire new cooks,
I ask them to fillet a fish,

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.190
I ask them to bone a
chicken-- sounds dirty--

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.180
and I ask them if they
say they know Thai food.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.840
Because that's either going to
be the last thing you're ever

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.610
going to say to me,
or I find a rock star,

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.670
you're going to make Pad Thai.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.010
Theoretically pretty simple.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.410
But there's so many
intricacies in this dish

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.740
that it's like making pancakes.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.480
You are going to jack up
and burn your first one.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.424
I guarantee you.

00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:03.840
But the more you
make it, the more

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.506
you start to understand
the nuances, OK?

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:06.760
So we'll do Pad Thai today.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.593
And then, we're going
to do drunken noodles.

00:03:08.593 --> 00:03:11.850
Drunken noodles will
soon overtake Pad Thai,

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.840
I think, in one of the most
popular Asian noodle dishes

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.340
in America.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.570
We're about three to four
years out, in my opinion.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.240
So this is like chicken
and waffles, right?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.880
And this is like Suvi chicken
that's been boned out,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.420
ballantine.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.350
One more time?

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.105
AUDIENCE: It's going to
be chicken and waffles.

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:31.104
JET TILA: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:31.104 --> 00:03:32.220
That's exactly right.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.120
But a waffle crisp, OK?

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.380
So that's where we're going.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.280
All right, so let's talk
about Asian food really quick.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.113
Let's break it down.

00:03:39.113 --> 00:03:40.190
Who cooks?

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.880
Who wants to actually learn
how to cook something today?

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.250
Who just wants to
be entertained?

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.740
Who wants a little of both?

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.905
OK, all right, I got you.

00:03:47.905 --> 00:03:50.030
I always ask that question
because I would give you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.460
just the hey, that
was really fun,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.250
I'm never going to cook
anything version of this thing.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.150
But you guys want to
really do this, right?

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.440
OK.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.490
There's a three letter
word in Thai food

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.580
that sums up the perfect balance
point between four flavors.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.337
What is that three letter
word that starts with Y?

00:04:08.337 --> 00:04:08.920
AUDIENCE: Yum.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.990
JET TILA: Yum.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.556
The white people beat you, dude.

00:04:12.556 --> 00:04:13.705
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

00:04:13.705 --> 00:04:14.900
Is anyone easily offended?

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.410
Because I'll tone it down.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.089
Who says keep going?

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.050
Am I OK?

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.480
OK, great.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.940
Yum.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.630
It's not like yummy
in my tummy yum.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.310
It's a real Thai word, and it
means the perfect balance point

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.290
between hot, sour, salty, sweet.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.110
You master four flavors
in Thai cooking,

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.520
you understand it, right?

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.220
What is the yum?

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.300
It's simply these
things right here.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.025
That's it.

00:04:40.025 --> 00:04:40.650
That's the yum.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.950
It's not as magical
mystical as you think.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.659
So let's break it
down by flavor,

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.450
and you'll start to
understand the yum, OK?

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.170
So pick a flavor.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.290
Pick one of the four.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.150
Let's go there.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.800
Sweet.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.690
What is the first ideal sweet?

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.140
Sugar.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.370
Cane sugar, beet sugar,
palm sugar, I don't care.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.880
But there's this
other ingredient

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.710
that we use as sweet.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.770
This is called sweet soy sauce.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.120
60/40 black strap
molasses to soy sauce.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.010
So it's extremely sweet.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.590
Way more sweet than salty.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.480
And because it's molasses,
it coats food amazingly.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.360
It sticks to that food,
makes it really dark.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.895
If you ever eat Pad See-ew
in Thai food or dark soys,

00:05:21.895 --> 00:05:22.645
that's the secret.

00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:24.640
Oh man, I should charge
you for this class.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.960
Look at that, you're
learning so many things.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.830
I love it.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.995
Sweet soy, sugar.

00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:31.370
If you're cooking
at home and you

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.740
don't want to buy
palm sugar, do you

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.812
want like-- do you guys
like-- I'm a food nerd.

00:05:35.812 --> 00:05:37.270
Who wants to food
nerd out with me?

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.940
Do you want to talk
about palm sugar?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.270
Again, the break and the gas.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.834
You guys drive, OK?

00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:42.500
Palm sugar, yes?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.000
Who wants to learn
about palm sugar?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.660
OK, yes.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.590
I'm a coconut palm tree.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.490
I'm a dwarf coconut palm
tree obviously, all right?

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.640
Before the nuts
actually develop,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.480
I sprout shoots
of flowers, right?

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.190
These flower will
eventually become nuts.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.630
If you gathered these
bunches of shoots,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.580
and you tied them
together and cut off--

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.920
if you cut my fingers
off, I bleed, right?

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.910
The tree bleed sap.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.090
So the sap from the
coconut palm tree

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.170
is called fresh coconut juice.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.120
Reduce that liquid into a solid,
guess what you've just created?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.265
Very good. palm sugar.

00:06:18.265 --> 00:06:20.010
You're absolutely
correct, all right?

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.780
So, yeah, you knew
that shit, dude.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.320
I'm sorry.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.856
OK, so palm sugar is
the reduction of what?

00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:28.606
AUDIENCE: Coconut.

00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:29.350
JET TILA: That was too easy.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.420
I'm not going to give
a gift for that one.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.190
OK, got you.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.690
Perfect.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.170
All right, sweet.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.800
Sweet.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.420
Pick another flavor.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.750
Go.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.375
AUDIENCE: Sour.

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:36.190
JET TILA: Sour.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.470
We have a few twists
and turns now, right?

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.400
The number one sour in Thai
cooking is going to be this.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.000
Persian limes is the
common lime that we

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.250
use in American, not key lime.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.960
Too small, a lot of work.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.260
Really kind of a stringent.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.530
Too acid for me.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.410
Persian limes.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.300
Real lime, not that crap that
comes in a plastic lime that

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.720
says "real lime," all right?

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.570
That's one acid.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.580
Your second acid
is vinegar of rice.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.510
Make sense.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.850
Your third acid is tamarind.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.510
Oo, ah, what is tamarind?

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.650
It's this potted fruit
that grows anywhere

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.370
around the equator.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.460
Started in Africa.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.420
It's traveled the world into
Latin America, in India, right?

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.300
In Asia.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.055
So tamarind juice.

00:07:23.055 --> 00:07:26.090
You take the fruit from
the tamarind, you seed it,

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.010
you take the shell
away, you mix it

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.710
with water to make
a cooking liquid,

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.515
and you've made
cooking tamarind.

00:07:31.515 --> 00:07:33.950
Or, you go to Bangkok
market and you buy it.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.050
That's it, am i right?

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.707
Last flavor.

00:07:35.707 --> 00:07:36.540
Oh, I have two more.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.530
Go.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.470
What's my next flavor?

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:38.880
AUDIENCE: Salty.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.600
JET TILA: Salty.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.490
I'll do salty, then
I'm going to do spice.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.800
For Thai cooking,
guys, fish sauce

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.080
is going to be 95% to
98% percent of your salt.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.520
We are not European chefs.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.030
We don't go here.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.200
This is salt.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.380
In French, Italian,
that's salt, right?

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.890
Salt is already in
here with the addition

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.660
of anchovies and water.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.650
So we're using this
as a salt, but also

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.560
gives you a layer
of umami, right?

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.690
There's glutamates, that kind
of full-flavored taste as well.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.470
So that's salt.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:08.970
Sorry?

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:09.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.890
JET TILA: Fish sauce.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.320
You're using fish sauce.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.245
And because a lot of us
Thai people are Chinese,

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.870
we're also going to
be using soy sauce.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.090
Because we've already
learned about sweet soy, OK?

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.810
Everyone raise your right hand.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.749
I swear--

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:22.540
AUDIENCE: I swear--

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.945
JET TILA: --to never use--

00:08:23.945 --> 00:08:25.340
AUDIENCE: --to never use--

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.256
JET TILA: --Kikkoman--

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:27.297
AUDIENCE: --Kikkoman--

00:08:27.297 --> 00:08:28.630
JET TILA: --in the Thai kitchen.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.630
AUDIENCE: --in the Thai kitchen.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.890
JET TILA: OK, OK, you pass.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.549
All right, you pass, all right?

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.700
Use Chinese soys and use
Thai fish sauces, period.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.330
All right?

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.531
Good to go.

00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:39.030
Missing--

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.049
AUDIENCE: --soy sauce.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:41.679
JET TILA: What is
Chinese soy sauce?

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.289
AUDIENCE: What's the brand?

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:47.380
JET TILA: Lee Kum Key,
Golden Mountain, Healthy Boy,

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.645
I can go on all day.

00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:51.180
Yeah, yeah, just remember
the brand not to use.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.390
I don't hate Kikkoman.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.790
I love Kikkoman when I'm
cooking Japanese food.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.180
I don't use Kikkoman
when cooking Thai food.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.930
All right, let me
make that very clear.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.410
And the last salt and
savory together is

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.610
Oyster sauce.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.145
This is your one-cook wonder.

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:07.520
This is the one sauce you take
into a cooking competition

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.645
if you have one ingredient.

00:09:08.645 --> 00:09:10.478
Because it has all the
flavors we mentioned.

00:09:10.478 --> 00:09:11.025
It has umami.

00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:12.370
It has sweet.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.350
It has salt in it.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.070
It's an amazing sauce.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:20.960
For the hot, I'm either using
fresh chillies or chili sauce.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.860
This is sriracha.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.820
That other BS with the
green cap with the rooster

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.060
is not sriracha.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:33.270
That's American, Vietnamese,
Chinese sauce called sriracha.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.230
Sriracha is a province in the
southern coast of Thailand

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.450
that grows chillis.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.770
This sauce has those chillies,
and it's from Thailand.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.050
So expand your
minds a little bit

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:49.840
and buy sriracha from
Thailand, for God's sake, OK?

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.340
AUDIENCE: What's
one of those bands?

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.000
JET TILA: What's
one of those brands?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.990
This is a good brand.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.930
This is actually PK brand,
or Grand Mountain brand.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.630
This is a phenomenal brand.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.000
Thai sriracha is more
garlic-y and Umami.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.180
That other stuff-- that's only
good for pho and spicy tuna

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.890
rolls, by the way-- is
very vinegar, is very acid.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.940
So this plays with
food so much better.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:13.950
OK?

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:14.959
Should we cook?

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:16.000
You guys read to do this?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.070
All right, I've given
you enough lecture.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:17.780
No more lecture.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.570
You have any, like,
bowls and stuff?

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.030
All right, so let's make sauce.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.509
Pad Thai sauce.

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:24.050
First of all-- oh,
you know, I'm just

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.175
going to cook off the cuff.

00:10:25.175 --> 00:10:27.620
I'm going to be wild
and crazy today, OK?

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.270
Yeah, I'll do that.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:29.790
Perfect.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.480
OK.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.250
This looks like a
lot of ingredients.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.162
Do not let it scare
you, all right?

00:10:34.162 --> 00:10:35.620
And if you guys
want to get closer,

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.640
if you want to hang
out back here with me,

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.220
you want to stand outside
not blocking anyone,

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.620
I mean, this is your house, bro.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.400
It really is.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.320
So if you want to be-- you
want to be, like, right here

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.945
hanging out with me,
just come on back.

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:46.530
Come on.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.200
Some of you do.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:47.600
Come on.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.266
I know you want.

00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:49.540
You want to bring a chair?

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.123
Do you want to bring
a chair with you?

00:10:51.123 --> 00:10:52.400
You sure?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.461
You want a big chair?

00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:53.960
You sure?

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.310
OK.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.851
I just wanted to
make sure you're OK.

00:10:55.851 --> 00:10:57.235
All right, sounds good.

00:10:57.235 --> 00:10:58.610
All right, all
the way over here.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.900
Come over, come over, come over.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.590
I'll take bowls.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.230
Give me that bowl
without the eggs.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.810
There you go.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:03.645
Look at that.

00:11:03.645 --> 00:11:04.930
See, no one's ever done that.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.096
Now he's freaking out, dude.

00:11:06.096 --> 00:11:08.870
The camera's like, oh my god.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.670
What the hell am
I going to do now?

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.770
Oh my god.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.870
OK, I think about
things in flavors.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.030
I don't think about
them as ingredients.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.260
Does that make sense?

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.830
So cooking is a lot--
a lot of people in here

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:22.810
are good at math.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.910
So I was a pretty
decent at math.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.380
I cook in ratios.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.840
I'm going to make a Pad
Thai sauce in ratios.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.010
Shall we do that together?

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.480
Thinking yum and
thinking ratios.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.080
So, first I'll
probably think of is,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.217
I need a sugar salt balance.

00:11:37.217 --> 00:11:38.550
So remember, I'm cooking for 30.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.966
So this looks like
a lot of sugar.

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:42.440
But it's actually not that bad.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.690
So I'm thinking about a sugar
salt ratio of one to one

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.140
first of all, OK?

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.779
So salt being this, fish sauce,
sugar being sugar-- and you

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:51.820
could have gone to brown.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:52.986
You could have gone to palm.

00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:54.970
You could have gone to
anything you want, OK?

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.660
So sugar-- sugar, salt.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.550
Acid to these two.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.200
You probably only need
about 25% to 30% acid.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.260
You don't want it
extremely acid, OK?

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.120
Because salt and
acid play together,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.210
and they actually
bring each other up.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:08.710
So--

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.310
AUDIENCE: So that's
the tamarind?

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.435
JET TILA: This is tamarind.

00:12:10.435 --> 00:12:12.700
So maybe 20% to 30%.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.110
Does that makes sense?

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.910
OK.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.750
Do I need heat now?

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.160
Absolutely do you need heat now.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.170
Sriracha.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.920
But we know good
sriracha also brings

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.580
glutamates, which is
umami, brings heat,

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.660
brings a little
more acid to that.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.430
And I've kind of made
the base Pad Thai sauce.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.270
If you want to get--

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.988
AUDIENCE: If you see that
that was like 40% sweet,

00:12:33.988 --> 00:12:35.542
40% [INAUDIBLE]--

00:12:35.542 --> 00:12:36.750
JET TILA: Yeah, I would say--

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.112
AUDIENCE: 20% tamarind--

00:12:38.112 --> 00:12:39.070
JET TILA: I would say--

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.330
JET TILA: Now I'm just confused.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.800
I don't know what
you're saying now.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.246
You know what
we've done for you?

00:12:47.246 --> 00:12:48.614
We have a recipe.

00:12:48.614 --> 00:12:49.530
Yeah.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.590
Thank chef over there.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.750
Chef made the recipe.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.460
Thank chef.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.520
So you have a recipe, OK?

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.800
But those of you--
who hates recipes?

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.629
Who tries to cook by feel?

00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:59.420
Right, just say it.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.400
Just be honest.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.880
Thank you, exactly, all right?

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.380
So that's why I'm
giving you ratios.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.757
So that was about
30% acid, right?

00:13:05.757 --> 00:13:08.090
So I need to complete that
30% with a little bit of rice

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.730
vinegar.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.716
Because there are
little layers of acid.

00:13:10.716 --> 00:13:11.590
Does that make sense?

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.807
Not all acid tastes the same.

00:13:13.807 --> 00:13:15.640
Even though the acidities
might be the same,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.870
the flavors are
different, right?

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.600
And then next time,
I want you to raise--

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.390
everyone raise your
right hand again.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.290
I swear--

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.600
AUDIENCE: I swear--

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.100
JET TILA: --to taste as I cook.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.560
AUDIENCE: --to taste as I cook.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.820
JET TILA: Thank you.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.900
Amen.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.090
Even if the recipe is
spot-on, maybe you're

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.570
using a different fish sauce.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.956
Maybe you're using,
like, a different-- you

00:13:34.956 --> 00:13:35.664
know what I mean?

00:13:35.664 --> 00:13:37.585
A different flavor,
different brand

00:13:37.585 --> 00:13:39.760
that I'm not endorsing
or believe it.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.210
No, I'm kidding.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.920
So anyway, the last bit is
going to be in the cooking.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.430
So I've made a basic
Pad Thai sauce, OK?

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.670
Let's start cooking
Pad Thai, shall we?

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.660
Order of operations.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.630
This is some wok technique now.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:57.072
Whatever takes longer
to cook goes in later.

00:13:57.072 --> 00:13:59.030
Whatever it takes longer
to cook goes in first.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.530
I'm sorry.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:00.936
I went the other way.

00:14:00.936 --> 00:14:02.680
Yeah, I know.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.434
I forgot, I'm talking
to smart people.

00:14:04.434 --> 00:14:05.850
If I was like,
[MOCK CONVERSATION]

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:06.780
oh yeah, totally.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.560
Yeah, the longer it takes,
the sooner it goes in.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.090
You start with a good oil.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.820
You never use olive oil
ever in Asian cooking, OK?

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.670
And you never start looking
until you see white smoke.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.170
Do we see--

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.800
AUDIENCE: What's a good oil?

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.633
JET TILA: I'm sorry.

00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:23.620
AUDIENCE: What's a good oil?

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.420
JET TILA: Peanut,
canola, sunflower,

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.410
any high-temp low-flavor oil.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.470
Baked tofu.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.394
Dried shrimp.

00:14:34.394 --> 00:14:35.685
AUDIENCE: Baked tofu, you said?

00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:36.780
JET TILA: Baked tofu.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.350
Dried shrimp.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.450
Pickled daikon red.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.360
Thai-style, not Japanese
or Korean-style.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.800
Thai-style.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.072
Garlic.

00:14:48.072 --> 00:14:49.780
I'm like, huh, how
many am i cooking for?

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.740
I better put more in there.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.710
OK, so-- and I don't
really cook for time.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.090
Because I don't know
how hot your cooktop is.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.301
I cook by smell.

00:14:58.301 --> 00:14:59.426
You starting to smell that?

00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:00.700
Is that fragrant?

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.360
Is it fragrant and not burning?

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.560
Absolutely.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.970
So now, I want to
cook eggs in here.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.080
So I want to put this--
I add oil as I need.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.250
I don't like pools of oil,
to be honest with you.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.140
So now I'm going
to add some eggs.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.660
And this is how I
cook eggs in the pan.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.660
I distribute them around-- out.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.190
And I break the
yokes, and I start

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.140
to let them coagulate
and set, all right?

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.130
Don't hurry the scramble.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.650
Because you want to
really be able to ID

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.860
the whites and the yolks.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.060
And then, once they
start to coagulate,

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.640
you drag the other
aromatics through,

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.340
and they all play
together beautifully.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.776
See how that works there?

00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:43.150
So basically, I'm
starting with--

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.790
AUDIENCE: I smell
how that works.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.831
JET TILA: You smell that?

00:15:44.831 --> 00:15:45.750
Isn't that delicious?

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.320
And now I'm doing a
little bit of chicken,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.180
or you can do shrimp.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:48.930
Whatever you want.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.270
But I'm doing chicken today.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.160
Now my chicken, I'm always
marinating my proteins first.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.657
It's very simple marinade.

00:15:55.657 --> 00:15:56.490
This will be a quiz.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.000
You'll get a gift for this one.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.180
Lubrication is a little oil,
cornstarch to suck moisture

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:09.580
into the chicken, baking soda
to denaturize and tenderize,

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.020
and salt for flavor.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.332
I'm only going to
tell you that once.

00:16:13.332 --> 00:16:14.790
Who can repeat
that-- ah, too late.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.414
I'm going to let you
forget that first.

00:16:16.414 --> 00:16:19.190
And then I'll come back there.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:23.500
All right, so you notice
I'm scraping as I go.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.470
And nothing is sticking, but
I'm still hearing a sear.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.520
That starting to smell good?

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.510
Questions so far.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.510
Questions so far.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.800
Questions so far.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.300
No?

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.690
If you're cooking
for a party, how

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.250
do you do it if
you're into catering?

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:43.320
Everything I just put in there
can be cooked right through

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.840
and then cooled--
This is a good how

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.510
do you cook Pad
Thai for 50 people--

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.480
and then held that way.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.830
So in a restaurant, I get a
ticket, pick up Pad Thai, boom.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.460
And then I can start
from this phase.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.999
Does that make sense?

00:16:56.999 --> 00:16:58.790
It's a very efficient
way to cook Pad Thai.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.140
You're like, I don't care, man.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.140
I'm cooking for four.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.810
Shut up.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.260
OK, here we go.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
My proteins are
about 80% cooked.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.106
I can continue.

00:17:08.106 --> 00:17:09.980
Because I don't want to
cook my proteins 100%

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.720
because I still have a few
more things to put in there.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.720
Noodles.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.490
This is rice stick.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:20.680
Dry rice noodle
made in Thailand.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.210
Not Thai sticks, rice sticks.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.200
You're in trouble.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.710
I always wait for the laugh,
because that person's busted.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.418
If you don't know what
I'm talking about,

00:17:30.418 --> 00:17:31.490
better you for it.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.240
Google it.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.470
Google it right now.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.950
OK, so rice sticks have
soaked in warm water

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.120
for about 40 minutes.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.330
Keeping them in water,
I'm pulling them out.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.965
Because once that residual
moisture hits the pan,

00:17:45.965 --> 00:17:46.995
it creates what?

00:17:46.995 --> 00:17:47.800
AUDIENCE: Steam.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.900
JET TILA: And I need that.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.600
I need that steam, right?

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.110
And these rice sticks come in
different sizes by millimeter.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:58.080
This is a small, which is
about a two millimeter.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.110
And they go all the way
up to eight millimeter.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.000
I like the two--
smalls and mediums.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.040
Don't go any crazier than that.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.240
All right, so the
noodle needs to morph.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.900
It needs to steam.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.970
It needs to sear.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.230
So we're going to keep an
eye on this new noodle.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.020
And you're going to
help me determine

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.750
when to put the sauce in.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.250
Because if I put the sauce
in now, I'm boiling noodles.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.420
I'm not getting that beautiful
steamed chewy mouth feel,

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:23.920
right?

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.054
AUDIENCE: This is
the trickiest part.

00:18:25.054 --> 00:18:25.554
I've never--

00:18:25.554 --> 00:18:27.800
JET TILA: This is the
hardest, hardest part.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.020
AUDIENCE: This is
where I always mess up.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.228
JET TILA: And also because
if you go thicker noodles,

00:18:31.228 --> 00:18:32.180
it takes longer.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.360
So, do you want another
secret tip for Pad Thai?

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.860
If you had a little bit of
boiling water on the side,

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.710
you dip these for literally
one second up and down,

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.890
throw them into the
pan, that will give you

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.369
that nice chewy mouth feel.

00:18:48.369 --> 00:18:49.160
AUDIENCE: So even--

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.020
JET TILA: You've expedited.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.103
AUDIENCE: So what you're
saying, even after you've

00:18:52.103 --> 00:18:54.913
soakied some noodles in
the water for a while,

00:18:54.913 --> 00:18:57.290
you go back another [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.240
JET TILA: Such a
fast dip, right?

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.790
And another thing,
if your home stoves--

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.280
if you're at this point and
you don't hear this-- everyone

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.730
listen.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.170
If you don't hear that sizzle,
your pan is way out of temp.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.220
It's too cool.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.430
And your noodles
will never get there.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.200
So that's why you do
your speed dip, OK?

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.910
So is it changing?

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.926
What do we notice
about these noodles?

00:19:19.926 --> 00:19:21.790
AUDIENCE: They look like they're
going to get all sticky on you.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.000
JET TILA: They almost
look cooked, don't they?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.290
Now I know I'm ready for sauce.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.430
Because we needed
them to change.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.290
And again, this is the hardest
part about Pad Thai right here.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.800
All right, sauce.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.720
In Thailand, old school
Pad Thai 40 years ago

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.030
was not nuclear orange in color.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.050
It came to America--

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.350
AUDIENCE: With ketchup, right?

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.190
JET TILA: Ah.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.090
Well, I mean, I don't know
how Tommy Tang does it.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.320
I'm kidding.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.000
But yes, you are
absolutely right.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.790
In America, when we started
doing this about 40 years ago

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.750
in the restaurant, we're
like, American people

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.800
don't eat spice.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.480
What we do to give
them that little pop?

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.710
Little bit of paprika.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.840
But in Thailand, you
don't do paprika.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.950
You go to sriracha, right?

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.202
So you have the choice
is what I'm saying.

00:20:11.202 --> 00:20:12.910
If you're cooking for
the little kiddies,

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.370
I would not put the
sriracha or the chili.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.119
I would do a little
bit of paprika just

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:19.160
to give it some interest.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.250
You see that color?

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.740
It really builds
in a nice color.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.050
Was that last thing we swore on?

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.630
What did we swear?

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.990
Taste as you go, guys.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.617
This is a perfect op to taste.

00:20:29.617 --> 00:20:31.700
Because you're going to
know now, like, well dude,

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.700
did I put enough sauce in?

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.670
Did I put enough paprika in?

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.558
AUDIENCE: Where I
mess up is the noodles

00:20:37.558 --> 00:20:38.905
will start to break apart--

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:39.446
JET TILA: Yes

00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:42.170
AUDIENCE: --added
too much sauce for--

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.820
JET TILA: Yes.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.320
Another thing you
might be doing too

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.870
is you're putting the
sauce in too early.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:51.290
If the noodles cook through,
they become very tough, right?

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.980
Yeah, they become a little on
the tough-- in a pleasant way.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.310
Now, because the American
expectation of Pad Thai,

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.670
is a little sweet, I would tend
to lean to that sweet side.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.140
I like that sweetness
in Pad Thai.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.090
It's one of the few dishes that
it's OK to be a little sweet.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:09.180
So the noodles are
about 75%, 80% done.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.790
Here's is our last phase.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.140
A mixture of scallions.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.450
Two inch sliced scallions
and some Julian scallions.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.850
I really like that look.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.260
Peanut.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.530
We roasted these
peanuts ourselves,

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.010
crushed them ourselves.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.500
And a little bit of bean sprout
on and a little on the side.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.000
So I'm just going to tuck all
those ingredients together.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.650
Let them steam together
so that bean sprouts

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.380
yield a little bit,
the scallions loosen up

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.840
that really strong flavor
and sweeten up a little bit.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.840
Let me tell you a trick.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.120
Your last trick.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.760
Let's all acknowledge and admit
that the Italians stole pasta

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.364
from Chinese people.

00:21:49.364 --> 00:21:50.530
Let's get it out of the way.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.485
So the secret of using pasta
water to get a little tight,

00:21:54.485 --> 00:21:58.810
like, a nice glaze--
that was Chinese, yo.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.717
That was Chinese, OK?

00:22:00.717 --> 00:22:02.300
I'm going to do a
little more paprika,

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.370
and I'm going to
finish this dish.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.600
Questions on Pad Thai yet?

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.066
You're going to eat this, so--

00:22:07.066 --> 00:22:09.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.652
JET TILA: How sensitive is--

00:22:10.652 --> 00:22:11.860
AUDIENCE: What we're cooking.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.030
JET TILA: Oh, very,
very sensitive.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:19.280
Your gauge-- you have two
primary gauge-- or things

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.560
you don't want to over cook.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.890
One is the protein.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.440
Two is the noodle.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.980
So as long as you
put your noodles

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.370
in when the chicken isn't
totally dust and dry,

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.940
that's the first good.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.400
And second, as you start
to feel this dish, when

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.544
the noodles overcook,
they'll actually break down.

00:22:37.544 --> 00:22:38.960
Can I have the
black plate please?

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.459
Right?

00:22:39.459 --> 00:22:40.360
Does that make sense?

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.310
So I'm going to play
it up, and just one

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.944
how I want you to plate this.

00:22:43.944 --> 00:22:45.610
And in the rest, we'll
just do portions.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:51.260
So I'm cutting this lime not
down the core of the middle.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.680
I'm going off to
one side, right?

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.440
I think this is the
cutting surface.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.140
I think chef just,
like, lost his mind.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.410
He was like, don't cut on that!

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.720
Don't cut on that!

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.977
All right, so this is-- I'll
plate the portion that-- when

00:23:04.977 --> 00:23:06.810
you're cooking on a
date, this is how you're

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:07.690
going to play it up, all right?

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.120
If you're already married,
then just give it a plate.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.556
Who cares?

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:13.290
OK, I'm kidding.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.620
So, I know.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.100
What a jerk.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.072
What a jerk, right?

00:23:18.072 --> 00:23:19.280
So the noodles on the bottom.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.220
Don't forget your
nice proteins on top.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.380
Leave some negative space.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.820
Because you eat with
your eyes, right?

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.480
And then, I'm going to engineer
this dish a little bit.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.150
So I need to call
out a few things.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:37.880
I need to call out bean
sprout on one side.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.550
I left a good amount of
negative space for bean sprouts.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.900
I'm such a nerd,
it's not even funny.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.870
I had to pretend to
be cool in school

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.490
because I was such a nerd.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:51.640
I'm going to call out lime,
in case you need more lime.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.567
And I'm going to call out
peanut on this kind of tucked

00:23:54.567 --> 00:23:55.150
into the side.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:01.210
And then, I'm going to do
a little peanut on top.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.860
And then I'm going to call
out a little bit of scallion.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:05.610
So there you go.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:09.340
That is the dish
pre-marriage, and here's

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.671
the dish post-marriage.

00:24:11.671 --> 00:24:14.970
Dinner's ready!

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.340
But this is like, hon,
I really like you.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.120
I'll cook like this forever.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.850
No you won't.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:22.750
Yeah.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.295
OK, so Julie on the side here
is going to dish this out.

00:24:25.295 --> 00:24:25.836
Thanks, guys.

00:24:25.836 --> 00:24:27.186
Thank you very much.

00:24:27.186 --> 00:24:29.027
All right, questions?

00:24:29.027 --> 00:24:29.526
Yo.

00:24:29.526 --> 00:24:31.359
AUDIENCE: Do you have
an order of operations

00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:32.479
when you're doing shrimp?

00:24:32.479 --> 00:24:33.270
JET TILA: Uh, yeah.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.644
The order of
operations on shrimp

00:24:34.644 --> 00:24:37.076
is, does shrimp cook faster
or slower than chicken?

00:24:37.076 --> 00:24:37.890
AUDIENCE: Faster.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.380
JET TILA: Then put it right
in right before the noodles.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.990
Put it in at the same time,
but don't let it cook as long.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.040
Does that makes sense?

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.580
Let the eggs be more cooked.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.370
OK, just mind your protein.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:49.400
I'm going to grab that
pan right behind you.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:49.970
You're good.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.440
Don't-- everyone's just freeze.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:57.460
You're better off not moving
and getting in my way, OK?

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.192
Questions?

00:24:58.192 --> 00:25:01.114
AUDIENCE: If you were going
to [INAUDIBLE] with fire--

00:25:01.114 --> 00:25:02.780
JET TILA: Oh yeah,
so just lay them out.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.710
People can grab their own.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:04.209
Yeah?

00:25:04.209 --> 00:25:05.620
AUDIENCE: How would the fire be?

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.130
JET TILA: How would the fire be?

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.430
Phenomenal question.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:09.470
This is how I cook, OK?

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.420
So I only can speak for myself.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.290
I let that fire rip.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:19.030
My heat is always
on full maximum.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.740
I control my heat by
putting ingredients in,

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.510
not by doing this.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.250
Oh my god, it's on.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:24.740
No, it's off.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.240
No, it's on.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:25.960
No, it's off.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.835
Because you know why?

00:25:26.835 --> 00:25:28.450
You'll forget.

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.000
You'll forget that it's on,
and you're be like, damn it.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.500
I've lost my sear.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.770
So that technique takes
a little time to master.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.170
But that's how I
cook, and that's

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.160
how I teach my chefs to cook.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.500
When we're in the restaurant,
first thing before service

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.490
starts, I rip all my burners.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.690
They're just all on fire.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.680
And I had to temps of
oven in the kitchen.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:54.160
Max like 400 or 500 degrees,
or like 300 degrees.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.800
I have two temps, and that's it.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.750
This is my control right here.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.424
This is it, OK?

00:26:00.424 --> 00:26:00.924
Questions?

00:26:00.924 --> 00:26:01.424
Pad Thai?

00:26:01.424 --> 00:26:02.659
Let's go to the next.

00:26:02.659 --> 00:26:03.950
The next one's a little easier.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.712
OK, what you need to
learn about this dish.

00:26:06.712 --> 00:26:08.920
Julie is going to be passing
around, so don't be shy.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.020
Because we're a family.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.080
Let's just circulate.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.620
Eat.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.300
This team over here.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.460
Oh wait, yeah, beauty shots
for Twitter, Instagram.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:26.300
@jettila, @jettila, @jettila,
@jettila, all right?

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.129
Pad Thai does not hold well.

00:26:28.129 --> 00:26:30.170
So it's one of the things--
rip it and get it out

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:31.045
within a few minutes.

00:26:31.045 --> 00:26:34.210
Like, [SNAPS FINGERS] Not a
good dish to take to potluck.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:38.070
What is cool about Pad Thai
is, bring it in pieces,

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.430
cook it there, and you
look like a rock star.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.070
So remember that cook all
the proteins together.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.550
So bring all your
proteins cooked.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.820
Bring your noodles.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.070
And then bring your garnishes.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:50.510
Just three different, like,
Tupperware containers.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.430
You need a skillet, you need
oil, and you're jamming.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.560
And all of a sudden, they're
like, hey, what's your number?

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.900
All right, I'm going to make
sauce for drunken noodles.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.880
New noodle to learn.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.499
What were those noodles called?

00:27:03.499 --> 00:27:04.415
AUDIENCE: Rice sticks.

00:27:04.415 --> 00:27:06.020
JET TILA: Who said that first?

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.040
Who said that first?

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.446
Rice sticks, yay.

00:27:12.682 --> 00:27:14.640
What was that other trivia
question that I had?

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.300
What was that really
difficult one?

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:16.800
Go.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.174
You should have
raised your hand.

00:27:18.174 --> 00:27:19.479
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] salt.

00:27:19.479 --> 00:27:20.770
JET TILA: Oh, pick your poison.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.587
You want fish
sauce or sweet soy?

00:27:22.587 --> 00:27:23.420
AUDIENCE: Sweet soy.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.160
JET TILA: Go.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.210
Sweet soy.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.530
That's you, all right.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:27.650
There will be more prizes.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:28.733
There will be more prizes.

00:27:28.733 --> 00:27:30.580
OK, new noodle.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.870
This will be a trivia
question later on.

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:40.510
In English, these are
fresh rice noodles.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.900
In Chinese, we call them ho fun.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.490
Ho fun, OK?

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.150
In Thai, oh, they're sen yai.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.830
Wide noodles, all right?

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.400
So let's see if you remember
all three of those, OK?

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.370
They come in the deli section.

00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:02.440
Non-refrigerated, room temp,
only good for about 24 hours.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.030
They're circulated out every 24.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.260
The test on whether
they're fresh or not is

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.050
you grab the pack, do this.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.800
And if they bend
without breaking,

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.170
this is a fresh bloody noodle.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.430
The secret of bringing
this noodle back,

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.820
though, in the
restaurant setting,

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.140
fridge them immediately
fresh, throw them

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.800
in the steamer in the bag.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.750
It's kind of like suvi.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.670
And let them come
back up in the steamer

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.450
in the bag, which is
what we did today.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.300
Because these were
bought three days ago.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.050
But this is how you
get them back, OK?

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.840
At Wazuzu, my restaurant
at Win Las Vegas,

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.590
we did 150 to 250 orders
a day of this dish.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.340
Each dish had a pound
of noodles in it.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.980
You don't even want to know
what the calorie count is.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:48.920
Don't ask.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.430
Let's make sauce.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.330
Pad Thai is very Thai.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.300
Drunken noodles is a
hybrid of Thai and Chinese.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.590
We can pick into that, guys.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.950
Don't be shy.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.150
All right, if it was me,
I'd be jamming into that,

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.600
so-- let's build
this sauce together.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.000
Oyster, because it's
the Chinese roots.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.250
Yeah, here, put it over here.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.208
Get it on my face, man.

00:29:10.208 --> 00:29:11.631
Come on, put it over there.

00:29:11.631 --> 00:29:12.130
I'm kidding.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.380
Why are you in my way, man?

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.296
I'm getting kidding, I'm
kidding, I'm kidding.

00:29:15.296 --> 00:29:16.190
Oyster.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.020
What flavor is that?

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.450
What flavor's oyster?

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.300
Everything, basically, right?

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.350
Everything.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.520
Fish sauce.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.880
Salt.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.161
And I've got to make
enough for all of us.

00:29:30.161 --> 00:29:30.660
Heat.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.170
Your real sriracha.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:37.875
Real sriracha here.

00:29:40.667 --> 00:29:41.750
Renee, take this with you.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.666
That's my gift to you.

00:29:42.666 --> 00:29:44.140
There you go.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.635
All right, I need a
little sugar for sweet.

00:29:48.635 --> 00:29:50.176
AUDIENCE: What's
your favorite sugar?

00:29:50.176 --> 00:29:54.710
JET TILA: Uh, I got to tell
you, if I'm not being fussy,

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:57.080
in every restaurant I've
ever operated in America

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.140
without buying palm, I use
brown sugar all day long.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:00.910
Light brown sugar.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.069
AUDIENCE: How do you
get so it doesn't stick?

00:30:03.069 --> 00:30:05.360
JET TILA: The brown sug--
oh, there's a million things.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.401
You put like a little--
what do you put in there.

00:30:07.401 --> 00:30:10.380
Like a little disk of
clay or whatever that is.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.090
I've never let it
sit long enough.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.220
AUDIENCE: Oh, if it's
airtight, it won't--

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:13.844
JET TILA: Yeah.

00:30:13.844 --> 00:30:15.320
AUDIENCE: --they
won't, you know.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.704
And also, you can put a piece
of white bread in there.

00:30:17.704 --> 00:30:18.620
JET TILA: White bread.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:19.745
AUDIENCE: And it-- totally.

00:30:19.745 --> 00:30:21.660
The bread comes
out like dry toast.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.292
But like 24 hours
later, your sugar

00:30:24.292 --> 00:30:26.950
is totally like powdered sugar.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.370
JET TILA: So I'm
not going to lie.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.740
A lot of restaurants--
we're not using this today--

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.070
do add a little bit
of chicken powder.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:39.130
The Chinese secret to umami is
adding a little chicken powder

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:39.630
to this.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.296
And you're like, what
is chicken powder?

00:30:41.296 --> 00:30:42.200
Bullion cubes.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.741
You guys know what
I'm talking about?

00:30:43.741 --> 00:30:47.750
That gives you so much
umami pop for a dish.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.290
So if you're ever
cooking at home,

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:52.090
and you're like, that doesn't
taste like the restaurant,

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.140
they're probably
putting in a little bit

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.610
of MSG, a little bit
of chicken powder.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:55.350
Just so you know.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.620
I'm just being brutally
honest with you.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.520
OK, sauce is done.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.540
Delicious.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.060
Tip-- if you take the recipe
and you're like, dude,

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.590
I'm going to do this all
the time-- because you

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.900
know how you get that
recipe and you do it, like,

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.080
once a week for
like three weeks,

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.454
and then it becomes
once a month,

00:31:09.454 --> 00:31:12.090
and then it becomes
once every five years?

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:15.800
Take the recipe of sauce only,
multiply that by 5 or 10 or 20,

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.270
and put it in a squeeze bottle.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:19.420
And look really cool
when you cook, OK?

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.780
Don't do this every
time you want to cook.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.190
If you love a recipe, up
multiply it one time, OK?

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.890
All right, let's do this.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.630
Chef here loves you so much.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.330
We use rice bran oil.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:35.505
That's like adamantium
or like diamond dust,

00:31:35.505 --> 00:31:36.380
you know what I mean?

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.296
Like, he's using, like,
the-- I'm such a nerd.

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:39.630
I'm going to shut up now.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.680
OK, so what am I looking for?

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.970
All right, garlic,
aromatics, stay still.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:49.970
Can we eat spicy here?

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.845
Anyone scared?

00:31:51.845 --> 00:31:53.090
No?

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.460
All right.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.357
Onion.

00:31:57.357 --> 00:31:58.440
How many am I cooking for?

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.100
OK.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.191
Onion.

00:32:02.191 --> 00:32:02.690
Chili.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.305
What, you wimping out on me now?

00:32:08.305 --> 00:32:10.490
I'm kidding.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:14.180
I've got some-- basically
cherry tomatoes.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.670
Grape tomatoes work
really well too.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.330
And now I've got protein.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:22.140
Don't breathe in the smoke
if you are chili sensitive.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.410
I've just made chili smoke.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.805
[FAKE COUGHS] I'm
kidding, I'm kidding.

00:32:28.805 --> 00:32:31.310
I'm kidding.

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.290
OK.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:34.780
Now I'm going-- It's nice
to have a nice, wide cooking

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:35.280
surface.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.960
I think I've just proven
these are pretty bad-ass.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.410
You can buy one of these,
and they work really well.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:47.660
OK, so, because they're
not in a blazing hot wok,

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.790
I might do this
one in two steps.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:54.150
Because I want that beautiful
kind of wok fire taste,

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.542
I'm going to cook this down,
separate it out, and then start

00:32:57.542 --> 00:32:58.500
the noodles separately.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.970
If I was doing just like
one to four portion,

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:05.750
I would do it all in this pan.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.930
But because I'm doing so
much, I'm not going to.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.044
I'm going to do two pans.

00:33:10.044 --> 00:33:10.710
OK, there we go.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.480
That pan's going
to heat up again.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.700
Rice bran oil.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.246
I'm going to, like, jack
some and take it home.

00:33:17.246 --> 00:33:20.310
It's such nice oil, it's crazy.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:22.874
All right, so what
am i waiting for?

00:33:22.874 --> 00:33:23.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:24.890
JET TILA: Very good, guys.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:25.815
Very good.

00:33:25.815 --> 00:33:27.940
Best tip so far that you're
going to take with you.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.660
Just fire one off.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.280
Best tip, best
cooking tip so far.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.363
AUDIENCE: Taste your food.

00:33:32.363 --> 00:33:33.690
JET TILA: Taste your food.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.313
What else?

00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:36.610
AUDIENCE: Keep the noodles wet.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.130
JET TILA: Keep noodles wet.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:38.825
Very good.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.710
So remember my
technique for eggs.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.620
I don't pre-scramble.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.650
I hate that.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.720
Doesn't look professional to me.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.930
I break yolks.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:51.900
I allow to coagulate.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:57.380
Do I dare?

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:57.970
Do I dare?

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.790
Yes, Yes, it's not
freaking out on me.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:01.840
99.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.955
We're going all the way, dude.

00:34:03.955 --> 00:34:05.405
We're going all the way.

00:34:05.405 --> 00:34:07.030
Those eggs are going
to come out faster

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.870
than that because of
this induction burner.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:10.880
It's a Great burner.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:15.409
OK, so the eggs are
starting to coagulate.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:17.550
And I really love
that separation

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.929
between yolk and white.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:20.270
It's so important to me.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.449
I want to sear my noodles now.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:31.120
That's fresh right there.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.669
That's super fresh.

00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:33.710
And these come pre-oiled.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.320
They come actually from the
factory with a little oil,

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.729
or they would stick like crazy.

00:34:38.729 --> 00:34:40.020
Are we going to feed-- oh yeah.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.110
You guys will eat it all.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:43.973
I don't think I made
enough Pad Thai.

00:34:43.973 --> 00:34:45.639
If you do want to
hang right after this,

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.425
I'll make another
quick batch of Pad Thai

00:34:47.425 --> 00:34:49.768
because I have all those
proteins ready to go.

00:34:49.768 --> 00:34:51.250
OK.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.080
So with these noodles, I want
them to get that sear love.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.540
So I'm not going to rush them.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.930
I'm not going to rush them.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.490
I'm going to let them sear up.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.570
And I like how the eggs
are going to marry well.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.820
Crank that other
pan up back there.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.580
Let's just get that going.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.970
And we could split the
task and get some heat.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.330
Questions so far?

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.532
Is this anything like
you did the other night?

00:35:16.532 --> 00:35:19.314
AUDIENCE: No, I
misspoke. [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:19.314 --> 00:35:20.230
JET TILA: What's that?

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.300
AUDIENCE: We had
done the Pad Thai.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.758
JET TILA: Oh, you
did Pad Thai, OK.

00:35:22.758 --> 00:35:25.370
Very difficult, isn't it,
to do really good Pad Thai?

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.890
AUDIENCE: I don't think I got
the right noodles [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.406
JET TILA: Oh really?

00:35:28.406 --> 00:35:29.790
AUDIENCE: --in getting
[INAUDIBLE] together.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.290
JET TILA: You got
right noodles now.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:32.134
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:32.134 --> 00:35:33.530
JET TILA: All right.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.030
When that pan gets screaming,
put oil in it and let me know.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:38.363
You're going to cook half of
this over there, all right?

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:45.150
Questions about anything
cooking related?

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:48.740
One more time.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:49.910
White and black vinegar.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:50.670
Flavor?

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:56.020
Black vinegar is very almost
like balsamic-tasting.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.410
It's got a fruit note to it.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:00.650
Like a deep-- almost
like a plumb note.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:03.960
Good for dipping, not
really for cooking.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.790
Good for souping and
good for dipping.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:07.740
Good questions.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.620
Any other question?

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:12.270
OK.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.650
So, you screaming?

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.887
You'll get there.

00:36:17.887 --> 00:36:18.720
All right, Pad Thai.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.530
Thought?

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.056
Comments?

00:36:21.056 --> 00:36:21.860
That good?

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.060
JET TILA: Can you
do that at home now?

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.185
AUDIENCE: Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:25.185 --> 00:36:26.424
JET TILA: Totally could.

00:36:26.424 --> 00:36:28.090
How do you know when
they're done-- then

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:29.570
what I'm looking for here?

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:34.200
I am looking for-- you know
what raw dough feels like?

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.435
And then you know what--
when you take raw dough

00:36:36.435 --> 00:36:39.150
and bake it in the oven, it
becomes bread or something?

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:43.330
I'm looking for the edges
to get slightly more opaque.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:45.350
The dough will get
opaque, and the dough

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.520
will get that crust to it.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.730
That's what I'm looking for.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.739
Best analogy i can come up with.

00:36:50.739 --> 00:36:51.780
Pretty damn good analogy.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.517
I'm going to remember that one.

00:36:53.517 --> 00:36:55.100
OK, so you're going
to do this, Julie.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.558
I'm going to give
you half of this.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:02.030
The old switcheroony.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:04.800
I'm going to give her
half of my noodles.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.700
I'm going to steal
half of this protein.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.810
I need that because
we were overwhelming

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.160
this cooking surface
with products.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.119
So I'm not getting-- I'm
not allowing the sear.

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:15.618
Here you go.

00:37:15.618 --> 00:37:16.482
Take that with you.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.380
All right.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:24.980
You really don't want more than
about, let's say, 60% to 65%

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.660
volume, or you're going
to lose your sear.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.964
So now I've got a
good sear happening.

00:37:30.964 --> 00:37:32.880
I'm really going to take
this where I want it.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.671
Yeah, check it out.

00:37:33.671 --> 00:37:35.910
Come hang out.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:36.686
Next ingredient.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:41.840
Thai basal.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.329
What is-- who's never
smelled it by itself?

00:37:46.329 --> 00:37:47.370
Don't give it back to me.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:48.036
I don't want it.

00:37:48.036 --> 00:37:52.181
Just pick a-- pick-- here,
take this out there with you.

00:37:52.181 --> 00:37:52.680
Pick a leaf.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:57.680
Don't-- save your answers until
we all smell this together.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.770
Pick a leaf, pass it on.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:37:59.728
It's aroma-therapeutic.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.080
Thai basal.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.880
Product identification.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.680
Purple stem, first
of all, right?

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.340
Green leaf.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.510
Kind of this veiny profile.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.850
Smells like, raise your hand.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:15.640
Smells like?

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.640
AUDIENCE: Toothpaste.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.250
JET TILA: Toothpaste.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:19.680
He's not incorrect.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.140
What is that herb?

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:21.926
Smells like?

00:38:21.926 --> 00:38:23.052
AUDIENCE: Mint.

00:38:23.052 --> 00:38:24.260
JET TILA: Going to go deeper.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.560
JET TILA: You two.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.420
There you go.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.072
Pick one.

00:38:30.072 --> 00:38:32.036
All right, there you go.

00:38:32.036 --> 00:38:33.020
Done.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.010
Calm down, calm down.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:36.000
There you go.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.810
OK, so here we go.

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:43.510
So now, I've got
sear, I've got opaque.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:48.380
Chicken is 60% to 75% done.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.166
You getting a sear over there?

00:38:51.166 --> 00:38:51.804
Good.

00:38:51.804 --> 00:38:52.470
You've got time.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.430
I'll do this one
first, you'll catch up.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:56.026
Chicken.

00:38:56.026 --> 00:38:57.400
What was in the
chicken marinade?

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.044
Not you.

00:38:58.044 --> 00:38:58.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.780
JET TILA: Who answered?

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.280
Go.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:06.646
AUDIENCE: Uh, it was
oil, salt, [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:06.646 --> 00:39:07.690
JET TILA: Oh, you win.

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.106
All right, I've
got gifts for you.

00:39:09.106 --> 00:39:09.954
Perfect, excellent.

00:39:09.954 --> 00:39:10.870
All right, here we go.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:11.370
Sauce.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:17.144
JET TILA: Sorry?

00:39:17.144 --> 00:39:18.786
AUDIENCE: What was
in the sauce again?

00:39:18.786 --> 00:39:20.410
JET TILA: Who wants
to raise your hand?

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:21.390
Who remembers
what's in the sauce?

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:22.640
AUDIENCE: Oh god. [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:29.670
JET TILA: Fish sauce, oyster
sauce, sweet soy sauce,

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.170
sriracha.

00:39:33.267 --> 00:39:34.100
And now I'm folding.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.440
I'm changing my tools because
the metal now with the moisture

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.710
in here will actually
tend to break.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:42.995
Last secret ingredient.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.930
Chicken bullion.

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:50.790
Basel torn right in.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:53.690
That is what makes
drunken noodles

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:57.720
different from Pad
See-ew in Thai food.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.780
And I'm not shy.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.530
Like, I've broken off, like,
the really, the lowest, lowest

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:02.390
stems.

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:04.790
I like those upper stems
that are kind of delicate.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:05.580
I like them a lot.

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.340
So I'm actually
including them in.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.110
And that goes in last.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:12.990
And we're going to basically
cook that leaf down, expose

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.536
that essential oil.

00:40:14.536 --> 00:40:16.785
And that essential oil will
bleed right into the dish.

00:40:16.785 --> 00:40:22.332
And that's what gives this dish
this kind of phenomenal aroma.

00:40:22.332 --> 00:40:24.240
AUDIENCE: Is it
[INAUDIBLE] breaking in?

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.781
JET TILA: Tom's will be breaking
in now because of the sauce.

00:40:26.781 --> 00:40:28.560
So that's why I switched over.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.610
And then the rule.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:32.234
Remember, Jet Tila's
rule number two.

00:40:32.234 --> 00:40:33.400
AUDIENCE: Taste as you cook.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.960
JET TILA: There you go.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.070
Always do that, guys.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:37.910
Because this is-- before
it hits the plate,

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:38.810
you can mess with it.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.880
You can monkey
with it, all right?

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:49.240
I'm going to just shoot off
the cuff, if you trust me.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.050
AUDIENCE: So why do
you call them drunken?

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.675
JET TILA: Drunken
noodles, because what

00:40:52.675 --> 00:40:57.960
I didn't add-- here's
the lore of this dish.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.110
It's kee mao.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.060
And if you speak to--
anyone speak Thai?

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.960
Kee mao means "the dude
who's an alcoholic."

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.940
So this dish is phenomenal
sobering up food.

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:11.470
Yeah.

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.750
On TV, though, I have
fudged it a little bit

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:16.740
and added a little rice wine.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.050
But the truth is, you
don't need it at all.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.540
But this is party food.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.394
This is like menudo Saturday
morning, [INAUDIBLE] morning

00:41:23.394 --> 00:41:25.060
after partying pretty
hard in the night.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.085
So that's it.

00:41:26.085 --> 00:41:27.210
I'm going to plate that up.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.270
Should we do a sexy plate up?

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:32.110
You want me to show
you that date plate?

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:33.000
Date plate?

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.270
I'm happy.

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:37.172
Mmm.

00:41:37.172 --> 00:41:38.648
All right, date plate.

00:41:38.648 --> 00:41:41.600
Here it is.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.370
The date date, first of all.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.375
Then the married
plate after that.

00:41:48.709 --> 00:41:50.250
AUDIENCE: All right,
you can see what

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.500
happens after you have kids.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.780
JET TILA: Yeah, oh no,
I've got kids, yeah.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.745
Then you order out.

00:41:56.745 --> 00:42:00.140
Then you don't cook any
more at home, right?

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.290
So a little portion there.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:05.630
I like call outs.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:06.750
OK, last time.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:07.709
I swear--

00:42:07.709 --> 00:42:08.500
AUDIENCE: I swear--

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.890
JET TILA: I will only use--

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:10.950
AUDIENCE: Only use--

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.910
JET TILA: Relevant garnish.

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:14.310
AUDIENCE: Relevant garnish.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.935
JET TILA: Relevant--
this is not relevant.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.792
That's just weird to me.

00:42:20.792 --> 00:42:22.250
That's actually a
relevant garnish,

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:25.160
but it doesn't-- that is not
good presentation right there.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.010
So there you go.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:27.540
You good?

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.801
You have sauce?

00:42:28.801 --> 00:42:31.010
Hold on.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.530
Questions on drunken noodles.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:34.800
Questions on drunken noodles.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.610
Who's never had this one before?

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:37.110
Never?

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:37.900
Ok, cool.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.482
All right.

00:42:38.482 --> 00:42:39.440
I'll start dishing out.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.640
As you ask questions, we'll
eat, and then we'll bounce.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.700
Who wants more Pad Thai?

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.990
All right.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.830
He ain't shy.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:51.840
Jeff, can you give me
a hand really quick?

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.048
We'll start dishing this out.

00:42:53.048 --> 00:42:55.301
I'll make another Pad
Thai while we talk.

00:42:55.301 --> 00:42:55.800
So guys.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.500
How do you get a hold of me?

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.370
What's going on?

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:59.286
You're going to watch
Cutthroat Kitchen Sunday

00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:00.370
nights, Food Network.

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:03.410
OK, Guy's Grocery Games.

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:05.760
Chefjet.com is the website.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.940
You guys know Jet Tila
is everything else.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:14.100
Next season on Parts
Unknown CNN with Bourdain,

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.380
I'll be on the Vegas episode.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:19.290
Because I was there so long,
I know-- I got a lot of homies

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:22.860
in Vegas, so-- but if
you want to hang out

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.720
for another pad thai, feel free.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.310
Cool.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:29.540
Guys, it was an absolute
pleasure cooking

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.207
for team Google.

00:43:31.207 --> 00:43:32.040
Thank you very much.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.910
Please stay in touch.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.034
Do let me know if I could
be of service in any way.

00:43:35.034 --> 00:43:37.110
Jeff, thanks for having me out.

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.814
I hope it was beneficial.

00:43:38.814 --> 00:43:40.072
I hope you learned something.

00:43:40.072 --> 00:43:41.140
Is it good?

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:42.682
Thank you.

00:43:42.682 --> 00:43:43.640
JET TILA: There you go.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.910
Tag me in all your photos.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:45.440
Thank you.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.040
I'm here for photos.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.490
Whatever you need, y'all.
