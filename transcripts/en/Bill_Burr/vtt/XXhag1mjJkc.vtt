00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.550
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:08.050
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and Ah,

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.920
just checking in on you.
Whew.

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.520
I'm just checking in on Y'all are you?
How's your week going?

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.290
My Week is going fed fucking tastic man.

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.510
<v 2>I did my special,
I taped it.
It is done.</v>

7
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:30.280
It's in the can as they say in my business and now just needs to be edited.

8
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.030
Some port pastures.
Got to look at the footage and try to put that mess together.

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.140
I want to thank everybody that came out to Royal Albert Hall in London,
England.

10
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.340
I could not have had a better time.
Um,
I just,

11
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.230
just a couple of magical nights out there and hopefully it'll show up on the

12
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.600
digital recording that we made.

13
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.790
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.960
<v 2>Somehow that it will,
that will be conveyed.
Um,</v>

15
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.680
so now I have no act and uh,
I was like,
you know what,

16
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:02.930
man,
I'm just going to stay away from the comedy clubs.

17
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:06.170
I'm just going to go live some life.
You've heard me all that yoga teachers shit.

18
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:10.280
I was saying just going to go live some life and I'm going to let the next hour

19
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:13.490
come to me.
And I was literally thinking already tonight,

20
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:15.740
I've been back for fucking 24 hours being like,

21
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.530
maybe I'll go down to the club tonight,
Dan.
I just go fuck around.

22
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.970
<v 0>No,
I am going to learn how to relax man.</v>

23
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.043
<v 2>Hello.</v>

24
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.400
Sit down and just fucking eat an avocado for whatever the fuck it is.

25
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.540
You people do that.
Know how to relax.

26
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.010
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.550
<v 2>you guys fascinate me.
You people know how to relax.
You know what I mean?</v>

28
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.440
Like you'd go to a hotel and you actually put on the robe,
right?

29
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.980
You get the slippers on and shit and then you fucking order room service.

30
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.700
You eaten like chocolate strawberries from Sherry's berries,

31
00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:56.680
whatever the fuck it is.
She do.
You know you have a spa day.
Um,
I,

32
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.930
I know I'm making fun of it but I,
I am fascinated

33
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.120
<v 0>by that.
I want to be that guy,
that guy who knows how to fucking chill man.</v>

34
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.180
Cause I don't know how to do it because this is what I do.

35
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:11.340
I go out and my two and fucking standup and then I go,

36
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:12.210
you know what I'm gonna do?

37
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.810
I'm going to get fucking 20 hours in the air in a helicopter,

38
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:19.490
or I'm going to go fucking play drums for fucking 30 hours.
Just my,

39
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:20.760
I just fill the time up.

40
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.810
<v 2>You know,
you fucking people who could just sit on a porch,</v>

41
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.370
you know,
I can't do that unless I'm slowly killing myself with booze or a cigar,

42
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.860
you know?
I can't just sit on a fuck,
give it just walk by,
you know,

43
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.190
and one of these sleepy southern towns,
you know what I mean?

44
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.670
Where they still think like Lyndon Johnson is president,
right?

45
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.690
You just walking down the fucking street and you just see somebody sitting on a

46
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:52.720
porch reading a book
and it's just,
you know,

47
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.650
that person,
they got it figured out.
You know what I mean?

48
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.340
<v 0>They walk into church on Sunday,
their head held high.</v>

49
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.180
<v 2>They've got nothing to confess.
The fuck did they do?
Huh?</v>

50
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.530
What does the big sin that they peaked a few pages forward,

51
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.700
hoping that there'd be an end of a chapter to give their eyes a break,
you know,

52
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.280
disrespecting the author and all the hard work that they put in.
Um,

53
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.080
yeah,
I'm going to try to fucking chill out here at least for three days.

54
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.130
I'm going to try to do,
uh,
nothing,
but I mean,

55
00:03:28.131 --> 00:03:30.920
I also have a table read tomorrow for F is for family.
So that's something

56
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.260
and uh,
whatever,
what are you gonna do,
you know,

57
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.460
haven't shit to do is better than having nothing to do right around my fucking

58
00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:43.580
that up.
What's the,
because at that fork in the road,

59
00:03:43.581 --> 00:03:47.390
I chose boo boos rather than we'd,

60
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.790
you know,
the people who choose,
we'd,
they liked the people that like,
you know,

61
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.790
their dream in life is to retire.

62
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.050
<v 2>And people who drink their dream in life is to tell people what to do and the</v>

64
00:04:03.051 --> 00:04:04.190
people go out and do it.

65
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.690
All
right.
I'm painting with a broad brush here,

66
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:14.540
but that's what I do on this podcast.
All right.

67
00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:18.080
None of this is fucking necessarily worked out.
You know,

68
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.160
there's the occasional goddamn setlist.
All right,
let's,
let's,
let's go.

69
00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:26.750
You know what I always do when I go to put together a new hour is I have to go

70
00:04:26.751 --> 00:04:31.340
topical.
Let's say what said the news?
Everybody.
R Kelly.

71
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.940
<v 2>Bobby Kelly.
My good,
my old roommate just playing Magoo obese,</v>

73
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.330
but the other art Kelly the singer,
right.

74
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.490
I'm trying to think of one of his fucking songs.
I used to know,

75
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.310
I used to know his songs.
Then they took the,
the videos away from MTV.

76
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.110
Like the last one I saw that he made was the one where you was sitting down and

77
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:59.100
he had half his head braided while summer was Braden is the other part of his

78
00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:01.800
fucking head.
You know,

79
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.870
and God knows what happened to that poor woman judge you by that fucking debacle

80
00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:08.140
of an interview.
Okay.

81
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.220
<v 0>Hi.
It's me.
It's my love Audi here.
Fight for my fucking life,
man.
Like</v>

82
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.800
<v 2>he is,
he is fucked.</v>

83
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.610
That's okay.

84
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.010
<v 0>All I got out of that I had not yet.
Uh,</v>

85
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:24.400
I am an innocent man accused of some shit that I didn't do.
What I,

86
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:25.750
the vibe from that

87
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.090
<v 2>is I am fucked.
Um,
they got me this time.</v>

88
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:32.920
God dammit.
Um,

89
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.033
<v 1>yeah.</v>

90
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.820
<v 2>Well,
you know,</v>

91
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.090
it was fucking hilarious when that guy was standing up screaming and yelling and

92
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.870
that woman just sat there,
right?

93
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.830
How that became the opportunity for other Douche bags on the Internet to try and

94
00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:54.330
bring up some male female point,
you know,

95
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.310
to literally try to wedge

96
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.350
they're fucking Goddamn agenda.
So we're literally talking about a guy who,

97
00:06:01.351 --> 00:06:05.400
if they're say,
and what he did,
if he did what they say what he did,

98
00:06:05.401 --> 00:06:06.990
this guy is a fucking monster.

99
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.620
This is about getting this fucking guy off of the Goddamn street before we can

100
00:06:10.621 --> 00:06:14.990
do this to somebody else.
But these selfish fucking assholes on the Internet.
Nah,

101
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:19.050
Nah,
Nah.
We're gonna notice when he screams and yells and that reporter,

102
00:06:19.051 --> 00:06:23.520
she just sat there.
So stoically so defintely feel privacy.

103
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.790
That's what they teach you.
They teach you that in journalism class.

104
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.180
What do you think a guy would have stood up and fought him?

105
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.440
So then all these women pile on and they start telling these stories of sitting

106
00:06:34.441 --> 00:06:37.800
quietly as their boyfriend punched the wall right next to their head.

107
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.940
These selfish fucking assholes took this moment in time,

108
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.050
uh,
a pedophile on alleged pedophile,

109
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:52.070
freaking the fuck out and all those victims,
fuck all of them.

110
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.100
It's about you and whatever fucking went down during your fucking relationship

111
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:00.380
and how you are a total fucking victim.
You know what?

112
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.990
I got one thing to say to you guys,
ladies.

113
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.433
<v 3>All right,</v>

114
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.710
<v 2>well we'll,
we'll fucking get to you on this one.</v>

115
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.710
This is about the women who actually were fucking a victim of this guy.

116
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.830
Stop trying to fucking,
you know,
you know what it's like.

117
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:19.990
It's like back in the day,
whenever I see stuff about hair metal bands in the,

118
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.770
in the 80s on the sunset strip,

119
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:24.530
and you'd go up and you'd staple your fucking banner,

120
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.470
your little flyer up to a telephone pole,

121
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:30.470
and then two seconds later somebody else would staple.
There's over yours.

122
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.200
That's what the fuck is going on.
It even happens on shit like this.

123
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:34.490
It's so God damn shameless.

124
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.193
<v 3>You know</v>

125
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.560
<v 2>it ladies,
you got to ask yourself something.
All right.</v>

126
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.840
If more than one time a man in your life punches a hole in a wall right near

127
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:49.250
your head,
at any point,
is there any sort of self reflection where you're like,

128
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:51.020
why do I keep picking this guy?

129
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.910
Or what exactly is it that I'm saying to the opposite sex that is causing this

130
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:56.744
behavior?

131
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.390
Speaking from experience.
You know,

132
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.650
I remember when I got to my mid thirties and I was like,
dude,
chicks a fucking,

133
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.510
they're all fucking Psychos,
you know?
And by then I was just like,
wait a minute,

134
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:11.240
but what are you doing?
What are you doing?

135
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.703
<v 3>You know?</v>

136
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.070
<v 2>And I actually turned around and I looked at myself and I said,
oh,</v>

137
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.780
this is what I'm doing.
You know?
And then I,
I decided to stop,
you know,

138
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.200
fishing in the same area,
pulling out the same God damn fish.

139
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.383
<v 3>Right.</v>

140
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.310
<v 2>I blamed the victim in all of that.</v>

141
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.970
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

142
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.770
<v 2>It's all you women out there who you know,
shaking the plaster out your hair,</v>

143
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.280
you know,
every once in a while,
you know,

144
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.390
every once in awhile it might be you.
I'm just saying like,

145
00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:48.391
just say one out of 3 million times when someone punches a wall near your head,

146
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.690
maybe you shouldn't bring up things about his family or whatever the fuck it is

147
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.500
that you said,
uh,
blows other times,
you know,

148
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:02.390
the guys who are aggressive and they shouldn't do that.
And um,
you know,

149
00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:05.060
maybe they wouldn't be so many home depots out there if there weren't so many

150
00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:06.470
guys with misdirected anger,

151
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.630
punching holes right next to their girlfriends heads.

152
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.820
A R Kelly,
could you,
uh,
just shut up for a second with your pedophilia.

153
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:19.230
This woman here has some plaster in her hair and she would like to,
uh,

154
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.490
tell her story while this is going down,
if you don't mind.
Um,

155
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:29.140
alright,
plowing ahead here.
So,
uh,
oh,

156
00:09:29.141 --> 00:09:31.060
you know what,
I got into the premier league a little bit,

157
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.030
cause I know Liverpool was up by one point.
And from what I heard,

158
00:09:34.031 --> 00:09:38.020
by the time we get to Manchester,
man city was up by one point.

159
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:40.603
<v 3>So</v>

160
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.190
<v 2>let's see.
Premiere league standings.
Oh,</v>

161
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.160
and everybody's trying to explain offsides to me.

162
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.280
And all they can say is the reason why they have offsides is so people won't

163
00:09:51.281 --> 00:09:55.690
hang down at the other end of the net.
And other end of the pitch,
it's like,
well,

164
00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:59.590
why don't you just have a blue line like hockey?
All right.

165
00:09:59.591 --> 00:10:02.650
And then nobody can hang down by the other goal and then on.

166
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:07.540
And then if somebody bringing it down the fucking field and they're faster than

167
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.990
the defensive line,
they get past.
I mean,

168
00:10:10.991 --> 00:10:14.110
you have what's known in hockey as a break away.

169
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.310
The crowd gets on its feet and that's exciting.
Hey Scott,

170
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.420
Jesus fucking Christ,
he scored,

171
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.550
don't understand it.
I understand the not hanging thing.
Oh Man.

172
00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:34.730
City up by one fucking point.

173
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.050
All right.
And I,
I realized that somebody told me I was wrong,

174
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:42.363
<v 3>that uh,</v>

175
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.780
<v 2>they don't have Saudi Arabia and money behind them.
Uh,
they have,</v>

176
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:53.080
uh,
Abu Dhabi,
Abu Dhabi,
Baba,
booey,
um,

177
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.730
they have that money behind him.
All right.
What's going on?
What's,
who's,

178
00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:59.790
who's playing less?
Just city is playing.

179
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:02.670
Who gives a fleas a bunch of fucking teams that aren't in it anymore.

180
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.110
I don't care about any of these fucking teams.
When his Liverpool,

181
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.730
well man city play in next.
That's,
that's the two.

182
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.150
You got to get into all you fucking yanks,
fellow yanks,

183
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:17.020
solicitor to this shit slide in now at the end of the goddamn season and there's

184
00:11:17.021 --> 00:11:21.400
like 10 games left.
So,
you know,
if you watch all 10 Liverpool Games,

185
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.900
you probably see about nine goals.
So buckle up for that excitement.

186
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.200
Offsides no,
it's not that bad.
I'm kidding.
Alright.
Um,

187
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.570
what am I up to here?
By the way,
fucking jet lag to shit.

188
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.580
I had a great flight back.
I started to watch black Klansman and,

189
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.200
uh,
before the jetlag got to me and I really enjoyed that movie.

190
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.853
<v 3>MMM.</v>

191
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.620
<v 2>Adam driver.
And uh,
I don't know the names of the other in the fuck.</v>

192
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:58.120
I'm not good with names.
Um,
but I liked what everybody was doing in that movie.

193
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:01.750
I liked the guy playing David Duke.
Um,

194
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.440
can I see anything else than I watch anything else?
I don't think I did.
Oh,

195
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:09.850
you know what I watched,
I was really disappointed.
I Some I went on kids' TV.

196
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.370
Um,
I clicked that by accident and I s you know,

197
00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:17.110
they had all the dumb fucking kid movies,

198
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:20.080
but then they had like three episodes of the Jetsons,

199
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.230
which was just the Flintstones,
which was just the honeymooners.
Alright,

200
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.640
so they add the Jetsons.

201
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.910
You don't meet George Jetson [inaudible] at that bar at the Buddha,

202
00:12:31.911 --> 00:12:36.020
the Buddha batterram Italy do his,

203
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.270
his boy l ride.

204
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.970
Then it's daughter Judy and they played it.
Why,
why blah blah,
blah,
boring.

205
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.310
Like she's already blowing somebody.
Then Jane,
his wife,

206
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.140
Baba Baba,
Baba Mama,
you know,

207
00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:52.120
he goes to hand her money and she grabs the whole wallet,

208
00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:54.640
goes to the shopping center,
Duh Duh.

209
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.690
[inaudible]
Bing Bong boom.
Right.
I watched it.

210
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.210
That fucking show sucked.
We used the episode.
I saw.

211
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.070
It's like they were,
they weren't even trying,

212
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.960
just kind of went further and further down here.

213
00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:14.660
The honeymooners was at like the highest level of funny.

214
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.860
And then the Flintstones,

215
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:20.390
they got halfway up the hill and then if fucking Jetsons didn't even get out of

216
00:13:20.391 --> 00:13:22.100
it was so bad.
I didn't even watch the other ones.

217
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.840
It's like I used to watch this shit.

218
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.290
But what I will say about the Jetsons is how much shit they got right about the

219
00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:30.770
future.
They have video phones,
they had flat screen TVs,

220
00:13:30.771 --> 00:13:35.040
they had robots in the fucking house talking to people,
right?

221
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.310
The only thing they got wrong was the,
uh,
the workweek.

222
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.910
They thought with all the technology,
we were going to be working less.

223
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.290
And that was one of George Jetson's famous comedy lines,
big,
Oh God,
these,

224
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.890
these three day work weeks or murder,
you know,
flying cars,

225
00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:54.190
they got that wrong.
That hasn't happened yet.
But,
uh,

226
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:59.160
most of the technology is a,
is right out there.
It's right up there,

227
00:13:59.161 --> 00:14:03.930
you know,
and in the future,
women are still spending their guys money.

228
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.520
Like,
you know,
like there's no tomorrow.
I mean,
some things never change.

229
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.890
Um,
all right.
So anyways,
the big thing is tomorrow I gotta go to the gym.

230
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.460
I've got to get back into the fucking gym because right now there's this big

231
00:14:20.341 --> 00:14:24.420
temptation where it's okay,
the big two things that I was shooting.
All right,

232
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:28.620
my acting Gig at,
uh,
one day at a time or as the world turns,

233
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.610
General Hospital,
whatever the fuck I did one of those soap operas that's over.

234
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.020
And then I did my standup special and that's over.
And I have no TV,

235
00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:38.790
no television,
no nothing coming up.

236
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.880
This is one of these times where you put on like 10 pounds,
right?

237
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.510
He'd go down to the local fucking bar,
you get yourself some wings,

238
00:14:45.511 --> 00:14:48.480
you have a couple of fucking peers,
you know,
and you look at the bears.
I go,
wow,

239
00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:52.010
that thing looks lonely about a cup of little shorties next to it.
Right?

240
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.840
And next thing you know,
you're a fat fuck going.
Why did I do that?
So,

241
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.900
<v 3>mmm,</v>

242
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.640
<v 2>as I told you,
I'm not drinking this year,</v>

243
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.600
taking the fucking year up and a,

244
00:15:04.601 --> 00:15:09.601
I'm getting the booze out of my house except for the pappies and uh,

245
00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.550
I'm just not going to have it in my house anymore.

246
00:15:12.551 --> 00:15:16.150
And then basically for the rest of my life,
if I want to go out fucking drinking,

247
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.280
I will,
I'll go out and do it.

248
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.310
But just the amount of nights that when I come home,

249
00:15:21.311 --> 00:15:25.360
the fact that I won't have it in my house,
it's perfect.
I've kind of,

250
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.490
that I figured out that's the kind of booze hound I am.

251
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.000
It's like boost to me is like I half a gallon of ice cream in the freezer.

252
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.510
If it's there,
I'm going to fucking eat it.
All right.
The booze is there.

253
00:15:36.511 --> 00:15:40.290
I'm going to fucking drink it and uh,

254
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:44.430
and I like getting fucked up so I can't have it around.
That's basically it.

255
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.660
Just literally talking about it makes me want to do it now.
You know,

256
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:53.490
come on bill,
your arm did.
Um,
no,
I can't do that.
That's fucking stupid.

257
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:58.340
All right.
Not Living for myself anymore.
That's what you learn,
right?

258
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.220
That's what the fuck.
That's what you learn when you have a kid.

259
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.000
If you're doing it the right way,
you're not living for yourself anymore.
Stupid.

260
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.960
All right.
Put down the doughnuts.
Get rid of the cigars.

261
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.660
You don't,
now I understand.
You know,

262
00:16:11.661 --> 00:16:14.810
like when you look at your parents like why are they so goddamn boring?

263
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.740
Why do they just pick this regular fucking car?
Why didn't they get a cool car?

264
00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:21.620
Why didn't they do any of this fucking shit?
And it's like,
oh,

265
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.490
because they were awesome.
Selfless fucking people.

266
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.130
That's why.
Okay.

267
00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.700
And they made money and they wanted to have some leftover to,

268
00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:37.850
to fucking give you when they died as the pope's to going out and buying a bunch

269
00:16:38.131 --> 00:16:39.540
of Nice Shit for themselves.

270
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:41.670
<v 3>Okay.</v>

271
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.800
<v 2>Somewhere along the line I picked that was lost in today's America.</v>

272
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:47.570
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

273
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.270
<v 2>It really is like,
just the level,</v>

274
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.450
the level of fashion that is fucking out there now

275
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.430
is insane.
They used,
I mean they used to be,

276
00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.480
it was like fucking Andy Warhol and all the skinny doses that hung around with

277
00:17:01.481 --> 00:17:05.020
them were into fashion and a couple of movie stars and whatever.

278
00:17:05.021 --> 00:17:09.580
And that was fucking it.
You know,
housewives,

279
00:17:09.581 --> 00:17:11.560
they were into fashion.
But Jesus Christ,
I mean,

280
00:17:11.561 --> 00:17:14.860
if they got something that Mrs Roper was wearing,
they w you know,

281
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.210
once every three years they were happy.
It wasn't this fucking shit show.

282
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.120
You know nowadays with like Instagram and fucking all of these social media just

283
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:26.703

287
00:17:37.631 --> 00:17:40.630

It's like they've become,
we become like women.

288
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:43.913
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

289
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.230
<v 2>People with fucking sneaker collections</v>

290
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.010
<v 0>do.
When I was growing up you had,
you had a pair of sneakers.
That was it.</v>

291
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.320
Like everybody had one pair of fucking sneakers.

292
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:58.260
I don't give a shit what sport you are playing yet.
That was it.

293
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:00.510
You put on your chuck Taylors and you went out and you played it.

294
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.630
These are my cross trainers.
What are we playing?

295
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:05.820
I have to go inside and get my soccer shoes.

296
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.430
Like that shit did not fucking exist and you know,

297
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.330
you fucking know good and God damn well a lot of his bullshit other than like

298
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:16.500
running,
I don't know,
maybe they just got better at it.
I have no fucking idea.

299
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.190
You know all these different kinds of genes,
all these different cuts.

300
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:25.410
There was basically when I was growing up,
there was Levi's and whatever,

301
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.640
people who couldn't afford Levi's war,
which was wrangler.

302
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.820
It was tough skins.
And then I remember the gap.

303
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.630
The gap had jeans for awhile.
Um,

304
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.600
but like the top of the line was fucking Levi's.
Oh Lee.

305
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:51.670
There was Levi's Lee Wrangler Toughskins and remember the gap that was basically

306
00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:57.850
it that made fucking cheap jeans and corduroys now was it,

307
00:18:57.851 --> 00:18:59.800
you got two,
three fucking pairs and you were good

308
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.710
and you're warm until you had fucking,
until you,
you,

309
00:19:03.711 --> 00:19:05.930
you made the holes in them and then that was it.

310
00:19:05.931 --> 00:19:10.160
And then eventually you fucking passed him on your mother put patches on them

311
00:19:10.161 --> 00:19:13.400
and pass them down to the next fucking kid.
That was it.

312
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.270
I look at some of the fucking childhoods,

313
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.780
photos of me and the way the kids address,

314
00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:20.690
we looked like we should have been hanging out with Tom Sawyer and huck Finn.

315
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.340
People would like patches on,
on elbows of,
of,

316
00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:26.990
of their shirts and all of this shit.

317
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.440
And it wasn't like people were broke back then.
They just,
I don't know.

318
00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.700
There was no Amazon there.
Like when I go down that fucking store,

319
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.540
driving all the way out to the Goddamn Mall,
give me a patch.

320
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.290
He'll just iron the sauna.
Right?
Get outside
fucking animal.

321
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.470
And that's the way I was and an 18 Chevrolets.
Wow.
Um,
all right.
I'm totally,

322
00:19:48.471 --> 00:19:51.920
I don't know what's going on in football.
Not Football,
sorry.
And uh,

323
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.750
in basketball or hockey.

324
00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:57.980
But I aims to sit down tonight and watch myself a couple of games so I can get

325
00:19:57.981 --> 00:20:02.981
reacclimated into the greatest country that ever were there ever was that ever

362
00:22:21.771 --> 00:22:26.180
I get enough fucking reads this.
Week
four reads all my good

363
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.690
deep breath.
Here we go.
Simply safe.
Here's something interesting study.

364
00:22:32.691 --> 00:22:35.780
Show that security systems deter burglars.

365
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.580
It's a fact is an asterick right next to its effect.

366
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.400
And I can't see where I read the footnote.
Um,

367
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:49.340
but there's still a burglary every eight seconds in America.
How well,

368
00:22:49.341 --> 00:22:53.480
think about it.
I don't want to think about it to explain it to me in the coffee.

369
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.200
I didn't come here to think,
came here to listen and buy shit.
All right,

370
00:22:57.201 --> 00:22:58.010
well think about it.

371
00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.610
Do Burglars give up just because some houses have security systems?

372
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.530
You know what?
I don't know.
I haven't really,

373
00:23:03.531 --> 00:23:06.740
I can't remember the last time I talked to somebody who openly admitted that

374
00:23:06.741 --> 00:23:11.720
there were a burglar.
Well,
fortunately they did the research.
Of course not.

375
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.570
They just find a house that isn't protected.

376
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.690
That's why securing your home is truly an necessity.

377
00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.980
So let me recommend this brilliant security system built by my friends,

378
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.880
evidently at simply safe,

379
00:23:25.881 --> 00:23:29.000
Fear has no place in a place like home.

380
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.300
So they made their system ridiculously smart.

381
00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:38.420
Simply safe sensors will protect every point of access to your home doors,

382
00:23:38.421 --> 00:23:42.020
windows,
garage,
you name it.
Um,

383
00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.810
if a burglar even tries to break in and ear shattering,

384
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.780
we'll let them know the police are already on their way.

385
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.970

dude,
dude,

427
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:36.290
me undies.
She's got a Twat.
Here we go.
Stick a at the head.

428
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.310
Who gives a fuck?
She's got some tits.
Were being progressive.

429
00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:43.980
What happened to our next quarter profits?
We should have

430
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.390
<v 2>done a background shirt,
shirt,
a background,
background check.</v>

431
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.510
She really fucking sucks.
All right,
me undies.

432
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.140
Ask yourself this one very important question.

433
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.810
Um,
is your underwear and making you happy at this very moment?

434
00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:07.390
Mine isn't.
It's not making me sad either.
It's just sort of fucking,

435
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.440
that wasn't really thinking about it.
Now I'm in my head,
right anyways,

436
00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.370
or are we not thinking about your underwear?
I was not me on days.

437
00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.850
This is getting exciting.
It's like,
it's like they're reading my thoughts.

438
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.960
Wouldn't you like to be wearing underwear that is so soft that you can feel like

439
00:27:22.961 --> 00:27:26.680
you're making love to an actual cloud all day long?
Well,

440
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:30.720
what can I just be laying on the cloud?
We have to be fucking it.
Uh,

441
00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.190
well I've got one word for you.
Me undies.

442
00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:36.820
Buzzfeed said this about me undies.

443
00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:40.950
They feel like actual heaven against your skin.
Woo.

444
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.940
The fuck is buzzfeed.
And when did they go to heaven?

445
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:48.400
We're going to assume heaven is really soft in this context.
As men said,

446
00:27:48.401 --> 00:27:51.670
they feel like silk drenched in hand.
Lotion.

447
00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:56.080
These undies are so soft,
they make Bob Ross's voice.
Sound like Gilbert Godfrey,

448
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.680
Godfrey taken a little fucking smack there.
They're so soft.

449
00:27:59.681 --> 00:28:03.900
They think that Kenny g thinks about them to get inspired to write his next

450
00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:07.390
songs.
Or I thought you'd say they're so soft.

451
00:28:07.391 --> 00:28:10.870
They think Kenny g needs to be stopped with his devil music.
Uh,

452
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.380
me undies used the coveted micro modal modal fabric,

453
00:28:14.381 --> 00:28:19.300
which is a full three times softer than cotton.
Take that big cotton you puffy.

454
00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:24.490
Cons.
Not only will you feel your loins are being hugged by joy itself,

455
00:28:24.491 --> 00:28:27.820
but me undies gives you multiple style options for both men and women.

456
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.060

prince,

457
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.860
prince like significant others,

458

undies.com/burr.
That's me,

464
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.343
undies.com/ [inaudible] all right,

465
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:07.540
so when you're jet lagged and you're over there in Europe,
um,

466
00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.470
what ends up happening is just shit starts popping into your head.

467
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:14.383
<v 3>MMM.</v>

468
00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.830
<v 2>And I don't know what.
Then you look it up and you're like,
my God,</v>

469
00:29:17.831 --> 00:29:21.250
I haven't thought about this in years.
And,
uh,

470
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.930
one of the things that popped in my head,

471
00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.160
don't ask me why was that song by Doctor Hook sharing the night together.

472
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.110
Oh my God.
Yeah.

473
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:38.850
That's just one of the great fucking easy listening fucking songs of all time

474
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:40.080
and it gets a bad rep.

475
00:29:40.081 --> 00:29:45.081
You have to understand this is post Vietnam war post JFK getting assassinated,

476
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.390
post Bobby Kennedy posts.

477
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:54.370
Fucking the bad acid at fucking Woodstock post all of that shit.

478
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.980
the 60s was a rough one.

479
00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.233
<v 1>You know,</v>

480
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:05.440
<v 2>people just wanted to listen to shit and not have to fucking think.</v>

481
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:06.730
Alright.

482
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:11.730
Which brought you music like this doctor Hook sharing the night together.

483
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:17.630
You got to listen to,
I'll post the video.
Uh,
but here are the lyrics.

484
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.720
She look and kind of lonely girl.

485
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:25.330
Would you lock someone new to talk to you?
I,

486
00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:27.430
yeah,
our ride.

487
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:31.090
I swear to God he says that I'm feeling kind of lonely too.

488
00:30:31.091 --> 00:30:35.440
And if you don't mind,
can I sit right down here besides you?

489
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.580
I,
yeah.
Ah,
right.
I swear to God,
this sounds like,
um,

490
00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:46.390
if this sounds like I'm making fun of a song,
but this is how it goes.
Um,

491
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.130
so it says,
you know,
if I seem to come on too strong,

492
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.930
I hope that you will understand.

493
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.820
I say these things because I'd like to know if you're as lonely as I am and if

494
00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:01.810
you'd mind sharing the night together,
we'll Hoho yeah.

495
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.320
Sharing the Nad to gather.
Whoa,
whoa.
Yeah.
Right.

496
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.130
Sharing the night together and later on he said,

497
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:13.930
we can bring in the morning girl if you want to go that far.

498
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.900
And if tomorrow finds us together right here the way we are,

499
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:21.660
would you mind basically,
hey,
you know,

500
00:31:21.661 --> 00:31:25.620
I'll f we can fuck if you want or I can just stand here and talk to you for the

501
00:31:25.621 --> 00:31:28.260
rest of the time.
Look it up,

502
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.880
Doctor Hook Sharon and I had together.
We'll hoo.

503
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.800
Yeah.
Which then of course led me to Dr Hooks.
Sexy eyes.

504
00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:39.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

505
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:43.040
<v 2>I was torturing Nia with this Sharon the night,
but then she actually,</v>

506
00:31:43.041 --> 00:31:46.220
she liked sexy eyes.
Um,

507
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.840
I don't know why I'm talking about this shit.
Oh,
I'm,
how much time have I done?

508
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.800
Have I have,
I have,
I done my contractually obligated.
30 minutes here.

509
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.610
Have I spent my 30 minutes with you guys?
Um,
all right.

510
00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.570
So what did we learn on this little podcast thing here?
Um,

511
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.800
don't punch a hole in the wall next to your girlfriend's head,

512
00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:07.640
because if you do,

513
00:32:07.641 --> 00:32:11.450
she'll bring that story up while we're trying to catch a pedophile.

514
00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.320
That's,
you know,
something that should be,

515
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.750
it's entirely own fucking,
you know,

516
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:28.420
I don't know.
You don't need to,
I think,
I think guys need to start having,

517
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.390
you're not,
not that.
Not that we don't bitch and we,
we fucking listen to me.

518
00:32:31.391 --> 00:32:34.030
Jesus Christ.
I'd bitch at him twice as much as any woman does,

519
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:39.010
but it's not organized.
We need organized complaining,
like,

520
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.850
you know,
just to balance this out.
So the next time,
you know,

521
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.660
you see a woman doing something in the middle of a fucking important story,

522
00:32:47.661 --> 00:32:49.730
you can insert your agenda into it.

523
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.150
And then if somebody comments on it in the wrong way,

524
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.810
there's then a big fucking fall out and then some woman loses her job.

525
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.330
You've got to fight fire with fire here.

526
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.350
What'd you like to dance with me and hold me?

527
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.740
You know I want to be holding you.

528
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.470
<v 5>Ah,
yeah.
Ah Right.</v>

529
00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.650
<v 2>You guys don't,
am I allowed to play just like a second of that.</v>

530
00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.580
I'll play just a second of it.
Let's see what happens.

531
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.640
The worst thing I do is I is,
I put money in doctor hooks.
Fucking hands.

532
00:33:23.641 --> 00:33:26.000
I don't give a shit.
I like these guys.
All right.

533
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.560
This is the oldest song is there's like no advertising before it

534
00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:36.470
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

535
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.670
<v 2>all your thoughts disappear.</v>

536
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.800
<v 6>Someone
new.</v>

537
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.330
<v 2>It's my favorite thing ever.</v>

538
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.330
<v 5>Ah,
yeah.
Oh right.
Yeah.</v>

539
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.560
<v 2>Try that tonight.
Bella's as your opening line.</v>

540
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.100
Just walk up to a woman and start singing to it.
Sing that fucking song.

541
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.550
Like when Tom Cruise sang that fucking song and top gun,
right?

542
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:10.910
Just walk up to some woman,
some poor fucking woman,

543
00:34:10.911 --> 00:34:14.570
just trying to enjoy your goddamn day.
Right?
So He'd probably just,
you know,

544
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.280
punch some fucking wall near right.
And she's just going out there.
Right?

545
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.880
She cut his dick off or something.
Whatever the fuck she did.

546
00:34:22.881 --> 00:34:25.190
She's just sitting there.
It's probably still in her purse.

547
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.390
She's trying to enjoy the drink.
I just come up to her,

548
00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.530
tap her on the shoulder.
Yeah.
Just be like you're looking cat alone liquor.

549
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:38.660
Would you Laksa won't talk to when she,

550
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:41.210
right is she gives you the look like what the fuck he get to be like.

551
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.130
<v 5>Ah,
yeah.
Oh right.
Yeah.</v>

552
00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:48.550
<v 2>Oh we can fucking go home,
man.
Fuck all.</v>

553
00:34:48.551 --> 00:34:53.040
We could just stay at here but talk for awhile.
Ah,

554
00:34:53.041 --> 00:34:57.360
yeah.
Oh right.
That was the 70s,
man.

555
00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.570
You just parted your hair down the middle and you feathered it.

556
00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.660
You grew up fucking beard.
That was it.

557
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.500
You just came up with your pube saying it out every which way can you just

558
00:35:07.501 --> 00:35:12.240
fucking said Shit.
As long as you tagged it with a yeah,
right.

559
00:35:12.241 --> 00:35:16.430
I guess you were in.
All right.
That's the podcast.
Everybody,
um,

560
00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.910
thank you to everyone who came out to the tour over the last year or so,

561
00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.470
and thank you to everyone who came out.

562
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:26.560
I feel unbelievable about what we taped and,

563
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.410
um,
I think it might be my best one.
That's what it feels like.
And,

564
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:37.950
uh,
I still can't believe that I got to perform at Royal Albert Hall.

565
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.881
It was crazy.

566
00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:43.440
And the fact that I now have documented it in a special that's going to be

567
00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:47.190
coming out on Netflix,
maybe the summertime,
I don't fucking know.

568
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.940
I am so excited about that.
I can't even begin to tell you.

569
00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:55.140
And the fact that I went to,
like,
I added Liverpool this time,

570
00:35:55.141 --> 00:35:59.910
I had a great time.
So the next time I come out to the UK,

571
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:04.380
Ireland and all that shit,
right,
I'm going to do that,
run through Ireland,

572
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:08.250
go up to Northern Ireland and then go right down through Scotland and just,

573
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.540
just do a bunch of fucking cities and uh,

574
00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.330
and ended up in London again and I got to tell you something.

575
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.780
I don't know what happened this trip.
I've always been a Paris guy at some point.

576
00:36:19.781 --> 00:36:23.740
I don't know.
I'm starting to become a London guy.
I Dunno what happened.

577
00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:27.010
I'll tell you right now.
It's certainly not the fucking food,

578
00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.760
but just the vibe of that city.
I really like,
I was still always love Paris,

579
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:36.040
you know?
But,
uh,
I don't know.
The last couple of times I went there,

580
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.920
plus I've got to get back there.
I've never been to Wimbledon.

581
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.820
That's the last tennis major I need to see life seen.

582
00:36:42.821 --> 00:36:47.080
A couple of US opens to French's in one fucking Australian and I've never been

583
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.700
to the,
the greatest one,

584
00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:52.480
the one on the grass to grass fucking court breakfast at Wimbledon with Dick

585
00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.960
Enberg rest his soul when I was growing up and I used to watch Bjorn Borg verse

586
00:36:55.961 --> 00:36:59.670
John Mcenroe and then Mac was the guy and then,
uh,

587
00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:04.450
what's his face came through there?
Boris Becker,
right?
The redheaded German guy.

588
00:37:04.451 --> 00:37:07.540
I'm like,
oh my God.
There's another one out there,
right.

589
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:13.180
He came in 17 years old.
One didn't fucking 85.
And Yvonne,

590
00:37:13.181 --> 00:37:16.210
Linda was always there looking like a fucking giant.
Uh,

591
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.360
I know he always looked more like a rock star to me.

592
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:26.130
Like that guy who was saying that,
talk about pop music,
pop,

593
00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:27.890

594
00:37:27.891 --> 00:37:32.520
they had fuckheads update everybody talking about pop music.
You look go,

595
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.610
he was new wave.
He looked like a new wave singer to me,

596
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:39.860
and then there was going east,
east and he eats he vich or whatever it was.

597
00:37:39.861 --> 00:37:42.410
That other guy,
Jim Courier,
who kind of looked like Phil Sims,

598
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.940
his younger brother can't believe I remember all these guys,
right.

599
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.620
And right as I was getting used to all of them,

600
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:54.320
then all of a sudden came fucking,
uh,
what's his face from Vegas rule?

601
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.320
One of the best books I ever saw open ever read,

602
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.580
fuck is his name.
You named,

603
00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:10.930
He had to shave his head,
like make,
yeah,
and now he just has a beard.

604
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.470
Anyway,
I,
what the fuck's his name?

605
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:20.620
The fuck is his name.
I saw him play

606
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.590
whatever and then fucking a peach.

607
00:38:25.591 --> 00:38:30.470
Sanford's then I started doing comedy right around then what the fuck is that

608
00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.573
guy's name?

609
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.890
He used to do the fucking commercials being a rebel.

610
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:43.260
This is going to torture me
second.

612
00:38:45.231 --> 00:38:47.540
one of the only fucking people that went on all four surfaces.

613
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.530
I gotta look it up and there's no fucking way I'm closing this fucking podcast

614
00:38:54.531 --> 00:38:59.420
not knowing who that guy's name is.
Tennis Book.
Open.
Boom.

615
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:01.970
What do you mean I'm not connected to the Internet?

616
00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.590
I'm always connected to the Internet.
God dammit.
Come on.

617
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.610
He didn't even want to fucking play.

618
00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.680
Oh fuck you open.

619

621
00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.070
That's right.
And then I don't know where it went.

622
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:33.140
Then the next light guy who came along,

623
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.360
there was that guy who he looked like a,
the guy from dude,

Who did punked and married Demi Moore.
Ashton Kutcher.

625
00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.140
There was a tennis player that looked like him.

626
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:50.060
And then there was the Croatian dude who just,
he just won the French,
didn't he?

627
00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:56.670
I can't fucking remember.
I don't,
I don't pretend to understand shit.

628
00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.000
All right.
You know,

629
00:39:59.001 --> 00:40:01.850
I could have just ended on how site that was about my special rather than than

630
00:40:01.851 --> 00:40:05.450
fucking talking about tennis.
But you know,
isn't that the charm of this podcast?

631
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.870
All right.
I hope I got you through your workout or whatever the fuck it is.

It's built bar and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

652
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:50.750
March 7th,
2011 there.

653
00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:55.250
I set it right.
2011,
2011.
Um,

654
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.220
I'm down here in Miami,
Miami beach.

655
00:41:58.221 --> 00:42:02.900
I did the South beach comedy festival or this,
this,
uh,
this past Friday night.

656
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.210
And uh,
the fuck did I do,

657
00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:09.800
I worked at the new symphony theater and uh,
it was funny.

658
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:11.900
I worked there Friday night and Thursday night,

659
00:42:11.901 --> 00:42:15.050
the first comedian ever to perform there cause it's basically designed for a

660
00:42:15.051 --> 00:42:19.130
symphony was a Kathleen Madigan.
So they had an all red head weekend,

661
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.410
which I thought was nice,
you know,

662
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:25.010
for once they paid attention to one of the,
uh,

663
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:27.740
overlooked minorities out there,
you know,

664
00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:36.800
how come we don't get a day on the calendar?
What about us?
Persecuted by the Sun.

665
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.310
Do you know what it's like to be persecuted from Sunup to sundown?

666
00:42:40.311 --> 00:42:43.220
I don't think you do.
Oh,
you fucking bitch.

667
00:42:43.221 --> 00:42:47.120
And people from other Goddamn fucking groups.
I've had it.

668
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:53.720
Um,
anyways,
yeah,
down here on Miami beach and everyone is dressed like a hooker.

669
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:57.950
You know,
this is really just a,
it's a bunch of,
I don't know,

670
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.880
really good looking women who are dressed as fucking trashy as you possibly can.

671
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:07.370
None of them do.
You look at like,
God,
I could marry that girl.

672
00:43:07.371 --> 00:43:12.080
You just look at all of them and you just start thinking about porno.
Um,

673
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:13.183
I don't get it.

674
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:18.230
It's that up and I can't just say that it's c a Miami beach area because I've

675
00:43:18.231 --> 00:43:21.540
kind of seen that in like a number of different cities.
It's that,

676
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:26.150
that Kim Kardashians,
Paris Hilton influence where I don't know,

677
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:27.570
I don't know what happened abroad.

678
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:31.070
I don't know how they went from the 1950s to early sixties,

679
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:34.700
which I think was the high point of Cla,

680
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:36.320
at least classy looking women.

681
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.350
God knows there was plenty of gold digging whores back then.

682
00:43:39.351 --> 00:43:40.760
But that whole era there,
man,

683
00:43:40.761 --> 00:43:44.360
the way they dressed telling you they look classy,

684
00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.710
your approach to them was different.
Down here it's just,
it's fucking ridiculous.

685
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.520
I'm sitting there with my lady,

686
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.960
I'm trying to pay attention to her as she's talking to me and these two checks

687
00:43:56.961 --> 00:43:58.100
at the fucking next table.

688
00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:01.130
Just go sit in there with a ted still like they're almost,

689
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:05.480
they were as close to being out of her dress as humanly fucking possible,

690
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:09.440
you know?
So that's what am I thinking?
Am I looking at her like,
oh,

691
00:44:09.441 --> 00:44:12.530
look at that beautiful,
beautiful woman.
I'm not,
I'm thinking,

692
00:44:12.531 --> 00:44:16.700
what would it be like if I just stuck my Dick Right in the cleavage as my end in

693
00:44:16.701 --> 00:44:20.960
my girl's voice just fades off in the back.
I'd had [inaudible] and you attack.

694
00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:25.850
Maybe you are where you get a jet ski.
I can't fucking hear what she's saying.
Um,

695
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:29.990
yeah,
it's,
uh,
I've had it,
I've had enough down here.
I am.

696
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:33.480
I'm fucking done with it.
I'm not going in the ocean.
I respect the ocean.

697
00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.630
All right.
There's sharks in there is Barracuda.

698
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.550
There's jellyfish to goddamn ocean itself can just get mad at you and drag you

699
00:44:41.551 --> 00:44:43.680
out to fucking see when it feels like it.

700
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.500
And then you're supposed to remain calm.
And just sort of,
oh,

701
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:49.320
which way is it dragging me?
I guess I'll swim sideways.

702
00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:54.570
I think that's what I'll do,
you know,
is the ocean just fucking attacks you,

703
00:44:54.571 --> 00:44:57.960
pulls your bathing suit off,
you know,
if you survive,

704
00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.910
you're going to be walking up there with the Sun Burn Dick.

705
00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:01.440
Is that what you want?
I doesn't know what I want.

706
00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.070
So what I'm looking for in a vacation.
All right.

707
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.830
These fucking ladies down here,
they're ridiculous.

708
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.700
And I've been making fun of him all week and uh,

709
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:16.220
every broad I've been around a,
yeah.
I don't know that they are,

710
00:45:16.221 --> 00:45:17.330
or people from Miami,

711
00:45:17.331 --> 00:45:21.890
they try to defend them or you do you though he don't understand on hits Miami,

712
00:45:21.891 --> 00:45:26.330
the weather,
it's just,
we are used to walking around with,
let's shut the fuck up.

713
00:45:26.331 --> 00:45:29.940
Walking around less clothes.
All right.

714
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.541
Heavy it tits.

715
00:45:32.541 --> 00:45:36.480
Hanging out of your fucking shirt and having a shirt design to show as much of

716
00:45:36.481 --> 00:45:39.950
your teddy as humanly fucking possible.
That's a different thing.
All right.

717
00:45:39.951 --> 00:45:42.080
That's not all.
My God,
it's so fucking hot out.

718
00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:44.043
<v 3>You know,</v>

719
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:48.680
<v 0>I saw it.
Right.
You know,
it was funny.
It was late at night and one of these,</v>

720
00:45:48.681 --> 00:45:50.900
these hooker dressed women who wasn't a hooker,

721
00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:54.650
was walking by herself on the other side of the street.
And I said to the guy,

722
00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:55.880
go look at that.
Right there I go,

723
00:45:55.881 --> 00:45:58.190
that's your daughter that your daughter walking down the street.

724
00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.760
What are you going to say to her?
And he just started laughing,
shaking his head.

725
00:46:01.761 --> 00:46:02.594
It's like,
exactly.

726
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:07.340
She looks like a fucking streetwalker and now she's away from the guard down.

727
00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:09.170
Hurt.
Well,
what do,
what are you going to say to her

728
00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:16.030
fucking five inch fucking heat every goddamn one of them.
How much?

729
00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:20.740
How much for a fucking blow job?
Um,
yeah,
that,
that really is Miami beach.

730
00:46:20.741 --> 00:46:21.670
So if you want to come down,

731
00:46:21.671 --> 00:46:26.260
if you want to come down here and you want to bang a 10,
uh,

732
00:46:26.261 --> 00:46:30.670
I think it's almost impossible not to because if you hook up with anything down

733
00:46:30.671 --> 00:46:35.080
here,
they're absolutely fucking gorgeous and they're dress like absolute fucking

734
00:46:35.081 --> 00:46:37.270
hookers.
Um,

735
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:43.530
I think I saw maybe two or three class acts the entire time I was down here.

736
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.290
So,
um,

737
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:51.150
it was going to be great as the amount of people who are gonna fuck it,

738
00:46:51.151 --> 00:46:53.430
email me and they going to try to defend.

739
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.123
<v 3>MMM.</v>

740
00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.680
<v 0>What is going on down here?</v>

741
00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.793
<v 3>All right.</v>

742
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.360
<v 0>And all you females from Miami who going to defend this type of shit?</v>

743
00:47:03.361 --> 00:47:08.190
Let me ask you this.
If you saver,
if you savor not,
you saved your fucking savior.

744
00:47:08.191 --> 00:47:11.880
Jesus h Christ showed up.
Okay.
And he was at one of those apps to parties.

745
00:47:11.881 --> 00:47:16.590
All of a sudden,
you know,
he finally comes back and proves assholes like me.

746
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.690
Wrong.
There he is.
Jay Star,

747
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:24.120
you know on the one and two with the fucking head set on right up there.

748
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:26.590
Fucking all of a sudden starts re remix in

749
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.610
[inaudible] Christ

750
00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.830
<v 8>has died for rose.</v>

751
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:33.940
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

752
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.910
<v 8>And has risen from the dead.</v>

753
00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:42.450
<v 0>The Jesus.
Um,
all right.</v>

754
00:47:42.451 --> 00:47:46.560
And he comes back.
I'd be aren't you?
At the very least the second you see them,

755
00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.810
I know two things you're going to do.

756
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:51.930
Why don't you got to take off those God damn shoes.
And number two,

757
00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:55.530
you're going to reach for your little granny shawl to cover your tits up.

758
00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.430
That's what you're going to do.

759
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:02.310
I think that's what you're gonna do and you're probably going to try and stand

760
00:48:02.311 --> 00:48:04.290
behind as many thick leggings,

761
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:09.320
sturdy whores as you possibly can as you text your friend Omg.

762
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:12.060
Can you please find me a pair of pants?

763
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.320
What would Jesus do?
Everybody.
What would he do?

764
00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:23.710
I'm probably gonna get a ton of shit for trash and fucking Miami liked that like

765
00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:25.450
I did from the potheads last week.

766
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:30.040
Some guy actually gave me shit cause I do that,
that voice.
Hey Man.
And he's like,

767
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:33.490
I'd never heard Eddie one shot.
You know what I'm talking about?

768
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.510
Go Watch that documentary on the Fillmore.
All right.
It's a fucking,

769
00:48:37.511 --> 00:48:40.690
it's an impression of the hippies from Woodstock.

770
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.210
I realized that people don't talk like that anymore.

771
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.410
I'm exaggerating for comedic effect.
You fucking cunt.

772
00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:50.230
I thought when you smoked weed,
everything became funny.

773
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:55.030
Why aren't you giggling right now?
Ah,
angry pothead.

774
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:58.330
And you never answered my fucking question.
None of you did.

775
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:01.930
How many weed smokers?
All right.

776
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:06.700
Who fucking,
I came here with my five.

777
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:09.560
My fucking question about mushrooms is trying to make some sort of point.

778
00:49:09.561 --> 00:49:13.210
Last week you guys were all afraid of it.
Stayed away.

779
00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:16.580
He changed the subject like a bunch of fucking politicians.

780
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:21.450
When's the economy going to turn around?
Governor?
You know,

781
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:25.640
I'm not teach 70 till this tub was built Bleah Out of vision.

782
00:49:25.641 --> 00:49:28.520
What the fuck are you talking about?
Answer the Goddamn question.

783
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:35.840
Um,
anyway,
so I got to see all sides of this state.
I saw the who was,

784
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:39.770
I saw the,
uh,
you know,
the fist pumpers,
you know,

785
00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.140
that really sounds fucking filthy,
doesn't it?

786
00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:46.040
A whole bunch of twinkle toes down here too.

787
00:49:46.041 --> 00:49:50.120
And then after I took a tour of the everglades the next day,
right?

788
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.870
I finally got to do that.
Went on a fan boat.
It,
uh,

789
00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:58.460
I gotta admit,
man,
I was pretty fucking nervous first of all.

790
00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.360
You know what's great is you,

791
00:49:59.361 --> 00:50:04.300
you go outside of Miami and you get a half a mile out there and the drop off.

792
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.220
It's just like the ocean,
you know,

793
00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.420
where you just sort of weighed out and everything's great.
You know,
what do,

794
00:50:08.421 --> 00:50:11.420
what do you call one of those drop offs?
We have any oceanography.

795
00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.960
Oceanography is listening now,
what do you call that,

796
00:50:14.961 --> 00:50:16.550
where all of a sudden it goes from like,
you know,

797
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:21.910
five feet deep to like 125 feet and you just slip into that darker water and no

798
00:50:22.581 --> 00:50:25.070
one ever hears from you again,
you know?

799
00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.270
And then one day you come back up on the fucking beach

800
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.180
with three quarters of your body going like,
like the end of the terminator,

801
00:50:34.181 --> 00:50:34.930
the first one,

802
00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:38.770
you know when he crawls out after he sticks that little canister in his robot

803
00:50:38.771 --> 00:50:41.500
rib cage,
you remember that?
And he just starts crawling.

804
00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:43.643
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

805
00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:48.620
<v 0>I actually watched that movie unedited.
Fucking great film stands up.</v>

806
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:52.680
Stands the test of time.
Um,
anyways,
what the fuck am I talking about?
Yes.

807
00:50:52.681 --> 00:50:57.560
So I started the second you get outside the dropoff where it goes from almond,

808
00:50:57.561 --> 00:50:59.480
Miami Bitch.
And um,

809
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:04.720
for some reason still wearing those white louvered Kanye West Grammy glasses

810
00:51:05.091 --> 00:51:09.840
that he wore like five years ago.
Um,
yeah.

811
00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.850
What's funny about him,
he broke his jaw.
Now he always looks upset.

812
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:20.320
He's got that bulldog mouth.
[inaudible] is his bottom lip sticks out a little,

813
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.910
little more than the upper lip.
Um,
anyways,

814
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:28.720
you go out there and it just immediately becomes,
hey,

815
00:51:28.721 --> 00:51:32.110
why you want your shelf from frog legs?

816
00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.900
Got Myself pickup truck.

817
00:51:34.901 --> 00:51:38.500
It's the one out there with the steel balls hanging off of it high like my

818
00:51:38.501 --> 00:51:42.160
mullet.
He liked this shit.
I'm immediately went out there.

819
00:51:42.161 --> 00:51:44.890
All of a sudden there's like,
there's like signs,

820
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:49.150
billboards for like bingo parlor in this casinos.

821
00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.130
So we go all the way out there and as we're driving they got these goddamn

822
00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:57.550
canals and uh,
this,
these,
these fucking alligators

823
00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:03.770
hanging out.
Not big ones,
just sorta like little,
like a little five footers,

824
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:09.040
but still five foot alligator man.
If that thing bits you,
uh,

825
00:52:09.041 --> 00:52:14.020
you know,
you,
I'm sure you can maybe pull yourself away from the thing.

826
00:52:14.021 --> 00:52:15.570
I don't know what,
I don't know what you door,

827
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:18.970
your one of your friends could start.
I guess you poke them in the,

828
00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.020
I have no idea what the fuck you do to it,
but you're,

829
00:52:21.021 --> 00:52:25.510
you're definitely losing your calf muscle or a chunk of your leg,
you know,

830
00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.950
broken arm.
When they start doing that.
God Damn death roll,

831
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:30.970
they just lay in there.

832
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:37.200
I Dunno like people down here they used to him alligators and shit but like uh,

833
00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:42.130
someone like me,
a Yankee from up north,
I really don't do well with reptiles.

834
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:47.180
They freaked me the fuck out.
So I know I'm on my way to the everglades.

835
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:48.920
They got all these alligators,

836
00:52:48.921 --> 00:52:52.820
they have our water moccasins or cotton mouth is it called?
And I learned,

837
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.720
cause they,
they sit there with their mouths open when the,

838
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:57.650
when they feel like they're threatened and they have all,

839
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.710
it's all white inside their mouths.
It's like black mamas.

840
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.580
I always thought that snake was black.
It isn't.
The inside of its mouth is black.

841
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.390
The outside,
he's sort of a gray,
uh,
Jesus Christ.
Bill,

842
00:53:08.391 --> 00:53:11.060
what does this fucking animal planet can you get to the Goddamn comedy?

843
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:13.400
Acuff go fuck yourselves.
I learned some things this week,

844
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.030
so we show up out there,
right?
It's me,

845
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:21.340
another comedian and both are fucking late A's and uh,

846
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:25.770
took one of those fan boats.
I'm going to give you some advice.
All right?

847
00:53:25.771 --> 00:53:30.450
You can be a cheap fuck.
Okay.
And go on one of those fucking air boats.

848
00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:34.620
I guess they call them and go on there with like 10,
12 other the fucking people.

849
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.240
Or You can shell out another 20 bucks a head and you can go on one by yourself.

850
00:53:39.241 --> 00:53:42.990
I definitely suggest that one because uh,
this time of year,

851
00:53:42.991 --> 00:53:46.110
the waters a little bit shallow and the other people will get bogged down with

852
00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:48.270
the weight in there and we fucking blew by all of them.

853
00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:51.550
And a little disappointed.

854
00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.130
I didn't get to see too many fucking alligators.

855
00:53:54.131 --> 00:53:57.790
I guess they were mating and they're shy and they're in the fucking tall grass

856
00:53:57.791 --> 00:53:59.470
or some shit.
I don't know what was going on.

857
00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.390
So for the first three quarters of it,

858
00:54:01.391 --> 00:54:05.080
all I'm seeing is a bunch of goddamn birds.
All right.

859
00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:10.300
Those white ones with the s the s turn fucking next.
Um,

860
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:11.620
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It was actually,

861
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:14.530
it was amazing and I was absolutely terrified than any second one of those

862
00:54:14.531 --> 00:54:18.340
fucking alligators was going to come up and stay and just rip off one of my
legs.

863
00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.080
And uh,

864
00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.490
plus you can't believe down here the amount of misinformation on alligators.

865
00:54:24.491 --> 00:54:27.640
These people were trying to tell me that those things can run 30 miles an hour.

866
00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:33.010
They go,
they can't run 30 miles an hour for a long time.
And they also,

867
00:54:33.011 --> 00:54:36.040
they can't,
like,
they can't run like Barry Sanders.

868
00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:37.660
They could just kind of go in a straight line.

869
00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:42.790
So what you do is you're supposed to serpentine,
which I don't get that.

870
00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.490
It's like,
shouldn't you just run in a straight line and then break?
Right.

871
00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:49.050
Why would you then break left and become you?

872
00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:52.510
You end up back in his fucking scope,
wouldn't you?

873
00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.050
I don't know what.
So I finally go on the fucking Internet.
I'm like,

874
00:54:56.051 --> 00:55:00.550
give me a goddamn break.
Those fat fucks can run that fast and it turns out,

875
00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:04.500
uh,
and sears.com how fast can they run?

876
00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:09.501
Says alligators can not run at 35 miles per hour is previously as a previous

877
00:55:09.901 --> 00:55:10.651
answer set.

878
00:55:10.651 --> 00:55:15.120
35 miles an hour is how fast a horse runs or an Olympic speed skater.

879
00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:19.370
Uh,
if they said it's faster,

880
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:22.070
it's fast at 35 miles an hour is faster than a deer.

881
00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:26.990
People tend to make outrageous claims about crocodiles with no basis.
Uh,

882
00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.650
just today I was a on an everglades tour and the guys,

883
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:34.690
the guide said they could go 35 miles an hour on land set of fast alligator Mike

884
00:55:34.951 --> 00:55:37.670
go eight or nine miles per hour.

885
00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:39.980
According to a study in Australia,

886
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:44.600
young crocodiles might be able to reach as fast as 10.5 miles an hour,

887
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:48.230
but only over a few yards.
And also their ambush,

888
00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:52.850
they usually ambush.
People saw the,
I don't know,
they said no.

889
00:55:52.851 --> 00:55:57.440
If they fucking run,
they usually just run away.
They're running back to water.
Um,

890
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:59.720
they run like fat people will you run in,

891
00:55:59.721 --> 00:56:02.960
all of a sudden you lose your footing and you just do a face plant.

892
00:56:02.961 --> 00:56:03.591
That's what they do.

893
00:56:03.591 --> 00:56:06.950
They just try to stay up and then they do a face plant right into the fucking

894
00:56:06.951 --> 00:56:09.200
water.
But once they get in the water,
you're screwed.

895
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.680
So I was also thinking with all these,
God damn alligator's laying around,

896
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.280
you know how many,
how many people get killed a year?

897
00:56:17.281 --> 00:56:21.980
And evidently it's not that many.
They only have like,

898
00:56:21.981 --> 00:56:26.740
they have like four or five a year.
That's it.
Four or five tests a year.

899
00:56:26.741 --> 00:56:30.850
But then they had like three people died all in one fucking week or three people

900
00:56:30.851 --> 00:56:33.940
down here got attacked.
Some woman joggers,
some shit.

901
00:56:33.941 --> 00:56:37.540
She was jogging and she decided to fucking cool off her feet in the water.

902
00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:38.800
And that was the last time you saw her.

903
00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:47.690
Why the fuck would you do that?
Why would you do that?

904
00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:51.440
That's why like whenever I watch like a fucking one of those horror movies from

905
00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:53.480
back in the day,
that's what you're always yelling.

906
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.600
What you're watching it like what,
why are you going in there?

907
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:59.240
Why are you doing it like this?
The same thing if you live in Florida,

908
00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:02.480
if you feed a hot fucking tough it out.

909
00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:08.200
Go home and stick them in the tub.
Dangle them in that fucking water.

910
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:09.610
He'll imagine that shit.

911
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.410
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

912
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:16.350
<v 0>Oh my God.
Second you get pulled in to this,</v>

913
00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:20.970
to the moment you're underwater.
You have to think.
I,
I would think.

914
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:22.581
Well,

915
00:57:22.581 --> 00:57:26.270
however long it takes the alligator to pull you from where you're seated into

916
00:57:26.271 --> 00:57:29.090
the water.
What do you think that is?
Point eight seconds.

917
00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.460
I would say for 0.4 seconds.

918
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:35.210
The first point to you like what the fuck?

919
00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:40.750
Point three,
your holy shit.
Point four you have hope

920
00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:45.480
maybe I can do.
Maybe I could do this.
Oh,
there's my ring.

921
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:53.800
There it is.
Hey Dude,
I'm doing my podcast.

922
00:57:53.801 --> 00:57:58.790
Let me call you right back in about an hour.
All right.
All right.
Um,

923
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:03.630
bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
bom.
That's the only normal one I can get.

924
00:58:03.631 --> 00:58:07.020
You want to hear my fucking things?
I was in such a great moment there.
Alright,

925
00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:11.600
so 0.4 seconds.
You have hope like,
well,
maybe I can do,
oh no I can't.

926
00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:15.900
That's 0.5 and then you just like,
I'm dead.
Point five to 0.8.
You're like,

927
00:58:15.901 --> 00:58:19.290
I can't believe I'm gonna get,
I'm gonna die via alligator.

928
00:58:19.291 --> 00:58:21.240
And then once you're under the water,
that's when you renew.

929
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:23.160
Renew your relationship with the Lord.

930
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.990
And I know what you guys are probably thinking,

931
00:58:24.991 --> 00:58:27.570
you're probably thinking about bill because you don't believe in that shit.

932
00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:29.070
What would you be thinking?

933
00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:34.080
I would be praying to God and a second got a fucking hedge my bets.

934
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:42.150
My prayers would be hilarious.
If you do exist and you do give a fuck,

935
00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:44.970
get me out of this or make it quick.

936
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:50.890
Oh my God.
How long do you think it takes?

937
00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:55.680
Like how long do you think before you're dead?
Here's the thing,

938
00:58:55.681 --> 00:58:57.930
just sitting there Chowan on your liver and you're going like,

939
00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.030
<v 9>ah,
okay.</v>

940
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.460
<v 0>For the love of God,
eat my heart so I can die.</v>

941
00:59:02.461 --> 00:59:05.640
I know it's getting really fucking more of it,
but uh,
I dunno man,

942
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:09.360
I could not get comfortable.
So we ended up going out there on the everglades.

943
00:59:09.361 --> 00:59:13.500
I definitely recommend it,
although if you're going to go,
um,

944
00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:17.670
try to go April and may cause the water levels come up I guess.

945
00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:21.590
And then also the mosquitoes aren't that bad.
There's a little travel for you.

946
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:26.860
April or may water levels come up.
They're mating season.
Right.

947
00:59:26.861 --> 00:59:31.460
I was just joking about them wanting to make the fucking tall grass and full of

948
00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:33.170
shit.
Um,

949
00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:38.900
go during April and may definitely get your own fucking boat.
And uh,

950
00:59:38.901 --> 00:59:42.890
I would also say venture out as far as you can into the everglades.

951
00:59:42.891 --> 00:59:44.930
Don't stop at the first one.
Just keep going.

952
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.160
Go as far as you can until you're out there with some fucking,
uh,

953
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:54.500
Seminole Indians,
you know,
and they're calling you in.
The guide says white man,

954
00:59:54.501 --> 00:59:58.110
speak with forked tongue.
I think that that's the one you want to get on.
Um,

955
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.580
we actually,
we had just a couple of redneck dudes,

956
01:00:01.581 --> 01:00:05.380
one and the redneck dude we had,
the guy's name was Regis and uh,

957
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:10.370
they had all this uh,
airboat humor,
you know,
where they would just like,

958
01:00:10.371 --> 01:00:13.310
do you know if you enjoyed the tour,
get out to the left.

959
01:00:13.311 --> 01:00:16.790
If he didn't get out to the wreck,
kick,
kick,
kick,
you get it.

960
01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:20.180
Cause then you'd step in the water and the alligators are in there.

961
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.310
But seriously,
folks,

962
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:26.240
don't hang your legs off the boat at any point as we're going through here.
Uh,

963
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:28.760
those you who are wearing hats,

964
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:32.380
I suggest you take them off or turn them off backwards because if you don't lose

965
01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:36.830
it,
leave known to fly off.
They go into the fan and then they laid off.

966
01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:41.360
Finish well could kick kick,
kick off.
Just kidding.
Alright.
Fuck.
Seriously.

967
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:47.000
Journey Hatch,
ramp.
Um,
if you're watering.
No,

968
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.620
I am not part shark.
That's just my awful dentition.

969
01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.760
John.
Just fucking with you.
Keep the fucking hands.

970
01:00:55.770 --> 01:01:00.400
Legs inside of the boat at all times.
Yeah.
Oh,

971
01:01:00.401 --> 01:01:02.900
this one.
An Algarian sounds like when it's trying to Mike,

972
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:05.300
they did all that shit.
It was fucking tremendous.

973
01:01:05.301 --> 01:01:10.160
We saw another boat that got it got um,
it was hilarious.
This boat,

974
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:14.570
one of those boats that had too many people on it,
it actually a win a ground.

975
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.260
So they were just sitting out in the everglades waiting to be towed in.

976
01:01:18.261 --> 01:01:21.500
So we came over to see if we could help him out.
And it was hilarious.

977
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:23.600
It was like six people all from Germany.

978
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:27.290
So they were getting the full on red neck experience.

979
01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.780
I would love to hear the stories they're going to tell when they get back.

980
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:33.850
They just sitting there,
we pull up near like one tie.
Hello?
Yeah.

981
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:39.320
Hi.
And they had the most redneck dude ever and he was just standing there.

982
01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:42.680
He had completely given up,
like there's no way you can get towed out.

983
01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:48.380
And so he puts his cigarette in his mouth and he's fishing for his lighter as

984
01:01:48.901 --> 01:01:53.280
he's talking to the other redneck owned.
He's like,
just God damn garbage can,

985
01:01:53.281 --> 01:01:57.090
you know what they say?
Won't go chrome it.

986
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:04.580
Yeah.
And as he's saying,
but he's saying it like you're trained to look there.

987
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.540
If you know what this is,
lips together cause he wants to hold onto cigarettes.

988
01:02:07.541 --> 01:02:10.990
So cigarettes sitting there,
flapping around as he's reaching for his lighter.

989
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:13.900
And it was amazing.
It was one of those moments as a performer,

990
01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:18.940
I'm watching this guy going,
this guy doesn't even realize it,
but this guy is,

991
01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:19.980
if someone could

992
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.910
<v 10>imitate him,
they would win an Oscar with what he's doing right now.</v>

993
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:24.744
Just sitting there.

994
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:27.840
<v 0>No,
great,
great,
well go chrome.</v>

995
01:02:27.841 --> 01:02:32.620
But that cigarette flap but not tied up,
boy,
fuck rock of Dar snikers genre

996
01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.860
<v 10>was just so God damn authentic.
And we,</v>

997
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:40.120
I was sitting there with Nia and we both immediately just looked down at the

998
01:02:40.121 --> 01:02:44.950
ground and just started cracking up at a,
not an asshole way,
not judging them.

999
01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:49.030
And I looked over at Nia at one point I was like,
you know what?
I was like,

1000
01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:53.320
Lemmy doesn't have shit on this guy.
I'm not saying this guy's beyond Lemmy,

1001
01:02:53.321 --> 01:02:56.650
but these two could fucking hang out.
And they would be two peas in a pod.

1002
01:02:58.450 --> 01:02:59.290
Um,
speaking of which

1003
01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.830
<v 0>underrated anybody see that,
that documentary on Lemmy from Motorhead?</v>

1004
01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:08.210
Fucking tremendous.
Um,
I'm one of those radio motor had fans.

1005
01:03:08.211 --> 01:03:12.440
All I know is the ace of spades,
but,
uh,
definitely a fascinating guy.

1006
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:14.370
And,
uh,
if he,

1007
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:17.390
I think it's on demand this month should definitely try and check it out.

1008
01:03:17.391 --> 01:03:21.140
So anyway,
so we ended up going through the fucking everglades and then the end,

1009
01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.500
I know I made fun of those Fan Buckeyes,
but they're actually,
they're,

1010
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:25.040
they're great dudes.
Tip Them.

1011
01:03:25.041 --> 01:03:29.570
Don't be a fucking asshole and a then we got off and they,
uh,

1012
01:03:29.571 --> 01:03:33.260
they gave us a baby alligator and they said that you get one of these,

1013
01:03:33.261 --> 01:03:36.680
you get one of these.
Are they ever trip?
Take it,
stick it in water.

1014
01:03:36.681 --> 01:03:39.890
Don't tell anybody you got it.
And uh,
when it gets too big,

1015
01:03:39.891 --> 01:03:42.830
you just flushed down the toilet.
Now they didn't get,
they actually,

1016
01:03:42.831 --> 01:03:47.720
they just let us hold one and uh,
was actually pretty cool.
I kind of,

1017
01:03:47.721 --> 01:03:50.510
I was terrified to do it.
Not like terrified.

1018
01:03:50.511 --> 01:03:54.800
I just thought it was going to fucking bite my finger off.
So,
uh,

1019
01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:59.900
it was weird,
the dog training that,
that I,
that I got through working with Cleo.

1020
01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.310
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1021
01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:05.430
<v 0>I realized that when you want,
at least when you go to make a move with a dog,</v>

1022
01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.980
if you're going to go pet a dog,
you don't,
you don't,

1023
01:04:07.981 --> 01:04:11.460
no pun intended alligator arms,
you don't start to pet it and then go,
oh,

1024
01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:12.750
wait a minute,
is it going to bite me?

1025
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:17.100
Because then they feel that and then that makes them feel fucked up.

1026
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:19.883
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1027
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.010
<v 0>So the guy goes,
you know,
take the alligator,
grab it right here.</v>

1028
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:26.070
And before I would even think,
I just fucking made sure I had its mouth closed,

1029
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:30.510
held it by its Goddamn tail.
And uh,

1030
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.790
I got the picture taken,
but I've got to admit,
I was nervous handing it back.

1031
01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.133
You know,

1032
01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:41.480
<v 10>like,
I think I could actually hold the most poisonous snake in the world.</v>

1033
01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:44.930
If you showed me how to do it,
I think I could grab it by the back of its head,

1034
01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:48.770
you know?
And I wouldn't get bit,
but when I was going to get bit was the,

1035
01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:51.800
the letting go of it.
Like,
I don't know,
I don't get that whole,

1036
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:57.590
do you like fucking throw it like hold onto the tail so it can't coil up and

1037
01:04:57.591 --> 01:05:00.740
then you,
you fuck.
Why am I asking you guys like your fucking snake experts?

1038
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.950
You know what somebody is going to be,
hey,
you guys want to hear?
Yeah,
about

1039
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:05.720
<v 0>the uh,
so that,
I definitely recommend that.</v>

1040
01:05:05.721 --> 01:05:07.970
And tonight I'm actually going to go to the,
uh,

1041
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.780
actually this will be tomorrow night with the podcast.
I'm going to the uh,

1042
01:05:11.781 --> 01:05:16.400
the panthers are playing the Washington capitals going to get to see,
uh,

1043
01:05:16.401 --> 01:05:19.900
Alex.
Uh,
what is he the great,
is that what they call him?

1044
01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:22.920
Alexander the Great,

1045
01:05:22.921 --> 01:05:25.740
I'm going to get to watch him and his fucking nine goals this year.

1046
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.560
The fuck are the capital's doing,
you know,
can I take,

1047
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:34.350
can I turn that horse loose?
What's going on with those guys?

1048
01:05:34.351 --> 01:05:37.010
How about them broads?
They went

1049
01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:43.440
6.06 and o on their,
their uh,
their road trip one another one at home.

1050
01:05:43.441 --> 01:05:46.220
And last night they stole a point from the penguins.

1051
01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.250
Mother fuckers are seven Oh one one
the last eight games.

1052
01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:53.050
If you can't do the math,
it's fucking great.

1053
01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:54.490
I hope they're not peaking too early,

1054
01:05:54.491 --> 01:05:58.510
but all of a sudden I know we look all right with the penguins injuries.

1055
01:05:58.511 --> 01:06:01.390
I don't know.
Who Do you think it's going to be this year?

1056
01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:04.360
I think you gotta go with the fly.
Yes.

1057
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:09.220
You know they were there last year.
They came.
Oh,
so fuck it close.

1058
01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.120
I think the flyers or the Goddamn team to beat,

1059
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:14.400
but for some reason the penguins with all their injuries,

1060
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:17.520
the filthy fucking Pittsburgh Penguins.

1061
01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:24.980
Um,
those sons of bitches,
they seem to be playing.

1062
01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.630
All right too.
I don't know.
It all comes down.

1063
01:06:26.631 --> 01:06:28.880
Can you beat him four times since in seven games?
I don't know.

1064
01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:32.270
I don't fucking know.
All right.
You guys want to read some on?
Want me to read it?

1065
01:06:32.271 --> 01:06:35.930
Some,
uh,
angry email.
An angry email from a fuckin pothead.

1066
01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.280
I'm all right.
I got one who disagrees with my view on product.
Okay,
Bill.
Dude,

1067
01:06:40.281 --> 01:06:45.281
you have obviously never regularly hung out with any weed smokers or smoked weed

1068
01:06:45.411 --> 01:06:48.980
yourself wrong on both counts right there,
sir.

1069
01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:52.640
I hung out with some of the biggest potheads you're ever gonna meet in your
life.

1070
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:57.670
I'm talking about people who smoked every fucking day because they couldn't

1071
01:06:57.741 --> 01:07:01.160
deal.
Uh,
they use stuff.
They quotes like this.

1072
01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.480
Why do you get high at work?
Why do you,
why do you smoke all the time,
dude,

1073
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:09.980
I like pot because it turns my world,

1074
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:14.630
turns my life into a movie.
That's what this buddy of mine said.

1075
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:19.830
All right.
So yes,
I have hung out with them.
He said,

1076
01:07:19.831 --> 01:07:21.780
you are usually on point with what you say,

1077
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:25.620
but you talk like someone who was absolutely zero knowledge of weed.

1078
01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:27.600
I've never seen someone with that.

1079
01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:30.000
I've never seen all this is the guy never seen him.
Someone with that tire,

1080
01:07:30.001 --> 01:07:33.240
cliched pot,
smoker voice.
Obviously you haven't.
All right,

1081
01:07:33.241 --> 01:07:36.210
but if you watch shaggy and Scooby,
you see it right there.

1082
01:07:36.211 --> 01:07:39.280
They're making fun of the whole Woodstock generation.
Um,

1083
01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:42.180
and did I mention that early?
I can't even remember if you watched that fucking,

1084
01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:43.523
uh,

1085
01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:47.910
there's a documentary about Bill Graham and this and he's having the last night

1086
01:07:47.911 --> 01:07:50.430
at the Fillmore and there's an,
there's a musician.

1087
01:07:50.431 --> 01:07:53.370
If anybody can find the clip on Youtube,
I think they took it down.

1088
01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:58.050
That guy's just like,
well,
hey man,
you know,
just like,
you know,
man,
it's like,

1089
01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:59.203
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1090
01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:03.450
<v 0>like fuck you and thanks for their memories man.
You know what I'm saying?
Man,</v>

1091
01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.500
you gotta listen to the guy.
That's the guy everybody's making fun of.
All right.

1092
01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:13.200
That's what I'm doing.
I realized that people in 2011 don't talk that way,
sir.

1093
01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:14.580
So anyways,
he said,

1094
01:08:14.581 --> 01:08:18.790
most part smokers are like anyone else and don't sound like they have down

1095
01:08:18.791 --> 01:08:21.680
syndrome.
As funny as you are,

1096
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:26.800
it pains me to hear you talk out your ass when usually you have good points.

1097
01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.340
Please smoke a joint and shut the hell up.
All right.

1098
01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:34.150
That part was funny.
Uh,
ps,

1099
01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.010
I know you're going to tell me to go fuck myself cause it's your podcast,

1100
01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:41.420
but I'm sure I'm not the only one who notices this about you.
Uh,
you know what,

1101
01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:43.340
I'm going to tell you what I'm really sick of.

1102
01:08:43.341 --> 01:08:47.930
I'm really sick of overly sensitive fucking pot smokers.
You know,

1103
01:08:47.931 --> 01:08:51.680
you guys are about to self righteous.
His fucking Jesus freaks.
I've added,

1104
01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:55.910
I've had it with you guys.
I've had it with your lies of how,
uh,
you know,

1105
01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:58.010
you know,
there's like there's no drinking and driving.

1106
01:08:58.011 --> 01:09:00.950
You can get pulled over for that and there's a test and there's nothing for
weed.

1107
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.830
And then pot smokers say,
well,
you know what?

1108
01:09:03.831 --> 01:09:06.500
I actually think you drive better when you're high.

1109
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:11.670
<v 10>You know,
everything's so fucking clear.
They say dumb shit like that.</v>

1110
01:09:11.671 --> 01:09:16.140
They say smoking weed is not addicting.
I just do it cause I like it.

1111
01:09:17.650 --> 01:09:20.260
You're all fucking full of shit.
All right.

1112
01:09:20.261 --> 01:09:23.200
I think weed is one of the more dangerous drugs is because everybody thinks it

1113
01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:24.250
isn't fucking dangerous.

1114
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:28.450
And I think the danger of that drug is that [inaudible] I don't know.

1115
01:09:28.451 --> 01:09:32.140
It just makes you want to sit on the goddamn couch.
All right,

1116
01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:33.870
now kind of course someone's going to send me an email.

1117
01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:35.020
He smoked weed every fucking day.

1118
01:09:35.021 --> 01:09:38.570
And I'm a fucking the Valedictorian of my class.
Rarely.
Well,

1119
01:09:38.571 --> 01:09:42.340
you're a fucker exception.
All right.
You are doing damage to your brain.

1120
01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.030
You are fucking burning up your brain cells.
Why can't weed smokers admit that?

1121
01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.810
Is it because it's illegal and you want to make it legal that you can't be

1122
01:09:49.811 --> 01:09:54.700
honest the way a drunk like I am that alcohol fucking turn your nose into

1123
01:09:54.701 --> 01:09:58.900
fucking,
you'll look like WC fields.
It fucks up your liver.

1124
01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.250
It kills brain cells.

1125
01:10:00.251 --> 01:10:03.160
You get behind the wheel of a car and you could kill yourself or even worse.

1126
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:06.520
Kill somebody else.
Why can't you guys admit that shit?

1127
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:12.470
Ha Ha man.
Why can't you say that man?

1128
01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.110
I'm just fucking with you by the way.
You know what?
I can't.
I can't actually,

1129
01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:18.110
you can't say,
oh I'll weed smokers like that cause I only got one fucking email.

1130
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:22.730
Somebody really disagreeing with me on my views on weed.

1131
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:24.703
Um,

1132
01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:29.550
<v 0>I don't know.
I don't fucking know.
You know my one thing I will,
I will,</v>

1133
01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:34.230
I will stand by this cause I am just fucking around.
I do know this.
All right.

1134
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:38.760
You can come home after work and have a beer,
possibly two beers,

1135
01:10:38.761 --> 01:10:43.320
depending on your tolerance and yet maybe you're a little buzzed.

1136
01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:48.420
That's it.
These motherfuckers who come home and get,
they get high,

1137
01:10:48.421 --> 01:10:53.070
you get high,
you,
you basically do the same as me drinking like six beers.

1138
01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:57.330
It'd be like me getting drunk every night.
If I drank six beers every night,

1139
01:10:57.510 --> 01:11:01.050
my girl would be talking to me going,
I think you need to go to some meetings,

1140
01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:04.680
but there's really no meetings for people who smoke weed.

1141
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:09.750
Basically every fuck if you,
if you're getting high for fucking nights a week,

1142
01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.160
think about this shit.
All right?

1143
01:11:11.161 --> 01:11:15.180
You multiply that times 52 fucking not to freak you out,
man.

1144
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.290
This is fucking 208 days of the year.
You're fucking high.

1145
01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:23.010
If I'm getting drunk two on eight times a year,

1146
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:26.460
which was I at one point I think I was,
that's what I finally,

1147
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:29.850
I started doing the fucking math and I was like,

1148
01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:32.670
I am very quietly kind of a fucking alcoholic here.

1149
01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:36.590
If you get drunk two times a week,
a year.

1150
01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:38.870
I'm really sounding like a fucking cut right now,
but I'm just,

1151
01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:43.250
this is just shit I worked out.
If you get drunk two times a week,
Friday,

1152
01:11:43.251 --> 01:11:47.150
Saturday night,
that's over a hundred days a year.

1153
01:11:47.151 --> 01:11:49.550
That's basically a third of the year your shit faced.

1154
01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:53.820
That's the only two times a fucking week.
Eight days a month,
you know?

1155
01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:58.670
Then you throw in a random Monday night football.
I would like another Pale Ale,

1156
01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:02.950
you know?
Next thing you know you had three or four walk out of the house.

1157
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:06.670
You fucking feel like you're floating in your loafers,
right?

1158
01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.410
You get out there and your Toyota Camry,
you didn't hit anybody.
You go home,

1159
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:13.660
you wake up the next day,
you feel like shit.
All right.

1160
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:17.290
How many times you do that?
A year at least 20 right?

1161
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:19.030
There's a third of the year your shit faced.

1162
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.540
So pot smokers on the other hand,
I,
you know,
they,

1163
01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.430
they got a whole different thing like five fucking walked by a guy in a car and

1164
01:12:29.431 --> 01:12:33.120
he's got a bear.
I can't just come up to the window.
Amen.
Let me get,

1165
01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:36.510
let me get a couple of Poles off of that.
Just shotgun,
one of his bears.

1166
01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:41.910
Thanks Matt.
Thanks for getting me drunk.
Like pot smokers,

1167
01:12:41.911 --> 01:12:44.760
they do that shit all day.
Maybe because it's illegal.
I don't know what it is,

1168
01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:49.920
but they get fucking baked,
which is the equivalent,
I think.
I haven't like,

1169
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:51.510
you know,
four,
five,
six beers.

1170
01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:53.003
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1171
01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:55.660
<v 0>What I'm saying is,
is you pot smokers,</v>

1172
01:12:55.661 --> 01:12:59.920
you're a lot more fucked up than you realize to get off your goddamn high horses

1173
01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:02.200
or is it,
you're not even on high horses.

1174
01:13:02.201 --> 01:13:04.630
You just trying to tone down the effects of that shit.

1175
01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:06.400
Isn't that what you're doing?

1176
01:13:06.401 --> 01:13:09.310
So they'll make it legal so you can just smoke it and not worry about it.

1177
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:15.130
And not to mention how toxic fucking weed is now I remember when I was living in

1178
01:13:15.131 --> 01:13:19.720
New York,
there's Duke came out to music.
Yo,
I smoke this shit last night.

1179
01:13:19.810 --> 01:13:24.040
It's called with tardy cause Yo,
you'd be smoking that Shit.
Yo.

1180
01:13:24.041 --> 01:13:27.040
You just be retarded.
You'd just be sitting there.

1181
01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:31.810
You'd just be sitting there like this,
Yo.
And he makes his fucking face.

1182
01:13:31.811 --> 01:13:36.120
Like he doesn't have a thought in his goddamn head.
All right,

1183
01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.470
I'll let shit chronic,

1184
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.040
all of that shit that just fucking burns your Goddam head up.

1185
01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:45.570
I don't know it,
uh,
you know,
fuck you know something.
Go fuck yourselves.

1186
01:13:45.571 --> 01:13:47.850
If I can sit here and admit how bad whiskey is,

1187
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:51.930
and then I was sitting there like Judy Garland for a quarter of the year,

1188
01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:00.270
you know what I mean?
I'm not saying you should quit.

1189
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:04.470
I'm not saying that you shouldn't,
did,
you know,
you shouldn't smoke more of it.

1190
01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.680
I'm just saying stop acting like you're taking fucking a Flintstone vitamins,

1191
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:15.250
you know,
because if you really wanted to,
rather than smoking it,

1192
01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:17.940
you could turn it into a hoodie.
Okay.
All right.

1193
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.740
The fucking declaration of independence.
Isn't that what they said?

1194
01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:22.840
Isn't that one of the,
the theories out there,

1195
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:29.110
declaration of independence has written on hemp paper,
man.
Um,
anyways,

1196
01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.430
so someone who agrees with my views on pot,
I can I,

1197
01:14:31.431 --> 01:14:34.210
the amount of listeners I'm going to fucking probably lose this week

1198
01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:42.490
agrees with your view on pot.
Here we go.
Hey bill this morning.
Uh,
okay.

1199
01:14:42.491 --> 01:14:42.821
Hey bill,

1200
01:14:42.821 --> 01:14:46.300
this has been bothering me for a little while now and I'm not sure what to do.

1201
01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:51.520
I'm 19 years old.
I go to Umass Amherst,
go minutemen.

1202
01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:54.160
Um,
I had a guess.
One of the worst fucking names,

1203
01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:58.120
you know something minimum used to be like the fighters because they can be

1204
01:14:58.121 --> 01:15:01.660
ready in a minute,
right?
The minute men and go fight the real revolution.

1205
01:15:01.661 --> 01:15:05.910
And then somewhere along the line I believe hip hop and RNB turn minute men and

1206
01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.630
to people who prematurely ejaculate.

1207
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:11.980
Do you like how my sentence slowed down there?

1208
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:16.530
Cause there was too many words with big syllables.
Uh,
no,

1209
01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.410
I just been hitting it hard down here.
Sorry.
Um,

1210
01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.970
I had a girlfriend my first semester of college and was still in high school

1211
01:15:22.090 --> 01:15:27.010
when I was still in high school.
They go,
oh,
she was still in high school.

1212
01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.510
Oh wait a minute.
Sorry.
Now it's getting a little creepy.
Well,
she is senior.

1213
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:33.303
Um,

1214
01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:38.350
we both knew that I would be going far away and we agreed we would stay
together.

1215
01:15:38.351 --> 01:15:41.470
However,
I guess her feelings changed and she wanted to be single.

1216
01:15:42.130 --> 01:15:45.820
I was devastated when she broke up with me and I've been really down because she

1217
01:15:45.821 --> 01:15:48.910
was the first girlfriend that I really liked.
Didn't I read this last week?

1218
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:52.840
I think this happens to a lot of guys and I wasn't just trying to get laid.

1219
01:15:52.841 --> 01:15:53.680
I really liked this girl.

1220
01:15:53.681 --> 01:15:56.410
So after a few weeks I found out she was hooking up with this kid that I

1221
01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:01.480
consider to be a friend.
This is the exact same as last week.
I swear to God.

1222
01:16:01.481 --> 01:16:03.790
This is different media email though.
Uh,

1223
01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:06.100
because we've been hanging out over the summer and partying together.

1224
01:16:06.101 --> 01:16:08.920
What's fucked up about the whole situation is that this isn't the first time

1225
01:16:08.921 --> 01:16:10.500
I'll ever read this.
Last week didn't I?

1226
01:16:10.501 --> 01:16:12.490
This isn't the first time this guy has done this to me.

1227
01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.810
And at the end of my senior year,

1228
01:16:13.811 --> 01:16:17.680
I broke up with a different girl and this kid was hooking up with her about a

1229
01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.510
month later.
Then I answered this one.
I let that one slide again.

1230
01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:26.440
I didn't really give a fuck about any of his girlfriends.
Yeah,
dude,
blah,
blah,

1231
01:16:26.441 --> 01:16:31.030
blah,
blah,
blah.
So it was questioned as,
should I go back to this kid and uh,

1232
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:35.680
tell them to stop going after my ex girlfriends?
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah,
he should.

1233
01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.490
He should.
I mean,
who gives a fuck?
He's going after you're sloppy seconds.

1234
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:41.590
Just ask them that.
I thought I said this last week.

1235
01:16:41.591 --> 01:16:42.940
Just call them up and be like,
listen dude,

1236
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.940
do you have an ability to get laid without fucking something that my Dick's

1237
01:16:45.941 --> 01:16:50.140
already been in?
All right.
Do I have to be your Dick Lewis and Clark?

1238
01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:51.520
The fuck is wrong with you.

1239
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:55.810
Why don't you go forge some of your own stop being Coby Bryan and being Michael

1240
01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:59.080
Jordan stopped doing the shit that I already did and taking credit for it.

1241
01:16:59.110 --> 01:17:01.990
You fucking cunt.
Fuck you.

1242
01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.560
And that fucking whore that you're with right now.
Okay.

1243
01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.560
Do you realize that this keeps up?
Someday I'll be able to say,
Hey,

1244
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.970
I fucked your wife right before you fell in love with her.
She loved it.

1245
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:18.110
And the edge,
um,
just say some mean shit like that.
All right?

1246
01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:24.590
How the fuck was that?
Agrees with me on pot.
I am I an idiot.
All right.
Advice

1247
01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:26.150
built.

1248
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:31.040
This is my tale of woe and in the interest of preserving the flow of the story,

1249
01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:32.390
I'm using names.

1250
01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:38.120
So I started at a Lexus dealership back in August a little bit after that.

1251
01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:41.180
A girl,
I don't give a fuck if you,
you know something.
I don't name names,

1252
01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.790
but if you guys are going to put names in your fucking thing,

1253
01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:44.930
I'm not going to say last names,

1254
01:17:44.931 --> 01:17:49.130
but I'm just going to name the names because my reading out loud skills are so

1255
01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:52.960
fucking bad.
I don't,
I don't have time to add other shit here.
All right.

1256
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:54.170
So anyways,
so bill,

1257
01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:57.440
I started working at a Lexus dealership back in August a little bit after that.

1258
01:17:57.441 --> 01:18:02.120
A girl named Ashley started in the Accounting Department.
She was a cutie.

1259
01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.131
Uh,
for a few weeks.

1260
01:18:04.131 --> 01:18:07.910
I kept getting shit from the guys in the parts department for not going after

1261
01:18:07.911 --> 01:18:09.830
her.
That's hilarious.

1262
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:13.620
What are they all married or the older perverts a little bit at a man who you're

1263
01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:16.520
not sticking your fucking Dick in a ah,
go over there.

1264
01:18:16.521 --> 01:18:19.550
What do you will fucking fig.
Um,

1265
01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.810
so they've given me shit for not going after,
but uh,
but I had a good reason.

1266
01:18:23.811 --> 01:18:27.890
She was 20 years old.
I'm 23,
so it's not overly creepy dude.

1267
01:18:27.891 --> 01:18:29.750
That's not even close to being creepy.

1268
01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.960
That's good that you have a conscious about that.
But think about that.

1269
01:18:32.961 --> 01:18:35.420
Someday when you're fucking 47,

1270
01:18:35.421 --> 01:18:39.230
she's going to be 44 and she's going to be up your ass telling you were and

1271
01:18:39.231 --> 01:18:41.120
where you can't wear your shoes in the house.

1272
01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.010
So why don't you bang her at the height of her fucking good looks.
All right.

1273
01:18:46.011 --> 01:18:48.710
Get that thought right out of your head.
That's my first piece of advice.

1274
01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.630
All right,
let's continue.
Uh,
right from the start.

1275
01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:54.500
I knew she was going to be the kind of girl that could only communicate through

1276
01:18:54.501 --> 01:18:57.680
her thumbs,
text messaging a and B,

1277
01:18:57.681 --> 01:19:02.480
too immature to handle any actual conversation.
Not to sound self righteous.
Uh,

1278
01:19:02.481 --> 01:19:04.580
but going after against my better judgment,

1279
01:19:04.581 --> 01:19:06.260
I followed my Dick's advice to started,

1280
01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:09.890
started to get something going after a few weeks of us chatting every once in

1281
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:15.140
awhile,
I told her,
I told her I needed a massage.
A.

1282
01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:19.700
Okay,
dude,
that's a really creepy way to try to get her in the boat,
so to speak.

1283
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:23.210
I need a massage.
All right,

1284
01:19:23.211 --> 01:19:25.880
well we'll deal with your opening lines later on in this.
All right.

1285
01:19:25.881 --> 01:19:29.480
But just put a little fucking little little check next to that to that.

1286
01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:34.190
That's not a,
that's a creepy way to fucking enter the atmosphere there.

1287
01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:38.210
All right.
Um,
anyways,
like a champ.
She tried her best to oblige,

1288
01:19:38.211 --> 01:19:41.690
but shit kept popping up when she walked by again.

1289
01:19:41.691 --> 01:19:46.490
I jokingly handed her my number telling her to call me and we'll schedule that

1290
01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:49.730
massage.
That's just creepy.

1291
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.180
Massage is creepy.
That's,

1292
01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:58.100
that's a creepy word because creeps go to massage parlors and they have people

1293
01:19:58.101 --> 01:20:00.710
fucking do things to them.
That is fucking creepy.

1294
01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:05.000
And also a lot of perverts kind of go with the massage thing.
You're young,

1295
01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:06.410
you're 23.
I get it.

1296
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:11.470
I had zero game at 23 beyond zero subzero freezing temperatures.

1297
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.410
I was horrific with women at 23.

1298
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:18.900
So the fact that you're even given a girl a number,
I right.

1299
01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:21.990
You're way beyond where the fuck I was.
Act.
I'm not talking down to you,

1300
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:25.500
but she got to get the word massage out of your fucking game.

1301
01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:30.120
It's just a creepy fucking word.
And it creeps women out.
Um,
anyways,

1302
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:34.080
the day after I wake up with a t that,
um,
after I gave the text message,
whatever,

1303
01:20:34.090 --> 01:20:36.690
I give them a number of the day after I wake up,
I have a text message says,
hey,

1304
01:20:36.691 --> 01:20:41.430
it's Ashley.
I can't help it.
So he says,
so I can't help but think.
Gotcha bitch.

1305
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:44.580
That's nice.
So,
uh,
so after week of texts we get together,

1306
01:20:44.581 --> 01:20:47.880
she finally calls me and pretty much in fights herself over to my house.

1307
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:52.140
She comes over all gussied up.
Perfect outfit,
perfect makeup,

1308
01:20:52.141 --> 01:20:54.990
the whole fucking package.
Uh,

1309
01:20:54.991 --> 01:20:58.610
we watched some TV and she comes up with the idea of bringing booze into the

1310
01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:02.640
situation.
Very nice.
I agree.
After a few hours or so,
she finally says,

1311
01:21:02.641 --> 01:21:05.880
I got to go.
She gets up to leave.

1312
01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:09.390
She tries to give me a high five as a goodbye.

1313
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:13.980
So I come back with,
I'm more of a kiss.
Good night kind of guy.

1314
01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:19.860
Jesus Christ,
Dude.
All she does is laugh and start walking to her car.

1315
01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:23.970
I got mind fucked.
All right.
First of all,
dude,
um,

1316
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:29.520
you were there for two hours and you were drinking and she's over there at some

1317
01:21:29.521 --> 01:21:33.150
point.
There's a moment where you got to make a move.

1318
01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:35.070
If you don't make a move,

1319
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:38.580
then it gets weird and then they just shut down and say,
okay,

1320
01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:43.560
this guy is an interested,
so then she's going to leave.
Then she says,
hey,

1321
01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:49.190
good stuff because the I five year and then all of a sudden you try to make it

1322
01:21:49.741 --> 01:21:51.480
intimate in the last five seconds,

1323
01:21:51.481 --> 01:21:53.460
you're going to be there and you come with a more of a kiss.

1324
01:21:53.461 --> 01:21:56.760
Good night kind of guy.
That's just creepy,
dude.
You're creeping them out.

1325
01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.920
All right,
but I get it.
All right.
I was creeping them.
I was,

1326
01:22:01.930 --> 01:22:04.950
I wasn't even in the game to creep them out at that point and I went through my

1327
01:22:04.951 --> 01:22:08.370
phase where I was creeping them out.
I said,
dumb shit like that before too,

1328
01:22:08.371 --> 01:22:12.750
so don't feel embarrassed or anything.
Okay.
You're just,
you're coming with a,

1329
01:22:12.751 --> 01:22:16.140
you know,
it's like you're right in your first five minutes of comedy here.

1330
01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:18.890
You know this.
None of this shit.

1331
01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.420
This is going to be embarrassing when you get older.
All right,
here we go.

1332
01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:24.000
This continuous,
after another week or so,

1333
01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:27.750
she calls me up again and invites herself over.
Very nice.
She comes over again.

1334
01:22:27.751 --> 01:22:31.920
All gussied up.
We pop in waiting.
I don't even know what that is.
That's a movie.

1335
01:22:31.921 --> 01:22:34.130
Okay,
and she gets the booze.

1336
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:38.880
A few minutes go by and she asks if I want the massage.
Very nice.

1337
01:22:39.170 --> 01:22:41.850
Said I never got on my stomach so quickly.
She straddles me.

1338
01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.950
It tells me to take my shirt off.

1339
01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:49.130
I get a good 30 minutes in and I asked if I'm doing her next dude.

1340
01:22:50.551 --> 01:22:53.670
Your lines that it's like blunt force trauma.

1341
01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:56.210
You just punching this girl right between her tits with you,

1342
01:22:56.211 --> 01:22:59.640
with the alliance here.
Um,
anyway,
she says,

1343
01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:01.230
she tells me she doesn't know.

1344
01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:06.610
So I tell her just to lay down while telling her can't work with shirts.

1345
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:14.440
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

1346
01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:18.520
you can you try to finesse it a little bit?

1347
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:24.140
I don't do I fi's.
I'm more about the kids.
Get your tongue out this weighty.
Oh,

1348
01:23:24.141 --> 01:23:25.240
you ain't leaving the house.

1349
01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.170
Are you lean it against the fucking door when you said that.
Um,

1350
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:34.300
Jesus Christ.
Okay.
I say I'm not good with shirts.

1351
01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:35.134
Where the hell am I?

1352
01:23:35.290 --> 01:23:40.270
She's so she takes her shirt off and let me guess as she took her shirt off.

1353
01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:43.990
You didn't say anything,
you weren't touching her or anything.
You just sat there.

1354
01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:48.100
So it could be as awkward as humanly possible as you heard the sound of her

1355
01:23:48.101 --> 01:23:50.830
taking her shirt off.
Um,

1356
01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:54.690
is if she's just gotten arrested for drugs or something.
Uh,

1357
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:59.050
she takes his shirt off and leaves on her Bra.
Of course she does,
but uh,

1358
01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:02.140
that quickly gets out of the picture.
Very nice.
It's fucking guys.

1359
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:06.230
Oh cause she's 20.
I get it.
So her mind saying no,
but she's too embarrassed.

1360
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:10.450
So she continues.
All right.
After a while she says she has to go,
but I told her,

1361
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.880
um,
she could just sleep here.
She agreed.

1362
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.150
So thinking I was going to get laid.

1363
01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:21.151
I went and I took a piss and got back to my room to find her fully clothed with

1364
01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:26.890
her fucking coat on in my bed.
I couldn't stop thinking,

1365
01:24:26.891 --> 01:24:30.610
what the fuck he goes.
I slept pretty good though.
All right.

1366
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:34.950
For all you rookies out there,
uh,

1367
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.980
there's a lot of guilt that young women have when they're,

1368
01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.050
when they're going to hook up or whatever that they're doing.

1369
01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:44.020
They got a lot of voices in their hand by my being a whore and that type of

1370
01:24:44.021 --> 01:24:48.880
thing.
So the thing is you got to keep the fucking plate spinning.
All right?

1371
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:53.410
You can't leave them alone if you leave them alone for any period of time.

1372
01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.350
That gives them a chance to entertain that voice that's saying,

1373
01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.620
why am I doing this?
Do I want to do this?
I work with this guy.

1374
01:24:59.621 --> 01:25:04.480
We're not even going out.
You gave her time to basically do the right thing.

1375
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:10.630
Um,
I don't know.
So yeah.
So yeah,
of course she come back,

1376
01:25:10.631 --> 01:25:14.250
she's fully fucking clothes.
It's like a,
and I don't,

1377
01:25:14.251 --> 01:25:16.180
I don't use the analogy now.
I'm all set.

1378
01:25:16.181 --> 01:25:18.970
I'm feeling like a creep now cause I'm trying to teach you how to fucking bang a

1379
01:25:18.971 --> 01:25:21.610
girl like this.
This whole fucking emails just really creepy,

1380
01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.970
but I'm halfway through it.
I can't stop now people.
All right,
let's go.

1381
01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:28.840
He says now for the good part,
uh,
December rolled around.
Okay.

1382
01:25:28.841 --> 01:25:32.200
Well you've really never given told me when this started.
Oh,
he said August.

1383
01:25:32.201 --> 01:25:33.580
That's right.
My fault.
My fault.
All right.

1384
01:25:33.581 --> 01:25:36.640
December rolled around and there was a company Christmas party,

1385
01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:41.950
old Jesus at my boss's house,
which we both attended,
me and a buddy,

1386
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:44.240
I'm not saying his name when,

1387
01:25:44.241 --> 01:25:49.241
and she immediately finds and latches onto me after a few hours and her friends

1388
01:25:50.621 --> 01:25:53.740
giving her a fuck load of booze to,
to suck on.

1389
01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:58.240
She comes up to me and asks if I want to get out of there while biting her lower

1390
01:25:58.241 --> 01:26:01.780
lip and other gestures to that drive me crazy.
I agree.

1391
01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:05.660
Then she goes out of her way to invite this,
this other dude along,

1392
01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:10.430
which leads us to believe that there's going to be some sort of double

1393
01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:14.210
penetration action.
Jesus Christ.

1394
01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.490
Now she's bringing this other guy

1395
01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:20.090
to fuck the whole thing up.

1396
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:24.630
That's going to be like the chaperone 20 ways we choose.
This is,

1397
01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.600
this is how,
so,
uh,
you know,
the next day the phone call,

1398
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:31.040
this is how all this shit goes.

1399
01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:33.350
Cause men and women just do not think the fucking same way,

1400
01:26:33.351 --> 01:26:38.120
especially at this God damn age completely not understanding what's going on

1401
01:26:38.121 --> 01:26:40.250
here.
Anyway,
so he said,
we choose my place for the,

1402
01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:43.940
for the alcohol and head out while we're walking out to the car.

1403
01:26:43.941 --> 01:26:45.830
She has her hands all over me.

1404
01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:50.420
So I'm thinking this shit is going down to this girl.
She's a Dick.
Tease man.

1405
01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.320
Jesus Christ.

1406
01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:55.490
We get to my place and we crack open some bear and she blatantly asked me to put

1407
01:26:55.491 --> 01:26:59.570
some porn on to watch.
Isn't this what happened to like that?
The,

1408
01:26:59.571 --> 01:27:03.540
the fucking Duke Lacrosse team?
Um,
at this point I think it's,

1409
01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:04.850
it's fucking over with.

1410
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:09.320
I start getting all touchy feely with her and she seems a little annoyed.

1411
01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:13.340
Finally she starts to wrestle with me and I go in to kiss her and she dodges me

1412
01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.940
thinking she was playing.
I continued my advances.

1413
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.220
Now there's a lot of women getting upset here.

1414
01:27:19.221 --> 01:27:22.010
You can't get fucking upset when she's doing that shit.
You want to come on?

1415
01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:26.300
Can we just hang out a little bite of the bottom lip?
Let's put a point on.

1416
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.980
Um,
I continue my advances and then she gets genuinely offended.

1417
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:32.300
Me being a little angry.

1418
01:27:32.301 --> 01:27:36.080
I asked the other dude to leave so we can have a little chat and I proceed to

1419
01:27:36.081 --> 01:27:39.860
ask her what the fuck,
what the fuck she's looking for here?

1420
01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:42.980
She tells me nothing and that she doesn't have any interest in me.

1421
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:44.540
Fucking furious.

1422
01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:49.220
I just start playing a video game and drink Jameson while she continues to ask

1423
01:27:49.221 --> 01:27:54.050
me what's wrong.
I'd never been so close to punching a girl.
In closing,

1424
01:27:54.051 --> 01:27:58.010
I started sending her incredibly asshole,
his text messages.
Ah Dude,

1425
01:27:58.011 --> 01:28:01.940
why would you do that?
To self destruct?
Any chances of her talking to me again,

1426
01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:06.830
but I still left.
It still left a very conti taste in my mouth.

1427
01:28:06.831 --> 01:28:11.270
I'd love to hear your take on this.
All right dude.
All right.
Yeah,

1428
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:15.800
she's a Dick Tease.
All right.
And um,

1429
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:18.160
I,
I don't know if she's got a few

1430
01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:21.830
<v 10>fear of being alone.
She's using you,
she's using you for company.</v>

1431
01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.350
She's probably does now obviously it doesn't have a boyfriend,

1432
01:28:24.650 --> 01:28:27.350
so she needs to get rid of her little fucking sexual acts.

1433
01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:30.290
So she kind of takes it up to the point and then backs off from it.

1434
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:34.100
But the problem is with the girl like that,
that first night she came over there,

1435
01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:38.120
you had the close the deal and when you didn't close the fucking deal,
that's it.

1436
01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:42.350
You got to fucking walk away and once you realize that girl is mind fucking you

1437
01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:46.400
basically being a Dick Tease,
you have to two things you have to do.

1438
01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:49.460
You got to walk away and two,
you can't get mad.

1439
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:52.190
You have to accept that that's part of the fucking game,

1440
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.490
but for some reason you really want to still bang this girl.

1441
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:56.720
You have to realize that.

1442
01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.440
Then what you have to do is you have to start playing mind games back with her,

1443
01:29:00.441 --> 01:29:02.790
which personally gets fucking exhausting.

1444
01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.580
But if you want to do that in the future,

1445
01:29:05.581 --> 01:29:07.830
what you then do is the next day when you go to work,

1446
01:29:07.831 --> 01:29:12.660
this has provided you didn't get upset is when you see her,
you don't ignore her.

1447
01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:17.550
You're not snide to where you're not angry tour.
What you do is you like,
Hey,

1448
01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.730
are you doing big smile?
If it's acceptable,
a hug at work,

1449
01:29:20.731 --> 01:29:24.950
if he can do that or whatever,
you'd just beyond cool with her.
All right?

1450
01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:27.120
But you don't try to go out with her or anything.

1451
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:31.020
And then later on that day or whenever the opportunity arises,

1452
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:35.950
you compliment some other female within earshot of her.
All right?

1453
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:41.090
That will cause a dick tease to be like,
wait a minute,
eh,
la La

1454
01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:45.540
fucking start coming your way.
And that's how you,

1455
01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:48.660
that's how you get them on the boat.
You gotta you gotta just turn her,
you get,

1456
01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.230
it's weird.
You've got to walk backwards.
You know what it is?
It's like,

1457
01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:57.290
like charged magnets.
You know what I'm saying?
If you fucking,
uh,

1458
01:29:57.850 --> 01:30:00.860
if you take a fucking,
I don't know what the fuck it is.
What am I trying to say?

1459
01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.620
I don't try to say,
it's like you take a step towards it,

1460
01:30:03.710 --> 01:30:06.050
it fucking goes off the other direction.
If you walk away,

1461
01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:08.780
it starts coming towards you and you just got to slowly,

1462
01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:10.490
<v 1>okay.</v>

1463
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:15.210
<v 10>Slowly back them into the boat.
But I dunno,</v>

1464
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:15.751
I dunno.

1465
01:30:15.751 --> 01:30:18.510
I don't know what to tell you as far as you fucking open lines of what you

1466
01:30:18.511 --> 01:30:22.370
really have to do,
dude,
is when you just want to fuck a girl,
you have to say,

1467
01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.300
you got to present that to them,

1468
01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.420
<v 9>you know?
Um,</v>

1469
01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:31.060
<v 10>and the only way you got it,
you got to do it through bombing.
Okay?
You're,</v>

1470
01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:36.170
you're blunt force trauma
period.
I,
I dunno,
I,

1471
01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:39.890
it's,
it's impossible.
It's,
it's a,
it's like how do I learn how to do standup,

1472
01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.610
right?
Five minutes of jokes and you have to go up there.

1473
01:30:41.611 --> 01:30:43.530
That's all the only advice I can give you.
And you've got to go up there.

1474
01:30:43.650 --> 01:30:45.450
You got to fucking figure it out for yourself.
But like,

1475
01:30:45.451 --> 01:30:48.030
eventually you have to just,

1476
01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:53.430
you just want to bang a girl.
You can't,
uh,
does he,
you have the,

1477
01:30:53.431 --> 01:30:57.240
you have the right instincts.
You're steering the conversation towards sex,

1478
01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.000
but you're doing it at 90 miles an hour.

1479
01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:04.020
You're grabbing her by the back of the head and slamming her face into the wall.

1480
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.033
You can't do that.

1481
01:31:06.230 --> 01:31:07.063
<v 9>Uh,</v>

1482
01:31:07.930 --> 01:31:10.750
<v 10>you know,
I don't know.
I don't know where,
where,
where to begin.</v>

1483
01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:15.370
I'm trying to think of all the fucking horrific things that I did back in the

1484
01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:16.203
day.
Um,

1485
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:22.270
I remember one time hooking up with a girl who was like 23 or 24 when I was

1486
01:31:22.271 --> 01:31:26.660
about 33 or 34
and uh,

1487
01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.470
what the fuck she said at one point she got,

1488
01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:34.600
she came over to my apartment and I invite her in.
Right.

1489
01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:38.920
Cause I was a veteran at that point,
but I don't have to take it in the movie.

1490
01:31:38.921 --> 01:31:41.470
Why do they come on up?
Meet me over at my place.

1491
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:47.710
This is embarrassing.
So she came over at one point we start fucking making out,

1492
01:31:47.711 --> 01:31:50.920
doing whatever and then she says,
wait a minute,
where is this going?

1493
01:31:50.921 --> 01:31:54.430
She hits me with that shit and I was like,
uh,

1494
01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:58.480
I'm like 11 years older than you.
By the time you're 30,
I'm going to be 68.

1495
01:31:59.290 --> 01:32:01.030
What do you mean?
Where is this going?
It's going nowhere.

1496
01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:05.100
<v 0>You know,
this is just basically,
it's a sexual,</v>

1497
01:32:05.130 --> 01:32:08.570
I'm basically going to be the reason why you're not going to have a midlife

1498
01:32:08.670 --> 01:32:12.540
crisis because all the fucked up shit you want to try but are too afraid to do

1499
01:32:12.541 --> 01:32:15.870
with the guy you're in love with.
You can just do it with me.
Obviously.

1500
01:32:15.871 --> 01:32:18.840
I said it a little smoother than that,
and then,
you know,
she was just like,
oh,

1501
01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:19.733
all right.

1502
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:24.030
<v 10>Oh Jesus Christ.
And then,
oh,
I can't even tell you what happened then.</v>

1503
01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:29.110
And it's not sexual.
It's disgusting.
Oh God.

1504
01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:31.780
Now I gotta tell you this,
this is really fucked up.
This is why I'm so happy.

1505
01:32:31.781 --> 01:32:36.670
I've got a great girl now.
So we ended up fooling around
and,

1506
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:41.400
uh,
the next morning,
wake up,
you know,

1507
01:32:41.490 --> 01:32:46.110
he started in the living room
and in the bedroom,
you know,
that whole thing.

1508
01:32:46.111 --> 01:32:48.600
You never,
you never give them a chance to reconsider.
Right.

1509
01:32:49.710 --> 01:32:52.950
I don't even give them the chance to fucking think about it from the living room

1510
01:32:52.951 --> 01:32:56.030
into the bedroom.
You don't do that.
You just constantly hands or move in.

1511
01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:00.380
You kiss it on the whole fucking thing.
Right.
So
she goes to,

1512
01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:03.860
this is,
I can't believe I'm going to tell you this.
She goes,

1513
01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:08.150
I walk out into the living room the next day cause she's getting dressed and

1514
01:33:08.151 --> 01:33:12.740
she's looking for underwear.
And she had these white lace,

1515
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:17.240
like foggy kind of underwear,
not a thong.
Geez.
Not Thought.
Yeah.

1516
01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:23.690
And they were in a,
they were crumpled up on the floor.

1517
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:26.600
All right.
If anybody gets really grossed out,

1518
01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:31.070
I suggest just shut it off here right now.
All right.

1519
01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:34.610
I looked down at them,
so proud of myself,
you know,

1520
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:40.520
that I hooked up and I looked down and there was a skid mark about,

1521
01:33:40.850 --> 01:33:45.050
I would say at least four inches long and those white panties.

1522
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:49.460
And I was like,
what was going to fucking dry heave?

1523
01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.460
I didn't go down on her,
thank God.
Um,

1524
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:57.230
how else is really just coming back?
And I was just like,

1525
01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:01.560
I didn't know what to do cause she was like,
yeah,
well I can't find my underwear.

1526
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:04.280
Ha.
So I fucking went out to look for him and then I found them.

1527
01:34:04.281 --> 01:34:07.730
And then it's just like,
you know,
if I had a stick in my apartment,

1528
01:34:07.731 --> 01:34:11.140
I would have picked him up and
handed them or,

1529
01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.220
<v 0>but,
uh,
I didn't have a stick,
so I acted like I couldn't find,</v>

1530
01:34:17.410 --> 01:34:22.410
I wandered over towards the kitchen and then she came walking out and she's

1531
01:34:23.031 --> 01:34:24.230
like,
oh,
there they are.

1532
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:28.370
And I know she saw what the problem was and she tried to play it off and she

1533
01:34:28.371 --> 01:34:31.580
just put them on,
Ugh,

1534
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:35.400
that I,
you know what,
let's have a vote.

1535
01:34:35.401 --> 01:34:38.040
Was that the most disgusting story I've ever told in the pie?

1536
01:34:38.150 --> 01:34:42.750
That was fucking errific right.
I Dunno.
W was there any advice in that?

1537
01:34:42.751 --> 01:34:45.210
Jesus Christ,
I don't know.
How the fuck did I relived that one?

1538
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:50.240
<v 10>Wow.
Wow.
Um,</v>

1539
01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.860
<v 0>how about some youtube videos this week?</v>

1540
01:34:51.861 --> 01:34:56.030
Somebody sent me this youtube video of this guy on,
on,
uh,
Dr Phil.
He's like a,

1541
01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:58.100
he has this website,
men are better

1542
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.300
<v 10>than women.com.</v>

1543
01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:03.470
He's really like a cartoon chauvinists cartoon character kind of chauvinist

1544
01:35:03.471 --> 01:35:06.890
stick person where he's just like,
you know,
women aren't good at working.

1545
01:35:06.891 --> 01:35:09.860
I mean they shouldn't have,
they shouldn't be allowed to vote.
Like he does shit,

1546
01:35:09.861 --> 01:35:14.180
like at that level.
Um,
which is just cartoonish.

1547
01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.580
There's a couple of funny things that he says.

1548
01:35:16.581 --> 01:35:19.700
At one point he standing next to an ATM and he's taken cash out.
He goes,

1549
01:35:19.701 --> 01:35:22.930
this is how women perceive men.
This is how they look at,
right?

1550
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:27.740
Which obviously not all of them do,

1551
01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:30.530
but it's so it's such a true fucking statement.

1552
01:35:30.531 --> 01:35:33.830
If he just adjusted a few words,
said,

1553
01:35:34.050 --> 01:35:38.390
well if he said a lot of women or there's a sizeable group of women that look at

1554
01:35:38.391 --> 01:35:40.610
guys like this,
you know,

1555
01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:44.060
and I know there's a lot of broads out there that are getting upset by this,

1556
01:35:44.061 --> 01:35:47.750
but you know,
you guys say the same shit,

1557
01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:50.900
don't you guys go on TV and the radio and what's that expression?

1558
01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:54.690
A good man is hard to find,
you know,

1559
01:35:54.691 --> 01:35:57.960
but for some reason you can't say a good woman's hard to find.
They are,

1560
01:35:57.990 --> 01:36:00.780
they are hard to find.
But this guy basically,
so he goes on,

1561
01:36:00.781 --> 01:36:05.190
Dr Phil and this lady,
this lady starts heckling him.

1562
01:36:05.250 --> 01:36:06.480
And I'm telling you,

1563
01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:12.060
when I say a classic classic comeback,
this,

1564
01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.280
the,
the comeback this guy has,

1565
01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:19.540
would have any respectable standup comedian on the ground laughing this,

1566
01:36:20.130 --> 01:36:23.880
this fucking lady,
you know,
they do the usual shit.
You know,

1567
01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:28.010
when they get insulted when a guy insults them,
they do,
you know,
they,

1568
01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:31.620
they basically,
females have like a

1569
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.820
very,
I don't know,

1570
01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:36.510
for some reason they think they're very limited with their arguing ability.

1571
01:36:36.690 --> 01:36:38.720
Like if they get an argument with the guy,
then they're,

1572
01:36:38.721 --> 01:36:40.830
they're either going to attack your Dick size,

1573
01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:46.470
your sexuality or uh,
Oh yeah,
well,
whatever.

1574
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:49.740
So that's basically what this woman does.
She goes,
you know,
I'm listening to you.

1575
01:36:49.741 --> 01:36:51.780
I bet you you,
you don't go out with any women.
You know,

1576
01:36:51.781 --> 01:36:56.730
she attacked him that way and he fucking,
he,
he brings the hammer down.

1577
01:36:56.731 --> 01:36:57.930
I don't condone what this guy does.

1578
01:36:57.931 --> 01:37:01.620
I actually think what he's doing is like a paint by numbers.
So to shock.

1579
01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:02.993
There it is.

1580
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:09.050
I challenge anyone to have a gay or a ringtone than that.

1581
01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:11.613
<v 11>MMM.</v>

1582
01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:15.680
<v 10>Anyways,
uh,
check out that youtube video and a,</v>

1583
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:19.710
we got a bunch of other funny ones where I'm actually just coming up on an hour

1584
01:37:19.711 --> 01:37:21.810
here.
I'm trying not to make these things too fucking long.
Let's,

1585
01:37:21.811 --> 01:37:24.840
let me just read a couple more advice and then a couple more.
Is it racist,

1586
01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:29.550
racist?
Um,
all right,
here we go.
Bill high from Australia.
Uh,

1587
01:37:29.551 --> 01:37:32.700
I seem to share a lot of your views and I want some advice on women.
Jesus,

1588
01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.010
this is all women's stuff.
Oh,
this week I'm supposed,

1589
01:37:35.011 --> 01:37:38.130
I'm only asking you because I want confirmation of my stance,

1590
01:37:38.131 --> 01:37:40.920
but who gives a shit?
Okay.
So generally,
uh,

1591
01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:45.450
so I generally look for value in things that I buy are things that I do with my

1592
01:37:45.451 --> 01:37:47.400
time.
I'm in my mid twenties and my parents

1593
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:53.190
and my parents' friends put a lot of pressure on me to get a girlfriend.

1594
01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:58.440
I've had girlfriends and I always just got bored and sabotage it or fucked it up

1595
01:37:58.441 --> 01:38:01.860
somehow by not paying enough attention,
I pretty much decided that I want,

1596
01:38:01.890 --> 01:38:06.440
don't want to get married there.
Everybody calling me bom,
Bom,
Bom,

1597
01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:10.110
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
bom.
Bom makes me feel important.
It feels like,

1598
01:38:10.111 --> 01:38:11.280
like announcement music,

1599
01:38:11.281 --> 01:38:16.140
like I've just walked in and people that are acknowledging,
I know.
I'm sorry.

1600
01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:19.530
I need to download a rig tone.
I should have the oh,
Jesus ringtone.
But I don't,

1601
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:25.230
um,
anyways,
let's go back to this.
Um,
fucking sabotage shit.
To be honest,

1602
01:38:25.231 --> 01:38:28.800
I'd rather spend my money on myself and spend my time doing things I want to do.

1603
01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:32.310
Dude,
that's very,
that's very mature.
You know,
you,

1604
01:38:32.311 --> 01:38:34.440
all you're going to do is just end up hurting.
Somebody said,
yeah,

1605
01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:39.000
just bang them in and then leave that,
that hurts way less.
Especially,

1606
01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:42.060
especially if you're upfront.
Where does this go?
And it's going nowhere,

1607
01:38:42.061 --> 01:38:46.350
sweetheart.
You'll want to write it.
No,
sorry.
Um,

1608
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:49.260
as far as sex goes,
it takes too long.
What?

1609
01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:53.070
It's always worse than you thought it would be.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
I haven't read.

1610
01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:54.390
I haven't read any of these,
by the way.

1611
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:59.580
And you're sweating your balls off under two feet of thermal blankets.
Dude.

1612
01:38:59.581 --> 01:39:02.220
You know,
you have the option to not have those blankets on.
Seriously.

1613
01:39:02.221 --> 01:39:05.520
What the fuck is it with women and the temperature?
I digress.

1614
01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:09.000
Basically I find women overall to be bad value.

1615
01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:11.850
There's two types of men as I see it,

1616
01:39:12.150 --> 01:39:16.080
those interrelationships that seem to be able to tolerate,
tolerate women.

1617
01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:21.680
And those that women won't go out with because they're ugly or don't have enough

1618
01:39:21.811 --> 01:39:24.510
money.
But I don't fit into either one of those groups.

1619
01:39:24.511 --> 01:39:28.860
I think I'm perfectly capable of acquiring or girlfriend,
but I just can't do it.

1620
01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:31.440
At least I can't be bothered maintaining a relationship.

1621
01:39:31.441 --> 01:39:34.860
I could see myself still being single at your age and was wondering how you've

1622
01:39:34.861 --> 01:39:38.160
dealt with people constantly nagging you about being single.

1623
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:39.570
I can't really explain

1624
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:45.210
that the world is overpopulated and I'd rather watch my big TV and peace without

1625
01:39:45.211 --> 01:39:50.010
some little annoying prick running around because then I'm labeled as some sort

1626
01:39:50.011 --> 01:39:53.620
of inhumane monster.
Any advice you can offer will be much appreciated.

1627
01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.430
You don't need any advice,
dude.
You know who you are and you know what you want.

1628
01:39:56.431 --> 01:39:59.350
Just continued doing it.
And you have to realize that,
uh,

1629
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.840
people look out of their own heads,
you know?
That's so they see the world,

1630
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:07.560
how they see it.
And when you don't see it the way they do,
they argue it or they,

1631
01:40:07.561 --> 01:40:11.280
they're just confused.
Uh,
you're not hurting anybody.
You know,

1632
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:14.430
there's people out there who get married because they're of a certain age,
like,

1633
01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:16.610
I should be getting married.
This is the age you get married.

1634
01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:18.000
They married somebody they're not in love with,

1635
01:40:18.510 --> 01:40:23.420
which is a fucking horrific thing to do to somebody a lot more.
I don't know.

1636
01:40:23.421 --> 01:40:25.050
There's a lot of people out there who shouldn't have kids.

1637
01:40:25.051 --> 01:40:29.310
They just fucking have kids and that terrible fucking parents and their selfish.

1638
01:40:29.311 --> 01:40:33.480
They'd rather sit around watching TV like me or go learn how to play drums like

1639
01:40:33.481 --> 01:40:38.430
me.
I am a selfish self centered cunt and a I w I,

1640
01:40:38.431 --> 01:40:42.750
you know,
I think I'd be a good dad at this point,
but um,
you know,

1641
01:40:42.751 --> 01:40:46.470
I was an angry fucking maniac when I was in my twenties.
You think I'm angry now?

1642
01:40:46.471 --> 01:40:49.770
Like this podcast would even have been funny in my twenties.

1643
01:40:49.771 --> 01:40:54.070
It would just be like Jesus,
dude.
Um,
you know,

1644
01:40:54.071 --> 01:40:56.140
when I would have brought a kid in the world then he would have been an angry

1645
01:40:56.141 --> 01:40:57.550
maniac.
So,
uh,

1646
01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:01.780
I dunno kind of bugs me that I waited this long,

1647
01:41:01.781 --> 01:41:05.530
but in general I'm kind of glad I did.
Um,
in,
what else?
What that,

1648
01:41:05.531 --> 01:41:06.850
what the fuck was I going to read?
Oh,

1649
01:41:06.851 --> 01:41:10.810
I know a couple of oh Jesus ones and then we're out of here.
Where the hell,

1650
01:41:10.811 --> 01:41:13.120
how the hell do I get to this?
Ah,
you motherfucker.

1651
01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:16.870
While I'm trying to get to that,
I'm coming up.
I have,
um,

1652
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:19.150
I'm getting going to be at the uh,

1653
01:41:19.151 --> 01:41:23.090
the wise guys in Utah on uh,

1654
01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:26.710
March 18th and 19th.
I have all that information up on my website,

1655
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:30.790
[inaudible] dot com please show up for that show as is.

1656
01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:35.470
It's a nice quick flight and I would like to,
I like nice quick flights.

1657
01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:39.140
<v 0>Steven,
funny,
right?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Is it racist?</v>

1658
01:41:39.141 --> 01:41:40.280
I haven't read this one at all.

1659
01:41:40.281 --> 01:41:42.650
So I have no fucking idea what this person's going to say.

1660
01:41:42.651 --> 01:41:45.920
So forgive me if this one,
cause the really offensive,
ignorant ones.

1661
01:41:45.921 --> 01:41:49.490
I just don't read because I think people are just fucking around or you're just

1662
01:41:49.491 --> 01:41:54.350
beyond help.
All right.
Hey,
bill loved your podcast.
Love your comedy,
uh,
yet Dah,

1663
01:41:54.351 --> 01:41:57.140
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
Here's what I want to ask.
If he could be racist,
right?

1664
01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:02.120
Deukmejian when the team warms up in the shoot around,
uh,
I guess basketball,

1665
01:42:02.121 --> 01:42:07.121
they basically well shoot around and there's always one or two white guys who

1666
01:42:07.581 --> 01:42:08.540
are not players.

1667
01:42:08.541 --> 01:42:12.200
The team managers or assistants who passed the balls back to the players when

1668
01:42:12.201 --> 01:42:13.670
they make or miss their shots.

1669
01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:18.170
But the white player who was suited up in uniform was standing next to the other

1670
01:42:18.171 --> 01:42:22.700
assistants or managers and was passing the ball out to the other black players

1671
01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:25.730
and he never got a chance to take a shot before the game started.

1672
01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.750
Considering every player on the team warmed up,

1673
01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:34.220
except for the white guy who was sitting in a lawn chair rebounding for every

1674
01:42:34.221 --> 01:42:38.240
other black player on the team.
Is it racist?
Keep up the great work.

1675
01:42:40.670 --> 01:42:43.790
Um,
no,
there's no racism going there.

1676
01:42:43.791 --> 01:42:47.990
He's either lazy or hurt or there's some sort of hazing going on.

1677
01:42:47.991 --> 01:42:51.770
He might be a rookie or a fucked up in the last game and that's his punishment.

1678
01:42:52.730 --> 01:42:56.180
Or maybe it was his turn.
I have no idea.
There's no racism going on there.

1679
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:59.540
I don't think that they were saying,
ah,
you know,

1680
01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:03.980
do they have like a rally their team there and they just decided that,
uh,

1681
01:43:03.981 --> 01:43:07.250
that this guy could not shoot the fucking ball because he was white.
I mean,

1682
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:11.960
you're really,
you're really stretching it there.
I'll tell you though.
I did go.

1683
01:43:11.961 --> 01:43:16.400
I did daddy tell you guys this one I went to,
uh,
when I went to fucking a,

1684
01:43:16.401 --> 01:43:20.840
that Portland trailblazers game when I was with Paul Versey and we put money on

1685
01:43:20.841 --> 01:43:23.300
the trailblazers and they will make an a comeback against New Orleans.

1686
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:26.300
And they came down the court and a fast break and they ditched it over to the

1687
01:43:26.301 --> 01:43:28.790
white guy and he fucking,
I can't remember,
he missed a dunk or whatever.

1688
01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:29.693
In the second he did it,

1689
01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:32.480
me and Paul both looked at each other and went to fucking white guy,

1690
01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:38.240
fucking white guy.
Why would you get out of the game,
put on a suit and fucking,

1691
01:43:38.241 --> 01:43:39.800
you know,
start drawing on that,

1692
01:43:39.801 --> 01:43:43.970
that little fucking legal pad or whatever the fuck is she supposed to be doing,

1693
01:43:43.971 --> 01:43:46.250
but you know,
or stay out on the perimeter.

1694
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.920
Don't try to take it to the fucking rack.

1695
01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:52.190
And if you do try to take it to the wreck,
do it.
Pau Gasol

1696
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:56.150
<v 10>does just start screaming like he just got raped because maybe then you can take</v>

1697
01:43:56.151 --> 01:43:59.870
a couple of unguarded shots,
shots by the,
uh,
the foul line.
I'm telling you.

1698
01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:04.610
Watch your Lakers game anytime.
POW makes a move.
Oh,

1699
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:08.060
is he goes there.
I just fucking hate that fucking money.

1700
01:44:08.061 --> 01:44:11.570
He's a great basketball player.
But that fucking,
what are you yelling about?

1701
01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:16.230
Sorry.
All right,
Bill.
Is it racist?
Um,

1702
01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:20.940
is it racist for me to say all Asians are racist?
Uh,
yes,

1703
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:22.531
I would think so.

1704
01:44:22.531 --> 01:44:26.340
I'm a white guy that happens to have dated a lot of Asian women of different

1705
01:44:26.341 --> 01:44:30.360
backgrounds from some from Asian,
some Asian Americans,
some actually born abroad,

1706
01:44:30.570 --> 01:44:32.970
all of whom were explicitly racist,

1707
01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:36.930
mostly against other Asian ethnicities.
For example,

1708
01:44:36.931 --> 01:44:39.780
my Korean x hates Japanese people.

1709
01:44:40.170 --> 01:44:42.120
Chinese x hates Filipinos.

1710
01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:47.340
A Japanese x thinks the Chinese are stupid and the Thai Taiwanese are stuck up,

1711
01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:52.170
et cetera.
I should note that I didn't exclusively target Asian women who date.

1712
01:44:52.171 --> 01:44:56.280
I dated all sorts of women.
Some of them were Asian.
Uh,
my wife,
uh,

1713
01:44:56.281 --> 01:45:00.510
white girl thinks it's racist,
racist.
When I say that all Asians are racist.

1714
01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:05.130
Yeah,
well it is dude.
I mean just cause the five that you banked.
I mean,
how many,

1715
01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:06.480
you know,
me,
Asian women,

1716
01:45:06.481 --> 01:45:10.870
you would have to fucking have that experience with before you realize that now

1717
01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:15.780
I'm not going to sit here and try and pretend like those groups get along with

1718
01:45:15.781 --> 01:45:16.614
each other.

1719
01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:18.673
<v 1>You know,</v>

1720
01:45:19.110 --> 01:45:21.960
<v 10>it's pretty safe to say any country that borders and other country,</v>

1721
01:45:21.961 --> 01:45:22.794
they don't like them.

1722
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.823
<v 1>You know,</v>

1723
01:45:26.170 --> 01:45:30.160
<v 10>English England and Ireland,
England and France,
France and Germany,</v>

1724
01:45:30.161 --> 01:45:34.750
Germany and everybody.
Japan,
Koreans,
Japan would,
they did the,

1725
01:45:34.930 --> 01:45:38.200
I mean,
first of all,
I understand if a people,

1726
01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:40.960
China have issues with people in Japan.

1727
01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:43.330
What the fuck they did during World War Two?

1728
01:45:43.331 --> 01:45:47.260
I read this book called the rape and Nan King.
I mean,
that alone it was,

1729
01:45:47.261 --> 01:45:50.830
was just fucking brutal.
So I mean,
uh,
I don't know.

1730
01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:56.260
Maybe,
maybe you,
I dunno.
I don't know.
Maybe you just kept,
you know,

1731
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:58.090
you know,
when you keep dating women,
I,

1732
01:45:58.091 --> 01:46:02.540
every woman's a psycho and then he kind of figure out that you keep picking

1733
01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:04.370
psychos.
Did you see,
I don't know.
That's kind of,

1734
01:46:04.371 --> 01:46:08.570
I'm just kind of stretching it there.
How does that work?
Did you just keep

1735
01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:13.350
somehow picking racist Asian women?
Were you attracted to them?

1736
01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:15.120
And it's fucking bizarre,
but I think,
yeah,

1737
01:46:15.121 --> 01:46:17.580
I think it is racist to say that you can't say,

1738
01:46:18.450 --> 01:46:21.570
you could say every Asian woman I dated was racist.
If that's what it was.

1739
01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:25.890
Our,
the fuck knows.
Anyways,
hey bill as a fellow,

1740
01:46:25.891 --> 01:46:30.840
pasty white male dating a beautiful black woman.
I say racist shit all the time.

1741
01:46:32.690 --> 01:46:35.240
Really?
All right.
The n word is off limits,

1742
01:46:35.241 --> 01:46:38.300
but I do make fun of her for having the middle name.

1743
01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:43.070
Love Fonts is that I said
L.
La.
P.
H.
O.
N.
Z.

1744
01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:47.780
I also tend to react to any stories on TV shows about young black males by

1745
01:46:47.781 --> 01:46:49.100
saying how hard it,

1746
01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:55.890
how hard it did for me to live my life as a strong black man.
I see.

1747
01:46:55.891 --> 01:47:00.450
This is the danger of not reading these up before I considered entering the Mr.

1748
01:47:00.450 --> 01:47:04.890
Black San Diego contest.
That would be funny.
I guess.

1749
01:47:04.891 --> 01:47:08.190
Am I racist?
I'm going to end up marrying this beautiful woman.

1750
01:47:08.191 --> 01:47:11.850
Sorry about the comedy central show.
Not working out a few or Bubba Bubba.
Bubba.

1751
01:47:14.010 --> 01:47:17.010
Ah,
is it racist?
I,
I'd have to hear how you're doing it.

1752
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:21.570
If you fucking around and you're being a Dick,
uh,
you could be a dick.
Yeah.

1753
01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:21.811
I mean,

1754
01:47:21.811 --> 01:47:24.960
a lot of the shit that you said now that I read it out loud on the podcast

1755
01:47:24.961 --> 01:47:27.720
probably would be considered racist or offensive and that type of thing.

1756
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:32.600
It depends.
Is,
is your girlfriend laughing?
You know,
I mean,
I,

1757
01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:36.360
I believe me,
the shit that comes out of my mouth when I watch TV,

1758
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:40.020
every fucking thing you could think of.
I make fun of fucking everybody.

1759
01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:45.810
Um,
so I,
I if you,
if you're doing that,

1760
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:50.130
like my girl watches reality TV,
I fucking can't stand it.
Okay.

1761
01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:54.780
So I make fun of every goddamn person on it.
And she laughed.

1762
01:47:54.781 --> 01:47:56.490
Sometimes other times she gets annoyed.

1763
01:47:56.491 --> 01:48:00.030
But the reason why she's getting annoyed is because I'm disrupting the show,

1764
01:48:00.031 --> 01:48:03.990
not because I'm truly saying anything offensive,
but,
um,

1765
01:48:05.970 --> 01:48:08.400
I dunno.
I Dunno.
Is it,
is it racist that you're doing that?

1766
01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:11.610
I think she would say something.
You know,

1767
01:48:11.611 --> 01:48:13.980
I think the day she gets up and punches you in the face,

1768
01:48:13.981 --> 01:48:15.990
I think you're going to know or she really gets mad.

1769
01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:17.640
And if she really gets fucking mad,

1770
01:48:17.641 --> 01:48:21.810
then you have to realize that should be that you're taking it beyond the point.

1771
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:26.110
Uh,
and then also just because you have a black girlfriend,
you can't use that.

1772
01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:30.300
It'd be like,
well,
I have a black girlfriend.
I can't be racist.
Yes you can.
Yes,

1773
01:48:30.301 --> 01:48:34.110
you can.
Um,
you could still be fucked up,
you know?

1774
01:48:35.670 --> 01:48:38.530
Right.
You can have issues,
but with other groups of people,
Jesus Christ,
I am,

1775
01:48:38.531 --> 01:48:39.900
I'm fucking sick of this topic.

1776
01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:42.960
I think this might be the last week of this fucking topic,
right?
I've had,

1777
01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:43.350
and you know what?

1778
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:46.770
Maybe it's because I'm in a hotel room where you can't open the fucking windows

1779
01:48:46.771 --> 01:48:50.910
and it's 900 fucking degrees out.
You know,

1780
01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.330
why can't I open the fucking windows and get fresh air in here instead of having

1781
01:48:54.331 --> 01:48:57.270
to turn on the God damn air conditioner.
Why the fuck can I do that shit?

1782
01:48:57.390 --> 01:49:00.210
You know why?
Cause there's a bunch of sue happy fucking cops out here,

1783
01:49:00.330 --> 01:49:02.850
which is why he can't open the fucking windows in a hotel room.

1784
01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:06.450
Cause they got to worry that some Douche bag is going to get drunk and fall out

1785
01:49:06.570 --> 01:49:09.180
or jump out himself,
you know?

1786
01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:11.580
So then guys like me have to suffer.

1787
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:15.420
It's the same fucking reason why you can't find a Goddamn hotel pool that's

1788
01:49:15.421 --> 01:49:19.050
deeper than three feet because some fucking assholes going to get drunk and

1789
01:49:19.051 --> 01:49:23.010
drown himself in a legitimate deep end.
Oh,

1790
01:49:23.011 --> 01:49:26.730
here's something I learned and I actually tweeted about it like a fucking pussy

1791
01:49:27.090 --> 01:49:31.080
is um,
here's one for you.
Don't judge a hotel by its lobby.

1792
01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:33.093
All right?

1793
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:37.500
It's the same thing is when you have a piece of shit car and you want to sell
it,

1794
01:49:37.501 --> 01:49:40.230
see you slap some rims on it,
you know,

1795
01:49:40.410 --> 01:49:44.080
or a high performance fucking exhaust system.

1796
01:49:44.081 --> 01:49:47.680
So it sounds like it has more power than it does.
All right.

1797
01:49:48.970 --> 01:49:49.950
It's fucking,
yeah,
cause they,

1798
01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:53.800
they go all out with the lobby and then he put that shit on the website and you

1799
01:49:53.801 --> 01:49:57.430
think everything's fucking fine and dandy.
And then all of a sudden what happens?

1800
01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:01.270
You get in the God damn elevator and you step off the elevator and they have

1801
01:50:01.271 --> 01:50:06.271
that casino rug from fucking 1973 it looks like they sewed together like 12

1802
01:50:06.821 --> 01:50:11.800
Robin Williams fucking shirts.
Dude,

1803
01:50:11.801 --> 01:50:16.090
I have an in my hotel,
I have an old school fucking,

1804
01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:20.410
what do you call the old all tube?
It's not a flat screen.

1805
01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:25.230
It's fucking ridiculous.
The amount of money.
I'm on Miami beach and I,

1806
01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:29.190
and I don't want to fucking talk about it.
Whatever.
All right,

1807
01:50:29.191 --> 01:50:31.240
that's the podcast for this God damn week.
All right.

1808
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:34.230
People stopped suing people so we can have legitimate fucking pools.

1809
01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:37.260
Can you scan?
You do that so you can open a hotel fucking window.

1810
01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:39.930
It's your fault if you fall out.
Okay.

1811
01:50:39.931 --> 01:50:43.110
It's your fault if your kids are moron and you're not a good parent.

1812
01:50:43.111 --> 01:50:45.540
If the kid crawled away from you and fell out the fucking window,

1813
01:50:45.570 --> 01:50:49.110
what were you doing?
Huh?
Tie him down.

1814
01:50:51.970 --> 01:50:54.700
That's fucking brutal.
Um,
all right,
that's the podcast for this week.

1815
01:50:54.701 --> 01:50:58.870
I'm going to have hide some ups,
upcoming dates here.
Uh,
I'm living,

1816
01:50:58.990 --> 01:51:02.950
I've never sweated during a fucking podcast before.
Suddenly ridiculously hot.

1817
01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:08.770
Um,
all right,
here we go.
Um,
and we at wise guys in West Valley City,
Utah,

1818
01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:15.610
um,
on March 18th and 19th.
Did you guys think about that?
That kid on Byu,

1819
01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:16.540
sorry,

1820
01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:21.340
I had the hiccups kid on Byu played on the basketball team and he admitted that

1821
01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:24.650
he had premarital sex,
knocked his girlfriend up,

1822
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:26.830
said he was gonna marry her and they still kicked him off the team.

1823
01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:30.530
<v 0>I got to go with the college on that one.
Believe it or not.
You know,</v>

1824
01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:33.260
they told you what the rules were.
If you didn't like the rules,

1825
01:51:33.261 --> 01:51:37.190
don't go to the fucking school.
You know?
That's like if I,

1826
01:51:37.191 --> 01:51:38.630
if I get booked on a corporate Gig,

1827
01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:40.520
I know I've used this example before and they said,

1828
01:51:40.521 --> 01:51:45.230
we want him to work totally clean.
This is how much we're going to pay.
And I say,

1829
01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:50.090
okay,
and then I show up and then I start dropping f bombs.
Right?

1830
01:51:52.510 --> 01:51:54.500
They're fucking [inaudible].
They have the right to get mad.

1831
01:51:54.501 --> 01:51:57.590
Don't take the fucking Gig.
Don't go to Byu Byu.

1832
01:51:57.630 --> 01:52:00.270
If you want some pussy this,
they,
they,

1833
01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.900
they make you sign a no pussy contract.

1834
01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:06.860
Don't sit there and act surprised and all these other fucking assholes who

1835
01:52:06.861 --> 01:52:09.650
aren't Mormons with 32 wide.
That's why they,

1836
01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:11.750
that's why they marry so many fucking women by the way.

1837
01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:14.990
So that they're trying to make up for those college years when they didn't get

1838
01:52:14.991 --> 01:52:19.040
the fuck,
you know,
and now because they're married,

1839
01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:23.060
they can have a fucking orgy.
Can you imagine that?

1840
01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:26.420
That would be,
that would probably,
do you think that would be worth it?

1841
01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:30.500
And I know the old joke,
Jesus Christ,
you can't put up with one woman gave love.

1842
01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:34.940
Welcome for,
you know,
actually the reality is she just get,
you know,

1843
01:52:34.941 --> 01:52:37.220
a couple of call girls and do that,

1844
01:52:37.221 --> 01:52:38.990
pay him and then just have them fucking leave.
Right?

1845
01:52:38.991 --> 01:52:42.950
That's probably what you should do.
But if you had four fucking wives,

1846
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:45.703
that would be great.

1847
01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:50.450
You would win every argument unless they all banded together,

1848
01:52:50.490 --> 01:52:53.920
then you'd be in trouble.
Oh Jesus.

1849
01:52:53.921 --> 01:52:55.930
You could do a lot of pimp shit to start,
you know,

1850
01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:59.790
to gain even more control.
You could just,
you know,

1851
01:52:59.791 --> 01:53:01.290
the ones that are the weakest one,

1852
01:53:01.291 --> 01:53:03.450
you start treating her the best cause she's doing all the good shit.

1853
01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:07.440
Then you break down the other ones,
you know,
do you get them in line?

1854
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:11.400
Then they look like once you know these proud

1855
01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.330
free mustangs running in the wind,

1856
01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:18.270
now they're just sitting there with their heads looking down at the carpet is

1857
01:53:18.271 --> 01:53:22.350
they bring you over TV dinner.
I think I'm gonna move to Utah.
Um,

1858
01:53:22.351 --> 01:53:24.150
I'm also going to be at the,
uh,

1859
01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:29.010
I'm going to be at the RECI stretchier theater.
And uh,

1860
01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:34.040
Maryland on April 8th and I'm going to be at the a tower theater in Philadelphia

1861
01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:38.370
on April the ninth.
Um,

1862
01:53:38.371 --> 01:53:42.420
all these dates are on billboard.com and uh,
that is that,
that is,

1863
01:53:42.810 --> 01:53:46.230
that is the podcast for this week.
I hope all you guys,
uh,

1864
01:53:46.830 --> 01:53:51.120
hope you enjoyed it.
Hope you learned some things.
I hope,

1865
01:53:51.121 --> 01:53:54.450
I hope I annoyed some pot heads out there.
Potheads I'm just fucking around it,

1866
01:53:54.451 --> 01:53:56.850
right.
Smoke it every goddamn day.
I don't give a shit.
All right,

1867
01:53:56.851 --> 01:53:59.970
but don't give me this horse shit that it's not addicting.
Alright.

1868
01:54:01.170 --> 01:54:05.000
You smoke it because you can't fucking deal.
Yeah.

1869
01:54:05.070 --> 01:54:07.290
I shouldn't even tell you this story.
I had a buddy of mine,
he was fucking,

1870
01:54:07.291 --> 01:54:10.950
he was working at a car dealership one time and he got high and there was

1871
01:54:10.951 --> 01:54:13.170
somebody looking at a car,
honey,
you know,

1872
01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:18.120
and they were bent down in front of the car and he got in the car and it was a

1873
01:54:18.121 --> 01:54:20.760
stick shift and he didn't press in the collection.
He turned the key in.

1874
01:54:20.761 --> 01:54:22.560
It lurched forward.
He hit the guy right in the head

1875
01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:33.160
and he tried to act.
He would never admit that he was high.
It was like,
dude,

1876
01:54:33.161 --> 01:54:37.330
it was,
he goes,
he,
he calls me up,
right?
He's like,
dude,

1877
01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:39.640
he leaves a message.
He's whispering.

1878
01:54:39.641 --> 01:54:43.030
That's how fucking scary as he's whispering into my phone.
Maybe he's at work.

1879
01:54:43.031 --> 01:54:43.670
I don't know.
Say

1880
01:54:43.670 --> 01:54:48.390
<v 12>Yeah,
I,
I,
I hit somebody with a car,
dude.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.</v>

1881
01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:51.940
Aye.
I thought I had the car,
dude.
Dude,
I,
I,

1882
01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:54.780
I thought I had the car neutral dude and I,

1883
01:54:55.650 --> 01:54:59.640
I went to turn the key and it,
dude,
I hit the guy in the head,

1884
01:54:59.641 --> 01:55:01.830
dude to call me.

1885
01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:07.820
<v 0>Somehow we didn't get fired.
Uh,</v>

1886
01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:09.720
that's another reason why I think we just worse than booze.

1887
01:55:09.721 --> 01:55:12.420
People would just cue that.
You know,
you can get fucking high at work.

1888
01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:15.240
No one fucking knows.
No one knows,
you know,

1889
01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:18.660
a little visor and a little fucking gum.
No one knows,
right?

1890
01:55:20.250 --> 01:55:23.310
You guys are bringing down this country with your fucking cookies.

1891
01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:28.170
You realize that your bunch of
Lazy Dorita Wheaton Sons of bitches

1892
01:55:29.850 --> 01:55:31.380

1893
01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:36.740
Do you realize that your potheads of the reason why so many awful movies get

1894
01:55:36.901 --> 01:55:39.180
made
because they know,

1895
01:55:39.210 --> 01:55:43.020
they know people out there a smoking dope and then when they put it out on on,

1896
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:47.310
they're going to fucking rent it and it doesn't only want us to be like remotely

1897
01:55:47.311 --> 01:55:49.590
funny and then Shit that wasn't even supposed to be funny.

1898
01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:52.980
It's going to be funny because he's fucking pot heads are going to be sitting

1899
01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:55.530
there.
They're going to be high giggling

1900
01:55:57.090 --> 01:55:59.790
like a bunch of school girls,
you know?

1901
01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:01.830
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

You realize that</v>

1903
01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:11.610

Passing it around to each other.
That's why.

1904
01:56:11.810 --> 01:56:14.180
That's why there's so many goddamn cold sores out there.

1905
01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.660
You know the number one cause it cold sores in this country.

1906
01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:21.110
It's you fucking potheads passing the things around each other.

1907
01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:26.490
Do you realize that?
You know,
I remember cracking open a beer.

1908
01:56:26.491 --> 01:56:29.970
I don't remember passing it around in nine other fucking people.
Hey,

1909
01:56:29.971 --> 01:56:32.820
let me get a swig of that.
Open your own.
You can't.

1910
01:56:34.410 --> 01:56:38.640
It's why I like weed man.
It's more so she'll gagged.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1911
01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:44.190
Don't you go take a fucking shower and take off those goddamn outback pants.

1912
01:56:45.590 --> 01:56:49.620
All right,
I'm sick of all right.
With your bracelet around your ankle,

1913
01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:53.610
right?
You're not more in touch with nature because you're smoking trees.

1914
01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:57.720
All right?
Get out there and get a fucking job straightened up.

1915
01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:02.720
Potheads you just spent the last decade of your life on a fucking couch.

1916
01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:06.870
You know,
when are you gonna put your helmet on?
Getting the Goddamn game?

1917
01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:11.830
Is that what you're gonna do?
You're gonna sit there
like some kept woman,

1918
01:57:12.250 --> 01:57:16.630
except you kept by yourself and you fucking awful habit.
I got to get high,
dude.

1919
01:57:16.631 --> 01:57:17.920
I can't deal unless I'm high.

1920
01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:21.130
You know you really going to sit there and act like you don't know that guy.

1921
01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:25.960
All Molly talk about as the alcoholics,
this is like the fucking broads.

1922
01:57:25.961 --> 01:57:27.550
All they do is talk about wife beaters,

1923
01:57:27.730 --> 01:57:29.740
but they never bring up gold digging whores.

1924
01:57:30.970 --> 01:57:35.970
Why don't you fucking get your Goddamn fucking pothead ass up off the couch and

1925
01:57:36.071 --> 01:57:38.560
go look in the fucking mirror?
Look,
look what you're doing to yourself.

1926
01:57:38.561 --> 01:57:43.510
Look at your eyes.
Feel your brain feels compressed.
I'm looking down,

1927
01:57:43.511 --> 01:57:46.100
my alkie knows that all you fucking pot heads,

1928
01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:54.360
there is a reason why weed is illegal and alcohol isn't all right cause alcohol

1929
01:57:55.691 --> 01:57:59.650
is better for you.
Alcohol is what a man does.
All right,

1930
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.900
we'd is what some pussy does.
Who,
who can't afford to pay for a good pizza?

1931
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:08.890
So he's got a fucking get himself so fucking disoriented that that's how

1932
01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:13.990
Domino's survives.
Those fucking assholes do you know,

1933
01:58:14.530 --> 01:58:18.310
dominoes makes such shitty pizza that actually potheads even fucking noticed.

1934
01:58:18.490 --> 01:58:19.323
They realized that.

1935
01:58:19.390 --> 01:58:23.590
So they actually had to have an ad campaign where they fucking admit that their

1936
01:58:23.591 --> 01:58:28.180
pizza sucks and that it stuck to the top of the box and it's completely

1937
01:58:28.181 --> 01:58:33.090
unacceptable,
right?
And now they're big ad campaign is we,
uh,

1938
01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:37.090
we admit that our pizza sucks and now we're going to start trying.

1939
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:38.980
We've only been around for what,

1940
01:58:38.981 --> 01:58:42.730
30 fucking years now we're actually going to to make decent pizza,
right?

1941
01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:46.600
So you think automatically they're going to raise the price,

1942
01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:47.980
they're going to add to the quality.

1943
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:52.900
This still selling like a large cheese pizza for five 99.
All right.
People.

1944
01:58:52.901 --> 01:58:57.640
You get what you pay for.
All right?
Don't order Domino's.
That's pothead pizza.

1945
01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:01.660
That's what those fucking drug users,

1946
01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:06.850
that's what that,
that's what they stick in their temple.
All right?

1947
01:59:06.851 --> 01:59:08.500
That's why they're so fucking dumb.

1948
01:59:09.850 --> 01:59:12.520
That's why it was the last time you talked to a smart pot head.
Have you ever,

1949
01:59:13.810 --> 01:59:15.420
you ever seen a pothead with initiative?

1950
01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:17.453
<v 1>You know</v>

1951
01:59:20.990 --> 01:59:21.160
<v 0>you don't.</v>

1952
01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:23.870
People are going to take that seriously and start sending me fucking emails

1953
01:59:23.871 --> 01:59:26.600
about,
well,
what about Bob Marley bed

1954
01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:33.050
really fucking call new kind of music?
Man.
He was fucking dead.
A lung cancer,

1955
01:59:34.970 --> 01:59:38.810
you know,
from smoking goddamn joints the size of a bus exhaust.

1956
01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:43.780
No different,
no different than a boom town or drinks himself to death at 28

1957
01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:47.780
you know,
I think you know,
I think you part it.

1958
01:59:47.781 --> 01:59:49.970
You guys have been on your high horse long enough.

1959
01:59:49.971 --> 01:59:51.980
I think it's time I fucking knocked you off a little bit.

1960
01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:56.720
Even going to notice you probably already off the horse laying in the grass,

1961
01:59:57.260 --> 02:00:01.040
right?
Letting a breeze go through your toes.
Is that what you did today?

1962
02:00:01.041 --> 02:00:02.810
Instead of going out and earning your fucking rent,

1963
02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:04.820
you're got to call your parents up again this week.

1964
02:00:05.690 --> 02:00:08.600
Hit him up for some more money because you ran out of fucking Cheetos.

1965
02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.540
You're too fucking old to have a full body.
Tam.

1966
02:00:15.541 --> 02:00:20.140
Why don't you go get a God damn job.
You son of a bitch.
All right.
There you go.

1967
02:00:21.150 --> 02:00:24.680
Once a week.
I got to try to piss off one group.
It keeps emails coming.
Um,

1968
02:00:24.690 --> 02:00:26.670
all right,
that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.

1969
02:00:26.671 --> 02:00:27.970
I want to thank everybody seriously,

1970
02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:30.510
and I'm not fucking around here like I was with the potheads there,
right?

1971
02:00:30.511 --> 02:00:34.260
So fucking don't get all fucking pissed off me.
And um,

1972
02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:36.960
I want to thank everybody who came out to my shows at the,
uh,

1973
02:00:36.961 --> 02:00:40.920
the Miamis symphony fucking,
uh,
Superman's house.

1974
02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:44.230
It's really what it looked like.
Um,

1975
02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:49.370
and I really hope a bunch of people show up in Utah,
uh,
and dopey.

1976
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:53.410
Don't be stuck up comments.
All right,
with your fucking religion.

1977
02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:56.230
Okay.
I,
I don't need that.

1978
02:00:57.620 --> 02:01:01.760
I don't need you and your seven wives sitting there staring at me like I got a

1979
02:01:01.761 --> 02:01:02.600
fucking problem.

1980
02:01:03.130 --> 02:01:03.963
<v 1>All right.</v>

1981
02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:06.880
<v 0>Fuck you.
And your legal orgy.</v>

1982
02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:09.613
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1983
02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:11.910
<v 0>Okay.
I think that's it.
All right.
That's the podcast.</v>

1984
02:01:11.911 --> 02:01:14.520
Everybody go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
Have a good week.

1985
02:01:14.521 --> 02:01:18.270
Don't talk any shit.
I'll talk some shit.
Don't take any shit.
There we go.

1986
02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:20.340
That's it.
I'm going to go get a sunburn.
I'll see you.
[inaudible]

1987
02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:26.280
<v 6>Sharon,
we can bring it to them.
Come on,
girl.</v>

1988
02:01:26.281 --> 02:01:31.050
If you want to go
and if tomorrow,

1989
02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:35.970
fine.
Just to gather right
the way we,

1990
02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:41.900
uh,
would you mind
sharing the night?

1991
02:01:49.150 --> 02:01:49.150
[inaudible].
