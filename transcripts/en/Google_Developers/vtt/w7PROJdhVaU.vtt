00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.250
MIHA: Hello everyone.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.590
Welcome to another session
of Google Payments Live.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.064
My name is Miha [? Ionesco. ?]

00:00:20.064 --> 00:00:22.720
PAUL: And I'm Paul
[? Mying. ?]

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.970
MIHA: And today we have
a special guest.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.720
SUDHIR: I'm Sudhir [INAUDIBLE]
and I'm the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.080
PM on the risk team.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.830
MIHA: And the topic for today's
an overview of the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.810
Google Payments risk engine and
automatic fraud detection

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.770
techniques.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.420
I know a lot of you had
questions about cancelled

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.590
orders and Google's techniques
for detecting fraud, so we

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.880
thought it would be a great idea
to bring in Sudhir for a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.130
panel discussion around
those issues.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.164
So let's start throwing
questions at Sudhir.

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:55.616
PAUL: Yeah.

00:00:55.616 --> 00:01:00.280
And the risk team is the team
that I ask for all of my--

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.040
Whenever one of you guys
asks us, we always

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.900
defer to the risk team.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.740
So they should know pretty much
everything about risk.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.960
SUDHIR: We are the best.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.830
PAUL: And just to get
it kicked off.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.080
We have a risk engine, but can
you tell us what problems the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.270
risk engine solves?

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.770
SUDHIR: So the risk engine is
our fraud management solution

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.740
for Google products.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.350
This is a completely in house
built technology.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.720
And we use it to solve almost
all the payment fraud

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.660
problems, including account
takeover, stolen instrument,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.570
daily abuse, any of those
kinds of things.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.020
Analyzes some of the policy
abuse problem

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.720
on AdWord side mostly.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.040
So this is a comprehensive
solution that we use for all

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.140
risk issues.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.360
PAUL: Got it.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.800
And can you get into how
it works at all?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.070
SUDHIR: Sure.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.850
It's a machine learning
technology that we use.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.592
And we use it because we
want it to be adaptive.

00:01:58.592 --> 00:02:01.670
As most of us know, fraudsters
are very adaptive.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.977
And so we have to use a solution
that also adapts very

00:02:03.977 --> 00:02:05.621
quickly to the new
fraud patterns.

00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:09.440
And we use lots and lots of
signals, hundreds of them,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.980
based on the transaction
data that we collect.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.280
And then we try to use that to
learn the fraud patterns.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.130
And try to then flag
the accounts

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.390
that need to be reviewed.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.080
PAUL: Good.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.490
Can you get into any detail
about which signals you

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.520
specifically use?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.060
Or provide more information for
merchants to see what they

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.480
should be doing on their
side to improve.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.070
SUDHIR: So it's hard for us to
talk about signals because for

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.820
any risk system to be really
effective, we don't want our

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.880
fraudsters to know the signals
that we are actually using.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.150
But just to tell you, we use a
lot of common signals that

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.560
many risk systems use like
IP and things like that.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.380
But we also have some
proprietary signals that we

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.990
use in our system to make
it much more effective.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.410
PAUL: OK.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.670
Got you.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.840
MIHA: So Sudhir, what products
leverage the risk engine?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.260
SUDHIR: So pretty much all
products at Google that either

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.310
collect money or disburse
money go

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.020
through the risk engine.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.510
So all paid products.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.675
That includes Google AdWords.

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:13.040
It includes Google Wallet,
Android, Enterprise.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.150
So any products where there's
money that's being exchanged

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.800
between us and the merchant
or the consumer.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.170
MIHA: So lots of products.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.792
So how can we handle
all these products?

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:26.680
At what scale does the
risk engine run?

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.230
SUDHIR: So yeah, Google
definitely has lots of

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.450
transactions going on.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.480
And risk engine works also in
real time, which means that we

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.510
have to handle all these
transactions in real time.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.310
Which means that we are
scaling to hundreds of

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.060
transactions per second
at times.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.170
And risk engine does very,
very well with that.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.510
MIHA: So that's real time.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.830
So how fast is that versus
manual review?

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.690
SUDHIR: So there
is actually two

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.990
component of the risk checks.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.940
There is an automated portion,
which actually we

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.730
do it in real time.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.260
So as the transactions are
coming through, it goes

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.600
through the system and we
actually check and escort the

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.860
transaction.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.680
Based on the where the score
comes in, we will sometimes

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.970
send it for manual review.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.880
And the manual review of course
is not real time.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.550
It takes its own time.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.690
But again that also happens
fairly rapidly so that we can

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.630
actually come back with the
decision in our system.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.730
PAUL: So I guess this goes
into our next question.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.130
And I think this is one of the
questions that a lot of

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.380
developers are asking.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.250
Why are orders cancelled?

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.950
Why are some orders cancelled?

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.605
Or why are a lot of
orders cancelled?

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:33.970
SUDHIR: Sure.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.510
We wish all orders
could go through.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.770
But the thing is, almost any
product that you have there is

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.440
going to be fraudsters
who would want to do

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.730
something with it.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.990
And there is a chargeback that
comes if the fraudsters

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.130
actually use something.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.830
And then the card owner or
payment instrument owner

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.370
reports it.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.140
And then they actually will
process something which

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.680
basically is called
chargeback.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:08.320
Most card association do not
want the fraud to actually go

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.260
at a very high level.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.230
And so they have a limit, either
1%, 2%, depending on

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.660
where you are and which
association

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.746
you are dealing with.

00:05:15.746 --> 00:05:18.360
At which point, the card
association will start

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.860
imposing fines.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.170
And if it happens for a very,
very long time, they might

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.030
even cancel your ability
to accept

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.930
payments using those cards.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.440
And so for us to not get into
that scenario, and not have

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.430
our developers get to that
scenario, we have to decline

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.850
some orders.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.270
We have to cancel some orders.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.920
Just to make sure that the
fraud is under check.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.832
PAUL: Makes sense.

00:05:39.832 --> 00:05:41.082
All right.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.775
What are some causes
of the frauds?

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.610
SUDHIR: I mentioned
this before.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.860
So their frauds can be many,
many different ways.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.210
We can have stolen instrument
fraud, which is the normal

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.830
fraud that happens across
many, many merchants.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.240
We also have account takeover.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.460
So you can actually take
over somebody's

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.630
Google Wallet account.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.140
And then start making
payment using that.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.380
And so that is another fraud.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.320
One fraud that we see a lot in
digital transactions on the

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.180
mobile phone a lot is what we
call friendly or family fraud.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.340
And this is a different kind of
fraud where somebody in the

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.590
household might be using the
owner's payment instrument to

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.390
make payments with or without
the knowledge of the owner.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.840
And so what happens is that a
lot of risk signals that we

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.140
collect on the transaction look
very similar because it's

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.960
the same household.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.820
It's the same IP.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.080
Same device in many cases.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.080
And so it might be slightly
harder to catch.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.010
But that fraud actually
happens quite a bit,

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.840
particularly in the digital
transactions.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.400
A lot in app ways as well.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.180
PAUL: OK.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.020
It's not Google canceling orders
all the time, right?

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.480
There's other third-parties that
are sometimes involved?

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.360
SUDHIR: That's right.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.210
So everybody who's involved in
the transaction, from the

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.840
association, the banks that
issue cards or carrier billing

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.140
where the carrier are involved,
everybody in the

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.060
ecosystem wants to keep
the fraud under check.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.170
And everybody wants to
participate in doing some

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.910
control to make sure that the
fraud doesn't actually go

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.920
really, really high.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.850
And so banks often will
do declines based on

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.860
signals that they have.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.990
Because they want to make sure
that their cards are not being

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.720
used illegally or without the
knowledge of their customer.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.990
Same thing with the
carrier billing.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.020
They have their controls where
they might have a per

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.710
transaction limit.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.986
Like you can't transact anything
more than $10 using

00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:41.155
their billing.

00:07:41.155 --> 00:07:44.076
Or they might have a limit per
month, like you can't spend

00:07:44.076 --> 00:07:46.560
more than $100 on that.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.020
And so a lot of those people
also have the control.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.590
Therefore if they decline the
transaction, then Google can't

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.880
process that at all.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.890
And so we need to make sure that
they first approve it and

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.240
then we can do our risk check
and then we can approve that.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.060
PAUL: Got it.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.320
So every order has
to pass through

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.790
multiple levels of risk--

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:05.210
SUDHIR: That's right.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:05.750
That's right.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.080
It's a collaborative way to
reduce fraud in general, yes.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.565
PAUL: Can you talk about what
other providers are doing or

00:08:13.565 --> 00:08:15.640
other payment providers are
doing at all versus

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.520
how we handle it?

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.440
SUDHIR: Sure.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:25.130
So most payment products have
their risk solution and they a

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.920
very similar kind of thing.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.620
Sometimes the philosophy
is different.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.860
What we have done consistently
is that we want to starve the

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.740
fraudsters from getting
the product they want.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.919
So we would want to make sure
that they're not successful in

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.140
going through with the order and
getting the goods, either

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.090
digital goods or even
physical goods.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.720
And so we prefer to cancel the
order upfront, rather than

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.190
allow the transaction to go
through and then do refunds.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.230
Which some other providers, some
of the merchants do to

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.860
also counteract the
chargeback limit.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.550
But in our philosophy, we think
that if you let the

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.270
fraudsters get the goods then
they will keep trying.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.140
Because they are successful and
they'll just keep getting

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.760
the benefit of the thing.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.240
So we try to catch early and
prevent the whole transaction

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.500
from going through in
the first place.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.240
PAUL: Got it.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.910
MIHA: Looks like you have your
work cut out for you.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:22.830
SUDHIR: Yes.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.080
PAUL: One last question.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.000
So we hear that merchants are
encountering these order

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.960
cancellations all the time.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.667
Are we doing anything to improve
that, to reduce the

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:38.410
amount of order cancellations
in our system?

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.030
SUDHIR: Yeah, sure.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.360
So we definitely are doing
lots of things.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.540
As I said before, we are
constantly looking for

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:52.290
signals, looking for new data
elements that we can use to

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.660
catch the fraud early.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.080
One of the things that we are
doing for friendly fraud,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.970
which is something that is
fairly new to us because we

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.610
didn't do all of this until
in-app transactions before,

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:10.050
what we're trying to do is
create a risk-based challenge.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.450
We're hoping that somebody in
the household who's using the

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.870
device without the knowledge
of the owner of the device

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.460
would not know the password
for the transaction.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.510
And so we would actually ask
for password in cases where

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.300
our risk systems believe that
this device is being used by

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.414
somebody without the permission
of the owner.

00:10:33.414 --> 00:10:38.290
We went that route because we
want to keep the transaction

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.190
flowing smoothly in the
majority of the cases.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.350
Some folks have decided to ask
for a password or some kind of

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.210
authorization for every
transaction

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.820
on the mobile device.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.030
We have taken the route that
we want to make sure these

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.760
transactions flow smoothly for
the majority of the cases

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.070
where there doesn't seem to
be any risky behavior.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.950
But in a very small set of
transactions where we suspect

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.970
that there's something different
going on, we would

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.030
want to prevent that by asking
for password or other

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.080
challenges.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.060
And then if the person passes
that, we will complete the

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.700
transaction.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.380
Otherwise, we won't.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.020
And so what we're hoping is
that, today since we don't

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.280
have that challenge, we are
cancelling those orders

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.680
because we suspect it
and we cancel it.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.960
By allowing the user to complete
the challenge and

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.800
going through, we would
let the legitimate

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.980
transactions go through.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.050
And only prevent the ones that
actually are really, really

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.950
risky and are fraudulent.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.980
That also will, we're hoping,
will have impact in how many

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.750
declines we get from banks and
other places because our fraud

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.430
overall is going to go down.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.720
And that will actually
hopefully help.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.790
So we're doing much better
on those things.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.510
And as I said, we constantly
look for more and more ways to

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.880
detect fraud and let the good
customers go through.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.450
PAUL: So two more questions
from me about this.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.840
First one, is this going to be
on both Android and Google

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.570
Wallet for digital goods?

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.780
Or is this going to
be a specific

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.000
platform that you're doing?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.320
SUDHIR: So yes, we are going
to be doing for all

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.210
transactions on the
Wallet platform.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.290
But it is going to be in
experimental mode for a while.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.832
So we're going to start
sometime in the

00:12:09.832 --> 00:12:10.720
next couple of weeks.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.030
And we'll start doing small
experiments making sure that

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.990
we don't mess up the
auto-processing and people's

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.880
experience with their device.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.070
But this is going to be across
all platforms, yes.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.982
PAUL: Got it.

00:12:21.982 --> 00:12:25.110
That was actually my second
question about when are you

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.190
guys going to launch.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.890
SUDHIR: So it is going to start,
as I said, more for

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.790
experimental way in the next few
weeks and then hopefully

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.586
we'll launch soon after that.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:34.052
PAUL: Cool.

00:12:34.052 --> 00:12:34.518
Cool.

00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:35.916
MIHA: Looks like we're
doing a better job

00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:37.320
on detecting problems.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.820
So any idea, any estimates, on
how much fraud we prevented,

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.570
how much money we saved?

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.000
SUDHIR: Well, we constantly
are looking for ways to

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.490
measure that.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.580
It's a little bit hard.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.510
And so what I'll give you is the
way that we look at what

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.040
fraud system does for Google.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.160
They're really three different
cost buckets we look at.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.990
We look at the fraud loss,
which is a number that's

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.720
slightly easier to measure.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.060
Because we want to make sure
that the overall fraud loss

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.260
and fraud in the
system is low.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.360
The second bucket, which is
slightly harder to measure but

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.020
we are actually extremely
careful about that, is impact

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.200
on the good customer.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.140
Because you can always prevent
fraud by cancelling all the

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.080
transactions and all good
customers will not go through

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.790
the system as well.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.710
And so we are very sensitive
of that.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.865
And we try to measure that as
much as possible, which is as

00:13:28.865 --> 00:13:30.900
we call a false positive
in our system.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.900
And we try to reduce
that overall.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.240
And we balance that against
the fraud loss.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.660
And then the third cost, which
is the entire operational cost

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.890
for the risk system.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.020
Both from the development of the
technology point of view,

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.430
but also in terms of
the manual review

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.660
that we talked about.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.150
And Google is, again, very,
very concerned about not

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.740
making that a very,
very big cost.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.280
Because it's not just a cost
in terms of resources and

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.630
money, but it's also a cost
in terms of delay

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.860
in the overall system.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.900
And so we try to make as many
augmented decisions as we can.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.090
And have very small operational
costs to that.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.570
And so in combine all these
three different things we need

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.690
to minimize across
all three costs.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:13.240
And I think, conservatively,
we have saved millions of

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.170
dollars in the last few years.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.800
MIHA: And I'm sure fraudsters
and fraud schemes are getting

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.680
more and more creative,
forcing us to

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.060
stay one step ahead.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.720
What would be some of the most
craziest frauds you've seen?

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.650
SUDHIR: So let me tell you
something that actually

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.400
happened quite a while ago
because it's already addressed

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.100
across all the systems
so we're not giving

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.220
fraudsters new ideas.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.550
So what happens sometimes
is what we call a

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.720
merchant-buyer collision.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.290
Where an app developer or
fraudster will develop an app,

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.450
post it, sell it for $20.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:58.920
But then have him or his staff
buy it from their own.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.670
And then make money that way.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.760
This happens quite a bit.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.480
But what really happened a
couple of years ago is that

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.030
these fraudsters figured out
that they actually can walk

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.350
into stores and use
the demo devices.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.880
So the phone sitting in the
store and they'll start

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.060
purchasing from there
their own app.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.480
And so all of these phones
were connected

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.500
to the carrier billing.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.030
And so they were using carrier
billing to pay and then

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.970
collect the money and
then walk way.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.160
And then keep going
to different

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.590
stores in the same city.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.650
Luckily, now not only that we
have prevention for that, but

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.490
also most stores do
not allow you to

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.800
purchase from those devices.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.600
PAUL: This is giving me ideas.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.050
MIHA: OK.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.553
Let's not give more ideas.

00:15:41.553 --> 00:15:44.870
SUDHIR: Let's get on the
bike and start riding.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.615
MIHA: Great.

00:15:45.615 --> 00:15:49.380
So what's next on the horizon
for the fraud investigation?

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.290
SUDHIR: So risk team
is always busy.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.480
We have our work.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.160
The majority of work happens
in reactive mode.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.210
Both in terms of new fraud
patterns, people trying new

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.850
things and trying to figure out
any loophole that we have

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:05.695
in our system.

00:16:05.695 --> 00:16:10.370
And so that makes us work
in that direction.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.910
Also, we or our developer
partners start

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.090
launching new products.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.740
And some of them are more
risky than others.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.450
And so again, we work on
them reactively to

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.700
control those fraud.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.230
But then also we have a lot of
work in the proactive side.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.710
Where we are constantly looking
for new signals.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.280
We are trying to make
our models better.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.910
We are trying to make our
models learn faster.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.020
And all those things happen.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.840
So we keep a balance of reactive
and proactive.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.784
And there is no dearth
of work to be done.

00:16:37.784 --> 00:16:38.166
MIHA: Yeah.

00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:40.900
Yeah.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.725
Great.

00:16:41.725 --> 00:16:42.970
Well, thank you very
much Sudhir.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.455
SUDHIR: Thank you.

00:16:44.455 --> 00:16:48.600
MIHA: And everyone I hope you
enjoyed our panel discussion

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.820
and we're looking for
more questions.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.920
You can submit them
on the group or

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.360
for our future sessions.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.835
And let's move on
and take some of

00:16:57.835 --> 00:16:59.280
the submitted questions.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:16:59.776
PAUL: Yeah.

00:16:59.776 --> 00:17:00.768
Can you stay with us?

00:17:00.768 --> 00:17:02.260
SUDHIR: Yeah.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.040
PAUL: In case we get any
questions about risk.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.440
MIHA: So let's see.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:10.380
Let's go to our moderator group
and see what questions

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.079
have been submitted.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:13.800
PAUL: I think the first.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.920
I have it up here.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.674
And I have the first
one for you.

00:17:16.674 --> 00:17:17.880
It's probably for you.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.589
Is VAT automatically collected
in EU countries?

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.220
MIHA: So we've been
getting this

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.609
question quite a few times.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:29.980
Taxes are always an
interesting topic.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.060
And the merchant is responsible
to collect taxes.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.480
Either with talking about Google
Checkout or in-app

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.610
statements.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.800
The case is the merchant
is responsible for tax

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.610
collection.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.830
But it's very easy to specify
taxes, rates for various

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.270
countries and various
jurisdiction.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.640
Just go to the Merchant Center
and under the settings tab

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.570
there is a tax account link,
which gives you a variety of

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.110
choices on how to specify
tax rates for

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.010
country or for zip code.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.910
And once you do that, taxes are
automatically collected

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.660
and submitted by Google
to the developer.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.760
And from that point on, it is
your responsibility how to

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.870
submit the taxes to the
tax authorities.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.830
PAUL: And then the second
question, what countries do

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.750
you offer in-app payments?

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.110
And what I've done is I've
already pulled up the page

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.180
where we list the countries.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.190
We'll list the international
countries where we support

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:26.450
in-app payments.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:30.950
And I'll just share that list
with you right now.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.495
So it's under our Developers
Guide FAQ.

00:18:34.495 --> 00:18:35.980
As you can see it here,
it's developers.googl

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.660
e.com/in_app_payments/faq.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.580
And we're just describing where
you can use this API.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.090
And something like 18 countries
right now from

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.350
Australia down to the
United Kingdom.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:52.140
We don't list the US here, but
we're going to add it.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:57.320
And it's pretty intuitive that
Google and Wallet for digital

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.950
goods supports the US.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.820
MIHA: So it's 18
countries now.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.900
We're looking to add more?

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.380
PAUL: Yeah.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.920
MIHA: And of course, buyers,
anyone who has a Google Wallet

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.830
account can buy.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.360
And right now it's over 140
countries that are supported.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:13.780
PAUL: Yeah.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.540
MIHA: So literally anyone
can buy from merchant.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.528
PAUL: Very international.

00:19:19.528 --> 00:19:19.930
All right.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:20.400
Let's get to the
third question.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.400
MIHA: Next question.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.870
So this is somewhat on topic
with today's fraud and risk

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.250
discussion.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.910
The question is, orders from
my Wallet customers are

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:33.920
failing with the following
message, Google

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.170
cancelled this order.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.280
Reason, took too long
to deliver.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.360
We usually see this mostly
on Androids, I believe.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.710
And usually I believe this
occurs when the account has

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:50.050
been flagged by the risk engine
for manual review.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:54.150
So you'll continue to get this
type of error until the manual

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.860
review completes.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.870
Anything you can add Sudhir?

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.310
SUDHIR: So yes.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.630
On the digital transactions,
because we cannot have the

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.950
user wait for our decision,
manual decision, to be made,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.320
we choose where we let the
automated risk engine to make

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.030
the decision.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.990
And then if it cannot make a
decision and decides to send

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.610
for manual interview,
we cancel the order.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.030
And we do the manual reviews
too but that is used for

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.180
future transactions and not for
the current transaction.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.590
Because we don't want the user
to keep waiting for 5 to 10

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.950
hours or whatever it takes
manual review.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.950
PAUL: So I also talked to the
Android team a little bit

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:31.470
about this.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.970
I'm not sure if it's directly
related to this issue, but

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.850
I've also heard that
sometimes cellular

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:37.920
networks can be flaky.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.190
Or cellular connection
can be bad.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.640
SUDHIR: Yes.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.750
PAUL: And that can be another
reason that this might occur,

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.360
that this error message
might occur.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:45.710
SUDHIR: Definitely.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.020
There are a lot of delays that
can happen from different

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:48.850
systems, yes.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.100
MIHA: And it's more likely that
developers see this when

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.330
they test their own
application.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.450
Because they do it with
different accounts and--

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.550
SUDHIR: Yeah.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.120
And also they're using some of
the test systems for the

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.740
products are broken systems.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.869
That's right.

00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:04.350
MIHA: Great.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:08.090
PAUL: So the next question that
I see is, I implemented

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.420
in-app payments in Sandbox.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.160
It works most the time, but it
fails randomly when I test it

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.110
with different buyer accounts.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.750
The spinning circle can go on
for more than 30 seconds

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.030
before I get the, uh-oh, there
was a problem dialogue.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.520
You want to take
this one Miha?

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.570
MIHA: Sure.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.260
So this can happen.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.830
In the sandbox especially,
because you're trying

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.890
different variations
of your apps.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.850
You try to cover all
the test cases.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.790
And you have various
ways to debug this.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.810
One would be the failure
callback.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.310
On the client side you
have error codes.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:49.360
You look at the error type
field in the return JSON.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.690
And that will tell you
what happened.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:55.390
Gives you an idea about
the problem.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:59.340
In this case where it says it
takes more than 30 seconds,

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.110
most likely the error
type you'll get is

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.740
internal server error.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.500
Which means something
bad happened

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.140
on the Wallet servers.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.800
You can wait a few minutes.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.780
Try it with a different
buyer account.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.040
Most likely the order will
go through and you

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.960
can continue testing.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.560
If it doesn't work again,
try switching to a

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.420
different buyer account.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.700
If it still fails, send us
a message on the group.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.920
We'll try to figure
out what happens.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.240
PAUL: Yeah.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.410
I just wanted to add that this
only occurs in Sandbox.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:36.060
That in production it
does it really well.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.490
It really occurs, if ever.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.160
And that we are actually
working, we are aware of the

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.040
problem, the inconsistency
in Sandbox in terms

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.290
of timing and errors.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.060
And the engineering team is
actively working on fixing

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.542
these issues.

00:22:50.542 --> 00:22:53.500
SUDHIR: Thanks for
the question.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.760
PAUL: The next one is, is there
a way for the seller to

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.430
get email notifications
when an order

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:00.940
is received or cancelled?

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.300
MIHA: Let me take this one.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.000
So you are getting a
notification, just not an

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.570
email notification.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.760
For successful orders, you
get two notifications.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.790
One on the server side and
one on the client side.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:17.190
And for canceled orders you
are notified on the client

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.120
side with the failure handler.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.820
Just as I mentioned earlier, you
can look at the error type

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.340
code for an idea of
what happens.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.600
We've been thinking about adding
email notifications.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.860
We may do that.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.610
They tend to be spammy.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.720
But we can offer it as an option
for merchants who have

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.720
a low volume of orders.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.730
If you have several hundreds
of orders per day then you

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.620
don't want to get that
many emails.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.160
You would turn it
off immediately.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.260
PAUL: Even if you specified your
Gmail account to receive

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.635
these emails, that would
probably start getting marked

00:23:52.635 --> 00:23:56.490
as spam and we would just
spam block ourselves or

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.320
something like that.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.490
I don't even know.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.400
MIHA: So the best way to handle
it is through the

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.300
failure handlers in case of
cancellations or the server

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.370
side of success handler
in case of a success.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:09.730
PAUL: Cool.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:10.530
MIHA: More questions

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.450
PAUL: So let's get to
the next question.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:16.380
So why doesn't Google put some
pressure on AT&amp;T, Verizon,

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.700
other carriers, to allow Wallet
on the Galaxy S3.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.160
It's really frustrating to not
have access to such awesome

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.260
technology because
of political BS.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.170
This is a good question.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.530
And so what we typically do with
our API-related products.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.420
So we don't have a lot of
insight into Wallet, but I

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.460
went to go ask the Wallet team
anyway because I saw this

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.650
question the other day.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.140
And their response was that we
actually do have a lot of ties

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.590
with carriers because
of Androids.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.440
And the powers that be are
working with the carriers to

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:51.040
find a mutually beneficial
agreement for Wallet.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.190
Other than that, they weren't
willing to share any

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.360
additional information
with me.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.920
So this is what I have.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.383
I think in the future, in a
Google payments live session

00:25:01.383 --> 00:25:04.020
in the future, we'll bring on
somebody from the Wallet team

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:08.770
so that we can have a deeper Q&amp;A
session about the future

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.700
of Wallet, its functionality,
and its features.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.930
MIHA: Great.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:14.470
So we took the question.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:15.200
PAUL: Cool.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.600
We'll go with the next one.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.110
MIHA: The next one is a question
about availability.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.030
I believe in a payment's
availability for other

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.820
countries for sellers.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.132
And this is a question--

00:25:26.132 --> 00:25:27.180
PAUL: This is actually
a new one here.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.335
MIHA: Oh, we have a new one.

00:25:28.335 --> 00:25:28.720
OK.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.390
Let me answer this one and I'll
move on to the next one.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:31.735
PAUL: OK.

00:25:31.735 --> 00:25:34.492
MIHA: A question from
Carlos in Madrid.

00:25:34.492 --> 00:25:36.464
And the good news is
in-app payments is

00:25:36.464 --> 00:25:37.450
available in Spain.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:37.950
Woo-hoo.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.550
So Carlos is covered.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.330
We showed you the
list earlier.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:46.910
It's about 18 countries that
we offer right now.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.900
And we plan to support
new countries.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.420
There are slight problems.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.420
Different countries have
different rules and

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.920
regulations for monetary
transactions.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.090
And that slows things
a little bit.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.100
And as we go through them and
figure out all the legal

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.480
requirements, you will see
newer countries being

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.230
added to the list.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.520
PAUL: Cool.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.472
MIHA: And you say there's
a new question?

00:26:08.472 --> 00:26:08.950
PAUL: Yeah.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.720
The new question is, Hi, is
basic authentication still

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.700
required for receiving
XML notifications?

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.520
In other words, do I still
need to use IIIS basic

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.420
authentication module?

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.480
This is a Checkout question.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.630
So API version 2.5 I believe
is the basic API.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:31.550
And in this case, instead of
us send you a notification

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.460
directly, or full notification
directly, we send a

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.245
notification to your server
indicating to you that we have

00:26:37.245 --> 00:26:39.810
a notification awaiting
your pull.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.340
So then you have to pull the
Checkout servers to pull the

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.690
actual notification.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:45.830
And because you're requesting
it from Checkout, we're

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.350
actually using the Checkout SSL
certificate to secure the

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.390
transaction.

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.600
So in this case, no you do
not need to use basic

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.150
authentication to receive
XML notifications.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:57.720
MIHA: Perfect.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.450
One more question.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.914
This is also Checkout
related I believe.

00:27:01.914 --> 00:27:02.412
PAUL: Yeah.

00:27:02.412 --> 00:27:05.710
MIHA: And the question is, it
seems difficult to understand

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.170
docs and such and programming
examples are difficult to

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:09.860
understand.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.630
Is there a plan to make
them more concise?

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.090
So the question doesn't specify
what it is from, but I

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.820
know its related to the Google
Checkout API so I got a little

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.220
bit more context from
the developer.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.880
And in this case, it relates
to level two integration of

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.730
Checkout APIs.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.300
That is notification
and order APIs.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.090
Level two integrations in
Checkout can be quite complex.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.435
And its OK if you don't
understand at the beginning

00:27:35.435 --> 00:27:37.890
and you go through a little
bit of trial and error.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.533
I suggest as you read the
documentation, also play with

00:27:41.533 --> 00:27:45.820
the sample library code which we
offer in the documentation

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.410
for various platforms.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:51.410
And try to understand what's
going on there.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:56.850
Another good resource for help
is the integration forums, the

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.280
Checkout integration forums.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.260
And you can access
them from the

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.690
documentation page as well.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.040
We have links there.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.930
And if everything fails, send
us a question again.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:07.250
PAUL: Cool.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.800
I think there's one more
question left.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.375
MIHA: Oh, we have
got one more.

00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:11.930
We have so many live
questions.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:12.870
PAUL: Keep asking.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.120
We'll be here all day.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.940
So the next one is, are there
any plans to have Google

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.740
Checkout be more usable on the
mobile device from a user's

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.810
perspective?

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.300
For example, on an Android
device when checking out the

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.440
user input is difficult.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:31.170
It appears that there's no
mobile specific CSS or HTML.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:32.270
This is a good question.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.440
So previously we did have
a mobile specific UI.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.025
There are a few bugs
with this UI.

00:28:39.025 --> 00:28:40.950
Actually, there are a
few really bad bugs.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:45.840
Like regardless of whichever
shipping method you chose,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.070
only the first shipping
method would be used.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:52.320
So to fix this what we're
working on or what we worked

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.670
on was changing the mobile flow
back to desktop biflow

00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:00.400
and then trying to
update the CSS.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.740
I don't have any more specific
details about the next steps

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.140
on the mobile flow from
the image team yet.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.575
But what we can do is we can
reach out to the eng team for

00:29:09.575 --> 00:29:12.230
Checkout and find out more
information about

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:13.480
the future of it.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:16.655
MIHA: Great.

00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:18.470
Any more questions?

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.270
PAUL: I think that is it.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:20.850
MIHA: That is it.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.800
OK.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.890
We're almost out of time.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:25.470
So thank you everyone
for watching.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.440
Remember you can watch
the video on YouTube.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.550
If you've been late to this
live session, the video is

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.950
available on YouTube.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:34.590
PAUL: Yep.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.130
MIHA: Every recording
it's available

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.830
there for your viewing.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.230
And we're looking forward
to see you again

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.690
in a couple of weeks.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:44.940
Send us more questions.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.400
PAUL: And one last thing before
we go, if you want to

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.870
do something like this, if you
want to join our team, right.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:55.510
And help share your knowledge
with external developers,

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.180
we're actively hiring
right now.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.760
And to find the job list
posting, go to

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.090
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.940
And with that, I think
that's everything.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.656
MIHA: Thank you Sudhir again for
participating in our panel

00:30:08.656 --> 00:30:10.135
discussion.

00:30:10.135 --> 00:30:11.614
This was helpful.

00:30:11.614 --> 00:30:13.513
And looking forward to seeing
you again in two weeks.

00:30:13.513 --> 00:30:13.896
Bye.

00:30:13.896 --> 00:30:14.280
PAUL: See ya.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.530
SUDHIR: Bye.
