00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:08.646
AMY: Welcome Helen
here at Google today.

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:10.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.260
HELEN ZIA: Thank you.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.410
Thanks to all of you.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.620
Thank you for taking
time to have me here,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.510
and thank you to the
Google Asian Network

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.640
for bringing me here today.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.910
I am an author.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.220
As Amy said, I've been an
activist for a long time.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.260
In fact, I was an activist
before I became a journalist.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.150
And I thought I'd just spend
a couple of moments talking

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.810
about how I got from there to
here with my new book coming

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.640
out, "The Last Boat
Out of Shanghai:

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.480
The Epic Story of the Chinese
Who Fled Mao's Revolution."

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.830
And so I'm the
daughter of immigrants,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.850
as she said, from China.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.400
My parents came
to the US as part

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.870
of this diaspora
and exodus that I am

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.510
writing about in my new book.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.650
But so I was born and
raised in New Jersey.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.450
And I'm just curious
here among all of you.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.220
Anybody from New Jersey?

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.019
Oh my god.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.660
One other person who isn't
ashamed to admit he's

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.190
from New Jersey.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.372
Maybe there are some there
in the live stream world too.

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.080
But so at the time
that I was growing up,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.380
there were so few
Asians in America

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.170
that it was as though when
my family walked into a store

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.860
anywhere, it would be like
every head in the room

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.960
would turn, and look in
unison, and with that look.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.140
Not like, hey, welcome,
but instead, it would be,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.660
what are you doing
here in my America?

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.488
And just that feeling of
always being an alien.

00:01:42.488 --> 00:01:44.530
And we talk about aliens
today, but it was really

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.690
like being an alien from Mars.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.560
And that look,
especially when you

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.850
think about the 1950s,
and 1960s, and 1970s,

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.920
every war that was fought was
against people in East Asia.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.190
So as a kid, when we
would go to the movies,

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.630
there would be that defining
crescendo in a war movie,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.750
where it was like, oh,
the Americans are winning,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.020
and we are going to kill
them, kill them, kill them.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.000
And the "them"
look just like us,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.330
so when the lights came
up in the movie theater,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.250
we'd be with our little friends.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.710
And it'd be like,
oh, OK, are you

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.750
Japanese, Korean, Chinese,
spies, or Vietnamese?

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.580
And so I grew up with
a sense of that there

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.750
were a lot of assumptions
of who was Asian,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.140
and it didn't match anything
I knew about my family at all.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.360
So I grew up with that
sense of, do I fit here,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.220
or don't I fit here?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.520
And so when the civil rights
movement was happening,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.860
a time of great
movements of equality

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.820
for people of color,
for African-Americans,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.320
for women and
women's liberation.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.110
The gay rights movement
was beginning then,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.990
and of course, the anti-war
movement and peace movement.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.970
Those were all things
that spoke to me.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.130
And so even though as
an Asian-American girl,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.700
I didn't see a lot of people
like me at all in the media,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.840
because we were totally
invisible except as aliens

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.860
from Mars, or as the enemy.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.040
I really wanted to be
part of those movements.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.160
So as soon as I was
around the age of many

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.480
of you or somewhat
younger, in college,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.730
that was where I wanted to be.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.040
I wanted to be part
of making a change.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.450
And I have to say today--

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.680
and not just America,
but globally--

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.450
there really is
that sense of change

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.430
to people wanting
to make a difference

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.190
and seeing that things
are not going so well.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.730
Not just here in this
country, but elsewhere,

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.288
and that we can do better.

00:03:56.288 --> 00:03:58.080
And so that was what
the movement was then.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.102
It really was a youth
movement, honestly.

00:04:00.102 --> 00:04:01.560
All of those
movements I mentioned,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.110
they were spearheaded
by young people.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.630
And the thing about
it, though, there

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.540
wasn't a lot of voice
about Asian-Americans.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.150
It was the beginning of an
Asian-American movement.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.079
And I wanted to be part of
that for the first time,

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.850
meeting people
who kind of looked

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.579
like me, who shared the
idea that we didn't have

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.810
to be second-class citizens,
or constant foreigners

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.120
in the country we were born in.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.810
I was always told go
back where you came from.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.460
But I'd have to say
I'm from New Jersey,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.250
and I really don't
want to go back there.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.300
Thank you.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.280
But, of course, we know that
that is not what they meant.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.880
And so I also had a great
curiosity about China.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.880
That's where they
wanted me to go back to.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.420
I had never been there.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.770
And so I became an activist.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.110
My whole goal as a young
person was to get to college.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.130
But then once I got
to college, what next?

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.660
And I had no idea.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.790
And as the daughter
of immigrants,

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.380
there were only a few
options that I was aware of.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.670
I didn't know what i-banking is.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.610
I still don't, but I
hate investment banking.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.240
And so to me, it was either,
what, doctor, lawyer, teacher,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.110
or business.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.230
And I was a very shy girl.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.720
Nothing was expected of me,
and so I never spoke up.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.670
And I went to medical school.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.170
That was the only one I thought.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.970
And I ended up quitting
medical school,

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.940
because once I got there,
I realized this is totally

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.980
the wrong thing for me.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.080
And it was by a
very circuitous way

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.980
that I ended up going
to Detroit, Michigan,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.160
after being a
construction laborer,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.360
after I quit medical school,
and then got a job in a factory

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.120
at Chrysler
Corporation in Detroit.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.010
And it was there that I realized
what I really wanted to do

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.280
is write about the stories
that were completely unseen.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.440
And these weren't
Asian-American stories.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.520
I was in Detroit.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.420
It's mostly African-American,
and working-class white,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.310
and Arab-American people.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.210
But that's where I started
out as a journalist,

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.580
spent a whole career
writing about many things,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.690
most of which were not
about Asian-Americans.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.230
So at a certain point, I just
really felt-- you know what?

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.970
I've been saving stories
all my life of things

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.920
that other people
should know about this,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.230
other people should know about
why being born in America

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.090
makes you an American citizen.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.850
That was a Chinese-American
who fought that all the way

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.500
to the Supreme Court in 1898.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.680
Everybody who's born
in this country who

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.760
can declare themselves a
citizen owes their gratitude

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.420
to Chinese-Americans in
San Francisco for that.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.020
And nobody knows it.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.110
So there were so many
things that I had saved,

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.027
and I thought people
should know these things.

00:07:00.027 --> 00:07:04.290
And that's when I wrote my first
book, Asian-American Dreams:

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.060
The Emergence of
an American People.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.320
And as I continued
writing books and stories,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.130
there were just so many other
stories that haunted me.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.740
And one of those
stories was about what

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.820
I call a forgotten
exodus, a time of people

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:27.060
fleeing a country, because
they feared the revolution.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.460
They might not have
known what communism was,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.550
but they feared what
was going to happen.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.060
And none of the places
were more magical in China

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:43.050
than Shanghai, compared with
New York, London, Paris,

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.200
and Berlin, and Shanghai.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.490
And Shanghai was only behind
New York in terms of population,

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.220
six million people in Shanghai.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.220
Albert Einstein, Charlie
Chaplin, George Bernard Shaw,

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.330
and Eugene O'Neill; any number
of writers and intellectuals

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.800
from all over the world.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.370
If they wanted to go somewhere
in Asia, it would be Shanghai.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.230
That's where the intellectual
heart of Asia was at the time.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:13.440
And that's where a
vast number of people

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.350
fled, because they feared
what was going to happen.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.600
They didn't really know.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.370
It's just they feared.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:25.770
And so it's a story about
refugees, about exiles,

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:30.240
about people who
didn't know what

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.140
was going to happen
to themselves,

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.679
but more important to their
families, to their children.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:40.350
And today we're in a
global refugee crisis, 70

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.780
million or so refugees
all over the world.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.960
It's in the news
every day about people

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.655
who carry their babies
for 1,000 miles,

00:08:49.655 --> 00:08:51.030
not knowing whether
they're going

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.890
to get tear gassed
at the end of it,

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.430
or have their babies ripped from
their arms, which unfortunately

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.450
is happening.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.630
But the thing about it is
this 70-year-old exodus,

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.710
which right now, it's
the 70th anniversary.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:10.800
May actually was the month that
the People's Liberation Army

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.630
marched into Shanghai.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.710
And so 70 years ago,
this month was when

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.735
this exodus hit full steam.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.870
And so I thought I
wanted to write about it,

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.670
because there's not a
single book, dissertation,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.630
or master's thesis on
this topic in English

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.250
anywhere in the world.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.950
And I know, because
I hunted for it.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:42.050
And in Chinese, there are
about three or four books--

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.280
maybe today, four.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.420
When I was researching,
only three.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.350
They're in Chinese.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.170
They're all in
Taiwan, and they're

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.010
written from the experience
of fleeing to Taiwan.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.560
Well, this diaspora
fled everywhere.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.460
Just like diasporas today,
people go wherever they can.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.430
And so this is the
only book about it.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.980
And I'm just really
thrilled to be

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.180
able to sit here today,
and talk about it,

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.770
and talk about these
things with all of you.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.360
So I think I'm going to be
in conversation with Amy

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.270
and so we can--

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.870
I have no idea exactly what
you're going to ask me,

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.420
so we can get into it.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.085
AMY: Yes.

00:10:23.085 --> 00:10:25.150
And what I love about
what you just shared

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.240
is it's clear that there
is a thread of storytelling

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.060
that you employ throughout
the entire course

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.338
of your career in your life.

00:10:32.338 --> 00:10:33.880
I'd love for you to
start off by just

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.020
talking about what you feel
the power of storytelling is.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.500
I was reading the book.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.950
There were so many
powerful stories.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.980
The one about your
mother I've read.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.020
I've heard recently
about how you even

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.660
found out about that
story, about your mother.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.050
And so talk a little bit
more about what that power is

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.358
for you on storytelling.

00:10:55.358 --> 00:10:57.400
HELEN ZIA: So I've been
a writer and a journalist

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.340
for a long time.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.910
And some of those writings have
been fairly straight forward.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.070
I did this research on A, B, C.
This happened chronologically.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.370
And then other ones have
been about people's lives

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.110
and what happened to them.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.830
And the thing about it
is-- and some of you

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.920
may know more about just the
neurophysiological pathways

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.420
about it.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.850
But human beings, we connect.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:22.890
We want to connect.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.330
We're social beings,
and the way we connect

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.620
is not through data,
and facts, and figures.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.600
The connection is
emotional, and that's

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.198
through people's stories.

00:11:33.198 --> 00:11:34.990
And it doesn't matter
whether those stories

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.680
are about people
from 1,000 years ago,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.940
or 70 years ago, or today.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.360
It's all about what happened to
them, and that's storytelling.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.420
And so the way I
connected with this book

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.757
was through a story, the
story about our mother.

00:11:53.757 --> 00:11:55.965
I don't know if you want me
to share with that story.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.060
AMY: Please, yeah,
for those out there

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.760
who aren't familiar about--

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.850
HELEN ZIA: So I had known
about this title, Last Boat out

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.570
of Shanghai.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.390
In a way, it's a metaphor,
but people talk about it.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.750
If you talk about anybody of
a certain age, World War II

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.280
generation age,
or Korean War age,

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.930
growing up as children
or young people

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.390
during these 1940s,
1950s period,

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.980
they will tell you if
they are Chinese and left

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.590
China in those days.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.950
My family left on the
last boat out of Shanghai.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.950
We left on the last
plane, the last train.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.920
We walked, we swam to Hong Kong.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.780
Those are the stories,
and they're all

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.030
about being the last ones.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.548
And so I knew this
just intellectually.

00:12:44.548 --> 00:12:46.590
And I always wondered,
well, what does that mean?

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.030
What is that sense of panic?

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:53.970
What would drive you, any of
us, to leave the wonderful--

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.820
the jobs we have, the
comfortable homes,

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.580
the communities,
the people we love.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.510
And we only have three tickets
to go, who will we take?

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.520
all of those things,
what was that about?

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.570
But it wasn't until I heard
a story, and as it turns out,

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.230
it was from my own mother
when she was in her 70s.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.070
And I was already in my 50s.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:20.820
I had already written two books
and spent a career as a writer,

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.360
as a journalist.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.430
And I think you grow up asking
your parents, or grandparents,

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:32.950
your family members, what was
life like when you were a kid?

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.400
And my mother would always
say, oh, that was wartime,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.855
a bad memory.

00:13:37.855 --> 00:13:39.230
And she would
never say anything.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.660
And then you grow up
thinking, well, they're

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.340
never going to tell me, or
maybe there's nothing to tell.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.050
And it wasn't until
that I was having dinner

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.470
with my mother at
full grown adult.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.040
And I just said, oh, mom
too bad you can't tell me

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.760
what life was like for you
as a kid growing up in China.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.000
And that night she said,
all right, you want to know.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.450
I'll tell you.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:06.590
And you could have knocked
me over with a chopstick.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.520
And I wind down, and
she put hers down.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.990
And she began to tell me about
being an abandoned girl when

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.920
she was 6 years old, that
her father had taken her

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.600
on a special trip
that she thought

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.280
was going to be just
such a wonderful thing.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.840
And instead, he took her to
a strange place and left her.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:34.960
From that point, it was a story
of the war with Japan begins.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.940
World War II for China
lasted eight years.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.760
She's a child growing
up in wartime China.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.960
She ends up in Shanghai,
is abandoned again,

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.855
and makes her way
through a city--

00:14:46.855 --> 00:14:51.580
a huge city that was
under wartime occupation

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:56.590
by a terrible memory and a
terrible enemy, and somehow

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.460
makes her way to come
to the United States

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.050
on the last boat
out of Shanghai.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.010
So she tells me the
story, and I was so--

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.200
of course, my
whole world changed

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.963
hearing my mother's story.

00:15:09.963 --> 00:15:12.380
But at some point, I wanted
to know other people's stories

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.270
too to be able to put my
mother's life in a context.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.390
And I began interviewing other
people, finding other people,

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.260
doing more than 100
interviews, and with people who

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.090
had survived this.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.650
So the stories I
got were amazing,

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.110
and that's how I
thought if I'm going

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.720
to tell the story of history.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.270
History can be a
recitation of facts,

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.510
or it can be made
personal so that you're

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.280
reading about people's
lives 70 years ago.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.880
But how to make that real
so people feel like that

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.260
could be somebody I know?

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.620
What if that was
me, what would I do?

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.690
And that's the power of stories.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.090
AMY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.890
I think what I found
just so compelling

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.800
throughout the whole
book is that as you said,

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.250
the stories feel both personal
and universal at the same time.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.250
There are a lot of very
real-world implications today

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:07.360
for these stories.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.760
I know you said that
you spent so much time

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.620
interviewing hundreds
of people, and you

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.700
landed on four just
incredibly powerful stories.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.135
How did you land on
these four specific ones?

00:16:18.135 --> 00:16:19.510
Obviously, the
one you don't want

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.310
it being about your mother.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.370
HELEN ZIA: Well, this
book took me 12 years.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.720
Part of it is because
it's such a dynamic, one

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.010
of the most tumultuous
periods of the 20th century.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.430
The changes going on in
the world after World War

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.330
II, and the revolution in China,
and the complete realignment

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.710
with the Cold War going on, the
communist bloc as they called

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.960
it, and the countries
like the United States

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.460
that were the former
Allied country.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.680
And so there was a lot
going on to capture that.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:57.100
But so these individuals living
through that time, their lives

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.500
were frankly pretty much
of a mess in many ways.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.010
They were living in
total uncertainty.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.520
It was like living with
tectonic shifts under your feet

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.390
all the time, except they were
global geopolitical changes.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:11.260
And where do we go?

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.619
What do we do?

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:18.069
And so interviewing
more than 100 people

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:22.510
and hearing their stories, some
of it has been the writer part,

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.730
the craft part kicks in.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.190
And you think, how am I
going to tell this story?

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.680
It's their stories,
but it's also

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.870
a history I want to encompass.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:37.210
So it has to be people who not
only have, in almost all cases,

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.780
several dramatic
stories to tell,

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.860
but the memories that were quite
detailed that could take me

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.040
from their childhoods,
to their teenage-hoods,

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:56.370
their young adult times,
the college times,

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.310
going across the world and
landing in different places.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.130
And then being able
to describe all that.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:07.530
So that narrowed it down,
but also some diversity.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.850
There were two girls and
two boys I focused on.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:10.800
I was very clear.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.660
You know, war and occupation
and flight is gendered too.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.080
It's a different experience.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.300
I mean, it was terrible for
all, but a different experience

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.680
being a boy and a girl.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.750
I wanted different
class backgrounds.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.608
The reputation of
people from Shanghai

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:28.650
is that they're all rich.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.358
Well, guess what.

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.680
A million people, they're not.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.280
And in fact, there was a
huge income gap there too.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.460
The vast majority of people in
Shanghai were incredibly poor.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.600
So I didn't want them to
all be educated and wealthy.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.960
So I have one who
is the daughter

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.200
of a nationalist, a
Kuomintang, the side that

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.320
lost the war, the revolution.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.970
So there was politics
involved too.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.850
One was the son
of a collaborator.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.780
His father sided with
the enemy, with Japan.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.410
And we know how that war ended.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:06.120
So you can imagine, their life
when Japan was occupying China

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.570
was amazing.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.680
And then as soon as the
surrender documents,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.240
they were out on the street.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.910
And so that was partly it.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.570
But they each had
amazing memories.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.470
And people actually
say, wow, how could you

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.040
remember such things when
you were such a small child?

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.980
But in some cases, one was
maybe three or four years old.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.580
And she saw Japanese
soldiers come

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.170
into their house in the
middle of the night,

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.460
point a bayonet and a
sword at their mother,

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:45.290
ask for their IDs, and make
a move toward her mother.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.890
And then her mother stood
tall and stared them down,

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.270
and they left.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.150
Now you would remember
every detail of that

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.370
if that was your mother,
no matter how old.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.990
And so they remembered
these things,

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.920
because they were such
incredibly not just

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.190
dramatic-- in many
cases traumatic things.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.950
And they remembered what
was the color of the room.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.070
They remember what people
said to each other,

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.300
the sense of that.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.720
They remembered their feelings.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.020
And so these are
people who had to also

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.400
be open enough and
reflective enough to tell me,

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.890
what was it like when
your father was in prison,

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:26.780
and you thought that he
might be executed at any day?

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.880
And to have them
tell me those things.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.460
Now, they didn't
open up their lives,

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.650
especially terribly
frightening or tragic things,

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.580
until I had maybe met with
them over a period of six

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.780
years already, to trust me
with these kind of stories.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.520
My mother, it took her 70 years
before she could tell anybody.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.370
She had kept this a secret.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.870
And a lot of the
people I talked to,

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.962
they would just tell
me about their lives.

00:20:55.962 --> 00:20:57.920
And the average age of
the people I interviewed

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.910
was about 80 years old.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.060
And at some point,
I would say, that's

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.920
an incredible story
you just told me

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.680
of what you had lived
through and survived.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.650
Does your family know this?

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.680
And they would say,
no, I don't think so.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.890
Well, what about your kids?

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.370
And their kids would
be grown adults, right?

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.470
I don't think they're
so interested.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.130
No.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:21.750
And then I would
say, no, I really

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.167
think you should
tell your family.

00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:25.030
I think they would
really want to know.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:31.050
And when people experience
things like having to flee--

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.880
or you can imagine
what it's like to be

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.890
on the border of the
United States today

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.540
and being separated
from your children

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.640
or being one of
those children living

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.550
in cages on a hard floor.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.740
I mean, you're not
going to tell about that

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.540
and open up your
emotions, because it

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.260
might take years and
decades before you can even

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.910
share that or put it together
or not fear being judged.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.850
Or, in the case of my
mother, as an abandoned girl,

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.950
I think she feared being
stigmatized, being made fun of.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.440
Kids did when she was a child.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.300
And so it takes time.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.350
I mean, we know that
Holocaust survivors,

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.020
it might have been their
grandchildren who found out.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.520
Or people who experienced
the incarceration

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.920
as Japanese-Americans
during World War II.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.070
It was the
grandchildren who first

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.900
began to find these things out.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.370
Their kids had no idea.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.040
And so one of the lessons was--

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.250
I mean, it was serendipity
that I just that night

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:39.720
said, oh, Mom, too bad you can't
tell me this at a point where

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.970
she was ready to tell me.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.690
And had I not said that, she
might not have ever told me.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.100
She might have been one of those
other people who said, oh, I

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.340
don't think my family cares.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.160
They don't ask.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.380
So one of the lessons
is don't give up.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.520
If they say, oh, I don't
want to talk about it now.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.990
They might not say "now."

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.790
But in your head, say,
OK, maybe some other time.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.520
AMY: Yeah.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.500
I think that really
resonates for me.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.740
I am the daughter of immigrants,
refugees from Vietnam

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.220
who fled after the war.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.650
And I think as I grow
older, little by little,

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.440
I feel like they're beginning
to open up and tell me

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:19.940
more things.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.900
They have so much
trauma around it.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.810
And I can understand the
hardships and challenges

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.740
and difficulties
they went through.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.920
I think you chronicle that here.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.160
You chronicle the challenges,
hardship, discrimination

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.120
that people fleeing their
countries were facing.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.870
I'd love for you to
talk a little bit more

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.300
about what was it like hearing
these stories of just very

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.080
real hardship?

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.590
And how did that make you
think about its implications

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:49.423
for today?

00:23:49.423 --> 00:23:50.840
HELEN ZIA: There
were times when I

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.100
was hearing stories that
brought tears to my eyes

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.430
as well as who was
telling me the story.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.780
But the fact was,
we were sitting,

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.870
whether it was in Hong
Kong or Taiwan or in China

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:06.460
or here in the US.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:12.220
And they had made it to
their 70s, 80s, or even 90s.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.470
And some of them had
lived through many, many--

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:18.200
I also interviewed people
who remained in China too.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.450
And so they had
experienced the revolution,

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:24.190
the many political movements,
the cultural revolution.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:28.370
So every story had pain.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.670
But they also had joy
to them, because they

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.440
survived the hardships.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.140
They also had
inspiration and things

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.520
that we could connect to.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.430
So that was the part that
I really had to hold on to.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.030
And any writer or anybody
working on a project that

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.080
takes a long time--

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.840
and especially 12
years as a writer,

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.570
you're kind of by
yourself doing this.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:53.020
There are times when you think,
why am I still doing this?

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.770
Is anybody going to care
about this except me?

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.490
Does this really matter?

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:01.390
And so the part of
it is, those stories

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.170
made me feel like I have a
responsibility to the people

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.690
who told me, who
opened up their hearts

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.580
and told me their stories.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.610
So I have a
responsibility to them

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.800
to honor their
stories, to tell it

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.100
in a way that they're entrusting
me, the truth of their lives.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.730
And then there's the
broader picture too,

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.320
because I wanted
to put it together

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.960
as a history of
something that happened

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.540
to millions of people
that is completely

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:34.860
forgotten except by them.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.960
And then when you multiply
it by their children,

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.460
their grandchildren,
their families,

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.340
we're talking about
multiple millions of people

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.520
having experienced
something that other people

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:50.230
in other times, fleeing
Vietnam, the last helicopter out

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.950
of Saigon--

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.160
I mean, all of those
things-- or the last boat

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.440
or leaving Syria
today and putting

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.320
your kids who can't
swim on a rubber raft

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.510
into the Mediterranean.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:05.120
And you don't know whether
your kids are going to survive,

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.920
but what you assume is
that you stay, they won't.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.630
And that's why they leave.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.337
And so then being able to make
a connection to that and say,

00:26:13.337 --> 00:26:14.170
well, you know what?

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.180
There's a larger story here.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.620
Because that's why people flee.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.440
Or that's why people immigrate.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.310
And this country, being a
country of largely immigrants--

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:28.630
and I say largely, because
unless you are Native American,

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.100
everybody's people came
from somewhere else.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.750
And one of the lessons of
this book or any exodus

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.300
is that if families
are doing OK--

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.950
I don't mean doing well.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.980
I mean if they're doing
OK, and they can make it,

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:42.850
they don't leave.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:43.635
They stay.

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:45.260
Who would want to
leave their families,

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:50.440
their homes, everything
that they fought and love?

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.150
They only leave if they have to.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:53.920
And that applied
to the pilgrims.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.198
It applied to every migration
from Germany, from Italy,

00:26:57.198 --> 00:26:58.615
from everywhere
else in the world.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.050
You asked me about the
power of storytelling.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.220
If people could connect
to their own stories,

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.260
no matter how many
generations back,

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.270
and really identify
how hard that

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:16.810
was for their own grandparents,
great-grandparents, relatives,

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:21.060
ancestors, that might
create a little bit more

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.210
empathy for the people who
are going through this today.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.660
And that's what it was like.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:32.340
I mean, writing it, feeling
that you take these stories--

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:36.270
you take some of that
energy from people.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.120
And you feel like, I
have a responsibility

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.290
to do something with that.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.930
So even hearing
stories that were hard,

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.860
it just made me feel
like, I have to tell this.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.470
People need to know.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.680
It can't just get forgotten
to the dustbin of history.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.760
AMY: What I'm hearing is
just this idea of connecting

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.340
to our own history and the
importance of connection

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.190
to our histories.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:07.530
Speaking of May, it's API
Heritage Month as of yesterday.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.855
One thing I love about
"Last Boat Out of Shanghai"

00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:11.730
in addition to "Asian
American Dreams," which

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.100
was published in
2000 is that I think

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.870
you do a really amazing job of
melding both the personal story

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.070
but also with the actual
chronicled history

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.880
and specific historical
incidents that

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.190
have happened throughout
Asian-American history.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.310
Can you talk a little bit more
about "Asian American Dreams"

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.675
and what you wanted readers
to get out of it in terms

00:28:32.675 --> 00:28:34.050
of the different
modes of history

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.830
and how that should
shape and inform

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.280
Asian-American identities
and actions and beyond?

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.540
HELEN ZIA: Well, sure.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.190
"Asian American Dreams"
was my first book.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.700
And I always knew--

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.220
because I had collected
stories in the day

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.110
before internet and so forth.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.810
I mean, all you had were
the newspaper or magazine

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:56.320
clippings.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.100
And I was a dedicated
news junkie.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.120
I would read everything.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.220
And I would collect
stories, because I

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.050
knew there was
something more I wanted

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:10.930
to find out behind the story
and to tell it in a fuller way.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.330
Having grown up as an
Asian-American daughter

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:22.140
of immigrants, I just
never saw our stories.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.710
Because I was Asian-American, I
would hear about these stories.

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.050
The killing of Vincent
Chin for example,

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:31.410
the hate crime that happened
in Detroit when I was there.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:35.590
This is something that some
Asian-Americans may not know.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:39.990
But even being Asian in
America, our stories are--

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.450
I feel like we're
robbed of our history,

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.653
that these are things
that are just not--

00:29:44.653 --> 00:29:45.570
they're not in movies.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:46.980
They're not in television.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.960
OK, there may be some
things now in the internet

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.800
if you know where
to look for them.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.790
So I reached a point where I
really felt that I don't know

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.260
when it is I'm--

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.420
what I'm waiting for
to try to write a book.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.490
But finally I reached the
point of saying, you know what?

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:09.450
In my lifetime I've seen so many
changes for Asians in America.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.730
Our population has
grown tremendously

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.910
from when I was that Martian
alien invader as a child who

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.660
was completely invisible.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.210
And even in those days, Bruce
Lee, the great Bruce Lee,

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:24.540
was only a sidekick in TV.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.460
He could never be
the champion himself.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.040
And so that was the way it was.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.020
And I just felt like
these are completely

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.990
missing the real stories
and the real contributions

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:37.920
and the real
experiences of people

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.990
of Asian descent in America.

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.620
And this idea that
we all just came here

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.170
to take advantage,
take the benefits,

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.330
work somewhere, take
the money, and run--

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:54.180
which is a continuing, even
today, idea, even possibly

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.980
at companies like Google.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:01.260
Are we really people
who belong in America?

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.380
What is our contribution?

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.830
That was missing.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.290
And that's what made
me feel like finally,

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.440
I have to tell
some of this story.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.880
Because pretty much
I was just fed up.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.000
And what was going
on in the news was--

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.230
at the time, when I was
writing this in the mid-1990s

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.100
was saying that
every Asian-American

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.530
who ever participated
in this democracy

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:30.030
and donated $10 to a
presidential campaign,

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:33.430
that they were conduits to the
People's Republic of China,

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.430
even if they were from Taiwan,
the Philippines, Vietnam,

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.710
India, Sri Lanka.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:38.730
It didn't matter.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:43.140
They would all, as Asians, be
potential spies and conduits

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.040
to China.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.250
Well, what could be more
ridiculous than that?

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.410
But it was out there, and it
was in the headlines every day.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.005
And that's what made me
feel like, you know what?

00:31:52.005 --> 00:31:53.130
I have to write about this.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.010
And I have to show
the real story

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.610
behind what we've been
doing in this country

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:04.170
and why everybody born here
is an American citizen, how

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:08.250
the separate-but-equal
laws were overturned

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:13.740
as unconstitutional in the 1800s
because of Asians in America,

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.330
and all of those things.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.250
So that's why I wrote that book.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.360
And I feel like today
we're still in that space.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.650
And it's painful to watch.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.710
Because the media--
and I include

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.650
the internet and internet
content to that--

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:37.410
so often goes to the
lowest common denominator.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.870
If everybody can jump on
this and agree with this, OK.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:40.980
It gets the most hits.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.480
This must be true.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.760
When in fact, there are
things we have to dig for.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.490
We have to look for it,
because it's not there.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:51.900
In a way, we have to be
intelligent not just consumers,

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.410
but we have to be
detectives on our own.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:58.960
And in doing that, in finding
nuggets of history that, wow,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.180
I didn't know that.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.080
This affects me.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.010
I'm a citizen because
I was born here.

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:07.980
Which, by the way,
there are some people

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:13.290
trying to change that, even
after 1898 when the Supreme

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.030
Court decided that.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.480
We need to be informed about it.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.730
So even in today's
space, I think we all

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.780
have a responsibility to try
to learn these things that have

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.120
happened and pay attention.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:27.810
Stay woke.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.210
AMY: I learned about the
murder of Vincent Chin

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.890
when I was in third grade.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.480
I remember my
third grade teacher

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.578
asking us to write
an essay about--

00:33:39.578 --> 00:33:41.370
I forget what the essay
topic was actually.

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:42.420
But I remember my
third grade teacher

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.600
asking us to write an essay.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.990
And the thing I had chosen
to write my essay about

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:48.070
was the murder of
Vincent Chin and you.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:50.160
And what was shocking
to me is when

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.310
I wrote this essay in third
grade, no one around me

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.140
knew who he was.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.400
Not my family, not
my friends, nobody

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.780
around me, no one at school.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:58.890
This was the first time
that a lot of people

00:33:58.890 --> 00:33:59.700
had been hearing about it.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.080
This was the first time that
I had been hearing about it.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.800
So for you, what really drew
you to Vincent Chin's case?

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.940
And why should this case matter
to Asian-Americans today?

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.239
HELEN ZIA: Well, so I was
in Detroit at the time

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:14.340
that Vincent Chin was killed.

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.550
And I was just beginning
my life as a journalist.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.320
I had been an activist
up until then.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.820
I wasn't really clear what
I was going to be doing.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.550
But I was in Detroit.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.989
I had been working at a Chrysler
stamping plant, in a factory.

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:29.139
And why was I there?

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.469
It was really because
friends of mine

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:32.969
had said, if you
really want to know

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:36.929
about the heartland of America
and really be an organizer

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:40.108
and think about change and
social change in America,

00:34:40.108 --> 00:34:41.400
you should go to the heartland.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.679
And so I thought, oh, good idea.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.840
And being young,
I went to Detroit,

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:49.440
not really knowing a soul there.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:54.030
And so I happened to be working
in Detroit when the entire auto

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.469
industry collapsed.

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:59.280
And I know it's hard for,
probably, most people listening

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.060
or watching to imagine.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:05.730
But in the last recession--

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.830
nobody wanted to
call it a depression.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:09.480
That was a depression.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.020
Millions and millions of
people were out of work

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.480
and had no idea when
they would have a job.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.630
And these were high-paying jobs.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.580
This is when minimum wage
was about $1.30 an hour.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:24.240
And working in a car factory,
you were getting $10 an hour.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.170
That would be like minimum
wage today at $15 an hour

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.630
if you're lucky
and instead getting

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.610
a job that paid $60 an hour.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.280
I mean, imagine what a
difference in your life

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.270
it would make.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:40.740
And so these were people who
were permanently laid off

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:45.120
from jobs that got them not
only a house, a second house,

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.170
a summer cottage, two cars,
a recreational vehicle,

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:53.070
all kinds of vacation,
health care, retirement.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.590
All that stuff gone
down the drain.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:59.280
And what happens when people are
really miserable in a mass way

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.290
like that, not knowing?

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.930
They start wanting
to find who to blame.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:08.440
And the finger of blame
ended up on Japan.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:08.940
Why?

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:13.320
Because the dinosaurs that
Detroit produced in those days

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.245
that could get maybe seven or
10 miles a gallon if that--

00:36:18.245 --> 00:36:23.580
the competition was either
Volkswagen or Japanese cars,

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:27.570
which could get
more gas mileage.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.537
And gas was so
expensive in those days.

00:36:29.537 --> 00:36:31.870
Most people couldn't afford
to drive their cars anymore.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:34.510
That's why people
lost their jobs.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:39.950
And so Japan was blamed and
anybody who looked Japanese.

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:43.350
So anybody with
an East Asian face

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:46.420
was considered to be
part of the enemy.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:50.110
And remember I had talked
about the wars preceding.

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:55.590
So the whole idea that you could
have been the enemy from Japan,

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.920
from Vietnam, from
Korea, from China,

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.300
and now the Japanese cars.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:05.910
So if you were
Asian, East Asian,

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:07.920
walking down the
street in Detroit,

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.960
you knew you could be attacked.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.820
I mean, the climate
was so thick.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.820
The only thing I can
compare it to today

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.990
was right after 9/11
and the Islamophobia

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:21.200
that we still have in
this country today,

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:27.130
and, sadly, so many killings
even in recent days.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.880
But at that time,
a young man named

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.330
Vincent Chin, who was
Chinese, not Japanese,

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:37.320
happened to be out
for his bachelor

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.360
party, the All-American
bachelor party.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.780
And two auto workers, two white
auto workers, saw him and--

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.682
can I use bad language?

00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:48.830
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:49.340
AMY: Yes.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:49.840
OK.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.320
We got the thumbs-up.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.060
HELEN ZIA: --saw him at a strip
bar for his bachelor party

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.270
and said, it's because
of you motherfuckers

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.280
that we're out of work.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.690
And you can imagine what kind
of reaction that would draw.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:10.040
And anyway, that turned
into a fight that

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.690
spilled out into the streets.

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.090
And these two white
autoworkers chased

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.760
Vincent Chin and his friend--

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.820
only his Chinese friend.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.000
There were other
non-Chinese friends

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.100
that they didn't bother with.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.870
But the two Chinese
then were chased

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.510
through the streets of Detroit.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.740
Vincent tripped.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:28.850
One grabbed him.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:33.170
The other had the baseball
bat and bashed his brains out

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.607
into the street.

00:38:34.607 --> 00:38:36.440
And so that would have
been terrible enough,

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.940
but it was witnessed by probably
more than a hundred people.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.000
Because it was just a
busy night that night.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.750
And two were off-duty
police officers.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:49.820
And so there was no
question that they

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.120
had killed Vincent Chin
and said what they said.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:58.280
But when it finally came
out to getting sentenced,

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.370
the sentencing judge
said, oh, you're

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:04.370
not the kind of men
who should go to jail.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:05.780
You're clean-cut.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.700
And he didn't say
clean-cut white guys,

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.110
but that was the implication
in a city like Detroit.

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:15.170
You're not the kind of men
we should send to jail.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:16.940
So he gave them probation.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:20.460
And so for beating another man's
brains out into the street,

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.240
they were given probation.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.170
And that created an uproar.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:30.370
But why it was so important
was because at the time,

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:35.290
in the 1980s, the Asian-American
community was very separate.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:37.210
It was each ethnic community.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.000
There wasn't something
called Asian-American.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.170
It was you're Chinese-American,
Vietnamese-American,

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.850
Korean-American,
Japanese-American,

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.230
and Filipino-American.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:52.870
And those were the major Asian
ethnicities in the Detroit area

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:53.380
at the time.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.780
But it was a minuscule number.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:58.600
And the Asian-American
community came together,

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.300
calling itself
Asian-American, to say

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.950
this was a violation of
Vincent Chin's civil rights,

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.960
and these men should be
punished for doing that.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.310
And it became a national
civil rights movement

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.880
with the improbable epicenter
in Detroit, Michigan

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.060
of all places.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.740
But it was something that
every Asian person in America

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.710
felt, because whether you
were in the Midwest or not,

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:26.470
you really felt
like people hate me.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:30.100
They're looking at me because
this country is in a depression

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.100
right now.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:36.670
And it's because of MFs like
you that we're out of work

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.910
or that we're suffering
or that our economy is bad

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:44.240
or that I can't get a mortgage
anymore or all of those things.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:52.890
And so it was the moment
that Asian-Americans really

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:58.230
started, in a mass way, talking
about civil rights, race

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:02.310
in America, where
Asian-American people fit

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:07.050
into a dialogue around
race, which up until then

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:10.320
had been completely
either black or white.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.300
And Asians were
like, what is this?

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.360
They were the Martians from
Mars, the aliens from Mars

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.632
like I was as a kid.

00:41:16.632 --> 00:41:17.340
Like who are you?

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.340
What are you doing here?

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.050
Where do you fit?

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.610
You have nothing
to say about race.

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:22.760
You're not black,
and you're not white.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.460
And that was the moment.

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.690
And that's why it's so
important in many ways.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:30.810
There have been many other hate
crimes against Asian-Americans,

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:32.760
sadly to say, since then.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.460
And today we seem to
have an epidemic of hate

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.725
crimes against so many people.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.540
But it was a time where
Asian-Americans were--

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.327
it's like, step up now and raise
your voices as a community.

00:41:49.327 --> 00:41:51.410
AMY: That idea of step up
now and raise your voice

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.750
as a community is
something I think

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.450
we've been talking a lot
about in Asian Google network,

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.490
this idea of solidarity.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:59.930
I think it's one
of the strongest

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.670
themes that comes through
in "Asian American Dreams."

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.837
You talk a lot about the
solidarity of our community

00:42:03.837 --> 00:42:06.410
as it relates to how we came
together on Vincent Chin.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:07.730
Then you talk about
times when our community

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:08.770
didn't come together.

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:10.940
You also talk about times when
our community has stood up

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.607
for other communities,
other communities

00:42:12.607 --> 00:42:15.188
of color in particular, and
times when we haven't at all.

00:42:15.188 --> 00:42:16.730
And so can you talk
a little bit more

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.130
about why does solidarity
within our own community

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:22.920
and also with other
marginalized communities matter?

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.340
HELEN ZIA: Well,
solidarity, connectedness,

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:30.810
sharing each other's stories,
having a feeling or common bond

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:36.640
as human beings, let alone
as people in one country,

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:45.600
I mean, that's what makes us
move forward as a civilization.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.980
It's what separates us from
other animals and species,

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:54.030
this ability to do that
and to build on that.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.040
And so it's vitally important.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:02.650
And the flip side of that
is keeping people divided.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:06.360
And we are at a time today
where divisiveness and pitting

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.580
one group of people
against another

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:13.590
is being honed to a fine
art and blasted every day,

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:17.620
not only on TV and movies, but
every tweet that comes out.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.580
There's so many of them that
are just filled with venom

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:25.830
and hate that it's all you can
do to just say, well, OK, let

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:29.520
me protect my little
cocoon and my little one

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:33.480
square foot of space
that I'm standing on.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:38.497
But in fact, if we only
exist for ourselves--

00:43:38.497 --> 00:43:40.830
and that applies to everybody,
not just Asian-Americans,

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:41.413
but everybody.

00:43:41.413 --> 00:43:45.130
If we only think of our
own self-interest, that's

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:49.150
the easiest and surest way
to be manipulated to say,

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:53.500
well, Asian-Americans,
you all go to Harvard.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.440
Why should you care
about a lawsuit that's

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.090
happening at Harvard right now?

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:01.660
Well, in fact, the vast
majority of Asian-Americans--

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.010
and studies show this--

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:08.800
go to community colleges and
state colleges, not even UCs,

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:13.390
and face the same issues
that every everybody else--

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:16.870
the economic choice of can
I make it through college,

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:19.540
or do I need to help
support my family,

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.110
and all of those things.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:26.980
But this myth has become to
not just separate, for example,

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:32.580
Asian-Americans apart from
other people of color or people

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.325
of conscience but that--

00:44:35.325 --> 00:44:38.723
to me, it's like a bad
rerun in another way of when

00:44:38.723 --> 00:44:40.890
I was growing up as a kid
when we were so completely

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:42.720
invisible, nobody saw us.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:47.520
Now it's a way of saying,
well, you're all doing so well,

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.470
you're actually almost
honorary white people.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:54.450
And so you're invisible
too, because you blend in

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:55.590
with the scenery.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:59.300
And the idea of blending
in with the scenery,

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:03.600
it's counter to the whole
idea of-- as humans,

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.010
we want to be recognized.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:09.350
As people in a world,
we want to be--

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:11.070
and that's the power
of stories too.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:12.840
It's being acknowledged.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.070
I have humanity.

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:14.760
So do you.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.410
So does everybody.

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:19.170
But do we see each other,
and do we hear each other?

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:21.750
And that only happens
when we're connected

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.580
and we can share
with each other.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.120
I mean share that common
interest with each other

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.900
to do something that
will benefit all of us

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.630
as a society or a community
or as a workplace.

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:38.440
I mean, that's why the
connectedness is so important.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.250
And that's why I wanted to
tell all of these stories,

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:44.070
because I think that's a
way to pull people together.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:44.940
AMY: Thank you.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:46.950
So we'll open it up to
audience questions now.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:48.110
AUDIENCE: We have a
question on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.030
I'll go ahead and read for you.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.890
AMY: Yeah.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:51.990
AUDIENCE: This question
says, "setting aside

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:55.110
history and cultural roots, in
your opinion, how important is

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.690
it to grow up with
mastering mother tongue

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.130
other than English?

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:01.770
What's the impact of speaking
a language other than English

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:03.210
to assimilation?

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:05.550
If my kids aren't interested
in my native language,

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.230
should I lose sleep over it?"

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:10.020
HELEN ZIA: Oh.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.210
Language.

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:12.480
AMY: Yes.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.050
HELEN ZIA: So when I was a kid
growing up during the McCarthy

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:19.740
period when people from
Asia and especially China

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:25.050
were all viewed as potential
spies or a fifth column,

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.690
meriting a fifth column
against the United States,

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:31.380
my father said to my
mother, don't speak Chinese

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.850
to the children.

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.920
Because he knew and he
experienced discrimination just

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.940
in the way he spoke.

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.860
And my father spoke
perfect English,

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.330
but he did have an accent.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:44.400
And as a kid, I
saw him ridiculed.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.380
And it was painful.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.660
But my father made
that decision.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:53.460
And as an adult, I have
regretted it every day.

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:59.040
So I grew up as a typical
monolingual American,

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.770
knowing only English
as my culture

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:06.660
and then having to study other
languages, but not Chinese.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.390
And it wasn't until I was in
college that I actually took

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:10.600
a couple of Chinese classes.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.600
So I can speak at a
level of, I think,

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.340
about a 2- or 3-year-old.

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.200
But not enough to
have a conversation

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.520
and not enough to read.

00:47:21.638 --> 00:47:26.560
If your child speaks another
language or two or three,

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:31.420
each language, I think, just
multiplies their ability

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:37.270
to be somebody meaningful,
have meaningful understanding

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:39.010
and connectedness in this world.

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:43.780
It multiplies them
tenfold each time.

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.910
And for me, I know
not even being

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:48.780
able to speak or read
Chinese, that cuts me off

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.200
from an entire culture.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.710
It makes it so-- in doing
my interviews, I did not--

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:58.030
my interviews had
to be in English.

00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:59.900
I did have a translator.

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.270
I did have other people helping.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:04.360
But I knew I was
missing nuances.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.030
Why did they pick this
word and not that word?

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:10.000
And if kids are unwilling--

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.740
I mean, of course, we all know.

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.990
For kids, it's like, I want
to be like everybody else.

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.740
I want to go play.

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.270
What, are you going to make me
study this language that nobody

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.740
among my friends speaks?

00:48:23.674 --> 00:48:27.190
One day they will thank you.

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:30.430
I'm told that's true for
musical instruments too.

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:32.440
But it's really
true for language.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.650
Just the ability to
travel in this world

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:39.580
and be in other
places, it's critical.

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:41.920
And I'm sure in a
workplace like Google,

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.250
being able to know
other languages--

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:50.530
a multinational company
that has viewers and people

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:53.290
all over the world,
the more languages

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.450
you speak and the more
you can connect there,

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.700
I'm sure it's an asset.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:01.870
So I wish my father
had never said that

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:05.720
to my mother every day.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.420
AUDIENCE: As a proud
queer Asian-American,

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.910
I'm interested to hear your
story or biggest challenge

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:15.140
you have as a lesbian
Asian-American.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:19.700
HELEN ZIA: So as a proud
queer person of color,

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.980
Asian-American lesbian,
I mean, the first thing

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:24.590
is it's assumed that we're not.

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:28.800
I mean I have been told,
especially whether it's Asian,

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:33.310
Latino, African-American
communities, being queer

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.990
is a white thing.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:38.380
Why are you-- you don't exist.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.170
The entire continent of Asia,
there are no gay people.

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:42.160
What?

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:47.110
And that in itself is
hilarious to think about.

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.720
Even China recognizes
at this point

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.400
that they have queer people.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:57.790
And so the challenge has
been, number one, knowing

00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:02.320
that you can pass and
kind of be invisible.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.320
And layer that on being an
invisible Asian-American

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:09.250
and also as a woman,
being walked on

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:11.660
or stepped on by
people who are like,

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:14.245
oh, you're female,
what do you matter?

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.240
I don't want to be invisible.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.040
I think that's harmful.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.010
I don't think anybody really
wants to be invisible.

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:29.300
And so the biggest
challenge, I think,

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:34.310
is being seen completely
as a full human being.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.960
And so there was
a time in my life

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.240
when I didn't feel
confident about being out.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:51.900
And I think that's true for
every queer, gay, lesbian, bi,

00:50:51.900 --> 00:51:01.800
trans person to be understood
and to be seen fully.

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:06.160
And so anyway, you go
through this time of

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.690
should I tell people.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:09.460
And the hardest
part was actually

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:12.190
being able to tell my
family, because these

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:17.620
are the people that know
you and love you, you hope,

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:21.310
as well as my community.

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:22.960
So I actually went out--

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:27.370
I went through a period
of time that I wrote about

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:30.530
in "Asian American Dreams"
where I was already an activist.

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:32.740
I was already
very, very involved

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.530
with communities of color,
including Asian-American ones.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:40.210
And I had what I call
my lesbian trial, where

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:41.380
I hadn't come out yet.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.270
I didn't even know--

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:47.360
I was at that point
where I wasn't sure.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.780
Now they call it
questioning or whatever,

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.970
where you're just not
sure of your identity

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:55.210
in every full way.

00:51:55.210 --> 00:52:01.370
And so I was real involved
with feminist movements.

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:04.180
And in these women's
organizations,

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:06.050
there were some lesbians.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:09.250
But in the way that
a lot of-- sort

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:14.350
of in the misogynist way
that feminism is disparaged,

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:17.440
it was like oh, if you're a
feminist, you're all lesbians.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.540
And therefore, the
300 women who would

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:23.980
come to our citywide meetings
in Boston must all be lesbians.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:28.720
So my organizing
community that I was in,

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.240
which was Asian and
African-American,

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.010
called me to a meeting one day.

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:35.300
And it was, like,
a space like this.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.300
And when I got to
the meeting, they

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:38.680
were sitting in a semicircle.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.280
They were all there.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.780
And it's like, oh,
everybody's here.

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.260
And they said,
yeah, you sit here.

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.770
And it's like, oh in the center?

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:48.820
And it soon became
very clear that I

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.680
was the topic of the meeting.

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:57.070
And one by one, the head of the
Asian community organization,

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:59.563
the collective, he
said, well, you're

00:52:59.563 --> 00:53:01.480
here because we've noticed
that you're hanging

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.820
around a lot of lesbians.

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:08.380
And we need to know whether
you're a lesbian or not.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:11.800
Because we could not
have you in our community

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.830
as part of our organizing,
because you would bring

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:16.360
discredit to us.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.730
And the head of the
African-American collective

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:20.680
says, that's right.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:24.850
In our black community,
there are no gay people.

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:26.530
And he didn't use the word gay.

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:28.330
But there are none.

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:33.610
And it's a symptom of white
petty Bourgeois decadence.

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:37.870
And so if you are a
lesbian, we wouldn't

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:41.470
want to have anything to do
with you or any other Asian.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.230
So I was sort of like, oh,
everybody's going to be--

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:48.410
so, Helen, tell us,
are you a lesbian?

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:53.750
And I sat there thinking, well,
I don't have a membership card.

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:55.660
I didn't get the toaster oven.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.740
I've never held
hands with a girl.

00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.230
I don't know.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:04.090
But I knew it was
clear if I said yes

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:06.280
that I was going to get
excommunicated from this

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.030
community that I was part of.

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:11.900
It was my spiritual
home at that point.

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.710
And so, tell us, Helen,
are you a lesbian?

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.940
And I said no, I'm not.

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:24.130
And it was at that point, I
stepped back into the closet

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:27.400
and slammed the door shut.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.010
So for me, it was, I
guess I would have to say,

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:34.300
quite a circuitous path
to eventually coming out.

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:37.270
And it was shortly after that
I actually moved to Detroit,

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:43.210
because one other reason was I
just felt so ashamed that I had

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:45.460
closed the door not
only on myself but all

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:52.180
of these feminist women's
liberation activists too.

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:55.750
I mean, how could I face them
when I basically had said--

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:58.360
So that was another reason
I thought, OK, a good time

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.480
to get out of Dodge
and go to Detroit,

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.290
where I pretty much stayed
in the closet for quite

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:08.950
a long time, I think, for me.

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:12.370
But anyway, I mean,
as things happen,

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:19.460
life never travels in a
straight line, so to speak.

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:20.950
But it goes in zigzags.

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:24.010
And so that was a
big zigzag for me.

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:26.870
But it was also why I
ended up in Detroit.

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:28.090
And so I was in Detroit.

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:31.240
And that's where I found
this Asian-American community

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:36.100
and became part of a national
civil rights campaign

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:40.840
but then eventually found my
way to come out as a lesbian.

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.460
And I married.

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:45.190
I've been married three times.

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:48.850
And I have to point out,
all to the same woman,

00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:52.420
because marriage has been
such a contested fight

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:55.510
to be able to even be
married to the person

00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:57.180
that I've been
with for 27 years.

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:02.260
And is still in jeopardy
because of the way

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.830
the Supreme Court may turn out.

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:06.580
And so anyway, there
are all these things.

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.830
There is no right
that's fully guaranteed.

00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:11.140
And that's why we all
have to be active.

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:16.030
And that's why, as an
Asian-American queer person,

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:19.840
I need to be out there too
so that people can't say,

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:25.480
oh, Asian people don't
have anybody who's queer.

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:31.580
And that was a slogan that
came out of the HIV epidemic.

00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:32.290
Come out.

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:32.890
Come out.

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:37.370
If you can come out, you must,
because silence equals death.

00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:42.015
And I think that slogan is
true for every community,

00:56:42.015 --> 00:56:43.390
every underrepresented
community,

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:44.598
every marginalized community.

00:56:44.598 --> 00:56:45.640
Silence is death.

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.520
We have to show who we
are as full human beings,

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:52.720
because we don't, nobody else
is going to do it for us.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.600
And so I think those are the--

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.710
a continuing challenge.

00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:59.380
But thank you for that question.

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:01.088
AMY: Thank you so much
for your question.

00:57:01.088 --> 00:57:02.870
I believe we are at time.

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:04.480
But it went by very quickly.

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.300
But thank you so much, Helen,
for being here in conversation

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:07.950
with us today.

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:10.600
We really appreciate
your time and just

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.340
feel so honored
to hear from you.

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:13.882
I don't know if you
can tell, but you

00:57:13.882 --> 00:57:15.803
are my shero, one of them.

00:57:15.803 --> 00:57:17.470
So this was a huge
honor for me as well.

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:18.380
Thank you, everyone.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:19.672
HELEN ZIA: Well, thank you all.

00:57:19.672 --> 00:57:21.230
And thank you, Asian
Google Network.

00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:22.240
Thank you so much.

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.110
Thank you.
