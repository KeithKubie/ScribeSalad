MALE SPEAKER: Welcome to
Authors at Google talk.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.860
So today we're pleased to
host Alex Koloskov, who

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.040
is an expert in product and
high speed flash photography

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.790
and also creator of Photigy.com,
which is an online photography

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.170
school.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.500
So today Alex will talk to
us about the magic of light

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.410
and will actually do
a live photo shoot

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.380
demo for us of the high
speed flash photography.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.950
So please join me
in welcoming Alex.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.334
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:36.375
ALEX KOLOSKOV: Thank you.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.900
Thank you, Kyrill.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.280
Thank you, everyone, and hello.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.370
Thank you for coming to see me,
to see what we're going to do.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.400
Well, photography is
a big part of my life.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.550
And actually, Google has its own
part in my heart, I would say,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.340
because it's a special
company, I think,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:09.150
and I have some very kind of
professional, personal things

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.790
to remember about Google.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.700
And for me it's a big thing
to talk to you right now.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.180
I'm a little bit nervous.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.687
But it should be
OK once we start

00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:18.520
shooting because this
is what I do and love,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.720
and I forgot about everything.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.770
So first, let me just show
you a little movie just a show

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.900
how I love and what kind
of photography I do,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.850
how I love it.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.610
And it's all about,
actually, the help

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.330
with the shoot about Google.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.680
I don't know-- did you see
or not behind the scene

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.290
of making this shot?

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.530
Who's seen it?

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.280
Only a few.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.880
OK, cool.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.980
This is what I called-- we did
it for the first anniversary

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.895
of Google+.

00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:54.800
Again, that was I think a
very cool thing, Google+.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.350
Well, it is, but it has
changed a little bit.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.260
Anyway, this is what we
did for first anniversary.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.692
We made Google.

00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:05.358
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:07.853
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:40.048 --> 00:04:40.790
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.460
ALEX KOLOSKOV: So as you see,
that was several years ago.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.830
That time we had studio inside
the basement of our house.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.870
And it was nothing fancy, I
mean in terms of equipment,

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.570
but to see what
kind of cool things

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.010
you can do even at home when
you are passionate about it.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.640
Right now we have studio here.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.410
It's all much nicer.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.930
But this is not what really
a passionate photographer

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.800
needs to do something
interesting and something cool.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.250
So let me ask you about this.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.700
Properly you have all
have cameras, right?

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.970
SLR, DSLR-- you don't
even need to raise hands.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.610
You probably have it all.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.640
What kind of
photography do you like?

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.310
Please raise your hand if you
really enjoy doing landscaping.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.300
Awesome.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.870
Probably more than 50%.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.850
What about people photography,
fashion and everything?

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.670
Do you do it outside or inside?

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.030
What about studio?

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.660
How many shoot
people in the studio?

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.220
How many of you shoot
still life in studio?

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.200
OK, two-- awesome.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.570
So it's very different.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.470
Every type of photography
is very different.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.630
And of course, we can
talk about this a lot,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.280
but I will try to do various
simple kind of division.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.780
Let's say for
landscape photography,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.490
you need to be in the right
place in the right time

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.380
with the right gear, right?

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.230
And then you have a good
chance to take something nice.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.160
If you miss one of
those things, well, it's

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.490
either too late, too early, or
there is no sky or whatever,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.840
and then you do it next time.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.690
This is for landscaping.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.300
When you shoot people, when
you shoot models and anything,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.190
if it's outside, same
conditions, right?

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.700
If it's inside of the studio,
meaning that you have much more

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.952
control.

00:06:36.952 --> 00:06:37.910
You control your light.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.076
You control your background.

00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:40.840
You control environment.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.520
The only thing that you
don't control is your model.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.500
You can influence.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.220
You can kind of communicate.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.150
But basically, if, let's say
you need some emotion out

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.352
of her or him and for some
reason it's not coming out,

00:06:58.352 --> 00:06:59.310
what do you need to do?

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.330
I mean, you kind of might
be stuck over there.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.360
When I get my first camera,
I started from landscaping.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.720
Then it was people outside.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.030
Then it was inside.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.090
And I just found
that it's not really

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.840
working well for me if I
have some kind of limitation,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.520
so I was looking for
photography without any external

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.820
limitations.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.560
And this is where still
life photography is.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.810
You control everything--
literally everything-- camera,

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.435
lighting, subject.

00:07:30.435 --> 00:07:31.310
Nobody will complain.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.450
He's not going to
complain if it takes me

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.740
five hours to shoot him.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.890
He'll be fine.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.480
And in terms of impact
from your photography,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.670
for example, with
people photography,

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.260
in studio, let's say--
this is one picture,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.530
and this is another picture,
same light and setup,

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.140
all the same except one
thing-- the emotion, right?

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.660
Different emotion makes a
completely different picture

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.100
in terms of how it impacts us.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:08.220
But what you can do if you need
to shoot a still-life subject?

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:13.830
Emotionless, basically, and
you need to somehow reach

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.750
to the viewer,
make it remarkable,

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.220
make people to remember
you, your photography.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:26.760
And the only thing that you need
to do is to work with light.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.034
That's why I call
it magic of light.

00:08:30.034 --> 00:08:31.450
Because in still
life photography,

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.659
we only work with light.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.000
And I'm going to demonstrate
it to you in a few minutes

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.340
from the beginning.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.774
It's another, actually,
example of people photography,

00:08:42.774 --> 00:08:44.190
just something
really beautifully.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.640
You don't need much
emotions, right?

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.390
Eyes, for example, attracts
attention and boom.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.260
You have eyes in the image,
people will look at it

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.080
and probably remember.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.350
But if you shoot something
like this, just a bottle,

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.880
and it should be pretty
kind of plain shot,

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.480
you're not going to prop it
with anything else, maybe

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.030
a little bit, all
what you see is

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.830
a light, the reflection or
refraction of the light.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:16.570
So it's very technical type of
photography, very technical.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.640
Well, my background
is bachelor's degree

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.700
in mechanical engineering,
long, long time ago.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:30.850
And then I was for 10 years a
programmer at one US companies.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.280
So I'm an IT guy.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.030
And this is probably
one of the reasons

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:39.659
why I really enjoy studio
still life photography,

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:40.700
because it's engineering.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.720
You're not going to
work with emotions.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.080
It's all very technical.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.150
So when you shoot simple
subjects, simple things,

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:55.190
to make an impact you
need to work with light.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.720
Just some examples--
you probably

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.260
know one of these things, right?

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.130
Google Glass--
beautiful and simple

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.830
thing-- how to make
something nice from it?

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.360
Light.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.620
It's all actually very
little Photoshop here.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.140
Even that little sparkles,
it's all done in studio.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.950
You can do everything in light.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.340
Or like the jewelry, again,
this is basically as-is shot.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.790
We just clean it, and
it's not a composite shot.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.590
It's call Diamond Drop.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.490
Some telling story
can be happening

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:30.440
with product photography if
you make a story with it.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.605
For example, this very simple
shot-- one light source and we

00:10:36.605 --> 00:10:37.480
didn't use Photoshop.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.220
Well, we used Photoshop to
change the ground color.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.550
That's it.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.190
Imagine how to shoot things
like this just with one click.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.360
Yeah, it was not blue
but a gray background.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.560
Again, engineering the
light, very cool things.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.020
Motion-- one of the things
that I really enjoy to do

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.580
is stop motion photography.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.479
That's something, again, that
makes an impact on the viewer.

00:11:02.479 --> 00:11:04.020
Especially in
commercial photography,

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.930
that's what they're
looking for when they're

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.950
looking for a
photographer, somebody

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:13.060
who can make images that
really make an impact.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.490
This is one of
the things, again,

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.750
you can do motion and stop it.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.690
Another shot.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.734
All of the shots,
by the way, wasn't

00:11:20.734 --> 00:11:21.900
done for commercial clients.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.290
We did it for
lessons for Photigy,

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.630
for the online school that
we have, probably only one

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.420
in the world that really is
dedicated to studio still

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.430
life photography.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.910
Everything we do,
it's all there.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.230
This vase, for example,
it's like painting.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:45.030
So it's a shot of the
vase with strobe light.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:49.120
Within the same
click, with one click,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.030
we added light painting--
pure technical stuff.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.540
Magic, but it's all
about understanding how

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.870
light works and camera works.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.040
This is one click.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.090
Again, in Photoshop we
colored stems green.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.090
We made it in Photoshop.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:09.430
The rest was just
out of the camera.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.720
About camera, iPhone
versus Hasselblad--

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.970
who will guess where iPhone
shot, where is Hasselblad?

00:12:18.216 --> 00:12:20.200
And how?

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.630
Actually, this on the
right is a Hasselblad.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.320
On the left it's iPhone.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.080
You can only tell because
iPhone has a wide angle lens.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.790
On the Hasselblad, I used
probably 120 millimeters.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.040
IPhone it's like
30 or so, right?

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.810
And again, that's another proof
that it's all about lighting,

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.270
not about the camera.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.830
Here it is.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.080
It's iPhone shot behind
this [INAUDIBLE]-- simple.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.440
Yes, it's a special program.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.410
It's not built in
iPhone program,

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.140
but the program
let me to control

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:02.670
shutter speed and aperture,
but nothing fancy.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.250
OK, this is Photigy.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.160
This is where all is behind
the scenes happening.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.130
And the Show Time-- cool.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.480
We got in 15 minutes.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.490
This is how I look like when
I do splash photographer.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.360
So we're going and do some
product photography here

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.110
and some special
photography as well.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.160
I hope you're going to wear
some protective clothes.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.550
I brought paint,
and you'll be OK

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.520
if I'll be throwing
it to you, no?

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.400
OK, kidding.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.180
It's only water, but it
will be really stop motion.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:39.080
So let's do this.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.050
Colors are mostly done in
Photoshop, even with the paint.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.550
For example, for
Google, we tried

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.770
to use paint that were the
correct colors, of course,

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.785
but to match it really
to the Google logo,

00:13:52.785 --> 00:13:55.520
we did Photoshop
correction of the color.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.280
It's really easy.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.430
And of course, lots of
manipulation, as you've seen.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.650
OK, so you shouldn't
see anything.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.840
You didn't see anything.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:10.760
OK, product photography.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.950
Let's start from something
very, very simple.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.020
I brought some light.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.750
I brought a camera.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:21.660
And I have this little
Plexiglas piece.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:27.030
And actually, this is the
present from Cliff from Google,

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.820
which will work awesome for us.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.970
This is basically how you
do the simplest people

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.355
photography in the studio.

00:14:36.355 --> 00:14:39.790
You have your model,
and you have a light.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.920
And then you can put
something here, [INAUDIBLE],

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.940
maybe some books, maybe nothing.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.250
So let's do a shot.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.910
Let's try.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.290
Manual focus, by
the way, if anyone

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.010
is really interested in this.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.830
Of course, the tripod is
not the real tripod, OK?

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.040
This is not what
I use in studio.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.410
And we do a shot.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.090
So what do we have here?

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:12.510
Let me do a little crop so
you see a little bit better.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.780
OK, so when you see the subject,
you can recognize it, right?

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.220
You know that it's this
little android drone.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.510
OK, so if you had,
for example, a little

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:31.700
reflector from other side.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.540
It looks pretty nice.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.330
It's little bit overexposed--
OK, a little bit overexposed.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.880
But you understand
that this is not

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.490
going to change much
if we adjust the light.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.670
It still will be
the same subject.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.880
If it will be my face there,
you recognize that, hey,

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.770
Alex Koloskov is here.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:57.360
So if you want to impress
somebody with your still life

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.260
skill, I can shoot some product
or any still life, please

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.800
start-- or not please.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.060
It's kind advice, OK?

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.780
Start from that subject.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.010
Because this guy, it
diffuses reflected light.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:13.640
It's matte.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.681
That's what we call this.

00:16:14.681 --> 00:16:16.590
This surface is matte, OK?

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.620
And if we replace it with
something really recognizable--

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.560
I'm sure most of you, well,
all of you know what is is.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.900
This is a bottle of wine.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.200
You're going to put
it on the same place,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.260
maybe a little bit--
no, it's all good.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.550
And we do a shot.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.850
I didn't change anything.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.488
What is going on?

00:16:49.488 --> 00:16:52.180
AUDIENCE: We get to see
the shape of your lens.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.320
ALEX KOLOSKOV:
Where's the subject?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.500
Where it is?

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.850
If not the top of the
bottle, you probably

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.220
wouldn't really know that
this is the wine, right?

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.220
There is something.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.040
That's it.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.010
You see, I increased light
almost one stop, two times

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.920
brighter.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.440
It didn't help, except
the top of the bottle,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.550
because the only part which is
matte is on top of the bottle,

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.170
right?

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:23.329
So making light brighter
doesn't work here,

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.980
simply because it's
glossy, glossy subject.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.740
It reflects everything.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.920
It reflects our light.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.600
It's like a mirror,
right, but not flat.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.860
Tell me-- when you stand
in front of the mirror

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.490
and you don't see yourself
well, what do you do?

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.160
You put lots of
lights on the mirror?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.510
No, you light yourself.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.890
So here is the same thing.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.350
You cannot really
highlight the subject.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.400
You cannot put lots of
light and see something.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.090
You can only reflect
something in it.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.690
Let's see what we can reflect.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:02.935
Diffusers, right?

00:18:02.935 --> 00:18:04.600
You know diffusers probably.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.670
This is basically
semi-transparent,

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.160
translucent anything.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.110
This is plastic, for example.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:14.100
So let's do something
very simple.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.080
Boom, we start seeing
something, right?

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.160
We start seeing the shape of the
subject, little bit, not much.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.160
Make it a little bit brighter.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.840
So it's more like a
bottle now, right?

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.050
But still not really a bottle.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.490
If you don't know that bottle--
you don't see the shape,

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:35.830
you don't see that it's
really cylindrical.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.860
And now, as any
studio photographer,

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.560
I'm going to shape the light.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.500
I am going to create the shape
of this bottle on a diffuser

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.440
so it will be just reflected.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.750
So see what I will do.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.080
Just to be doing this.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.570
OK, I turn it off for a moment.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:19:04.940
I'm connecting other light, a
little bit more serious light

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.860
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.490
But the idea is the same.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.460
And you probably already know
what I'm going to use, right?

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.590
Softbox, or in this case
it's called strip box

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.790
because it's narrow.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.180
But basically it's softbox.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.220
Everyone knows
what's inside, right?

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.400
No?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.250
So it's a diffuser.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.150
You mount light on
this side, right?

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:31.330
This is special ring for special
type of lighting, [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:32.490
color, for example.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:39.450
And inside, you have this, OK?

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.880
It's a glossy box covered
with kind of foil.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:51.500
It has some diffuser inside and
one more diffuser on this edge.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:57.930
So the whole idea of all this
is to produce uniform feeling

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.500
of this surface.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.266
That's it.

00:20:02.266 --> 00:20:11.660
And when we mount in a light,
OK, let's see what will happen.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.290
I have a trigger.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.700
That's a very handy thing.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.480
OK, now we kind of start
seeing more, right?

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.330
It's more like a bottle.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:26.290
But still, the shape of the
bottle is not really visible.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.440
We can guess what kind
of shape of this bottle

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.200
is simply because we have
a one to one-- of course,

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.920
size has changed because
it's not a flat mirror,

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.570
but we have reflection
from this guy,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.260
from our diffuser [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.590
Three [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.560
Let's see if I will
add just the larger.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.150
This is the same
thing, larger softbox.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.511
What will happen?

00:20:50.511 --> 00:20:53.950
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:58.150
OK, we see more of
the bottle, much more.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:02.790
Now, what's the difference
between this and this

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.110
besides the shape of the light?

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:11.970
How do you know if your
subject is glossy or not

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.030
on the picture?

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.460
How do you know?

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.892
Does this look glossy?

00:21:16.892 --> 00:21:18.350
I can actually crop
it a little bit

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.820
so you see a little bit less.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.540
And this actually is a
little bit fallen inside,

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.620
but not a problem.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:34.670
So for me it
doesn't look glossy.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.430
This looks glossy.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.310
The previous shot is
not looking glossy.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.820
However, glossy, because it
reflects something bright,

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.640
we know it, but it
does not change shape.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.260
So we need to show the
shape of the bottle.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.090
It's cylindrical.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.900
Do you know when
you're drawing things

00:21:52.900 --> 00:22:00.060
how to make from a circle
to make a sphere, right?

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.870
You're creating shadow, maybe.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.360
You're creating some highlights.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.760
Basically it's a
gradient, right?

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.990
If it's a flat paper,
you're creating a gradient.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:15.910
And for us, it looks like, hey,
there is some 3D coming, right?

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.990
If takes them and
creates a shape.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.490
So I'm going to create
a gradient over here,

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.960
because I cannot
do it here, right?

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.900
For example, when it's matte--
remember our little guy?--

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.530
we have a gradient, like here.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.010
We have bright and darker areas.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.960
We see that it's a
cylinder, basically.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.360
It was not a problem,
but on the glossy stuff,

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.160
you don't see that
it's cylindrical.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.240
You cannot see it.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.230
So you need to create it here.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.489
This is what I'm going to do.

00:22:50.489 --> 00:22:51.780
I'm going to create a gradient.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.070
How do we do it?

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:59.750
If I touch diffuser with one
side of the light on the strip

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:03.440
box, it will be brighter.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.810
It will be sharp cut off
to the brighter area,

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:08.890
and then it will be
gradually, the brightness

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.170
will follow majorly, right?

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.110
So let me do this.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.950
You see how it tuned
the light a little bit?

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.068
And I do the shot.

00:23:20.068 --> 00:23:21.466
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:32.038
OK, we can do it
even more like this.

00:23:32.038 --> 00:23:33.529
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.800
OK, gradient-- this is
where it comes to the life.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.130
Depends on how good you are.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.880
When we create a
gradient, we start

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:53.460
seeing that, hey, that's
how gradient looked like.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.740
It's like half of the shape,
but it's tough, right?

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.380
It's like same as you
would paint this bottle.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:02.010
Now we just need to add
another side, right?

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.440
Kyrill, can you help me?

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.040
I'm going to ask
assistant for this shot.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.040
Kyrill, help me
to-- this is just

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.980
a piece of form core board.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.760
So white reflector,
not even diffuser.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.540
And Kyrill is going to
hold it from other side.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.180
Make it vertical and closer.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:25.940
Awesome.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.159
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:24:27.159 --> 00:24:28.450
Far away, a little bit farther.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:29.842
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:24:29.842 --> 00:24:31.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.390
OK, actually, the previous
shot is completely fine,

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:35.920
because you're going to crop it.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.140
It's easy to crop, right?

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.430
And he didn't touch the
subject, so it's fine.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.270
But you see what's happening.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.800
We start seeing the bottle, OK?

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.821
It turns really
kind of simple shot.

00:24:47.821 --> 00:24:48.320
Thank you.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.730
Thank you, Kyrill.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:57.040
Just showing you the approach
of how we shoot still life.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.770
We examine the subject.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.419
This is a simple
one, very simple.

00:25:00.419 --> 00:25:02.710
And I didn't finish, because
if you're going to finish,

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.790
we may miss some other stuff.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:10.170
Because, for example,
the bottom of the bottle,

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.330
what makes the reflection?

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.810
Do you know?

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.190
Now, the bottom, you
see it's not coming,

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:20.980
the reflection, from our
reflectors, diffusers.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.270
It's not coming all the way
to the bottom of the bottle.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.740
Exactly-- the table.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.050
So the whole process of
still life photography

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.860
is understanding where
the light or where

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.051
the reflection is coming from.

00:25:38.051 --> 00:25:39.300
So we just need to understand.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.080
I see so many times when
people are struggling to get,

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.160
for example, edge reflection
on something like this,

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.050
where to put light/
They put in light,

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.020
and it's not on the edge.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.990
Again, the whole idea is to
understand what do you see,

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.590
where your light is
reflecting, and where

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.570
to move your light, maybe,
to get edge reflection.

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:04.330
For example, where
now in the shape

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.450
should the light for
the edge reflection

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:10.103
be if you want to have
tiny edge on this?

00:26:10.103 --> 00:26:11.969
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:11.969 --> 00:26:12.760
ALEX KOLOSKOV: Top?

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.350
No, no, if edge on the side.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:19.290
On top, it will be like this.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.050
Let's play.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:25.010
I really love to play with
light, holding it like this.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.910
So on top, what did you get?

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.800
Of course, this surface
reflects something on top,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.820
nothing behind.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.360
And we start moving in behind.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.770
This is where it's
hitting the camera,

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.050
so we need to move it
away from the comma.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:49.300
This is where this edge
reflection is coming from.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.240
And you see I can
even shoot like this.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.460
It will be still edge
reflection because of the angle.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.850
It's a lot of reflection.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.310
Where is it?

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.180
Simple-- we just need
to understand how,

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.780
based on the shape of the
subject, where it's reflecting

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.900
and what it's reflecting.

00:27:10.169 --> 00:27:14.150
So this is why I love studio
still life photography.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:18.070
I can spend hours to
shoot complex subject.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.130
This is a simple one.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.260
When it has mix of glossy
, glass, transparent stuff,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:33.570
matte, the way that you
highlight it is-- it's like,

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.860
I don't know, like a maze.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:41.650
I mean, you can do a
lot and learn a lot,

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.520
while shooting this,
about the light.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.420
One more thing
just to test you--

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.460
how I fix this
reflection at the bottom,

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.670
how to make reflection
to go all the way

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.770
to the bottom of the bottle?

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.237
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:59.237 --> 00:28:00.278
ALEX KOLOSKOV: Say again?

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:02.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.550
ALEX KOLOSKOV: One thing,
correct-- so table,

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.660
because reflection from
the table is what we see.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.140
Another thing, if you
still want to-- well,

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.390
it's probably really the same.

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.400
What I do this
instead of moving,

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.262
I can move the
camera lower, right?

00:28:19.262 --> 00:28:21.595
You understand when we're
shooting something cylindrical

00:28:21.595 --> 00:28:24.130
a little bit from
the top, it reflects

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:25.640
at some point the table.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:33.400
If I move it almost like from
the bottom a little bit--

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:43.000
probably a little bit more--
you won't see the table

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.535
at some angle, of course.

00:28:44.535 --> 00:28:46.020
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.770
OK, so almost to the bottom.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.670
Just again, just
one of the examples

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.070
of how to deal with
all those reflections.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.280
Let's try to finish the shot.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.040
What we can do is this.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.770
We can put the background light.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:12.000
You know it when you
work with models.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.920
It's also one of
the coolest thing

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.030
is to separate your subject
from the background.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.730
And if subject is dark
and background is dark,

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:26.580
the only way to separate
it beside creating the edge

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.190
reflection, right,
the ring light,

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.420
is to just make a spot
on the background.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.430
So let's try to do this.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.860
Let's see how do you work.

00:29:39.632 --> 00:29:41.075
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:56.160
OK, again, cropping it, then
making a nice reflection.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.059
Let's see what will come.

00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:04.556
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:30:07.051 --> 00:30:08.710
OK, a little bit closer.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:11.030
You see what I'm doing?

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:15.450
If I want to remove the gap
on top of the bottle-- well,

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.560
I'm probably getting
too technical.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.580
Don't you think?

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.445
No?

00:30:19.445 --> 00:30:20.930
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:26.250
[CHUCKLES] Didn't get it yet.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:26.750
More.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.160
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.890
OK, almost.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.315
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:44.030
It looks my tripod-- this is
my new tripod for travel--

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:48.210
not made for Hasselblad,
and it's kind of floating.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:51.100
So let's finalize the shot.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:57.430
Please be my holder for the
reflector one more time.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:05.850
And now I rotated
bottle more to-- I

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.820
mean I rotated the
label, showing the label.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.810
And let's do a shot.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:13.370
OK.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:14.765
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:31:15.695 --> 00:31:18.030
Kyrill, a little bit further.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.941
It's little bit too much light.

00:31:20.941 --> 00:31:22.372
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.720
OK, so with two
lights probably is

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.430
the best way to shoot bottle.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:34.310
Of course, I would need
probably a third light

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:40.860
to make a little bit better
reflection for the label.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.770
But we're going to stop on this.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:48.936
Now I'll show you a little
bit of splash photography, OK?

00:31:48.936 --> 00:31:54.470
We're going to make-- I'm
going to put the glass.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.640
Because it's similar shape,
right, to the bottle,

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.880
the light hits the top of
this, which we kind of created.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:07.890
Should work for us, at
least at some point.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:12.950
One more thing that I see-- you
know about [INAUDIBLE], that

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:16.140
[INAUDIBLE], the
guy [INAUDIBLE] that

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.580
created this nice culture
of basically telling

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.460
behind the scenes,
they kind of set up

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.970
of how they took a picture.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:27.100
Usually it's portraiture
or some outdoors shot.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.220
And usually the
scene is like this,

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.340
one light on the right,
second light from top

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.100
or a little bit from
left, for example.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.650
And it's enough for
people to understand how

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:42.570
to take that type of portrait.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:48.180
With this light, you see how
little change of position

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.790
the diffuser or
light-- your light,

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:54.040
let's say-- changing the
angle, it affects pictures

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.160
so much that basically
there is no way

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.260
to memorize lighting setups
for still life photography.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.490
Yes, you can memorize
how I just shoot a bottle

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:05.160
and can actually
shoot it much better

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.680
but using the same technique.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.410
But if your bottle will
be not a straight cylinder

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:13.750
but a little bit like that--
you know what I'm saying?

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:15.220
It's not going to work.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.579
Well, you need to
modify the light

00:33:17.579 --> 00:33:19.370
on the top to make it
work for that bottle.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:23.520
If bottle is like spherical,
again, it's not going to work.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.610
The only thing to be successful
at still life photography

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:31.742
is to understand how light
comes through the camera, where

00:33:31.742 --> 00:33:33.950
it's coming from, what kind
of reflection do you see.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.990
Is it reflection or refraction?

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:40.610
For example, now you're going
to see some refraction probably,

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:41.110
right?

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.900
We can see through our subject.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:49.890
Let me replace it
with different gel.

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.970
Sometime it's cool to
have colored light.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:56.130
Again, one of those
emotional things

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.520
in still life
photography, one color

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.830
can help you to
bring some something.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:14.560
So, our glass-- and
let's have some magic.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:20.372
One of the magic comes
from fake things, as usual.

00:34:20.372 --> 00:34:22.330
In still life photography,
it's the same thing.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:23.514
This is fake ice.

00:34:23.514 --> 00:34:28.520
It's a beautiful
acrylic fake ice cubes.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:33.000
And well, you've probably seen
those advertisement pictures

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.070
with some alcohol,
probably with little glass

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:39.460
filled with alcohol
and the rocks, right?

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.000
So this is what they use.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.210
It's not real ice, because
it's going to melt,

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:47.000
and it's hard to
get it transparent.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.040
Here it's easy.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:54.360
One piece actually cost
$40-- just for you.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:59.872
So let's fill this
thing with the ice.

00:34:59.872 --> 00:35:01.321
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:14.615
OK, again, we can
try to add diffuser,

00:35:14.615 --> 00:35:18.480
because same as this bottle,
we see some sharp reflection.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.119
But again, this
looks already not bad

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.160
because it's transparent.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.160
It's semi-transparent.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.400
You can see something behind it.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.410
If you add thing
like this, maybe even

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:38.262
rotate a little bit, our glass,
we can get some better look,

00:35:38.262 --> 00:35:39.530
I would say.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:44.330
You see with gradient, it
kind of starts looking better,

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:47.980
especially if you make a
little bit closer look.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.360
This is sharp cut of line.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.065
You can see it, right?

00:35:52.065 --> 00:35:56.352
And the ice looks like this.

00:35:56.352 --> 00:35:59.935
AUDIENCE: Would you emphasize
the texture of the ice

00:35:59.935 --> 00:36:03.857
while minimizing the
glass reflection?

00:36:03.857 --> 00:36:05.690
ALEX KOLOSKOV: Well,
probably for this shot,

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:12.050
I would put the light
behind it, some spotlight

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.970
hitting it like this.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.740
On the glass, it will probably
make one little spot somewhere,

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.710
bright spot.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.230
If it will be a
sharp light, meaning

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:27.470
that it will be something
with honeycomb grid,

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:28.410
spotlight basically.

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.680
But on the ice,
because of the shape,

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:34.610
it will probably create lots
of interesting reflections,

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:35.690
refractions.

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:36.790
That's how we can see.

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:38.497
Is this what your question?

00:36:38.497 --> 00:36:38.996
OK.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.130
Now stop motion.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.944
It's almost time for
questions and answers.

00:36:45.944 --> 00:36:47.110
Do you guys have a question?

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:51.170
We do have things to
talk about when I'm done.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.110
Because we may shoot
for 15 minutes.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:55.970
Or we can, I don't know, shoot
for five and talk for ten.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:59.440
OK, I'll try to do it
as fast as possible.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.080
Let me do it simple.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.930
Let's do it simple.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.340
I need the thing in my hand.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:19.220
Usually in studio I may use
some special trigger that

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.810
is a trigger which can
be triggered by sound

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.900
or triggered by light,
meaning that if I have

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.170
some tiny light going
through this way

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:32.990
and throw liquid, when I
intersect that line of sight,

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:34.660
you know like in
garage door opener,

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.230
it will trigger the light.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:40.560
However, it's possible
to do it just with hand

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.940
if you have practice, of course.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:43.780
So how do you do it?

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.130
This way or that way?

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.806
OK, so I'll try.

00:37:49.806 --> 00:37:54.400
Oh, one thing to
make it more chances

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.786
to be successful
at this, I do this.

00:37:57.786 --> 00:38:00.350
Do you know what I did?

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:01.470
Exactly.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:06.280
Mirror flip, meaning that it
will-- I press it immediately

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.910
without any delay, take a shot.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.310
So mirror look up, right?

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:13.670
That's how it looks like.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:17.200
And let's try-- three, two, one.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.510
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:19.830
Boom.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.740
OK, so we got something.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.250
We got something, which
already looks emotional, right?

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.196
Ooh, I see.

00:38:25.196 --> 00:38:27.570
It's like this is one of the
things that easily can bring

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:31.530
emotion to the still life shot,
something which you cannot see

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:33.520
with the naked eye, right?

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.390
This is one of the
things that you usually

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:37.340
don't see in real life.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.100
Here we can freeze
it and see something.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.500
But let's examine it.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.450
Boom.

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:44.210
What is going on?

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:46.277
AUDIENCE: How fast
is it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:46.277 --> 00:38:47.360
ALEX KOLOSKOV: One second.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.000
You see it's blurry.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.762
It's all blurry.

00:38:50.762 --> 00:38:51.470
I had it focused.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:52.620
What's going on?

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.330
It's motion blur.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.360
And, well, I have--
what's the shutter speed?

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.840
1/100 of a second.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.920
I can go up to 800 of a second,
but it's not going to help,

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.510
because with high
speed photography,

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.820
we're freezing motion
not with the shutter,

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.250
at least in studio,
but with the light.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.760
Because without
light, this picture

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.520
will be completely dark.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.930
Take a look at this.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.870
I just took a picture.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:25.690
Here, what we see with ambient
light on given exposure

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.280
is dark.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.690
There are very few highlights
from the spots of light.

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:32.690
So the only light that
we have is our strobe.

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:37.800
And if strobe impulse
will be short enough,

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.190
top camera will capture
only the time when it fires.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.920
So the whole idea
is to, in our case,

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.440
change the mode of the strobe
from normal kind of color,

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.510
constant color, to high speed.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.570
[INAUDIBLE] can do it.

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.390
ProPhoto can do it.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.310
Paul C. Buff Einstein can do it.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:59.360
Speedlights immediately have
it, all the speedlights,

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.840
battery-powered
little speedlights,

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.680
various shot [INAUDIBLE]
and lower power settings.

Again, if you want to
learn more about this,

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.660
Photigy is the answer.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.470
So let me do this, minimum.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:18.380
So it went from 1/1,700 of a
second to 1/5,600 of a second,

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.000
this light and same
for this light.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.820
Oh, actually this
light is good as well.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:27.420
It's already
1/6,000 of a second.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.990
And let's do this shot again.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.469
OK, will we be lucky this time?

[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.750
Well, sort of.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:48.160
Let's try to do a few more.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.460
Because it's interesting
that this flash photography,

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.970
when you throw in the
liquids, technical side

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.750
usually is very easy,
once you get it,

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:58.030
kind of how to set up light.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:01.140
You put some light
modifiers for the subject.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.080
It's all easy.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.430
The hardest part and probably
the most interesting part

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.510
is the shape in the splash.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:11.180
Because everyone can
do like I just did.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:14.760
But to do that Google
and things that you

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.380
will see in my portfolio,
it takes so much time

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:22.504
to just train your hand to
throw something interesting.

00:41:22.504 --> 00:41:23.170
Well, it's cool.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.640
It's almost like a painting.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.330
You paint, and looks like crap.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:27.600
You paint again and crap.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.370

and do it again and again.

things in a focus plane.

You understand if I throw in
this way, part of the splash

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:48.750
may be out of focus, because
this is our focus in plane,

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.460
right?

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.356

bit out of focus,

blur where things are in focus.

little bit too bright for this.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:31.914
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:36.306
Ooh, even better.

00:43:36.306 --> 00:43:37.770
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:43:40.015 --> 00:43:40.515
Meh.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.280
I want to fly it on top.

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.596
Yeah, like this.

00:43:48.596 --> 00:43:49.720
And then I want to heat it.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.105
And it will be last shot,
because bottle is gone.

00:43:53.105 --> 00:43:54.440
[CAMERA CLICKS]

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.220
OK, whatever-- almost.

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.240
Thank you.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.160
All right, so now it hit, right?

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.465
We did it.

00:44:04.465 --> 00:44:07.520
We did it on this side.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.760
Yeah, not really visible.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.520
But we did it.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.770
But all this flying liquid
can look really nice

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:22.180
when it's in the frame.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:30.240
OK, this is, in short, how all
still life commercial studio

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.050
photography looks like.

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:37.060
Photographers sit in quiet
environment, usually,

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.300
with very few people around,
and can spend hours or days

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.140
sometimes to get
something really nice.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:45.970
It was like this,
but then Photoshop

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:50.250
came to the game, then
3D Max and all this

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:55.340
to where now you
either can spend time

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.090
shooting it and
making the light,

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:03.860
or you can just grab one light,
hold it, shoot several walking

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.820
around the subject, so we
have all kind of reflections,

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.490
and then put them together in
Photoshop, composing the shot,

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:13.290
and erasing some parts, so
it's kind of really crazy.

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:17.660
And there is no right
or wrong way to do it.

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.910
That's it.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:19.800
Any questions?

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.800
Let's talk about.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.276
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:22.276 --> 00:45:22.776
Thank you.

00:45:22.776 --> 00:45:28.499
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:28.499 --> 00:45:29.040
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.980
Sorry, you may have mentioned
this early, but what

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.180
shutter speed are you using?

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.950
Because when I've tried to do
anything with motion before,

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:38.141
I feel like the sync speed
limitation of like 200 or 250

00:45:38.141 --> 00:45:39.140
gets in the way of this.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.011
So I'm curious.

00:45:40.011 --> 00:45:41.760
Is this because you're
using a Hasselblad,

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.714
or are you just using
a regular sync speed?

00:45:44.714 --> 00:45:45.880
ALEX KOLOSKOV: OK, I got it.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.290
So it's about X-sync
speed of the camera.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:52.550
Hasselblad has a lift
shutter, and that's

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:55.990
why X-sync speed is equal to the
maximum shutter speed, actually

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:57.500
1/800 of a second.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.480
For DSLR, it's not the
case, in most cases.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.520
And with DSLR, we shoot
at [INAUDIBLE] speed.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.530
Usually it's around
1/200 of a second.

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:11.032
And it's not a problem, because
shutter stays open for 1/200

00:46:11.032 --> 00:46:12.240
of a second, completely open.

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.100
You understand the difference
between X-sync and faster?

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.740
If, let's say, you shoot 1/4,000
of a second shutter speed,

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:24.491
shutter is not going to open and
close for 1/4,000 of a second.

00:46:24.491 --> 00:46:24.990
No.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:26.280
It's not working this way.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.890
It will make a
little gap and move

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:33.822
this gap across the
frame, exposing it,

00:46:33.822 --> 00:46:35.530
like line by line, basically.

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:39.500
That's how it creates 1/4,000
of a second, for example,

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.770
shutter speed effective.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:44.990
But in reality, it
moves much longer time.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:48.800
So X-sync, it's the shot
on the fastest shutter

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.780
speed when it opens completely.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.370
When it opens,
that's what we need.

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:55.865
We can use high speed strobe.

00:46:55.865 --> 00:46:56.740
It can be speedlight.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.790
The least expensive is
adjust the speedlight.

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:04.790
If you put your speedlight into
1/4 of full power, or less,

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:09.120
but not more, it will give you
about a 1/4,000 of a second,

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.590
T 0.1.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.610
I'm not going to talk
about these technical ways

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:13.670
of measuring.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:16.110
Basically it will give you
really short flash duration.

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:18.310
Like this, we have 1/6,000
of a second, right,

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:19.270
with those lights.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:20.970
So this would freeze it.

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.860
And we shoot at X-sync speed.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:27.440
Again, I don't have DSLR, but
if I would shoot with the same

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.620
light on the top with
1/8,000 of a second,

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.250
I will get just little--
actually, it will be like this.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.210
Little part of our
frame is highlighted.

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:38.510
The rest will be completely
dark because it's

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:40.604
behind the curtain.

00:47:40.604 --> 00:47:41.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.390
The tool you're using
to like throw the water,

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:46.160
it seems like-- can
you talk about that?

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.730
Like how it shapes the
water you're throwing?

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.810
ALEX KOLOSKOV: Yeah, this
is patented technology.

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:53.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.880
It's a funnel.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.670
I kind of stuck some
sort of playdough.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:03.820
So it's not-- it works as a cap.

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.920
But yeah, in throwing
splashes, the shape

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.590
of the things that you have
liquid on, it's very-- well,

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:14.120
it's changed the shape a lot.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.450
But the thing I can
easily do, C-shaped

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:20.700
splashes-- I didn't do it
because it's a tight frame.

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.420
But I was experimenting.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.960
There are so many things
that you can put the liquid

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.080
and throw it.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.650
I don't know-- did
you see it or not?

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:30.800
I don't have it much here.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.160
I'm going to show you later.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.010
Like I have a splash where three
colors collide and kind of mix

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:36.760
in.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.390
And it wasn't for the shot.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:41.850
It was real, three colors
filled with something

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:45.220
like this, where I divided
it by 3 sections, three

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.250
different colors of paint.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.410
I throw it, and in the
air it's really nice.

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:55.230
So it's about shaping
the splash, partway.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:56.670
AUDIENCE: What
liquids do you use

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:01.300
for colors and a
matte like splashes,

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.790
rather than transparent
glossy water?

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:06.380
ALEX KOLOSKOV: Oh,
what dye, what ink?

00:49:09.338 --> 00:49:11.190
We either use already mixed.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:14.140
If it's something that
should be non-transparent,

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.770
we use just paint, latex
paint, acrylic paint,

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:18.290
different colors.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:22.130
But if we need something
transparent, semi-transparent,

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:27.570
we use just food coloring
in any grocery store.

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:28.480
It should be clear.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.020
There are different ones.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.290
Clear is better.

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:35.577
And in addition to
this, sometimes you

00:49:35.577 --> 00:49:38.230
need to change viscosity
of your liquid.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.846
And if you want it to be like
water-like, it's a secret,

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:42.470
but I love you.

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:44.480
We use glycerin.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.865
Glycerin you can buy
a very big can of it.

00:49:47.865 --> 00:49:50.600
It's relatively non-expensive
compared to what

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.570
you can buy, in pharmacies.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:56.270
And you mix it with
water, and you can kind of

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:57.790
get any viscosity.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:01.820
You can have thicker, thinner,
just based on the ratio.

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:05.910
AUDIENCE: In some of the shots
in your portfolio on the web,

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:10.770
there were almost surfaces
of water or liquid

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:13.960
where they were apparently
lit from both below and above.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.060
Is that just the strip light
spanning the difference,

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.920
or do you have more complex
lighting configurations

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.710
for some of these?

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:25.170
ALEX KOLOSKOV: When liquid
is like a sphere, right?

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:26.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.500
ALEX KOLOSKOV: OK, we throw
it, and it gets this way.

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.030
And that we did actually
on this workshop

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:35.360
that we had here in
California first time.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.810
When we have enough
room, you can throw,

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:41.240
and if liquid is thick
enough, you can throw it,

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:46.307
it will fly like something
without any form,

00:50:46.307 --> 00:50:48.390
and then at some point--
you've probably seen it--

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:51.050
when you throw liquid,
let's say from second floor,

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:53.950
it flies, flies, flies,
and then it bursts, right?

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:59.560
You've seen this effect like if
you put like bucket of liquid.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.840
Before it happens,
before it bursts,

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.200
it starts inflating
like balloons itself.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.890
So it starts going like this.

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:11.000
And if you catch the moment when
liquid goes-- just before it

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.100
bursts, that's what happens.

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:16.840
That's what we do.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.950
It's truly amazing, techniques,
what you can do with motion.

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:23.192
AUDIENCE: So how
do you get started

00:51:23.192 --> 00:51:24.275
with splash photographing?

00:51:24.275 --> 00:51:27.350
Where's the minimal
setup you need?

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.010
ALEX KOLOSKOV: Speedlights.

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:30.610
I have one speedlight.

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:32.690
You can start with
splash photography.

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:33.550
Let me tell you.

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:35.549
The fastest way to start
with splash photography

00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:36.900
is just one speedlight.

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:39.390
Have a white background,
white wall, whatever.

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:44.740
Put that speedlight-- put
some honeycomb grid on it,

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:48.760
better around it so it
will have great spot, OK?

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:53.100
Put the glass in front so
it's enough for the glass,

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:58.981
for example, to have only one
light to be on the background.

00:51:58.981 --> 00:52:00.230
And it will be visible, right?

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:01.747
Because it's transparent.

00:52:01.747 --> 00:52:02.330
I'll show you.

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:11.040
One demonstration is
worth 1,000 words, right?

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:14.640
Well, it's a little bit too
dark, but this is the idea.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.620
Do a setup like
this with one light.

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:24.730
And then throw
something on the glass.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.620
You will see my splash.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.090
This is technically.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:30.170
I don't know-- did you
ask about business side?

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:32.750
In business, you need
to do a lot [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:37.024
with something really cool
and start reaching out.

00:52:37.024 --> 00:52:38.940
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
so we're out of time.

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.170
Let's thank Alex again
for this presentation.

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:45.420
[APPLAUSE]
