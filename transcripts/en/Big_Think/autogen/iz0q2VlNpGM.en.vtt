the most interesting thing is that it's
changed unevenly so you have this huge

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
changed unevenly so you have this huge
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.909

educated folks who are middle class and
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.740
educated folks who are middle class and
upper middle class but then for people

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
upper middle class but then for people
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.800
upper middle class but then for people
who aren't for people who you know have

that has all kinds of implications for
 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.530
that has all kinds of implications for
reinforcing class divides and I think of

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540
reinforcing class divides and I think of
 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.940
reinforcing class divides and I think of
that as a really big problem but of

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950
that as a really big problem but of
 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.920
that as a really big problem but of
course there's another problem of this

that we're living in a world in which
 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:26.690
that we're living in a world in which
you know you have this so-called global

global labor glut we're living in very

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
global labor glut we're living in very
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.429
global labor glut we're living in very
different circumstances yet again our

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
different circumstances yet again our
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.109

institutions haven't evolved quickly

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
institutions haven't evolved quickly
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.649
institutions haven't evolved quickly
enough to accommodate that and that I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
enough to accommodate that and that I
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.599
enough to accommodate that and that I
think of as a real threat to the

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609
think of as a real threat to the
 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.030
think of as a real threat to the
American working class

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040
 
 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.850
 
I definitely think that the interests of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860
I definitely think that the interests of
 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.250
I definitely think that the interests of
business and the working class could be

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260
business and the working class could be
 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.620
business and the working class could be
aligned but you know it's very

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630
aligned but you know it's very
 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.110
aligned but you know it's very
complicated because for example you're

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120
complicated because for example you're
 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.610
complicated because for example you're
looking at an environment in which when

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620
looking at an environment in which when
 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.960
looking at an environment in which when
you look at corporate profits they were

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970
you look at corporate profits they were
 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.640

where there are lots of attractive

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550
where there are lots of attractive
 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.400
where there are lots of attractive
investment opportunities whereas when

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410
investment opportunities whereas when
 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.800
investment opportunities whereas when
you're looking at the american workforce

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
you're looking at the american workforce
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.690
you're looking at the american workforce
there are a lot of liabilities there are

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700
there are a lot of liabilities there are
 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.219
there are a lot of liabilities there are
a lot of liabilities and all first world

workforces given that you know you have

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700
workforces given that you know you have
 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.940
workforces given that you know you have
an older age profile you have a skilled

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950
an older age profile you have a skilled
 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.770
an older age profile you have a skilled
profile that oftentimes isn't quite as

resilient so I think that that is a way

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050
resilient so I think that that is a way
 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.260
resilient so I think that that is a way
in which it appears as though those two

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270
in which it appears as though those two
 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.640
in which it appears as though those two
interests have diverged to some degree

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650
interests have diverged to some degree
 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.760
interests have diverged to some degree
at the same time I think that you know

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770
at the same time I think that you know
 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.230
at the same time I think that you know
it's useful to think of these things

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240
it's useful to think of these things
 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.940
it's useful to think of these things
that's not entirely separate because

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950
that's not entirely separate because
 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.290
that's not entirely separate because
again members of the American working

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300
again members of the American working
 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.020
again members of the American working
class start businesses and I think would

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030
class start businesses and I think would
 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.910
class start businesses and I think would
start more businesses if you had an

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920
start more businesses if you had an
 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.140
start more businesses if you had an
environment that was more conducive to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150
environment that was more conducive to
 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.330
environment that was more conducive to
grassroots entrepreneurship when you

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
grassroots entrepreneurship when you
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.520
grassroots entrepreneurship when you
look at China they have this kind of

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530
look at China they have this kind of
 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.050
look at China they have this kind of
interesting dilemma where in the 80s

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060
interesting dilemma where in the 80s
 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.910
interesting dilemma where in the 80s
they had you know very rapid economic

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920
they had you know very rapid economic
 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.580
they had you know very rapid economic
growth just as they did post the 80s yet

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590
growth just as they did post the 80s yet
 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.380
growth just as they did post the 80s yet
then it was very broad-based you saw a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390
then it was very broad-based you saw a
 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.240
then it was very broad-based you saw a
lot of in rural areas and it was fueled

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250
lot of in rural areas and it was fueled
 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.800
lot of in rural areas and it was fueled
by grassroots entrepreneurship whereas

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810
by grassroots entrepreneurship whereas
 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.729
by grassroots entrepreneurship whereas
since then it's been fueled by

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739
since then it's been fueled by
 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.080
since then it's been fueled by
state-owned enterprises and foreign

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090
state-owned enterprises and foreign
 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.120

direct investment in America we have a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130
direct investment in America we have a
 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.400
direct investment in America we have a
similar thing where if you don't create

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410
similar thing where if you don't create
 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.570
similar thing where if you don't create
an environment that's conducive to

and failing starting new businesses then

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580
and failing starting new businesses then
 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.710
and failing starting new businesses then
you actually have situation where you

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720
you actually have situation where you
 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.390
you actually have situation where you
know people are at the mercy of kind of

and productivity games that we actually
