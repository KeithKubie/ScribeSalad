00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:09.730
JOANNA: Hey, everybody
I'm Joanna Smith,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.900
and I work on Google+.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.790
WOLFF: And I'm Wolff Dobson.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.640
I work on Android.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.130
And today, we're going to talk
about Google I/O Hunt, which

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.800
is the game that we made
for Google I/O 2013.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.910
We've just open sourced it.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.360
It's at NFCHunt.appspot.com.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.120
And we want to tell you about
what the game is and then how

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.380
you can make your own.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.190
So the game is actually easier
to show than it is to

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.430
demonstrate right here.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.250
So we're going to a clip of
Joanna and I playing this game

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.270
on the Google campus.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.410
To put up an NFC hunt,
we hide NFC tags

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.760
in interesting places.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.060
The hunt's now set up, so Joanna
is going to be our

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.800
guinea pig.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.380
JOANNA: What I have here
is I've opened the app.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.850
And it's welcoming me, and
I'm going through it.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.080
And I'm getting to find
out the story.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.730
Now I've got Google+
sign-in option.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.460
So I'm going to go ahead
and sign in.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.450
So the first thing is
I've got a clue.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.000
And it's got an image as well
as text, letting me

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.140
know where to go out.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.560
And since I happen to work on
this floor, I know the floor

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.140
pretty well.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.690
So let's take a look at where
I think this area might be.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.790
And I was right.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.100
So I can immediately
see a clue.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.410
This is exactly what I want.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.470
So I'm going to take
my NFC device.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.470
Let's scan it.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.990
[PHONE CHIMES]

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.340
And I got a [INAUDIBLE], which
means I found the first clue.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.935
But what's really cool is I
can actually scan these--

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:28.380
[PHONE CHIMES]

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.630
JOANNA: --in any order and
they're going to show up.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.900
So that's pretty awesome.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.216
We usually have one or two that
are easy to find and one

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:36.880
that's kind of hard.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.650
Wolff!

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.970
[PHONE CHIMES]

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.010
JOANNA: Oh, and I got them
all, so I get to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.471
go to the next clue.

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:46.130
The picture is a slide.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.234
And that's part of my favorite
part of the floor.

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:49.626
So let's go down the slide.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.180
Here I go!

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:04.108
Yes.

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:05.080
All right.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.199
So let's get the app back up,
because I already see a clue.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.220
And sure enough, once again
any order I can scan them.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.340
And look, two more.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.662
They're so easy.

00:02:15.662 --> 00:02:19.000
So I've got the second one
and the third one--

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.082
[PHONE CHIMES]

00:02:20.082 --> 00:02:21.325
JOANNA: What?

00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:22.685
This is a fake tag!

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:25.480
So this is a feature that we
added that's really fun.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.860
Because you can throw people off
the scent and have decoy

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.260
tags all over the place.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.180
And then you bring up
this little guy.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.890
So let's find the
last real clue.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.370
There it is.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.020
So now you can see, once
again, I'm going

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.140
to get a new clue.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.650
And I know where the sign is.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.170
But unfortunately, I think
we're out of time.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.430
So let's go back
to the studio.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.150
So that was our video.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.980
A little cheesy, but obviously
really fun.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.390
And you can set up the game
yourself in a number of ways--

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.220
set it up as a race,
or in teams.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.230
It's pretty cool.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.060
But in order to make these
changes, you need to actually

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.900
see it run and see
how it works.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.990
So Wolff?

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.560
WOLFF: All right.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.270
So as you can see, we have
this intro section here.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.330
And you'll want to modify that
with your own text, because

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.400
you're not actually
going to be on the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.780
floor of Moscone Center.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.320
So we're going to
import the two

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.470
products that you download.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.030
Or actually, three projects.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.510
We get Simple I/O Hunt.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.100
You get Hunt Writer,
which writes tags.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.490
And you get I/O Hunt.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.900
I/O Hunt is the full version
of the game that includes

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.900
trivia questions, Google+ sign
in, game services, all the

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.010
things you need.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.110
We're going to do Simple I/O
Hunt, which is the same thing,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.890
except without the trivia
questions and so forth.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.130
And we're going to
import that.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.150
And you can modify all those
strings and assets and

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.050
everything inside the
resources directory.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.800
In particular, you can
modify the strings.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.690
You can see we have lots
of strings in here.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.140
All the story strings, you can
edit them any way you want.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.730
And if I run this, you
get the game running.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.950
And it's kind of fun.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.190
I click Let's Go.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.020
JOANNA: So if we take a look at
the screen, now that we've

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.790
got past the story and actually
started playing the

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.180
game, you'll see this image.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.450
And this image is part of
the clue, letting you

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.660
know where to go.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.960
The text might help
you get there.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.670
And the picture helps
people remember, oh

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.550
wait, I've seen that.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.970
I know where to go now.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.810
And once they get there, they're
going to find tags.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.500
We do three tags in the game.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.899
And the tags are actually what
you need to scan in order to

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.000
move onto the next clue.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.350
WOLFF: Right.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.860
And so if we were to scan these
tags right now you just

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.750
hold it up and go,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.410
[PHONE CHIMES]

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.420
WOLFF: B-dink.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.210
But these tags are empty,
because we haven't written

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.395
anything to them yet.

00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:35.600
This tag in particular
came from Coveo.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.140
They're custom printed
with our own labels.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.310
They've got this
big scan area.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.900
They're pretty neat.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.250
But they're only write once.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.580
Which means basically, when
you write them, you

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.500
can only write 1s.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.010
You can't write 0s.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.990
Joanna, do we have another
kind of tag?

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.920
Which is this little
round guy here.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.810
This one's an all-weather one
that we got from Tagstand.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.110
It's rewritable, which
means you can

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.140
write it several times.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.650
Which is great if you're
experimenting.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.480
It's not so good if somebody's
attacking your tags and trying

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.230
to change them in the
middle of the hunt.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.050
This one's also shielded, which
means you can put it

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.780
against metal.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.350
These ones aren't shielded,
so you have a

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.460
little bit more careful.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.750
So going back to where we were,
the game itself has any

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.270
number of tabs between
one and three.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.510
And when you scan them,
you're finding them.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.330
And when you scan all three,
you'll go on to the next clue.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.960
You'll obviously want
to change that.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.650
So we're going to show you how
to change this screen just

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.380
using data.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.170
So if we open up this JSON file,
we have a hunt object,

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.640
which contains a
list of clues.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.490
So a clue has this
display text.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.920
In this case, it's saying,
go find this robot.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.680
It's got an image, which we'll
show you how to add.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.380
And then it's got
a list of tags.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.590
And the tags can be any
arbitrary string.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.950
I have them numbered because
that's easier to remember.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.250
We also have a trivia
question.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.250
If you're playing the full
version of the game, this

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.980
question is there.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.526
If you're not using the full
version of the game, it'll let

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.350
us ignore this question
and keep going.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.900
And so we have another
clue down here.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.220
This one only has
one tag to find.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.820
It's pretty straightforward.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.720
All you have to do is make sure
that you have unique tag

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.150
names for each thing and
that you set the

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.380
text the way you want.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.960
Now, this JSON file ends up
inside your app inside the raw

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.670
directory inside a zip file.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.710
What's in that zip file?

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.393
Let's take a look.

00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:23.680
If we look inside Hunt Data, you
can see it's a series of

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.730
images and this JSON file.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.860
And it's actually not showing
the extension, but trust me,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.540
it has the extension .json.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.560
If I wanted to add another one,
say, off my desktop here.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.650
I have this picture of
this cool robot.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.840
You just add it here.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.930
And then you'll need
to package it

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.050
up when you're done.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.260
To packaging it up, if you have
a UNIX-based machine, you

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.325
can just run our little
Make Bundle script.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.320
Whoosh.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.600
And you get a zip file,
which is just the

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.230
contents of that thing.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.520
And Make [? Level ?]

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.220
just copies it into
the right place.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.010
So let's assume we've
done that.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.170
We've added the zip files.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.440
Now we need to write tags.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.980
It comes with this utility
Hunt Writer.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.270
And we can pull that
in as well.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.380
And you can compile
it yourself.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.310
You need to compile your own
Hunt Writer, because it's

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.530
going to have its own unique
hunt.zip in it.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.110
That's part of it.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.080
So we're going to
pull that in.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.820
Grab Hunt Writer.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.970
And there we have it.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.360
Hunt Writer, when it's running,
looks like this.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.870
Oh, right.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.792
And again, you're going to put
that hunt.zip inside raw.

00:07:34.792 --> 00:07:36.500
You can put it right there.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.520
This is what it looks like.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.590
You can tell we spent
hours and hours and

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.950
hours on that UI.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.250
[LAUGHS]

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.510
But if I want to write a tag,
I'm going to click there.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.880
I just select it and then--

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.770
[PHONE CHIMES]

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:48.440
WOLFF: Doink.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.000
I've created a tag.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.880
We've got to do that a couple
more times, for each one of

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.030
these tags.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.780
Come on.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.680
Scan.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.490
You're my best friend.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.250
[PHONE CHIMES]

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.000
WOLFF: There you go.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.480
I'm not going to--

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.180
You want me to write--

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.510
JOANNA: You can write
my hand if you want.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.830
WOLFF: Sure.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.180
I'll totally write it.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.500
We're going to write
Joanna, too.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.140
[PHONE CHIMES]

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.890
WOLFF: And actually, that's
a fun thing you can do.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.140
You don't have to just stick
tags to the walls like we did

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.280
in the video.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.630
During Google I/O,
Colt actually

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.780
wore a tag for awhile.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.880
People had to chase around
and find him.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.940
So you can have lot
of fun with this.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.390
So we've written these tags.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.920
But the question is, what
did we actually

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.850
write to these tags?

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:23.590
We can check.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.160
We have Tag Info up here,
which is an app you can

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.630
download the Play store.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.090
I scanned this tag.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:34.080
And it says, "you have NDEF
data." What is that NDEF data?

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.220
It's a URI.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.830
So what we're basically
doing is just

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.010
writing a URI to a tag.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.309
Then you scan that tag, it
gets caught by the intent

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:44.640
filter on the app.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.440
And I've actually got the
intent filter up here.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.100
You can see, it says, when you
find an NDEF thing, and that

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.600
NDEF has https and the
URL of our site.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.330
And it's also looking
for path prefix f.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.000
If you look over here,
we have the f--

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.890
it's basically "f" for find--

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.160
equals clue dev4good-0.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.400
So dev4good-0 is the tag
that we just wrote.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.010
So that's what's on the tag.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.120
It's just a URI.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.920
Now, we can actually play the
game using these tags that we

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.150
just wrote.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.320
So we have it up.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.080
Scan it.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.680
Scan it.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.860
[PHONE CHIMES]

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.670
And you can see it's filling
in the little dog prints.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.170
And when we find all three
of them, it takes

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.870
us to the next clue.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.780
And the next clue is the
big green Google sign.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.610
So that's the game.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.320
What you're going to be doing,
then, is going around, taking

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.700
pictures of the places that you
want people to go, then

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.410
adding them to your hunt.zip.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.860
You're going to be then writing
a whole bunch of tags

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.180
for each one of those places
and then hiding the tags.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.850
JOANNA: And what we noticed when
we were setting this us

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.380
is if you have one really
obvious tag, it let's people

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.690
know they made it to
the right place.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.920
And the other two can be
hidden a little higher

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.200
difficulty to make the
search more fun.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.160
So one easy, two hard worked
out pretty well.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.980
WOLFF: We also have
one Easter egg.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.030
If you have a tag that's written
with the same URIs,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.820
everything else, but the tag
name is Decoy, you get this.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.340
[PHONE CHIMES]

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:19.930
WOLFF: Oh no!

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.610
TOGETHER: It's a decoy!

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.510
WOLFF: And that can
be a surprise.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.500
We put that later in the hunt.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.200
When people ran along and found
it, they were like, oh

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.710
my gosh, it's a decoy.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.070
So that's the whole thing.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:34.000
You could also try running them
in the full experience,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.040
which has trivia questions.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.380
But otherwise, it's
open source.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.330
We invite you guys take a look,
try making your own

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.383
hunts, and playing
it yourself.

00:10:42.383 --> 00:10:42.736
JOANNA: Good.

00:10:42.736 --> 00:10:43.986
Have a great day.
