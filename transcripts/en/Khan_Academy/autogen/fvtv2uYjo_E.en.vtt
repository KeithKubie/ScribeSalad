00:00:00.284 --> 00:00:02.989
 Let's see if we can calculate 5/6 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:05.392
 Plus 1/4, and to help 

00:00:05.392 --> 00:00:08.713
 I have a visual representation of 5/6 

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:11.360
 And visual representation of 1/4 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.425
 Note I have a complete unit 

00:00:14.425 --> 00:00:15.156
 I think you can say 

00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:18.686
 He divided into one, two, three, four, five, six 

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:21.124
 Sections, and we have five of them shaded 

00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:22.889
 Thus this represents 5/6 

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.955
 Also we have below the other complete unit 

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:28.252
 We have one shaded section of the four sections 

00:00:28.252 --> 00:00:30.992
 Thus this represents 1/4, now we want to collect the fractions 

00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:32.688
 I encourage you at any time to turn off the video 

00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:35.218
 To see if you can find out for yourself 

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:37.552
 Well, every time we collect fractions we have to think 

00:00:37.552 --> 00:00:40.060
 Do these fractions have the same place 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.521
 It is clear that these two fractions do not have the same place 

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:45.052
 But in order to re-write their common denominator 

00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:48.059
 We just have to think about the common multiplier for six and four 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.322
 Ideally, consider the smaller common multiplier for six and four 

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:52.993
 The way I prefer it to do that is 

00:00:52.993 --> 00:00:55.826
 To take the larger number of them, which is the number six 

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:57.858
 And then think about its complications 

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.925
 I think of the first six 

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:02.188
 Obviously, the six are divisible by six 

00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:06.461
 The six are indivisible on the four, and now let us multiply it 

00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:09.634
 By number two, we will get number 12 

00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:12.960
 12 can be divided into six and four 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.420
 So 12 is the best common place here 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.195
 12 is the yellow multiplier of the six and four 

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:22.260
 Thus we can rewrite the fractions as numbers 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.723
 On 12 

00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:26.184
 Thus the number on the 12 

00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:28.589
 Plus number 

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:32.653
 On 12 

00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:34.789
 Equal 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.519
 Now, there are a range of ways to address them 

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:39.015
 But what I want to do is to see it here 

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.581
 In this drawing 

00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:43.288
 So if you go 

00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:45.482
 Or if I had to turn from 

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:47.792
 If I had to move from six equal sections 

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:50.486
 To 12 section is equal, which is what I do 

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:52.552
 If you go from six in the place to 12 

00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:53.957
 In the place 

00:01:53.957 --> 00:01:57.127
 I will multiply all these sections by 

00:01:57.127 --> 00:01:59.553
 Or, I will multiply the number of sections 

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:00.923
 Which I have number two 

00:02:00.923 --> 00:02:03.826
 Or I will take each of these sections 

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:05.788
 I convert it into two parts 

00:02:05.788 --> 00:02:07.251
 let's do it 

00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:08.551
 let's do it 

00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:12.684
 Let me see if I can do this accurately 

00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:16.422
 I can do a little better than that 

00:02:16.422 --> 00:02:18.419
 So it will look 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.091
 And , 

00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:21.415
 Oh 

00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:23.656
 Let me do this 

00:02:23.656 --> 00:02:26.790
 I want to divide it fairly evenly 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.320
 I'm doing it so given it would not be perfect 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.723
 And we also have this 

00:02:32.723 --> 00:02:34.917
 Then finally and not 

00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:36.250
 Last but not least 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.354
 And then notice 

00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:41.790
 I had six sections but now I have twice as many 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.417
 sections 

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:45.088
 You converted the six sections to 12 sections by conversion 

00:02:45.088 --> 00:02:48.420
 Each of the six basic sections into two, so I have 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.392
 One, two, three, four 

00:02:51.392 --> 00:02:54.492
 Five, six, seven, eight 

00:02:54.492 --> 00:02:58.892
 Nine, Ten, Eleven, 12 Section 

00:02:58.892 --> 00:03:01.585
 If I have 12 departments, how many of these twelve 

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:02.955
 They are now shady 

00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:04.975
 Instead of having five shaded sections of six, I now have 

00:03:04.975 --> 00:03:08.493
 Ten shaded sections of 12 

00:03:08.493 --> 00:03:10.722
 Thus, I now have 10/12 

00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:13.787
 5/6 is considered as 10/12 

00:03:13.787 --> 00:03:15.390
 There is another way to think about it 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.547
 They are moving from six to 12, beating in two 

00:03:18.547 --> 00:03:20.556
 Then I have to do the same thing in the rugs 

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:22.959
 Five in two equals ten 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.991
 It is hoped to see that these two fractions 

00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:26.291
 Equal 

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:29.124
 Because I did not change the shaded part 

00:03:29.124 --> 00:03:31.423
 I just took each of the six basic sections and turned them around 

00:03:31.423 --> 00:03:34.720
 To two, or you multiply the total number of sections 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.589
 By number two we get 12 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:38.261
 And then put it instead of 5/6 

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:41.152
 I now have 10/12 section shaded 

00:03:41.152 --> 00:03:43.521
 Now, let's do the same with the four 

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:44.786
 With 1/4 

00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:47.654
 I have a conception here about 1/4, but I want to turn it into 

00:03:47.654 --> 00:03:49.860
 Number on 12 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.018
 Thus converting it to a number of 12 

00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:56.187
 Each section must be divided into three sections 

00:03:56.187 --> 00:03:57.093
 let's do it 

00:03:57.093 --> 00:04:00.123
 Let's turn each section into three sections 

00:04:00.123 --> 00:04:04.918
 Thus, this is one, two, three 

00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:09.887
 Then we have one, two 

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:11.384
 And three 

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.091
 I have 

00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:14.124
 Believe that you can see where this happens 

00:04:14.124 --> 00:04:15.645
 One 

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:17.120
 Two, three 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.125
 I have one, two, three 

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.225
 And you can see that all I did was multiply 

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:26.059
 In the past I had four equal sections 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:28.486
 Now, I convert each of these four sections to three 

00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:32.155
 Sections, now I have 12 equal sections 

00:04:32.155 --> 00:04:34.419
 And I did it by multiplying the number 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.054
 The sections I had were three 

00:04:37.054 --> 00:04:39.655
 Now what is the fraction that represents the shaded part 

00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:41.721
 Well, that's the origin 

00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:44.300
 Who was one of four, we can now see that he became three 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.888
 Out of 12 equal sections 

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:52.161
 It is now three out of 12 equal sections 

00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:53.891
 Therefore, what will be 

00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:58.651
 If we collect 10/12 to 3/12 

00:04:58.651 --> 00:05:00.427
 Well, how much is part of our dozen 

00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:04.583
 I'll get 13/12 

00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:07.381
 And you can see it visible from here 

00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:10.528
 Here in green, I have 10/12 section shaded 

00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:13.059
 Each of these funds is part of 12 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.394
 Let me write it down 

00:05:14.394 --> 00:05:17.517
 Each of these funds represent 1/12 

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.827
 This represents 1/12 

00:05:19.827 --> 00:05:22.451
 This represents 1/12 

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.274
 Thus, how many sections shaded from 1/12 

00:05:24.274 --> 00:05:27.490
 We have ten sections shaded in green 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.718
 And then we have 11/12 

00:05:30.718 --> 00:05:32.424
 12/12 and finally 

00:05:32.424 --> 00:05:37.424
 13/12, this is one way to think about the subject
