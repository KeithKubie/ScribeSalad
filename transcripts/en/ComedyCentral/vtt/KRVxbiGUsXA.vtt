WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THIS
EARLIER.

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:04.670 size:75% position:38% line:85%
I SAW THIS THIS WEEKEND.

00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:06.339 align:start position:0% line:85%
I HAD TO BRING UP.

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:10.043 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE COLORADO SUPREME COURT RULED
THAT BUSINESSES CAN FIRE

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.945 align:start position:0% line:91%
EMPLOYEES FOR THE USE OF MEDICAL
MARIJUANA.

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:13.479 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:14.914 align:start position:0% line:85%
EVEN IF IT'S OFF DUTY.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:17.116 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT TALKING ABOUT SMOKING IN THE
BATHROOM, RIGHT.

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:20.653 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE CASE IS A QUADRAPLEGIC WHO
WAS FIRED FROM DISH NETWORK

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:28.327 align:start position:0% line:85%
FOR FAILING A DRUG TEST

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.965 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AS IF THINGS WERE NOT [BEEP]
BAD ENOUGH.

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:36.102 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IS IT FARE TO FIRE
SOMEONE FOR WHAT THEY DO ON

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.470 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEIR OWN TIME.

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:40.740 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT DEPENDS ON THE JOB.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:42.108 line:85%
THIS GUY WAS CUSTOMER SERVICE.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:46.512 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF YOU HAVE TO FLY A PLANE OR
WORK, DRIVE A BUS.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.915 align:start position:0% line:91%
YA, DON'T -- BE IN SHAPE FOR
WORK.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:52.385 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, YOU WORK AT STAPLES GET
HIGH.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:56.189 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; IT SUCKS.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.457 align:start position:0% line:85%
SMOKE CRACK.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.691 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
CRACK.

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:00.927 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S KIND OF UNFAIR.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.929 size:88% position:44% line:85%
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:06.999 line:91%
AT THE END OF THE DAY IF HE WAS
DRINKING ALCOHOL THEY WOULDN'T

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:07.700 align:start position:0% line:85%
FIRE HIM.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.968 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S LEGAL IN COLORADO.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.773 size:88% position:44% line:85%
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:14.540 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: RIGHT.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:20.546 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S BANG OUT OF
ORDER

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:21.347 size:75% position:38% line:85%
Larry: BANG OUT OF ORDER

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.914 align:start position:0% line:85%
I LIKE THAT.

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:24.283 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:26.486 align:start position:0% line:91%
Larry: DOES THIS SEEM LIKE A
VIOLATION OF RIGHTS, 

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.487 align:start position:0% line:85%
LEWIS?

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.590 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT JUST SEEMS STUPID AS A LOT
OF THINGS WE DO.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:35.094 line:91%
SON OF A BITCH WE ALLOW PEOPLE
TO POP KLONOPIN  AND GO TO WORK.

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:41.801 align:start position:0% line:85%
COME ON.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:45.037 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SPEAKING OF [BEEP]
HERE IN AMERICA.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.706 size:75% position:38% line:85%
DONALD TRUMP IS RUNNING.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:47.206 align:start position:0% line:85%
FIRST THOUGHTS.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.176 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; MY FIRST THOUGHT.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:51.277 align:start position:0% line:85%
Larry: YES.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.984 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF SOMEONE WERE TO HOLD  A
SWORD I'D RUN AT IT.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:04.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:09.128 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHAT IS THE OPINION
OVER SEAS WHEN THEY SEE SOMEONE

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.597 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE DONALD TRUMP RUN FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.499 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DONALD, YOU'RE FIRED.

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:16.502 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S THE OPINION.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:17.336 align:start position:0% line:85%
DUDE, NO.

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.305 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DISAGREE.

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:19.872 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DON'T KNOW.

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:20.473 align:start position:0% line:85%
I LOVE HIM.

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:21.874 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE A TRUMP FAN.

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:24.577 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HE WON MY VOTE TODAY.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.147 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE CAME OUT TALKING LIKE FLOYD
MAYWEATHER.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.050 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT WAS AMAZING.

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:31.918 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: READY FOR THE FIGHT.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:35.221 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M REALLY RICH.

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:37.123 align:start position:0% line:91%
FLOYD SAID THAT BEFORE HIS
FIGHT.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:37.824 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HE DID.

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:39.592 line:85%
&gt;&gt; HE WAS TALKING LIKE A RAPPER.

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:42.028 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO DROP A
MIXED TAPE.

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.031 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; IT'S AMAZING.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:49.569 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Larry: THERE IS NO WAY TRUMP
CAN BACK ANYTHING HE SAID.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:53.472 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHEN DID WE BEAT JAPAN?

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:54.307 align:start position:0% line:85%
AT ANYTHING?

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.609 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SECOND WORLD WAR.

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:58.177 align:start position:0% line:85%
HELLO.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.247 line:85%
&gt;&gt; LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.817 size:78% position:39% line:85%
YOU KNOW -- JUST -- JUST.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.922 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY THE PROBLEM
IS HERE, WE HAVE REACHED THE

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:14.860 align:start position:0% line:91%
POINT IN TIME THAT SATIRE AND
REALITY HAVE INTERSECTED.

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:16.229 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S THE SAME THING.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.464 size:78% position:39% line:91%
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE SHOW.

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:22.768 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW DO WE MAKE THIS [BEEP]
FUNNIER THAN IT IS.

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:24.270 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:26.305 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS REPEAT IT
BACK THIS.

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:27.673 size:84% position:42% line:85%
IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT IRAN.

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:32.612 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WILL STOP IRAN FROM GETTING
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:37.416 line:91%
WE WON'T BE USING A MAN LIKE
SECRETARY KERRY WHO IS MAKING A

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.118 size:88% position:44% line:85%
HORRIBLE AND LAUGHABLE DEAL.

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:43.990 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEN GO INTO A BICYCLE RACE AT
72 YEARS OLD AND FALLS AND

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:44.657 align:start position:0% line:85%
BREAKS HIS LEG.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.359 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WON'T BE DOING THAT.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:49.629 align:start position:0% line:91%
I PROMISE, I WON'T BE IN A
BICYCLE RACE.

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:55.134 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM --
Larry: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:56.102 size:84% position:42% line:85%
HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:04:00.072 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM IN
SPANDEX.

00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:02.475 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT'S NOT EVEN MAKING
SENSE.

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:06.245 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S AMAZING IS HE DIDN'T
SMOKE.

00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:08.581 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WELL, HE PROBABLY DID.

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:10.249 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DOUBT IT.

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:13.653 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ALL OF THOSE RICH OLD GUYS
ARE ON EVERYTHING.

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:16.422 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; REALLY.

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:17.089 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; COME ON.

00:04:17.122 --> 00:04:18.658 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A SOBER THOUGHT.

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.793 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE IT'S A SOBER
THOUGHT.

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:21.861 align:start position:0% line:85%
LOOK AT HIS HAIR.

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:28.934 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; Larry: ALL THE HAIR IS COMING

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:36.075 align:start position:0% line:91%
UP -- I THINK THE HAIR IS COMING
UP AND SLOWLY DRAINING THE

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:37.043 align:start position:0% line:85%
BLOOD.

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:39.345 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE SIGN FOR HIS CAMPAIGN IS
JUST HIS HAIR.

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:42.415 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST WRONG.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:43.249 align:start position:0% line:85%
Larry: CHINA.

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:45.251 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HEY, I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE
STUPID.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:50.923 align:start position:0% line:91%
I LIKE CHINA. I SOLD AN
APARTMENT FOR $15 MILLION TO

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.391 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOMEBODY FROM CHINA.

00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:55.127 line:85%
AM I SUPPOSE TO DISLIKE THEM?

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.196 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THEY'RE GOING TO
DISLIKE YOU NOW.

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.533 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ALONG WITH THE REST OF
AMERICA.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:07.206 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A TREMENDOUS START
TO A FOREIGN POLICY IDEA.

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:08.340 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: RIGHT.

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:11.344 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU ALWAYS WANT TO START WHAT
YOU GOT PAID TO SELL AN

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:11.911 align:start position:0% line:85%
APARTMENT.

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:12.812 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU KNOW LOGICAL STUFF.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.214 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE.

00:05:15.247 --> 00:05:17.616 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; LIKE EVERYTHING THERE.

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0% line:91%
arry: JUST MAKE IT MAKE
SENSE FIRST, PLEASE.

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:21.888 align:start position:0% line:85%
LEWIS.

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:23.789 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.
DONALD TRUMP IS STANDING ON  

00:05:23.822 --> 00:05:27.059 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE VERREZZANNO BRIDGE BEING
DEDICATED AND OFF

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:32.198 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO THE LEFT IS THE GUY WHO BUILT
THE BRIDGE, THE ARCHITECT.

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:36.402 line:91%
DONALD TRUMP SAW NOBODY PAID
ATTENTION TO THE MAN WHO BUILT

00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:37.636 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE BRIDGE.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.575 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE SAID TO HIMSELF AT THAT POINT
IN TIME I'M NOT GOING TO BE A

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:43.042 align:start position:0% line:85%
SUCKER.

00:05:43.075 --> 00:05:44.977 align:start position:0% line:85%
LIKE THAT GUY WAS.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.215 line:91%
HE IS LITERALLY DECLARING TO THE
PRESS THIS IS THE MOMENT WHEN I

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:55.488 align:start position:0% line:91%
DECIDED I'M GOING TO BE AN
ASSHOLE.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.587 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ASSHOLE OF THE WORLD.
