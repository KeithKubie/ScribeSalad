00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.043
- [Instructor] This right over here

00:00:01.043 --> 00:00:04.607
is the graph of y is equal
to absolute value of x

00:00:04.607 --> 00:00:06.037
which you might be familiar with.

00:00:06.037 --> 00:00:08.213
If you take x is equal to negative two,

00:00:08.213 --> 00:00:11.431
the absolute value of
that is going to be two.

00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:13.473
Negative one, absolute value is one.

00:00:13.473 --> 00:00:15.308
Zero, absolute value is zero.

00:00:15.308 --> 00:00:17.735
One, absolute value is one.

00:00:17.735 --> 00:00:19.514
So on and so forth.

00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:20.786
What I wanna do in this video

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:23.992
is think about how the
equation will change

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:26.327
if we were to shift this graph.

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:28.457
So in particular, we're
gonna first think about

00:00:28.457 --> 00:00:32.624
what would be the equation
of this graph if we shift,

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:36.133
if we shift three to the right

00:00:38.132 --> 00:00:41.034
and then think about how that will change

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:43.038
if not only do we shift three to the right

00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:45.205
but we also shift four up,

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:48.036
shift four up,

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:53.617
and so once again pause this
video like we always say

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:55.785
and figure out what would the equation be

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:59.674
if you shift three to
the right and four up?

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.347
Alright, now let's do this together.

00:01:01.347 --> 00:01:03.512
So let's just first
shift three to the right

00:01:03.512 --> 00:01:06.339
and think about how that
might change the equation.

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:10.955
So let's just visualize what
we're even talking about.

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:14.255
So if we're gonna shift
three to the right,

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:16.290
it would look like,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.781
it would look like this.

00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:22.948
So that's what we first wanna
figure out the equation for

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:27.636
and so how would we think about it?

00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:29.812
Well, one way to think about it is,

00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:31.783
well, something interesting is happening

00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:34.275
right over here at x equals three.

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:36.317
Before, that interesting
thing was happening

00:01:36.317 --> 00:01:37.819
at x equals zero.

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.168
Now, it's happening at x equals three.

00:01:40.168 --> 00:01:41.928
And the interesting
thing that happens here

00:01:41.928 --> 00:01:45.279
is that you switch signs
inside the absolute value.

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:47.818
Instead of taking an
absolute value of a negative,

00:01:47.818 --> 00:01:49.454
you're now taking the absolute value

00:01:49.454 --> 00:01:52.191
as you cross this point of a positive

00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:55.507
and that's why we see a
switch in direction here

00:01:55.507 --> 00:01:56.507
of this line

00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:00.576
and so you see the same thing
happening right over here.

00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:03.326
So at this point right over here,

00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:07.105
we know that our function,

00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:11.560
we know that our equation
needs to evaluate out to zero

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.227
and this is where it's
going to switch signs

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.235
and so we say, okay, well, this
looks like an absolute value

00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:20.750
so it's going to have the form,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.330
y is equal to the absolute
value of something

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.109
and so you say, okay, if x is three,

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.265
how do I make that equal to zero?

00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:34.571
Well, I can subtract three from it.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:38.738
If I say y is equal to the
absolute value of x minus three,

00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:40.623
well, let's try it out.

00:02:40.623 --> 00:02:42.426
Let's see if it makes sense.

00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:44.597
So when x is equal to three,

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.316
three minus three is zero,

00:02:46.316 --> 00:02:47.666
absolute value of that is zero.

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:48.853
That works out.

00:02:48.853 --> 00:02:50.445
When x is equal to four,

00:02:50.445 --> 00:02:54.612
four minus three is one,
absolute value of one is indeed,

00:02:55.794 --> 00:02:56.961
is indeed one.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.962
And if x is equal to two,

00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:02.215
well, two minus three is negative one

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.791
but the absolute value of that is one.

00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:06.586
So once again, I'm showing you this

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:08.011
by really trying out numbers,

00:03:08.011 --> 00:03:09.793
trying to give you a
little bit of an intuition

00:03:09.793 --> 00:03:12.422
because that wasn't obvious to
me when I first learned this

00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:14.914
that if I'm shifting to the right

00:03:14.914 --> 00:03:17.528
which it looks like I'm
increasing an x value

00:03:17.528 --> 00:03:20.516
but what I would really do is replace my x

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:24.520
with an x minus the amount
that I'm shifting to the right

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.072
but I encourage you to try numbers

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:28.086
and think about what's happening here.

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:30.669
At this vertex right over here,

00:03:32.447 --> 00:03:36.737
whatever was in the absolute
value sign was equaling zero.

00:03:36.737 --> 00:03:38.660
It's when whatever was in
the absolute value sign

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.851
is switching from negative
signs to positive signs.

00:03:41.851 --> 00:03:45.165
So once again, if you
shift three to the right,

00:03:45.165 --> 00:03:47.899
that has to happen at x equals three.

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:51.332
So whatever is inside
the absolute value sign

00:03:51.332 --> 00:03:55.263
has to be equal to zero at
x equals three and this,

00:03:55.263 --> 00:03:57.050
pause this video and
really think about this

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.569
if it isn't making sense

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.345
and even as you get more
and more familiar with this,

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:02.897
I encourage you to try out the numbers.

00:04:02.897 --> 00:04:05.427
That will give you more,
instead of just memorizing,

00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:07.103
hey, if I shift to the right,

00:04:07.103 --> 00:04:10.335
I replace x with x minus
the amount that I shift.

00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:12.340
Always try out the numbers
and try to get an intuition

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.078
for that why that works.

00:04:15.078 --> 00:04:18.588
But now, let's start from
here and shift four up

00:04:18.588 --> 00:04:22.708
and shifting four up is in
some ways a lot more intuitive.

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:24.208
So let me do that.

00:04:25.322 --> 00:04:27.072
Let me shift four up.

00:04:29.485 --> 00:04:31.485
Alright, so let me move.

00:04:33.286 --> 00:04:36.703
I'm gonna go up one, two, three and four.

00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:41.180
I think I got that right.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.340
So now I've shifted four up.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.975
And just as a reminder
of what we've even done,

00:04:46.975 --> 00:04:50.642
the first part we shifted
three to the right

00:04:51.508 --> 00:04:54.175
and now we are shifting four up.

00:04:55.553 --> 00:04:58.553
So now, now we are shifting four up.

00:05:01.313 --> 00:05:03.813
So before, y equaled zero here

00:05:05.068 --> 00:05:07.886
but now, y needs to be equal to four.

00:05:07.886 --> 00:05:09.552
So whatever this was evaluating,

00:05:09.552 --> 00:05:11.886
do we now have to add four to it?

00:05:11.886 --> 00:05:14.015
So when we just shifted
three to the right,

00:05:14.015 --> 00:05:17.123
our equation was y is
equal to the absolute value

00:05:17.123 --> 00:05:19.085
of x minus three

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.847
but now whatever we were getting before,

00:05:20.847 --> 00:05:22.279
we now have to add four to it.

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.386
We're going up in the vertical direction.

00:05:25.386 --> 00:05:27.719
So we just have to add four.

00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:30.659
Now, this makes a little bit more sense.

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:33.720
If you're shifting in
the vertical direction,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.598
if you shift up in the vertical direction,

00:05:35.598 --> 00:05:38.828
well, you just add a constant
by the amount you're shifting.

00:05:38.828 --> 00:05:40.908
If you shift down in
the vertical direction,

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:41.894
well, you would subtract.

00:05:41.894 --> 00:05:43.451
If we said shift down four,

00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:46.027
you would subtract four right over here.

00:05:46.027 --> 00:05:48.444
The less intuitive thing
is what we did with x

00:05:48.444 --> 00:05:50.205
'cause when you shift to the right,

00:05:50.205 --> 00:05:52.090
you actually replace your x

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.174
with x minus the amount that you shifted

00:05:55.174 --> 00:05:57.197
but once again, try out numbers

00:05:57.197 --> 00:06:00.631
until it really makes some
intuitive sense for you

00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:02.636
but this is what we would finally get.

00:06:02.636 --> 00:06:05.583
The equation of this thing right over here

00:06:05.583 --> 00:06:07.997
is y is equal to the absolute value of x

00:06:07.997 --> 00:06:09.830
minus three plus four.
