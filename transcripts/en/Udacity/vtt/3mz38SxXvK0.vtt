00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, if we double the distance, we can use this ratio to figure out

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
what's going on with f₂.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here I've called the radius for f₂ twice the initial radius r₁.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I've made the exponent -2, because it's proportional to 1/r²,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so the 2 comes from it being r² and the negative comes from this being in the denominator.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
When we work this out  we find that f₂ is only 1/4 of f₁.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But I'm still confused. How could a force be mutually attractive?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That means that this apple will be drawn to the center of the earth, which is exactly below it--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so the force will go that way--and the force on the moon will also be

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
towards the center of the earth.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
How could a force pointing inward causing an object to move in a circle?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Seems like maybe you'd want a force that pointed that way or that way.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's do a little thought experiment with this apple,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and maybe that will help us see how an attractive force could actually cause

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and object to perhaps move in a circular path.
