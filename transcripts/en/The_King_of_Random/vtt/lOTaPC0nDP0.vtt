00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.980
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
What types of treats can you
put into a cotton-candy machine

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.460
to make your own custom
flavors of cotton candy?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.260
In today's video,
we're going to try and find out.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:16.040
[Music]

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.100
We've got ourselves a little
home-sized cotton-candy machine,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.820
and we want to test this out.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.840
The packaging tells us
that we can actually use

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.440
different kinds of candy to put
directly into our cotton-candy machine

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.330
to have different flavors
when we're finished,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.280
and we want to test that out.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.760
We want to see which ones work,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.840
which ones don't work,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.120
and if we can use homemade candy,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.720
that way, we can choose
whatever flavor we want.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.860
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.040
We'll first make a batch of cotton
candy using a pre-made sugar

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.660
that's designed for this use.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.200
We'll then compare that to
regular white sugar

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.060
and a variety of different candies.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340
We'll also try our homemade candy recipe,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.900
and maybe even see if we can get

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.520
some cotton candy that glows
under a black light.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.920
To start out, let's use the
pre-made cotton-candy sugar

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.240
that you can buy at party stores,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.120
and see what a normal batch
of cotton candy should look like

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.300
so we can compare
that to other batches later.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.600
I'm turning it on and letting it spin,
 because it doesn't heat up

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.960
until you hit the switch,
and the one switch does everything.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.000
So, we're going to let this get warm,
and then we're going to add

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.520
about a tablespoon of our
candy floss pre-made sugar

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.280
into the dish and see what we get.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.840
How cotton candy machines work is
the sugar goes into the little hopper,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.160
there's a heat source, usually, below it,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.100
and the heat actually just melt the sugar.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.380
Once the sugar is melted, it's thrown
out of the sides of the machine.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.600
Usually, through very
small holes or a very thin gap,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.020
and the liquid sugar is so thin
that it cools down,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.260
like, immediately
as it leaves the hopper,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.700
and so, it just forms into
these super, super fine threads.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.100
And those just get
thrown out to the side,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.620
and they stick to the walls,
and you use the cone to gather them up,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.920
and you eat.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.720
There, we've got 
some wisps showing up.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.540
[Music]

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.860
It very much just looks like there's
a lot of busy spiders in there

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.760
that are just building webs really quick.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.900
You can't really see the threads
as they get thrown out.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.520
They just sort of look like they're
appearing all of a sudden.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.880
I think the machine has just about run
its course with the sugar we put in there.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.740
So, here we have sort of the standard
by which we'll compare other things.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.800
This is interesting.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.420
We've just got candy fibers floating
through the air all over the place.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.480
That's what happens if you use
the pre-made floss sugar

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.960
that's just designed for making cotton candy.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.100
It looks pretty much just like what
you might think of

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.740
if you've ever had cotton candy at a
carnival or a party or anything like that.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.940
[Music]

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.920
It tastes pretty much the same.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.280
And, of course, one of
the hallmarks of cotton candy

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.320
is that it dissolves 
pretty much instantly

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.480
once you put in your mouth.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.020
[Music]

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.140
So now, let's start trying some other
things to see how close they are to this.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.440
Next up, let's see what happens
if we just take regular granulated sugar

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.080
and add that to the machine.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.684
Last time,
I used a full tablespoon.

00:02:58.684 --> 00:03:00.880
But in the end,
some of it got sprayed out,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.180
and some of it didn't seem like
it wanted to melt very well.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.460
So, I'm just going to start
with a little less than a tablespoon.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:13.480
[Music]

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.920
Using regular white granulated sugar,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.680
here's our result.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.780
I gotta say my first impression
is that this works pretty well.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.280
I just poured the sugar in
after I'd let it heat up for a bit.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.180
It spun out.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.000
It looks just as light and fluffy.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.200
Of course, this is just white,
rather than the pink,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.000
because we didn't have any coloring in it.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.960
But to me, that looks pretty much
just the same, except for the color.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.740
Of course, this one tastes
more just like sugar,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.480
instead of the vanilla flavor
that our pink stuff had.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.540
It seems to dissolve pretty
much the same way in my mouth.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.700
Let's try putting it in the water.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.460
Yep, that looks the same.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.020
Just dissolved right through.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.680
Let's try one of our hard candy types.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.920
These are just little
butterscotch discs.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.060
And I'm going to take
maybe a couple of these.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.720
And I don't want to
just put the candy in there,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.160
just because I think
they probably won't end up

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.780
perfectly balanced
across from each other.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.340
And this is sort of gyroscopic,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.580
so, I don't want to unbalance it.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.800
So, I'm going to take these candies,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.060
and break them up
into a little bit of a powder.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.800
[Music]

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.240
Well, there were some
snafus in that process.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.560
For some reason, it kept
getting caught on the center,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.460
and it would just grab all the floss,
and pull it in and like bind up.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.360
I was getting these weird long
strands and clumps of this stuff,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.880
rather than just getting the
light fluffy webbing texture

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.420
that we're normally looking for.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.140
But we did get some decent
cotton textured candy out of this.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.240
It's pretty fluffy.
It smells like butterscotch.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.140
Let's give it a taste.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.440
[Music]

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.940
It taste like butterscotch too.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.800
The texture is a little bit different.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.800
It seems like it's a little
bit thicker, coarser,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.240
not quite as fine strands maybe.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.250
Still pretty good, though.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.620
So, these butterscotch candies,
I would say, definitely work.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.240
Let's see how well
this dissolves in water.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.180
Pretty similar.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.159
Maybe just a little bit
slower, but nothing major.

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.080
I have never had
butterscotch-flavored cotton candy before,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.910
so, I kind of like this.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.360
This is enjoyable.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.030
I thought there would
be more color to it too.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.419
These were very golden colored going in.

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.389
Coming out, you can see
they've lost most of it.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.189
There's still a little bit
of the yellowy-orange color.

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:11.909
Compared to the normal white sugar.

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.220
It is more colored, but not as
much as I thought it would be.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.800
[Music]

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.980
Let's try something a little different.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.480
Let's try Jolly Ranchers.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.920
Let's try and make
pineapple-orange cotton candy.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.820
Well, once again,
we had the issue

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.340
where it started by binding up
a lot in the middle,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.960
and we were getting
these weird strands.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.319
It might just be that I'm not
letting it heat up enough

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.780
before we start adding the sugar.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.710
In the end, we did start getting the nice
fluffy texture that we were looking for.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.680
So, this is made of two different flavors
of Jolly Rancher, orange and pineapple.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.940
[Music]

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.099
It's got a lot of flavor.

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.340
This is very strongly-flavored
cotton candy.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.280
I really like that.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.720
[Music]

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.380
Before it was getting
the good fluffy texture,

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.780
we were getting these
dense kind of rope pieces.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.840
Let's try taking some of the thread
ropes and putting that into the water.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.719
Those definitely dissolved slower.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.400
Next up, let's give Life Savers a try.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.200
Now, all of the candy we've done so
far has pretty much discolored,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.100
to the point where it's almost white.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.780
So I'm going to try using a couple
of the really dark-colored Life Savers,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.940
and see how that works out.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.180
We've got grape and raspberry here.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.640
I don't really know if grape-raspberry
is a good combination flavor-wise,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.180
but we'll still see if it works,

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.219
and we'll see if it
keeps the color anymore.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.420
Oh yeah!

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.960
I'm pretty convinced I just
wasn't letting it get hot enough

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.720
with the other ones,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.480
because this one,
I let it run for a lot longer.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.920
I put it in, and it almost
immediately started

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.600
throwing out the threads
looking just the way we want it to,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.140
not binding into the middle.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.000
Pretty sure that's the key.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.380
Give it more time to heat up.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.040
Also, wow!

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.960
That seems to turn all
to threads really quickly,

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.840
like, even more than
the pre-made sugar stuff.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.300
Cotton candy made out of Life Savers.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.500
It melted down really well.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.300
It seems to be a good fluffy cotton texture.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.480
[Music]

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.080
Wow!

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.320
And really intense on the flavor.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.440
[Music]

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.200
There is a lot of flavor on that.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.000
Let's try a dissolving test.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.419
Pretty much instant-dissolving.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.540
Next, I've got this giant slab of candy.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.620
And if you've seen our video on 
how to make thumb suckers,

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.420
or casting a Pokeball using candy,

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.360
this is the same recipe we used for that.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.400
It's made of sugar, corn syrup,
water, a little bit of color,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.840
and a little bit of flavor.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.700
I want to try breaking
this up into fine granules,

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.860
and see if it will work in
our cotton-candy machine,

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.600
because if it does,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.675
it means we can choose
the color and the flavor

00:07:29.675 --> 00:07:31.280
of whatever we put in here.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.340
This one's peach.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.820
It's the weirdest-shaped lollipop ever.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.540
There's no stick.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.320
You just hold on to a
different part of the lollipop.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:47.560
[Music]

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.560
It's working.
It's working.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.920
Okay, so, that worked surprisingly well.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.160
I think we got quite a bit
more volume on this

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.360
than we did 
with some of the others,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.400
like the Life Savers
or the Jolly Ranchers.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.800
Not as much volume as
the pre-made candy sugar stuff.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.640
But ... it's good and fluffy.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.420
Let's give it a taste.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.040
This had quite a bit of strong peach flavor
when I was licking it at as a weird lollipop.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.580
Let's see how it is.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.480
[Music]

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.700
Ooh!
That is nice and peachy.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.620
Comparison of the colors:
it really took out a lot of the color.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.680
Now, in the past, we've actually
made some candy that glowed

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.100
under a blacklight by adding
in some vitamin B2, or riboflavin.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.960
I want to see if
we can replicate that glow

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.820
in the fluffy, cottony texture
of our cotton candy.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.300
So, we're going to take
some Life Savers,

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.740
crush them down, 
add in some crushed-in vitamin B2,

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.320
and see if it's a fine enough
powder that it can bond to the sugar,

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.360
and really make some
glowing cotton candy.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.100
[Music]

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.160
Ooh.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.600
Random fact: machine-spun
cotton candy was invented in 1897

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.979
by the dentist William Morrison
and confectioner John C. Wharton,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.980
and first introduced to a wide audience
at the 1904 World's Fair as "Fairy Floss."

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.220
Our vitamin B2 glowing cotton candy.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.340
This is glowing under a black
light because the riboflavin

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.720
was in such a fine powder
that it was actually able to be carried

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.850
and mixed in evenly
with all of the spun sugar.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.040
It's a pretty cool effect.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.040
I do have to say,
if you're trying this,

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.820
you want to be really
careful about your balance

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.120
between the sugar
and the riboflavin,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.900
because it does have
kind of a bitter taste.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.260
So, if you have too much of it,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.120
your cotton candy
will end up tasting bitter.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.460
So, you want to just barely have enough

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.200
that it starts showing up
under the black light.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.040
Otherwise, it's not
going to taste great.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.560
Lots of types of hard candy
work in this machine,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.420
including making our own hard candy.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.720
Adding a little bit of vitamin B2
can actually make the cotton candy

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.880
start to glow under a blacklight.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.580
If there's anything else you
would like to see us try,

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.400
let us know,
 and maybe we'll give it a shot.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.820
Guys, there is more for you to see.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.600
That box up at the top will transport
you directly to our last video,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.800
and you should go check that out.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.820
The box at the bottom will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.860
you need to be watching next,

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.960
and if you hit this bomb in the middle,
you'll be subscribed to the channel,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.660
so you never miss out on a video.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.600
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.620
Talk to you then.
