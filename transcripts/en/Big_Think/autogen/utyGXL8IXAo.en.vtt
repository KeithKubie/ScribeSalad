something about it if people have the

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709
something about it if people have the
 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.369
something about it if people have the
foresight to understand what the risks

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379
foresight to understand what the risks
 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.800
foresight to understand what the risks
are in the dangers and actually act upon

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810
are in the dangers and actually act upon

so yeah fortunately no one died in the
 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.740
so yeah fortunately no one died in the
Ural Mountains of Russia but it's still

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750
Ural Mountains of Russia but it's still
 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.259

an expensive experiment it was a shot

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269
an expensive experiment it was a shot
 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.959
an expensive experiment it was a shot
across our bow
