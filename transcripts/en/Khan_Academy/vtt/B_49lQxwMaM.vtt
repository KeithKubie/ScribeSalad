00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.090
- [Instructor] In our study
of the different types

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.690
of markets, we are now going
to dive a little bit deeper

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.300
and understand perfect competition.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.930
Now this notion of something
being perfectly competitive,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.040
you might have a general
idea of what it means.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.090
You might feel like it's very competitive,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.750
that there's a lot of
people there maybe competing

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.850
for your business, or maybe
there's a lotta buyers,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.550
and there are a lotta sellers.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.140
And that is generally
true, but we're trying

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.780
to be economists here, so
we wanna be very precise

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.210
with our language.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.930
So when economists talk
about perfect competition,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.690
they're talking about this
somewhat very abstract state

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.840
where you have many buyers and sellers,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.343
many sellers and buyers.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.370
Now that doesn't seem too abstract so far.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.210
We can imagine a lot of markets

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.370
that have many sellers and buyers.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.570
Now another thing that
defines perfect competition

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.960
from an economics point of
view is that they're selling

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.150
identical, identical products or services,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.390
products, products or services.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.630
Now this one seems a little bit harder

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.830
because even when you can imagine

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.220
a fairly competitive
market, does everyone sell

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.470
exactly the same thing?

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.200
Well you imagine certain
markets, maybe the market

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.200
for water or maybe the market
for some type of energy

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.440
or maybe the market for produce,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.030
gets pretty close to identical
products or services.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.330
So so far it doesn't seem
like that abstract of a thing.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.410
Now another aspect of perfect competition

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.390
is that every agent, so
that would be the buyers,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.390
the sellers, the producers, the consumers,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.643
they have perfect information,
perfect information.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.290
Now what does perfect information mean?

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.150
It means that every
participant in the market,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.580
the buyers and the sellers,
they all know exactly

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.330
what is happening in the market.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.980
So what goods or services
are selling for what price

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.130
and who is selling to whom.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.510
So once again, this gets
a little bit more abstract

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.780
because to get truly perfect information,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.220
you can't, not everyone in
a market will always know

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.430
everything that's going on.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.150
So once again, this is a
little bit of an abstract idea

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.930
that economists have introduced

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.990
to be a little bit more precise.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.910
And the last aspect we're
going to talk about,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.740
and this is also something
that is a bit idealized

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.130
that doesn't truly
exist in the real world,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.480
things close to this
exist in the real world,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.480
is that there is no barriers,
barriers to entry or exit.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.340
Now we already mentioned some markets,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.530
say the market for agriculture.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.690
That doesn't quite have no
barriers to entry or exit.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.410
You would somehow have to
get land, you would have

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.430
to get seeds, you would
have to get fertilizer,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.240
you would have to hire
people to put the seeds in

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.630
and to harvest the crops.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.010
And so almost any industry,
any market you imagine,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.890
will have some barriers, but
this is an idealized notion

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.690
that economists like to think about,

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.110
and of course in the real world
things might approach this

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.630
or be closer to perfect
competition than say other markets.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.810
But when you're in this
situation, let's analyze

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.970
what will be happening.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.460
So we can look at the market
as a whole for whatever

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.310
this product and service is.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.920
So let me draw price versus quantity here

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.380
for the market as a whole.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.760
So this is price, and this is quantity.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.250
And this is the market right over here.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.470
And so, we've seen this multiple times

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.350
in our economics journey.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.860
That you have an
upward-sloping supply curve,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.160
and once again this is
for the entire market.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.080
Let me do this is in a different color.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.910
So you have an upward-sloping
supply curve like that.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.670
And you would have a downward-sloping

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.490
demand curve like that.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.460
And we know what the
equilibrium price and quantity

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.350
would be for the market.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.960
So this right over here
would be the equilibrium,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.420
equilibrium quantity for the market,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.668
and this right over here
would be the equilibrium price

00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:12.740
for the market.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.940
Now how would this affect
the decisions for the firm

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.750
in perfect competition?

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.240
Well let's draw, let's
draw a similar analysis,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.640
but now at the firm level.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.640
So on this axis, you could
view this for the firm,

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.170
and so this is going to be
the firm right over here,

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.300
one of the participants in
the perfect competition,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.490
one of the producers, one of the sellers.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.590
So on this axis, you
could view this as price.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.220
You could also view this
as marginal revenue.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.610
And you could also view
this as marginal cost

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.750
because we're going to plot
the different curves here.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.800
And then on the horizontal axis,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.709
we're going to have quantity
again, but this is once again

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:00.320
the quantity that the firm produces.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.745
Now, first of all, we could
think about the marginal cost

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:07.600
for the firm, and we've
seen this multiple times.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.430
That the marginal cost for the firm,

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.950
it might look something like this.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.570
It over time might trend
upwards something like this

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.372
where at some point every
incremental unit is costing

00:05:19.372 --> 00:05:20.800
more and more to produce.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.380
Maybe it's harder to get the resources,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.990
harder to get the labor,
whatever you wanna say.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.460
So that's the marginal cost curve,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.220
fairly typical for a firm.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.080
And then we could think about
their average total cost.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.210
And so the average total
cost curve might look

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.110
something like this.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.903
So draw something like this.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.260
So our average total cost,
we've seen this multiple times.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.610
Now what is going to be the
marginal revenue for this firm

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.093
that is operating in perfect competition?

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.560
Well when it's operating
in perfect competition,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.520
it just has to be a price taker.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.360
So every unit it sells
is just going to get

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.590
the market price for that unit.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.796
So in perfect competition,
the firm, every participant

00:06:08.796 --> 00:06:11.640
that is really identical in a lotta ways,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.390
they're just gonna take that price.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.950
Think about it, they won't
be able to charge any more

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.250
for their product or service
than the market price

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.260
because their product
or service is identical

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.160
to everyone else's, and everyone knows it

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.260
because of perfect information,
and they would have

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.510
no motivation to charge less either.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.640
They're just passive.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.190
You could view it that way
when it comes to price.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.430
So if we just take this
market price across

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.683
just like that.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.410
This right over here, this
price, is going to define

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.180
the marginal revenue curve for that firm.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.070
So let me make this a bold
curve right over here.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.950
This is going to be the
marginal revenue for the firm.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.610
For every unit it sells on the margin,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.190
that's how much more
revenue it's going to get.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.780
Now you could also view
this as the demand curve

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.840
for the firm's product.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.870
You could also view this
as the average revenue

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.310
for the firm's product.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.690
And let me make this clear,
this is for the firm,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.520
demand for the firm, which
is equal to the price

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.030
that the firm actually gets.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.900
So the big takeaway here
is in perfect competition,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.820
which is this somewhat idealized state

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.720
that doesn't quite
exist in the real world,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.780
certain markets can approach it,

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.150
the firms are passive price takers.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.970
They have no say on what
the price is going to be,

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.411
and so it would be rational
for them to just produce

00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:34.686
where their marginal cost intersects

00:07:34.686 --> 00:07:36.620
with their marginal revenue.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.100
Because anything more
than that, then for every

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.160
incremental unit, they're
going to be spending more money

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.900
than they get in terms of revenue.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.130
And this passivity goes
a little bit against

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.240
some of our everyday notions
of fierce competition.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.750
When we think about fierce competition,

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.040
we often think about many players trying

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.330
to constantly undercut each
other, and in future videos,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.520
we'll talk about scenarios
where that might happen.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.690
And you might think about
whether or not you would want

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.760
certain markets to have
perfect competition.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.390
Because no barriers to
entry means that frankly

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.450
anybody could get into that industry.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.150
So for example, you might
not want perfect competition

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.640
when it comes to someone
being say your doctor

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.010
because you want barriers to entry.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.520
You want some level of training.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.130
You want some level of
experience before someone

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.453
gets into that service.
