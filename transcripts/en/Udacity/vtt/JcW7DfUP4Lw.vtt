00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.220
So this lesson, showed the power, of the object technology, for

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.330
structuring complex application servers. EJB, allowed

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.260
developers to write business logic, without having to worry about

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.190
crosscutting, cancer such as security, logging,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.750
persistence and so on. As a homework, what I would want you to do, is understand

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.870
the design choices that we discussed in

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.490
the lesson and analyze [UNKNOWN] the performance

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.490
implications, of those design choices, with respect

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.620
to concurrency, pooling of resources, number of object

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.630
classes, lines of code and so on. And read, the paper that I've assigned to you,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.760
as part of the reading material for this course, in this topic, and relate

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.600
the arguments they present in the paper, against your own qualitative analysis.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.300
A word of caution though, EJB has evolved, considerably, from the time

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.690
of this paper. But, the principals that are discussed in this paper,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.379
apply, to the way complex entier applications are structured to this day.
