00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.969
Hey guys, a couple weeks ago Castrol sent me some of their brand new Castrol EDGE motor oil.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.200
Which is really good timing because I just bought a car that needs an oil change.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.889
Now Castrol claims this is the strongest full synthetic oil money can buy for a whole number of reasons

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.669
I'll tell you about later, but before I put this fluid titanium technology in my own vehicle,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.699
I thought it'd be exciting to run a few torture trials of my own.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.900
Now the first experiment in the torture trials is called thermal shock. I brought back the mini metal foundry from a previous project; we're going to use that to

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.020
superheat the oil to an extreme temperature and then this little contraption uses a thermos to store liquid nitrogen, and when it's time,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.020
we'll pull the pin from a safe distance;

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.879
releasing the liquid nitrogen into the oil, and seeing what kind of reaction takes place when these two extremes collide head-on.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.629
Now of course the disclaimer is don't boil motor oil. This is extremely dangerous

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.929
We're in a controlled environment, and this is not something that should be duplicated.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.139
We're just doing it so you can see what happens if you did. Okay, so update,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.090
we've got our thermos locked in the back position,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.749
we've just filled it up with liquid nitrogen to the very top, and if we take the temperature,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.390
you can say it's actually too low to measure.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.720
This is minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit. In contrast, if we look at the oil now, we're about

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.300
425 degrees right now. I think it's time to drop the nitrogen.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.300
Alright here we go guys, it's showtime!

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.700
Whoah! (Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!)

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.360
That was so much than I expected!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Boom!

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.700
(Letâ€™s go check it out)

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.880
Oh! Look look look look look [you] still see a little bubbling drops of liquid nitrogen floating on the top there

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.400
How crazy is that?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.520
The oil exploded out, and we got a spray radius up to about almost like 20 feet

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.400
It was a good idea to be way way back there

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.100
[well] a little makeshift contraption worked out pretty well didn't it.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.100
So let's move on to torture trial number two this second torture trial is called terminated

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.040
And it'll make sense in just a second. The idea is to use liquid nitrogen to see if we can get motor oil to freeze

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.060
Completely solid and help me do that I've got this cake mold that I got off the internet

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.130
[this] is designed for baking and is made of silicone and should be able to handle temperatures of about 300 degrees

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.660
Which is what our oil is at right now

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.650
So let's fill our mold up with oil

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.290
Gently add Liquid nitrogen around the edges and see if we can get motor oil to freeze completely solid

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.100
Check that out, that's awesome

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Oh, that's amazing

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.589
It's making little crystals. I'm not sure if it's doing that through the whole thing or if that's just on the surface

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.050
It's definitely unique formations. [well], that's enough time for me. Let's take this thing over to [Tray] and smash it

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.959
It's pretty solid

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.249
Question is can we get them out. It's like the rubber and the oil have become one. I cannot physically separate them right now

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:55.000
I wonder if we [should] just smash it in the tray that might be the best bet.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.900
There we go.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.880
That is insane you're looking at frozen motor oil. That is nuts

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.210
Look at that [guys] our motor oil seems to have survived test number two

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.800
Which is more than I can say for the silicone mold let's get this over to trial number three the blend test.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.180
Now I just went and bought a high speed blender because for this last torture trial

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.550
I want to see how [our] oil holds up to the extreme mechanical turbulence generated by metal moving at high speed

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.229
Now this thing's been running for well over [ten] minutes

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.880
The only real difference that I've noticed [is] the temperature has risen to over a hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.130
And that's because of all the heat being generated by the friction of the blades spinning around so fast okay check this out

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.230
It's been over 20 minutes now, and I think our blender is breaking down because I can see some oil spilling up the back

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.680
Whoa that's hot that's hot. That's hot. Yeah, that's almost 200 degrees. This oil has been through a lot

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.109
Which is really amazing because it looks almost exactly like it. Did when it first came out of container. We have boiled it

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.709
We have frozen it solid we have smashed it and we have blended it

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.279
And it seems to have passed all those tests with flying colors so as a final

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.279
testament to my commitment and confidence and casserole Edge motor oil

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.660
I'm actually [going] [to] put this stuff in the engine of my car and drive it around the country just to see how it holds

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.249
Up after all that abuse now here's the thing about cars if you want them to treat you well you need to pay very

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.519
Special attention to what you put in [your] engine and here's why today's engines are smaller and [even] more powerful than they were before which

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.530
Means they run hotter and have to handle extreme temperature shifts the metal parts in your engine move at jet speed

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.200
Creating insane amounts of pressure and the only thing keeping the whole system from blowing apart is a thin layer of oil that

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.859
Lubricates and cools the engine and to help spread the [word] about it. [they] made a really cool video

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.970
They want me to tell you about featuring world-class driver's racing digital clones of themselves

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.220
With the goal to try and beat their own best tire

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.770
It's never too late to get better performance from your car

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.629
So consider switching from conventional oil to [Castro's] full synthetic motor oil Castro Edge

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.969
oh and feel free [to] replace the oil that's already in there because contrary to popular belief you can switch between

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.260
Conventional and synthetic oils as often as you want without harming your engine at all well

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.849
Thanks so much for joining me for these extreme experiments today guys and thanks to Castro for supplying the oil

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.600
And of course it goes without saying these experiments cannot be duplicated at home

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.779
But I was glad [to] have you [along] for the ride, and I hope to see in the next video. [talk] to you then
