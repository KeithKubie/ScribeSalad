00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.700
Water left out in the sun, evaporates.Gasoline
evaporates.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.700
And black holes!

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.700
Yep.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.610
They do too.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.000
Hi there you little quantum wiggles in space-time,
Trace here for DNews!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.220
First things first, make sure you’re sitting
down for this episode, things are about to

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.220
get deep.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.990
Like a supermassive black hole’s gravitational
well “deep”…

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.329
So, black holes.

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.169
I think most of us have a pretty good idea
about what a black hole is, even if we don’t

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.839
necessarily understand , you know, what it is, you
know what I mean.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.559
Black holes are basically regions in the universe
where physics flips us the bird and takes

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.559
a holiday.

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.500
They are regions that are so dense with matter
that their gravity becomes so strong that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.530
even light cannot escape and the normal laws
of physics no longer apply.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.000
They're made of two things: a dense, massive
singularity and an “event horizon,” which

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.730
is basically the point of no return where
gravity gets so high nothing escapes.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.899
We will never know what lies between the event
horizon and singularity (unless you’re Matthew

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.660
McConaughey I guess) as no information
can escape past the event horizon.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.119
If you looked in, you’d be forever lost
from the universe inside the who-knows-whatness

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.280
that lies beyond.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.700
However, in recent decades, physicists have
been debating the possibility that information

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.110
can escape from a black hole via something
called Hawking Radiation, which throws a curveball

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.020
for the “classical” model of black hole
physics.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.070
British physics superhero Stephen Hawking
started playing with this idea in the 1970s.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.100
He came to the conclusion that not only can
information escape the black hole’s clutches,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.329
it can also carry mass away from the black
hole.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.060
Black holes that aren't gaining mass, will
eventually lose it and disappear -- or evaporate.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.439
Basically, this information is just electromagnetic
radiation, like light.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.240
It's called "information" because it's encoded
with information about what has fallen beyond

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.820
the event horizon into the black hole!

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.950
Something we know nothing about.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.109
So, taking this to its logical conclusion,
black holes are not permanent features in

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:59.340
the cosmos!

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.219
Because if they’re not sucking in matter,
they slowly evaporate and eventually disappear!

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.500
This works because the vacuum of space isn't
really a vacuum.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.400
We just did a video about how virtual particles
pop in and out of existence.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.650
It's a quantum mechanics thing, and it's complicated
-- so just know they do this, and that they do

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.080
it in pairs.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.480
Those pairs pop into existence, and then hit
each other and disappear -- this is called

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.540
“annihilation”.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.380
This is good, because energy cannot be created
or destroyed, and the math must balance.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.120
Because they annihilate, they don't break
any law! QUANTUM LAWWWWW!

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.720
I just love doing that.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.900
Sometimes, these pairs will appear in that
no-man's land between the event horizon and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.290
the singularity of a black hole.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.560
In this situation, theoretical physicists
think that one of the virtual particle pairs

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.849
should fall into the black hole, while the
partner of the pair is stuck on the other

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.470
side on its lonesome.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.150
We'll call this lonesome particle Jared.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.379
This is where things get interesting.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.530
According to quantum dynamics, that lonesome
Jared particle is now stuck in our universe!

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.000
It becomes “real” so it can't disappear
again!

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It's no longer "virtual".

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.270
It’s gifted with a mass and energy, like
Pinnochio turning from a wooden toy into a

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.270
real boy.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.849
But to conserve energy (another pretty heavy
physics law that has to be obeyed!), the virtual

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:19.549
particle that fell into the black hole must
carry some kind of negitive energy, therefore very

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.319
slightly reducing the amount of energy inside that black
hole.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.220
The net effect is that the Jared particle
(like a photon of radiation) is sent out of the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.290
black hole into space, and the black hole
loses a little bit of mass.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.490
If this is continuously happening and a black
hole is no longer eating new mass, it will

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.410
lose mass overall.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.739
This is called "evaporating."

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.130
Scientists are currently looking for the gamma-ray
signal that would be generated each time one

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.010
of these black holes pop out of existence.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.200
Though we've never seen it happen, yet.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.580
Also, scientists at the Large Hadron Collider
are looking to create ultra-tiny micro black

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.849
holes, which would fizzle out of existence
really fast, helping us better understand

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.500
this evaporating process.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.690
Though Hawking Radiation is fun to consider,
it has added fuel to the epic battle between

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.040
general relativity and quantum dynamics, culminating
in the “black hole firewall paradox”!

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.320
But we probably should save that for another
day...

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.320
Speaking of the Large Hadron Collider, we
visited this crazy particle accelerator to

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.500
give you an inside look. Check it out.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.000
How's your brain feeling after all of this? A little stretched? A little tough?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.500
Let us know down in the comments if you want us to do more of these

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.900
