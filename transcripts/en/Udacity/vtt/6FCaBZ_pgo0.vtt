00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.830
So color is a psychological phenomenon,
all right.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.870
You know what In fact let me go back to,
to something here.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.270
If I turn on a red light and
a green light and

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.550
I blend them together
what color will I see.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.180
&gt;&gt; Yellow.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.920
&gt;&gt; Yellow, right.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.630
So why?

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.490
When I tell people this at Georgia Tech,
some of them tell me,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.850
oh well, you know,
red is here in the spectrum.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.110
And green is here in the spectrum.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.420
And when you turn on both of them
you get the average spectrum.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.400
No.
[LAUGH]

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.010
The light doesn't know
anything about averaging.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.680
So here's a green light,
and here is a red light.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.090
What happens is this light
over here in the green,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.000
triggers the green cones a little
bit more than the red cones.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.530
And the red light makes the red cones go
a little bit more than the green cones.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.730
Kay, so let's pretend for
a moment they were sort of balanced.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.250
So in other words,
if I had a yellow light,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.300
which makes both of the cones
go about the same amount.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.720
Your system can't tell the difference
between a green light and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.910
a red light turned on
versus a yellow light.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.290
Forget this little blue stuff here for
now, all right?

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.090
So the reason that red plus green make
yellow with lights has nothing to do

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.210
with physics and everything to do
with how your retina is put together.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.770
Right?
The red and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.890
green cones go on at the same time.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.600
So, color is psychological.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.760
That is you can think of
color as representative.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.420
Some combination,
linear combination otherwise of red,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.880
green and blue and
it's related to cones not to physics.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.930
By the way almost all of
us have the same cones, but

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.590
there are some people who don't.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.240
Right, so the sky might not really look
blue to them although actually to them

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.990
it looks blue, but

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.560
it's actually not blue because
they actually can't see blue.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.330
So these people are referred
to as color blind,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.800
all right, a bunch of people
are missing one type of cone.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.499
Almost all of them, by the way, are men.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.160
It, it's, it's some reasonable
percentage of men are colorblind.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.820
Some tiny,
tiny percentage of women are colorblind.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.580
So it was kind of funny back when I
was a grad student, psychology class,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.265
people have to sometimes do a,
so I was the TA,

00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:15.405
people would have to do an experiment
and write it up and hand it in.

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:17.765
And you can tell, every now and
then, when somebody, shall we say,

00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:20.235
ran out of time to actually
do a real experiment.

00:02:20.235 --> 00:02:22.715
because they'd say they worked
with 20 color-blind patients,

00:02:22.715 --> 00:02:23.705
ten men, ten women.

00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:27.135
For them to find ten color-blind women,

00:02:27.135 --> 00:02:30.035
they probably would have had to
sample more than Massachusetts.

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:32.475
So there are very few color-blind women.
