00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:14.630
JASON SILVA: The
philosopher Tolstoy

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.810
wrote about how,
in order to live,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.722
man must find a way to connect
the finite to the infinite.

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:24.300
We need to form some kind
of kinship between ourselves

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.270
and the unfathomable
vastness of the cosmos.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.930
We are star stuff,
said Carl Sagan.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.929
We are made of atoms,
literally cooked

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:35.520
in the furnaces of dying stars.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.300
And so, in many ways,
we are infinite.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.930
Yet a psychologist,
Ernest Becker,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.020
wrote, we are
nevertheless housed

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.560
in heart-pumping, breath-gasping
decaying bodies, simultaneously

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.140
gods and worms.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.040
And so we need a bridge,
a conduit to the numinous.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.750
And perhaps no
greater instrument

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.830
in the history of humankind
than the telescope

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.960
can provide this
cathartic bridge,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.239
as it blasts open new tunnels
between the mind and the other.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.890
Ross Andersen's dazzling essay
on the James Webb Telescope

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.150
reminds us that in
his metaphysics,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.990
Aristotle called seeing
the noblest faculty of man.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.480
Andersen goes on to describe
with requisite virtuosity

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.480
how the deep field images of
the universe taken by the Hubble

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.030
literally mainline all of space
and time in the optic nerve.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.180
So that the Space Telescope
has downloaded space and time

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.161
into our eyeball.

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:38.400
Where as once we were
blind, now we could see.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.140
He continues, through
the sheer aesthetic force

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.720
of its discoveries,
the Hubble has

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.390
distilled the complex
abstractions of astrophysics

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.870
into singular
expressions of color

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.370
and light, vindicating
[INAUDIBLE] beauty

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.370
is truth, and truth-- beauty.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.800
And thus, allowing the layman to
witness the scope and grandeur

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.139
of the universe through
an unprecedented expansion

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:09.959
of human vision, something the
new James Webb Space Telescope

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.540
will take to a whole new level.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.690
Andersen continues,
the telescope

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.540
has provided nothing less
than an ontological awakening,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.110
a forceful reckoning
with what is--

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.918
because we get to witness
galaxies pinwheeling

00:02:24.918 --> 00:02:26.914
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:29.658
Something happens to
us during these moments

00:02:29.658 --> 00:02:33.530
of introspective contemplation,
drunk on awe, as we literally

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.150
get to contemplate space
and time on a scale just

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.850
shy of the infinite,
that enlarges

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.060
the boundaries of our being.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.480
Astronauts have called
this the overview effect.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.440
Neil deGrasse Tyson calls
it the cosmic perspective.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.820
We get to move beyond
the self toward something

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.340
grander, more
majestic, ineffable.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.440
And we chase these
experiences ravenously.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.360
As Henry Wismayer wrote,
as spirituality wains,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.922
experience is the
new faith, and we

00:03:01.922 --> 00:03:04.860
are refugees from the mundane.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.240
And so we shall
continue achingly

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.760
to resuscitate that sense
of humbling incomprehension,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.790
so that we may say, ah yes,
I remember what I forgot.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.320
In the words of
Nisagardatta, the other world

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.680
is this world rightly seen.
