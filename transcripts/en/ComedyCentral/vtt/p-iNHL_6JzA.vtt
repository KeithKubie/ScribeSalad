And now it's time for tonight's
#HashtagWars.

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:06.105
WATERS:
Holy (bleep).

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.908
(applause and cheering)

00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:10.376
Since we're here tonight
with the brilliant folks

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:12.278
from<i> Drunk History</i> who get drunk
and teach history,

00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:14.047
we felt that we should take
a moment to remember

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.315
the towering figures who
got drunk and made history.

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:18.017
For example, we all know
that Winston Churchill

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.419
beat the (bleep)
out of the Nazis,

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.687
but did you know it was because
the Nazis bumped into him

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.689
at a bar and said his cigar
made him look gay?

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.024
-Look at that.
-(laughter)

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:26.459
There he is.

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.461
There's even, uh, there's even
a meme of this, uh,

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:31.264
adorable drunk little baby.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:32.999
So, comedians,
in honor of the contribution

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:34.500
of drunks in our past,

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.602
tonight's hashtag
is #DrunkerHistory.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:39.072
Examples might be,
Long Island Iced Tea Party,

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:40.907
or Madam Hangover Curie.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.443

on the clock. And begin.
