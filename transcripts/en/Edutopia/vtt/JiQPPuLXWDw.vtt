00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:02.455
- [Child] 25, 26, 27...

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.530
- [Woman] It is not easy to see them

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.950
go through this experience of
actually making the incense.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.420
It's a dark and dingy place

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.406
where they are all sitting cramped up,

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:17.440
but when the child goes through
that experiential learning

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.090
I see them building empathy
and having gratitude

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.413
for their own lives.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.520
I'm really proud that
I'm creating citizens

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.023
who are changing the world.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.650
The vision of Riverside is
to create the best school

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.633
for the world and not just in the world.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.910
Education is not all about content.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.660
It is about doing good
as well as doing well.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.437
So, right from Grade 3,

00:00:48.437 --> 00:00:51.920
we start with this whole
idea of citizenship.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.060
- Citizenship for me is when
you add value to your society

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.370
and make it better, the way you want it.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.540
- [Woman] We start by giving
them various experiences

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.710
which highlights the problem.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.229
- You recognize a problem around
you and that disturbs you,

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.963
then you actually go and experience it.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.060
- Grade 5 we are learning
about child labor.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.400
We learn what is a lifestyle of child

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.543
who is making incense sticks.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.870
- Agarbatti is the incense
sticks which we use

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.990
especially in our Indian culture.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.060
These incense sticks is
made by these tiny children,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.660
these tiny hands.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.820
- What did we just see?

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.890
- That they have to work for so much

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.050
and they're not even getting food.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.060
- And the children were
forced to work over there.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.470
- They don't have basically a choice.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.420
- To understand what they
might be going through,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.390
what can we do?

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.200
- Agarbatti experience.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.370
- We can experience.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.890
- Children will spend two
days making agarbathis.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.743
That kind of experiential
learning is something which

00:01:59.743 --> 00:02:01.860
hits the children the most.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.150
They will understand child
rights and child labor

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.180
to a much deeper extent.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.570
- When we watch videos or talk,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.260
we don't get to know what do they feel

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.140
and this is like stepping into their shoes

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.330
and feeling what they do.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.660
- We want them to see these

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.640
are the places where children work.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.703
So you try to make it as
authentic as it can be.

00:02:36.768 --> 00:02:37.601
(kids chatting)

00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:39.770
- [Woman] Complete silence.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.440
You will be in complete
silence right from here.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.753
No talking to each other.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.820
- [Child] We have a dough of
agarbathi that we have to roll

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:52.010
on a stick and make it.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.153
- [Woman] No smiling.
This is not play time,

00:02:55.153 --> 00:02:57.260
this is work time.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.490
- [Child] So the teachers
are acting very strict.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.980
They're not letting us do anything.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.820
It was not normal.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.890
- So, I also want the size proper.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.880
I want the thickness proper.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.350
- You wanna buy this
from market? Would you?

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.047
Would your mom give money for this?

00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:14.006
- [Woman] Quick, move your hands now.

00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:15.324
- No, I don't want to buy this.

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.157
- [Woman] Move it!

00:03:16.157 --> 00:03:19.618
- [Child] I was feeling very excited that

00:03:19.618 --> 00:03:23.101
what is going to happen and
I'm going to have a lot of fun.

00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:24.127
- [Woman] Hurry up, Tushya!

00:03:24.127 --> 00:03:29.127
- And now I'm really
unexcited and I'm very sad.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.300
I've been having a headache.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.040
My back is aching because of sitting.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.920
- Six hours. How many
agarbattis of quality?

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.753
- 10.

00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:39.653
- 10. So what's the problem?

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:44.653
You will get water only when
you give me 50 agarbattis

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.580
and you will get food when
you make 100 agarbattis.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.160
- We give them two
chapatis, onion and chili,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.880
which actually, a child in a factory gets.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.100
- I was like so happy in that
chapati with chili and onion.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.953
I could eat anything at that time.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.120
- I told my parents that I
don't want to go to school

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.720
tomorrow because of the same experience.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.080
Then after thinking sometime,

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.580
I thought that I need to experience this,

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.697
this is important for me.

00:04:20.697 --> 00:04:22.447
- [Child] One, two...

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.550
- Right now, we will be
doing the reflection.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.300
What do they feel? Has that
made any difference to them?

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.390
- I was feeling very bad.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.000
I was not being treated like a child.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.060
- So, what do you think
children should be doing?

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.060
- Go to school, get education.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.804
- What else children should
be getting at this age?

00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:42.732
- Playtime.

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:44.007
- Playtime.

00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:46.540
- Now I'm feeling more
grateful about things

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.890
because I know that
everyone doesn't get it.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.780
So, now I'm not wasting things.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.480
- So, when you wrap up the experience,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.210
it is about how would they
like to take it ahead.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.167
Some of them said, "We
want to do a street play

00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:00.180
"and we want to make people aware."

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.470
- Basically, going back to
the purpose of citizenship,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.820
taking some action to
change that situation.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.070
I believe this is the education.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.670
Through content, the head is growing,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.270
but definitely, you need the heart to grow

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.760
and when you get content
and character together,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.020
that's where the change
happens and if we can have all

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.410
our children go as citizen leaders,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.260
they will stand up for what is right.
