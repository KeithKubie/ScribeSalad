00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.870
So far we've dealt with simple
chains and rings of carbons.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.540
But let's think about what
happens when things get a

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.810
little bit more complex.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.210
Let me just draw a molecule here
and we can think about

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.470
how we'll name it.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:20.890
So let me draw it like that.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.710
So here we don't have
a simple chain.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.910
It branches off at some point.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.870
So what we do in this situation
is we find the

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.370
longest chain in this molecule,
and let's think

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.010
about what the longest
chain is.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.170
If we start here we get one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.330
seven, eight carbons.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.820
If we start here we get one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.570
seven, eight, nine carbons.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.060
So what we do is we look
at the longest chain.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.770
The longest chain is this
one right here.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.290
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.930
So this is one, two, three, one,
two, three, four, five,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.920
six, seven, eight,
nine carbons.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.239
And so this will be-- that will
be kind of the core of

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:04.840
our naming.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.510
So it's nine carbons.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:15.270
So that right here, longest
chain, has nine carbons.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.740
You can kind of view this is the
backbone of our molecule

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.830
and also the backbone
of our naming.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.660
Nine carbons, so we're dealing
with a nonane.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.600
Remember, nine, non- for nine,
and then -ane, because we're

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.230
dealing with an alkane.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.860
We have all single
bonds over here.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.420
Now, what do we do with
this thing over here?

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.140
Well, what's kind of sticking
off of this chain?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.130
Well, we essentially have one
carbon here that's attached to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.970
the chain, right?

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.470
This carbon is bonded to
a carbon on the chain.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.930
If we wanted to draw the entire
molecule, we could draw

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.550
carbon here and it would it be
bonded to three hydrogens, but

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.850
that is all implicit.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.900
But what is this thing
right here?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.330
Well, it's one carbon.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.270
You might be tempted to say
it's methane, but it's not

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.520
methane because it's attached
to other things.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.550
But it would be right to
use the prefix meth-.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.340
So this right here, you would
use the prefix meth-, so this

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.020
is one carbon, so you would want
to use the prefix meth-,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.200
but because it isn't the main
chain, it is added to

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.760
something else, we don't write
methane, we write methyl.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.210
So let me write this
right here: methyl.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:37.360
So this means it branches
off longer chain.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.070
So this molecule right here
would be called-- and

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.340
actually, there's one
more thing that we

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.390
have to think about.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.670
This thing could have been--
we could just call it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.750
methylnonane.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.250
Let me just write that
down right now.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.490
So we could just call this
right from the get-go, we

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.740
could call it methylnonane.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.740
But there's one problem with
just calling it methylnonane.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.970
This is methylnonane, but so
what's-- let me draw it.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.930
So the thing I just drew here,
this is, one, two, three,

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.340
four, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.610
So that's the nonane.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.430
And the one I drew here's one,
two, three, the methyl is

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.340
right over here.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.650
That's what I just drew.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.250
That is-- let me do it
in the same color.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.210
So this is what I just drew.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.420
But maybe, what if it was
something like this?

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.500
What if it was one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.490
eight, nine?

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.560
And let's say that the methyl
group was, instead of being

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.970
right here, let's say the methyl
group was right here.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.170
So how would you name these
two things differently?

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.210
This name right now does not
differentiate between the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.920
methyl group being on this
carbon versus the methyl group

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.740
being on this carbon over here
or this carbon over there.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.210
And what you do in this case is
you number the carbons on

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.170
the longest chain, on the main
backbone, and you number them

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.820
so that the methyl group is
attached to the lowest

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.570
possible number.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.730
So there's two possible ways
to number this chain.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.420
You could start here
as one, two, three,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.440
four, five, six, seven.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.710
Then you would say that this
would be that the methyl group

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.170
is attached to the
seven carbon.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.450
Or you could start numbering
from this end of the chain.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.779
It would be one, two, three.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.740
Or so it could also be attached
to the third.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.420
Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.440
So you want to number
it so you're closest

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.130
to the methyl group.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.020
So you want to start here.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:36.240
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.240
So in this case, this would
not just be methylnonane.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.406
This thing right here
would be three.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.690
Let me make this very clear.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.540
It would be 3-methylnonane.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.160
Because the methyl group, that
one carbon, that one CH3, is

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.810
attached to the third carbon
on our nonane backbone, so

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.430
that right there is
3-methylnonane.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.880
Since I drew this out, what
is this right here?

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.490
Well, once again, we have this
nonane backbone, one, two,

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.980
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, and you want to

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.420
number it so that this methyl
group is at the lowest number

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.640
carbon as possible.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.320
So it's closer to this
end than that end.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.870
So it's one, two, three, four,
I'll do that in magenta, and

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.930
you can keep numbering, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.780
So this one is going to be four,
and then you have your

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.360
methyl group.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.570
It's just one carbon sitting
right there, so

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.820
4-methylnonane.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.840
Now, let's go the other
way around.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.740
Let's say we start with the name
and we want to figure out

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.490
its formula.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.310
And hopefully, this gives you
a good understanding how

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.410
things will get more complex.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.020
And over the next few videos,
they'll get more and more

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.550
complex, but you'll
see it's all at

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.270
least reasonably logical.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:07.410
So let's say I were to give
you let me think of one.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.660
Let's say 2-propylheptane.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.780
So how do we take this apart?

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.310
So the first thing you
see, it is an alkane.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.930
It's all going to
be single bonds.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.540
Heptane, this is kind
of the core.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.520
So the longest chain here, hept-
is the prefix for seven.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.530
So this tells us-- let
me make this clear.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.005
This tells us that we're dealing
with all single bonds.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.295
That's what the -ane tells us.

00:06:41.295 --> 00:06:43.700
If we had double bonds,
it would be -ene,

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.970
triple bonds, -ine.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.680
We're going to see that in the
future, but let's stay

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.220
simple right now.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.955
The hept- tells us we're dealing
with seven carbons.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.470
And then what does this
2-propyl mean?

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.980
Well, propyl tells us-- what
was the prop- prefix?

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.870
If methyl is one, ethyl is two,
propyl is three, butyl is

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:12.180
four, so this is a three-carbon
group, and it's

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.980
going to be attached to the
second carbon on the heptanes.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.520
Let me draw the heptane chain.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.420
So we have seven carbons, so
one, two, three, four, five,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.850
six, seven.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.490
And then on the second carbon--
just let me pick a

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.220
good color here.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.580
On the second carbon, so if we
just number it one, two,

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.170
three, four, five, six, seven,
on the second carbon right

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.440
there, we have a propyl group.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.015
We have a propyl group, but it
is a three-carbon group.

00:07:43.015 --> 00:07:44.430
So let me draw the
propyl group.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.920
So we have a one, two, three,
three-carbon group, and it's

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.170
attached at the second
carbon right there.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.330
So this molecule,
2-propylheptane

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.240
looks just like this.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.610
Let's do another one, maybe one
that seems a little bit

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.670
more difficult.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:08.850
Let's say that we have
6-butyltetradecane.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.880
And all of these might seem a
little daunting when you see

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.450
it at first, but if you really
just break it up, it actually

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.540
is pretty logical.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.945
So once again, we have the -ane
there, so it's all going

00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:27.110
to be single bonds.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.830
What is tetradec-?

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.350
What is that prefix?

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.240
Well, dec- is 10 and then
we have tetra-, that's 4

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.620
plus 10, that's 14.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.510
Tetradec- is 14.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.850
So this is telling us
that we're dealing

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:43.870
with a 14-carbon chain.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.240
Let's draw that.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.540
So one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.380
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen carbon chain.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.540
And if we number them, one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:04.910
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen,

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:10.530
fourteen, this tells us that
the sixth carbon will be

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.360
butyl, will be a butyl group.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.410
So let's see, the sixth
carbon is right here.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.680
And butyl, and you should
memorize this, methyl is one,

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.910
ethyl is two, propyl is three,
butyl is four, so we have a

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.015
four-carbon group.

00:09:23.015 --> 00:09:25.290
So let me write this
in a pink maybe.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:33.140
So this is a four-carbon
group.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.650
When you call it an alkyl
group, it's attached to

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.770
something else.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.870
So on the sixth carbon, we have
a four-carbon group, so

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.990
one-- let me draw it this way.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.410
No, this is fine.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:49.540
Let's say we have one, two,
three, four, so that is our

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.560
butyl right there, and it's
attached to the sixth carbon.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.700
It's attached to the sixth
carbon right there.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.900
So this is what our molecule
would look like.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.460
Now, let me ask you
a question.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.385
Would you ever see a
9-butyltetradecane?

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.640
Would you ever see a
9-butyltetradecane?

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.400
So something where-- so let
me redraw it like this.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.030
So a 9-butyltetradecane, so it
would have butyl over here.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:20.460
One, two, three, four, one,
two, three, four.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.880
Would you ever see a
9-butyltetradecane?

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.060
Will you ever see
that written?

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.510
You might say, oh, yeah,
Sal, you just drew it.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.320
And the reason why you won't
ever see that written is

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.390
because there's a better
way to number it

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.430
if it's like this.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.410
Instead of starting over here at
one at this end, you'd want

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.810
to start one that end.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.810
So instead of saying
9-butyltetradecane, you should

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:40.520
number it the other way.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.550
You should say this is one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.715
So this is actually also
6-butyltetradecane.

00:10:50.565 --> 00:10:51.580
Let me be sure I got that.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.320
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.280
So instead of starting from the
left and making this the

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.140
ninth carbon, you always want
to start numbering from the

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.340
direction that has the lowest
number for the first group.
