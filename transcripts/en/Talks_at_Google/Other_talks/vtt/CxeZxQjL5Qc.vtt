ANDREW: We've got
a special guest

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.350
with us today,
Jennifer Pharr Davis.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.370
She's logged over 12,000 miles
on six different continents,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.520
including trails like
Pacific Crest Trail, Colorado

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.930
Trail, the Appalachian Trail.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.060
She has a new book,
"Called Again,"

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.730
which chronicles her journey of
47 miles per day over 46 days.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.850
And she's been featured
on the "New York Times,"

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.310
"Washington Post,"
"Talk of the Nation,"

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.299
"Daily Beast"--
the list goes on.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.475
She's agreed to come here
and give a talk to us today,

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:37.850
and I'm very
excited to have her.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.915
So please help me welcome
Jennifer Pharr Davis.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:43.705
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:48.000
JENNIFER DAVIS: It's
always fun to share

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.530
some of my hiking stories.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.490
And like Andrew said,
I've been able to hike

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.490
all over the world on
six different continents.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.770
I have not been to
Antarctica, because I'm

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.970
a wimp in cold weather,
which we talked about.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.980
But of all the places where I
have hiked and I have traveled,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.060
the one trail that
means the most to me,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.660
and the trail that has
changed my life the most,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.364
is the Appalachian Trail.

00:01:11.364 --> 00:01:13.030
And where I come from
in North Carolina,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.990
we call it the
"Appa-lah-chin" Trail.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.970
You may have heard of the
"Appa-lay-shin" Trail, right?

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.400
Well, that's not correct,
just so you know.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.730
It's the "Appa-lah-chin" Trail.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.360
Or at least we can
all agree on the AT.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.340
And I've done the entire 2,185
mile AT three separate times.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.740
And it was the most
recent time in 2011

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.250
where, with my husband's
help, and a whole lot of help

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.520
from friends, and family,
and hikers, and runners,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.790
we set the overall record.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.700
So for 46 straight days I
averaged 47 miles a day.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.970
And that's crazy,
exactly, right?

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.640
Someone said it.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.160
Yes, we can all agree
that that's crazy.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.570
But hopefully, we can
also agree that a journey

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.990
of any distance or
any speed is always

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.340
going to start
with a single step.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.840
Yes?

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.930
And my first step
into the wilderness

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.610
didn't take place until
I was 21 years old.

00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:18.160
And that is so sad.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.990
It is.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.890
I grew up in a beautiful area.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.710
But nowadays, with
school being so

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.000
demanding, and extracurriculars
taking up so much time,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.760
unless your family's really
focused on going outdoors,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.910
you're not going to spend a
whole lot of time in nature.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.705
So I graduated from college,
and I didn't know anything

00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:39.580
about the wilderness.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.940
And that really bothered me.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.700
And I felt like because
I didn't know much

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.795
about the natural world, I
really didn't know myself.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.620
So I wanted to take some
time to try and fix that.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.430
And growing up in
North Carolina,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.540
I'd heard about the
Appalachian Trail.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.170
I had never set
foot on it before.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.010
In fact, I'd only
spent two nights

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.870
in the woods my entire life.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.170
But the good news is, at age
21, that doesn't matter, right?

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.120
Inexperience never seems
to matter to 21 year old.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.660
And I decided that I was
going to get out and do

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.670
that entire trail by myself.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.490
So I started on my own, with my
brother's old Boy Scout gear,

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.240
in Georgia.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.210
And my goal was to walk
all the way up to Maine.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.890
And that first journey,
I was out there

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.380
for five full months, which
is very standard when you're

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.912
trying to hike the entire trail.

00:03:40.912 --> 00:03:44.870
But at the time, it was
the five hardest months

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.750
I had ever known.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.270
And even though it was 10 years
ago, I'll still today say,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.475
it was also the five best
months of my entire life.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.330
Because the trail
completely changed me.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.200
And I needed that.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.190
I liked the woman at
the end a heck of a lot

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.290
more than the girl who started.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.700
And I could spend
all day telling you

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.470
about that first journey.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.690
It was so foundational.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.670
I could tell you
lessons I learned,

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.590
describe folks I met along
the way-- because, trust me,

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.590
there's some characters.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.380
But you guys are at work.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.700
You don't have all day.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.150
We got to get you back and
being productive and solving

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.310
all the Google problems.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.960
And so I'm going
to try to sum up

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.050
that journey and
that transformation

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.880
by reading a short passage
from my first book.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.030
And this book chronicles
my initial journey

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.380
down the Appalachian Trail.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.180
And it's got a
really strange name.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.305
It's called "Becoming Odyssa."

00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:45.180
Half the people read
the book, and they still

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.360
can't pronounce the title.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.810
But just so you know,
Odyssa is my trail name.

00:04:51.654 --> 00:04:53.070
And it's really
common when you go

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.350
and you hike these long paths
that, while you're out there,

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.890
you take a nickname that
hikers call a trail name.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.220
I know we have hikers in here.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.490
Do we have any trail names?

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.737
Are you willing to share?

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:05.320
AUDIENCE: Doc.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.440
JENNIFER DAVIS: Doc.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.999
Did you take that, or was
someone else-- gave it to you?

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:10.540
AUDIENCE: It was
kind of given to me.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.880
JENNIFER DAVIS: Kind
of given to you.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.421
Well, that's the
point I'm going for.

00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:16.120
Because hikers love to
try and give other hikers

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.970
their trail name.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.210
In my first week out there--
by the way, if you can't tell,

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.236
I am 6 feet tall.

00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:26.110
And I've been this height
since eighth grade.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.870
And my first week on the
trail, I got suggestions

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.921
like Sasquatch, Amazon,
and Stretch, yeah.

00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:38.420
And all of a sudden, all those
old wounds from middle school

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.336
were just ripped open.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.900
And I don't want any of those.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.450
But then I was being a dork
and comparing the trail

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.080
to Homer's "Odyssey."

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.315
And another hiker said,
well, what about Odysseus?

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.210
And I liked that.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.149
But I was proud to
be a woman out there.

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:55.940
Because there weren't
that many, especially

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.815
hiking by themselves.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.100
So I wanted a
feminine trail name.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.810
And we changed
Odysseus to Odyssa.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.250
And I've been Odyssa ever since.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.110
So here's a passage
from the last full day

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.670
of Odyssa's first journey.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.200
"When people had asked why I
wanted to hike the Appalachian

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.780
Trail, one of the
answers I had given

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.670
was that I wanted time to think
about where I wanted to live

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.730
and what I wanted
to do for a living.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.160
And the trail would give me
plenty of time to do that.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.130
But now that I was at the
end, I didn't feel any closer

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.730
to knowing those answers
than when I started.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.050
The only thing I
felt more certain

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.780
of at the end of this
journey was myself.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.070
I was no longer
defined by my resume,

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.850
and I didn't give
answers based on what

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.190
I thought other
people wanted to hear.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.140
For the first time in my
life, I knew who I was,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.490
and I was OK with who I was.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.870
At the end of this journey,
I knew that something deep

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.460
within me connected with
nature, and with hard work,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.535
and with simplicity.

00:07:09.766 --> 00:07:13.330
I also learned that I was
both stubborn and tough--

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.970
a lot tougher than I
thought I was, especially

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:23.070
when I let other people
help me along the way."

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:29.110
Now, when it was all said
and done, I got off trail,

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.650
and I got a job.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.030
I mean, much to my mother's
relief, I got a job.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.430
And it was a good job.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.890
I was working with fun people,
living in a great place.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.955
And I think everything said,
I should have been happy.

00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:45.080
I should have been content.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.220
But then the weeks
started to pass.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.700
And the months started to pass.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.940
And all I could think
about was the trail.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.160
And I missed it.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.980
I missed moving through nature.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.470
My job was great, but
it was a desk job.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.360
And I sat there for
eight hours a day.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.600
And while I sat there,
I longed for the friends

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.050
I had made on the trail.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.930
It was the first
environment I had

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.480
been a part of where the people
who were the closest to me

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.770
were extremely
different from me.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.255
That made life really fun
and really interesting.

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:25.230
But surprisingly-- and I'm
going to say "surprisingly,"

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.370
because when I started, I
was your typical 21 year old.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.810
And I was leaving behind
my friends, and my family,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.510
and my computer, and TV.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.990
And I was terrified
that, at times, I

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.235
would be really bored
and really lonely.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.090
But then when it
was over, I longed

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:49.590
for the silence and the
solitude that I had discovered,

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.080
as much as I longed
for my friends.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.045
But the thing I missed most
of all sounds really strange.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.890
Because I missed how
beautiful I felt on the trail.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:07.060
And I promise you, when I
was out there, I was filthy,

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.990
I mean covered in dirt.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.500
We won't even talk
about the smell.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.720
Because I don't think you
can put it into words.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.070
And it's East Coast
smell, which by the way

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.550
is way worse than
West Coast smell.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.660
Plus, there were
scrapes, bug bites,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.460
bruises all over my body.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.370
But here's the thing.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.730
For five months, I
didn't have a mirror.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.650
And I don't know if
this is funny or sad,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.690
but the other week, I
went into a middle school.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.760
And I literally had
to explain that this

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.020
was before the day of the
selfie, like I wasn't taking

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.910
digital pictures of
myself the entire way.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:47.160
Plus, I didn't have billboards,
magazines, or commercials

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.150
telling me what I
should look like.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.730
So I started to see myself
through my interactions

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.386
with other hikers.

00:09:56.386 --> 00:09:58.150
And if I made
someone else smile,

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.470
that made me feel pretty.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.050
Also, growing up, I
had always thought

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.400
that nature was beautiful.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.770
But I had never seen
myself as a part of nature,

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.860
and a part of all that beauty,
until I walked the trail.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.320
And finally, after
hiking through 14

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.750
states-- which I love saying
that on the west coast.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.840
Because it makes it
sound so far, so long.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.820
But after hiking through
14 states, at that point,

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:35.044
I based my self worth a whole
lot less on how I looked,

00:10:35.044 --> 00:10:36.710
and a whole lot more
on what I could do.

00:10:38.186 --> 00:10:39.560
And that's the
gift of the trail.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.316
It makes you realize you can
do so much more than you once

00:10:43.316 --> 00:10:44.190
thought was possible.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.465
It exposes you to new things,
new horizons, new trails.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.650
And I decided that
I really wanted

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.062
to do more, on
and off the trail,

00:10:55.062 --> 00:10:56.645
more than I once
thought was possible.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.710
So as time passed, I started
saving up money from work.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.110
I started saving up
time away from work.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.396
And I started to plan
another big hike.

00:11:07.396 --> 00:11:09.600
And one of the great
things about being a hiker

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.490
is that there are
trails everywhere,

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.100
I mean all over the
US, all over the world.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.470
And in my opinion, hiking is
one of the most affordable,

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.062
accessible, and
best ways to travel.

00:11:20.062 --> 00:11:21.520
So I actually want
to take a minute

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.180
and share some of my
favorite hiking pictures

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.927
from different trails around
the world with you all.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.010
And as the pictures
scroll through,

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.440
I'll try to tell you
where they were taken.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.045
So we'll start our journey in
Africa at Mount Kilimanjaro.

00:11:37.438 --> 00:11:40.432
[MUSIC ALATHEA, "COME HOME TO
 ME"]

00:12:01.477 --> 00:12:03.960
This is on the 600
mile Bibbulmun Track.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.000
You see that big lizard.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.930
The southwest
corner of Australia,

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:17.910
so just beneath Perth--
yeah, big spiders.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.750
And here we go to Peru.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.380
This is in Cotahuasi Canyon.

00:12:25.134 --> 00:12:27.058
And that hurt.

00:12:27.058 --> 00:12:28.501
That hurt a lot.

00:12:29.695 --> 00:12:32.070
This is actually one of the
deepest canyons in the world.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.445
And there are no
official trails.

00:12:33.445 --> 00:12:35.153
There's just all these
old trading routes

00:12:35.153 --> 00:12:36.100
that people still use.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.100
So we were able to
navigate the entire canyon.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.310
The next pictures come
from the Inca Trail

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:50.770
to Machu Picchu, which I know
some of you have been on.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.950
And this is a trail
you all should all

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.070
check out at some point.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.460
This is the Pacific Crest
Trail, runs about 2,700 mile

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.020
all the way through California,
Oregon, and Washington.

00:13:13.057 --> 00:13:14.390
These pictures are not in order.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.679
So this is Washington.

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:16.845
This is in the High Sierras.

00:13:19.942 --> 00:13:20.900
That's a marmot friend.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.690
That's Crater Lake in Oregon.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.740
That's back up in Washington.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.592
And those goats
can be mean, too.

00:13:43.592 --> 00:13:44.518
They can be.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.810
And all the rest
of the pictures are

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.740
going to come from
different parts of Europe.

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:52.430
This is in the Alps.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.190
That's Mont Blanc
in the background.

00:13:58.554 --> 00:13:59.460
This is in Iceland.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.564
These next few pictures are
from a 50 mile trail in Iceland.

00:14:10.564 --> 00:14:11.980
But there's more
diversity in that

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.775
50 miles than maybe the
entire Appalachian Trail.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.500
And the last few shots are
from the United Kingdom.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.680
This is from the coast of Wales.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.105
And then there's some
shots from Scotland.

00:14:43.045 --> 00:14:45.170
That was a monument at the
end of the West Highland

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.020
Way in Scotland.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.870
And I always thought, that's
the perfect way to end a hike,

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:49.620
have that statue.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.200
So hopefully, you guys
enjoyed those pictures.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.890
Be glad that I did not sing.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.140
That would not be a
pleasurable experience.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.010
But the point of
showing those images

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.800
is just that the trail-- I mean,
I'm not a good photographer.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.670
I'm not.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:07.080
But the trail can take you
to these incredible places.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.140
They're just so stunning,
so mind blowing.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.136
And by the time-- for several
years, I just worked to hike,

00:15:13.136 --> 00:15:14.760
and worked to hike,
and worked to hike.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.835
But by the time I was 25, I
had admitted I had a problem.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.590
And I said this recently,
and someone yelled back,

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.842
and 12 steps just
wasn't going to fix it.

00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:30.000
And I was like, that's right.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.470
I was a hiker.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:32.000
I was.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.120
All my time, all my money,
it was going to the trail.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.340
So at that point, I
actually quit my day job

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.700
to start my own hiking company.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.400
Because what I really
wanted to do was

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.354
get other people outside.

00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:46.770
And I thought I could do it
through writing, and speaking,

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.160
and guiding on the trail.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.340
But I still wanted to hike
a little on my own, too.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.150
And I was in the
very beginning phases

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.710
of planning for
my next trip when,

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.360
all of a sudden,
something happened

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.750
that I thought might
ruin everything.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.526
Any guesses?

00:16:03.526 --> 00:16:04.420
AUDIENCE: Ankle?

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.470
JENNIFER DAVIS: Ankle?

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.330
That is such a
sweet, naive guess.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.810
No, I fell in love-- way
worse than twisting an ankle.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.740
I fell in love.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.020
I got engaged.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.270
And I was convinced that
at the time in my life

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.280
when I was ready
to be married, I

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.410
would need to be ready to settle
down, or at least just slow

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.910
down.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.600
But I was really fortunate
to meet this great guy who

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.936
loves me for me, which
is the crazy hiker.

00:16:31.936 --> 00:16:33.185
And he's extremely supportive.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.950
But maybe most
important of all, I

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.000
ended up marrying a
fellow who, at the time,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.440
was a public school teacher.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.615
So what does that mean?

00:16:42.615 --> 00:16:43.890
AUDIENCE: Summer vacation.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.098
JENNIFER DAVIS: That's right.

00:16:45.098 --> 00:16:47.100
This could work, right?

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.130
And truthfully, I
had always wanted

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.630
to have adventures
with someone else.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.110
I had gone on my own, but I'd
always wanted to share it.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.100
And I told Brew--
that's my husband.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.800
I told him, on our
very first date,

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.500
that I wanted to hike the
entire Appalachian Trail again.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.040
So he knew what he
was getting into.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.210
But as much as he loved me,
even after we were engaged,

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:14.420
he still did not want
to hike 2,185 miles

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.295
with me-- imagine that.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.069
So we started to talk
about how I could hike,

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.099
but how we could also
spend time together.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.560
And we came up with the idea
of doing a supported hike.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.030
Now, a supported hike is
going to take a long trail

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:34.355
like the AT and basically turn
it into a series of day hikes.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.750
Because now, instead of carry
my big heavy pack with tent,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.810
sleeping bag, several days worth
of the food, all I had to carry

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.640
was a day pack
with just the items

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.059
I needed to reach the
next road crossing.

00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:51.475
Because at every road crossing,
there would be my husband.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.572
And what else would be there?

00:17:54.572 --> 00:17:55.196
AUDIENCE: Food.

00:17:55.196 --> 00:17:56.680
JENNIFER DAVIS:
Food, that's right.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.665
Food, gear, supplies,
fresh socks-- fresh socks

00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:03.180
are like the best thing
ever when you're a hiker.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:03.880
They are.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.960
So I could get
whatever I wanted,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.140
but just what I needed
to reach the next road.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.870
And as soon as we decided
that we would complete

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.850
the trail in that
manner, and knowing we

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.240
wanted to do it in
the summer months

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.370
when we could be together,
I decided that I also

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:26.530
wanted to try and establish a
women's record on the trail.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.220
Because as long as I had
heard about supported hikes,

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.320
not all of them,
but a number of them

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.010
had been in regards
to records, people

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.160
trying to go very quickly.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.270
But every record
I had ever heard

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:44.555
of on the Appalachian Trail,
not just speed-- oldest hiker.

00:18:44.555 --> 00:18:46.680
By the way, do you want to
guess how old the oldest

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.069
hiker to do it all at once was?

00:18:49.069 --> 00:18:49.610
AUDIENCE: 90.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.330
JENNIFER DAVIS: 83, 83.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.025
Youngest hiker?

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.590
AUDIENCE: 13.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.530
AUDIENCE: Five.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.850
JENNIFER DAVIS: Five.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.600
The person who had
done it the most times,

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.360
which is 17 times--
that's over 35,000 miles.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.410
All those records, all
those marks-- several folks

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.530
who had hiked the trail legally
blind-- they were all men.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.200
All of them, every single
record, every single mark,

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.070
belonged to a man.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.460
And I'm all about
some girl power.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.480
So I thought, there should
be a women's record, too.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.860
And truthfully,
there wasn't one.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.680
So I figured if we were smart,
and if I stayed healthy,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.410
we'd probably
accomplish that goal.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:35.240
And it was back on June 8, 2008
when Brew and I got married.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.055
And it was lovely.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.670
But then just 12 days later,
we started the trail--

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.150
12 days later.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.810
And once again, I can
spend all day telling you

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.300
about this one journey.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.080
And I won't.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.560
But I will say, if
you ever really want

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.620
to work on
communication-- I mean,

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.560
that might be a good
team building exercise,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.100
to do a supported hike
for a couple days.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.670
Because it forces
you to communicate.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:11.590
And after 57 days of working
together, communicating, being

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.030
a team, we got to the end.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.670
And we accomplished our goal.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.175
When we arrived, we
established a women's record.

00:20:20.175 --> 00:20:23.250
And along the way, I
averaged 38 miles a day.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.750
38 miles a day, that's
not too shabby, right?

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.370
I mean, it was hard.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.060
And it was challenging.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.990
But I was surprised at
how much I loved it.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.700
I loved it.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.520
And now, when I look
back to that summer,

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.650
sometimes I feel like, well,
sure, I should have loved it.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.690
Because there was, a
newlywed on cloud nine out

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.230
on my favorite trail
getting to do exactly what I

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.960
loved to do all day, every day.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.310
And meanwhile, the man who
I loved more than anyone

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.800
was running all of my
errands, every single one.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.900
But when we got to
the end, Brew and I

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.445
hiked up the last
mountain together.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.860
And on the summit, there's a
plaque that represents the end.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.796
So we went up to it.

00:21:13.796 --> 00:21:15.190
And we both put our hands on it.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.250
And as soon as we did,
I turned to my husband

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.310
just grinning from ear to ear.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.280
And then he turned
to me, and he said,

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.520
we are never doing that again.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.140
And he meant it.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.340
But there was one
very small problem.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:43.870
And that was we hiked off that
mountain to get to our car

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.680
and go home.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.350
But as we descended
down the trail,

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.600
I knew that I could
have kept going.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.340
I knew I still had something
left, something substantial.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.350
And now, I also
realized that when

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:00.000
you're trying to set a
record on a very long trail,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.835
it's not about speed,
or strength, or gender.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.510
What do you think
it's all about?

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.240
You guys tell me.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.615
What do you think
it's all about?

00:22:11.732 --> 00:22:13.440
You can point, if you
don't want to talk.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.240
Here, here, here, right?

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.850
Support-- someone has to
help you along the way.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.080
There's a lot of factors.

00:22:25.242 --> 00:22:26.950
But I was thinking
through those factors.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.766
And now there was this small
voice inside me that said,

00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:34.610
I might have what it would
take to set the overall record.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.870
But I took that voice,
and I just [SWOOSH]

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:40.850
buried it down deep.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.550
And I thought it would
probably go away.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.080
And the next two
summers, Brew and I

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.320
agreed to hike much
shorter trails.

00:22:48.245 --> 00:22:49.870
Granted, when I say
shorter, I am still

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.990
talking about 500 miles.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:55.100
So they were decent
trails, but shorter.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.010
We hiked at a slower
pace, side by side.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.270
And even Brew would tell
you that we had so much fun.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.120
We went out-- there's
a trail in Colorado

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.210
from Denver to Durango.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.085
So we did that together,
and it was awesome.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.330
And then the following summer,
we went over to Europe.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.250
And there are foot paths
everywhere in Europe.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.230
And we just had this
incredible time.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.830
But meanwhile, what do you think
happened to the small voice?

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.530
Did it go away?

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.220
No, use your hands again.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.140
Got bigger, got stronger,
and it got to the point

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.530
where I knew there
were only two options.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:36.300
Either we would go back and try,
at least try, for the record.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.230
Or else I would
always look back,

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.780
and I would always wonder
what might have been.

00:23:41.952 --> 00:23:43.160
And I didn't want to do that.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.065
So I sat down with Brew, and
we had a long conversation.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.510
And I was shameless.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.300
I used every bribe,
every bargaining chip

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:56.530
I could think of, which included
football game tickets, really

00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:00.200
good craft beer, and
also future offspring.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.700
I figured if I was going
to carry his stuff for nine

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.155
months, then he should carry
mine a little bit more.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.050
And it worked.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.430
He agreed to help
me one more time.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:17.470
So in the summer of
2011, we went back

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.080
to the Appalachian Trail
for the third time.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.800
Do we have any East
Coasters in here?

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.900
OK, I'll ask the question.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.240
We decided we wanted a start
in Maine, not down in Georgia.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:29.740
Why?

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.710
AUDIENCE: The heat.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:33.460
AUDIENCE: Weather.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:33.930
BREW DAVIS: Mosquitoes.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:34.930
JENNIFER DAVIS: Weather?

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.830
We actually got the
worst of the bugs.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.840
We traded the maximum
amount of daylight

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.920
for the worst of the bugs.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:47.580
But weather, crowds-- wanting to
hike home, that was part of it.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.040
However, the primary reason
we wanted to start up in Maine

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.660
is because Maine and New
Hampshire are the toughest

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.710
two states on the entire path.

00:24:56.866 --> 00:24:58.240
Most of the time,
hiking up there

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.020
is not just walking
with your feet.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.540
It's literally
scrambling up mountains,

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.674
or sort of sliding down them.

00:25:04.674 --> 00:25:07.090
And if you're going to get
knocked off because of weather,

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.548
it's probably going to happen
up in Maine or New Hampshire.

00:25:10.692 --> 00:25:12.150
So we thought,
well, let's just get

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.399
through that in the beginning.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.580
So we started up in
Maine in mid-June.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.322
And for the first
few days, everything

00:25:19.322 --> 00:25:20.780
went about how we
thought it would.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.230
Then on day five,
I was going up one

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.170
those steep mounts in Maine.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.700
And on my way to the summit,
I noticed a sharp pain

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.780
that was developing
in my right leg

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.390
in between my knee and my ankle.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.300
And by the time I
got up the ridge,

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.660
I was in so much discomfort
that all I could do

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.680
was limp down the trail.

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:48.270
And I kept limping until
the exact same pain that

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:53.270
was in my right leg
developed in my left leg.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.315
By the end of the afternoon,
I had full blown shin splints.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.890
And I can usually
look out, and I

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.040
can tell exactly who's
had shin splints.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.570
Because I'll say the word,
and folks will be grimace

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.969
if they've had
them, just grimace

00:26:08.969 --> 00:26:10.260
like it's the worst thing ever.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.370
Because it's the
worst thing ever.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.454
It really is.

00:26:14.454 --> 00:26:16.120
And if you've had
shin splints, then you

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.150
know walking is very difficult.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.736
Going uphill is excruciating.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:26.060
But going downhill
is unbearable.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.670
There were times on my descent
where I would plant my foot,

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.360
and my leg would just buckle
beneath me because of the pain,

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.880
and I collapsed
down to the trail.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.540
But I was convinced
that my injury

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.300
had been caused by
the high mileage

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.700
days on the rocks in Maine.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.080
I trained really hard,
but I trained down south

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.910
where we have a lot
of nice dirt trails.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.450
And up in Maine
and New Hampshire,

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:56.500
they have a lot of exposed,
unforgiving granite.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:03.040
However, if I can just make it
to Vermont-- Vermont's trail

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.080
name, its nickname,
is actually Vermud.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:06.790
It is.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.790
It's the one state
where you take a step,

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.910
and you lift your
foot, and the shoe

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.449
is no longer attached to it.

00:27:12.449 --> 00:27:13.490
You know what I'm saying?

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.110
It's shoe sucking mud.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.910
It's sloppy.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.280
And it's messy.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.545
But it's soft.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.550
And I thought it
might be soft enough

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.450
to where my legs
could start to heal.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.067
So that was my goal--
get to Vermont.

00:27:28.067 --> 00:27:30.150
And all I had to do was
hike through New Hampshire

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:30.910
to make it there.

00:27:32.521 --> 00:27:33.020
Exactly.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:38.060
And even getting
into New Hampshire,

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.810
I was in so much pain
that almost every time I

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:44.650
got to the top of the mountain,
I would actually turn around

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.030
and then hike or scramble
downhill backwards.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.040
And you see a lot of hikers
on the Appalachian Trail.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.100
And no one once stopped and
asked me, hey, aren't you

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.055
that girl who's trying
to set the record?

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.080
No, but at that
point on the trail,

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.760
someone literally
stopped and asked

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.120
if I was lost or confused.

00:28:04.034 --> 00:28:06.700
They thought I was backtracking,
because I was hiking backwards.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:13.310
Yeah, but like so
many times in life--

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.110
and I think especially
with technology--

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.800
like so many times
in life, by being

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.300
willing to take a
few steps backwards,

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.140
I was able to keep
going forward.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.220
And I got to New Hampshire.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.910
And if there's one state on the
entire trail where I wake up

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.060
and I just pray for good
weather, it's New Hampshire.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.995
When I arrived, I had 24
hours of decent weather.

00:28:39.184 --> 00:28:41.225
Then I started up the
slopes of Mount Washington.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.056
And Mount Washington
is not only one

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.680
of the highest
mountains on the trail--

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.980
and I'm not going to
tell you how high.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.910
Because you West
Coasters will poo poo it.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:50.760
But it's high.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:57.490
And at one point, it had the
highest recorded wind speed

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:58.920
of any place on the planet.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.680
It's notorious for its
wind and its bad weather.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.460
And sure enough, as soon
as I got above tree line,

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.670
wind picked up.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.350
We're talking the type of
wind that can knock you over.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.480
And then the clouds rolled in.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.150
And then on top of that,
the rain started to fall.

00:29:17.387 --> 00:29:18.970
And out of all the
trails I've walked,

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:20.690
the Appalachian
Trail, relatively,

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:21.990
is the most well marked.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.490
It's very difficult
to get lost on the AT.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:28.740
Until you're above tree line,
and the next trail marker

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.334
is 40 yards away, and
you can't see 10 feet

00:29:31.334 --> 00:29:32.250
in front of your face.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.485
Then it becomes very
easy to get lost.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:38.430
And I got off trail.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:41.367
It took several hours
and several miles for me

00:29:41.367 --> 00:29:41.950
to re-correct.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.380
And even when I got
back to the right path,

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.040
it was such slow going.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.780
Because all those rocks
were slick, wet rocks.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.800
And I was slipping.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.530
I was falling.

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:59.690
But I kept telling myself
that, at some point,

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.342
it would have to change.

00:30:01.342 --> 00:30:02.800
It couldn't stay
like that forever.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:09.040
And it finally changed after a
day and half of torrential rain

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.880
when I got up to
another high ridge.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.430
And there, the
last week of June,

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.915
I was no longer
in the rainstorm.

00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:18.080
Because now I was in the
middle of a sleet storm.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.196
And I thought I was prepared.

00:30:22.196 --> 00:30:24.390
I had great gear.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.640
But I don't care what type
of Gore-Tex you're wearing.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.960
After a day and half straight
of pounding rain, water gets in,

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.210
or sweat does not get out.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.120
So I was up there
soaking wet, shivering.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.240
I was starving.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.080
And yes, I always have to
explain, I did have extra food.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.930
But again, at some point,
you lose A, the dexterity,

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.630
or B, the desire, to open
another frozen Clif Bar

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:48.470
and just lick it.

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.910
That is not much fun.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.210
So I was up there.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.720
And I was in bad shape.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.590
And I wanted to do
anything to take

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:56.825
my mind off the conditions.

00:30:57.932 --> 00:30:59.640
And I mentioned earlier
that when I sing,

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.860
I have a horrible voice.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.910
But when things go
really bad on the trail,

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:07.670
I'll start to sing to help
take my mind off of it.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:12.240
And I decided to belt out
one of my favorite tunes

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.070
up on the ridge.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:16.128
But from the very
beginning I was just

00:31:16.128 --> 00:31:17.430
s-s-slurring the s-s-song.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:24.800
And I was [STAMMERING]
mumbling all the words.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.610
And, oh yeah, I was tripping
like every five or six steps.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:34.360
So finally, I acknowledged
what, deep down, I already knew.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.135
I was moderately hypothermic.

00:31:37.422 --> 00:31:39.970
And it was becoming a
lot worse very quickly.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:44.790
By the time I got to the base
of the mountain, I was so cold

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.022
and I was so stiff that I
could barely been my joints.

00:31:48.022 --> 00:31:50.230
I remember, because there
were all these rocks steps,

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:51.780
and I kept feeling
like I could not

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.660
bend my knee to get
to the next one.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.135
But Brew-- we have
not communicated.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.255
He assumed, my
husband assumed, there

00:32:00.255 --> 00:32:02.340
had been really nasty weather.

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.850
And so he hiked in
as far as he could.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:06.450
And he set up our tent.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:10.020
And as soon as I saw
the tent, I got inside.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.315
Now, I was so rigid, I
couldn't even undress myself.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.590
He had to help me out
of cold, wet clothes

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.630
into two sleeping bags.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:22.200
And for the next 30 minutes, I
lay there and I just shivered.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:28.386
But when I finally started to
relax just a little bit, what

00:32:28.386 --> 00:32:29.760
do you think I
wanted to do next?

00:32:30.744 --> 00:32:31.660
AUDIENCE: Get back up.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.160
JENNIFER DAVIS: Get up, yeah,
wait, I heard a lot of things.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.170
They're all correct, but the
first thing I wanted to do

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:37.850
was eat.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.550
And food is wonderful
medicine for hypothermia.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.470
It warms you from
the inside out.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:49.370
And in the next 20 minutes, I
consumed over 3,000 calories.

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.890
Yeah, yeah, and I
know that for a fact,

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.810
because Brew took some
type of sick pleasure

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.510
in actually counting, keeping
a running tally of all

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.980
the calories that I was eating
on every single wrapper.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:03.400
So at that point, I felt
a little bit better.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.275
And I wanted to
try to keep hiking.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.490
And Brew packed in the tent.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:09.550
He brought the food.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.396
He even remembered
extra clothes.

00:33:12.396 --> 00:33:16.950
So I was able to put on a warm
fleece and a dry rain jacket.

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:18.850
But as I was getting
dressed, I realized

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.240
there was not an
extra pair of pants.

00:33:23.009 --> 00:33:24.550
So I turned to the
corner of the tent

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.760
where my cold,
wet, icy rain pants

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.000
sat in the middle of a puddle.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.185
And then I turned to my husband.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.270
I glanced back at the
puddle, and back at Brew,

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.810
and just said, I
want your pants.

00:33:43.032 --> 00:33:44.610
And my husband's
here, by the way.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:47.660
I'm hoping you'll get to meet
him at the end of the talk.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.590
But he is the sweetest guy.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.020
And this is so Brew.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.690
He did not bat an eye.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:53.820
He did not disagree.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.340
All he said during
this entire exchange

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.070
was, at least ask nicely.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.760
He's like, at least say please.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:02.650
So I did.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.560
And then I kept
hiking in his pants.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.219
And he packed up all our gear
and marched everything back

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:11.760
to the road crossing
on June 27 wearing

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.909
the "Grinch that Stole
Christmas" boxers.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:16.815
I will never, never
forget that detail.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.630
But I tell that
story not to talk

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.870
about my husband's underwear.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.610
I tell that story, like so
many others that I could share,

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:29.300
because it clearly illustrates
that it's the support.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.930
It's the support that's so
key in this type of endeavor.

00:34:35.107 --> 00:34:37.440
If Brew had not assumed that
there had been bad weather,

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.360
if he had not hiked
in, if he had forgotten

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.560
the extra food or
the extra clothes,

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.159
I would not have been
able to keep going.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:48.540
And I know people ask
all the time, why would

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.560
you want to set a record?

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.302
What's valuable about
that experience?

00:34:52.302 --> 00:34:54.260
And for me, one thing
that was really important

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.130
was it took this trail that,
when I hiked as a 21 year old,

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.820
it had taught me all about
independence and self

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.220
sufficiency.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.740
But now, eight years later, it's
teaching me all about teamwork.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.920
It was teaching
me that sometimes

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.671
being able to ask for help is
far more important than being

00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:14.170
independent.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:18.430
And it was teaching me that
a strong team is always

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.263
going to be better than
a strong individual.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.590
I'll be the first to admit
that there have been folks who

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.650
I consider to be much
better athletes who

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.800
have gone after this mark, and
they have not been successful.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.814
Because they did not
have the level of support

00:35:32.814 --> 00:35:33.480
that I received.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:38.640
And there were a lot
of folks who helped us.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.360
But Brew was the only one who
was with me from the beginning

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.450
all the way to the end.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:46.000
And when I think
about our record,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.029
I believe it has more
to do with his support

00:35:48.029 --> 00:35:49.070
than with my athleticism.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.184
And one of the reasons I
say that is because I know I

00:35:54.184 --> 00:35:55.350
would have quit without him.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:58.470
We got into Vermont.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.140
And I still had my shin splints.

00:36:02.077 --> 00:36:04.410
Now I had these weird side
effects from the hypothermia.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:08.030
And because of that,
or on top of that,

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.700
I got really, really sick.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.535
And that's not fun at
home, but it's especially

00:36:14.535 --> 00:36:15.410
not fun on the trail.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.522
The type of sick I had, I
wasn't even on the trail,

00:36:19.522 --> 00:36:20.590
you know what I'm saying?

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:25.070
I was just running off
trail every few minutes,

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.600
grabbing striped maple
leaves, every-- I mean,

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.110
I was just miserable.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.540
I was depleted, dehydrated.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.550
And giving all that
I could, I still

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.670
couldn't go one mile per hour.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:43.171
So for the first time
on any trail, I quit.

00:36:43.171 --> 00:36:43.670
I quit.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:46.445
100% in my mind, I was finished.

00:36:46.445 --> 00:36:49.080
I was just going to get to
that next road crossing.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.600
And when I made it there,
we were headed home.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.520
So I finally arrived.

00:36:55.656 --> 00:36:57.030
I walked out of
the woods crying.

00:36:58.304 --> 00:36:59.470
And Brew was waiting for me.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.470
So I told him how sick I was.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:02.710
I told him how much I hurt.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.876
And I told him that we were
finished with the trail.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.890
And this was the man who gave
me the pants off his body.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.610
I knew that he was going
to wrap me up in his arms,

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:15.990
tell me it was OK, and then
help get me to some place where

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.290
I could start to feel better.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.285
So I looked at him
waiting for my embrace.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.726
And he looked back at me, and
he basically said, suck it up.

00:37:27.726 --> 00:37:28.622
Suck it up.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.090
And there's this strange
phenomenon where every time I

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.520
tell this story, I literally get
a little angry at my husband.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.750
I get a little bit mad.

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:42.095
But when it actually
happened, I was shocked.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.370
I was caught
completely off guard.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.640
Because he'll tell you--
we had talked about it.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.010
This was my dream, not his.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.800
He said if it were
up to him, we would

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.080
be having a normal vacation like
a normal family that summer.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.340
Yet here we were in Vermont.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.030
We were both uncomfortable.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.690
It was hot.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:01.280
It was humid.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.650
There were black
flies everywhere.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:06.190
I had never felt so
bad in my entire life.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.090
And he wouldn't let me quit.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.090
And here's what he said.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.650
He said, if you
really want to quit,

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:15.200
if that's truly what
you want, that's fine.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.980
But you just can't
quit right now.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.650
He said, right now,
I think you feel

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.185
too bad to make a good decision.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:27.620
So he said, I want you eat,
drink, take medicine, and then

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.750
just keep going
until tomorrow night.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:34.628
And tomorrow night, if you want
to quit, I'll take you home.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.390
And I left that road
crossing counting

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:44.460
the minutes and the miles
until I could officially stop.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.680
But after several miles
passed, the medicine kicked in.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.990
I was able to hold in
some food and some water.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:53.435
And I felt a little better.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.250
But when I felt a little
better, I still felt horrible.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.630
And no part of me thought
that I could set the record.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:04.860
Because I was doing the math.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.660
I was there on day 12
averaging 38 miles a day.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.960
And that meant every
day until the end,

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.600
for five straight
weeks, I was going

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.320
to have to hike an
average of 50 miles a day.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:20.610
And I didn't think
that was possible.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.870
But I realized that my ultimate
goal was not to set the record.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.390
My ultimate goal was to
find my best on the trail.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.220
We had talked about--
Brew is a planner.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.230
So we're always talking
five or 10 years out.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:38.000
And we knew we wanted our
next adventure to be a family.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.330
I wanted to be a mom.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:40.260
I wanted to have kids.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.710
And I didn't want to have
to look back and just always

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.120
wonder, what did 100% look
like for me on the trail?

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:49.340
I wanted that answer.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:53.880
And so I decided to keep going,
not necessarily for the record,

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.380
but to really find what
my best was on the trail.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.902
And there was this huge
psychological shift

00:40:01.902 --> 00:40:02.485
that occurred.

00:40:03.672 --> 00:40:05.130
Because up until
that point, we had

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:10.230
fixated on numbers-- miles
per hour, miles per day,

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.980
where the previous record
setter was at any given point.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.920
And in a lot of ways, it
was his hike, not ours.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.650
But after Vermont,
the one thing we

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.820
said every day was,
just do your best.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.120
And after 46 days
of doing our best

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.345
and leaving it all out on
the trail, we got to the end.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:34.200
And when we arrived, we--
again, it was kind of a surprise

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.330
that we accomplished what
almost everyone thought

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:40.440
was impossible, and at times
what I thought was impossible.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.100
But Brew never believed
that it was impossible.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.180
We set the overall record,
and it was the first time

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:51.110
that a woman had surpassed
the mark of a man

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:52.180
on a long distance trail.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:54.675
So it got some attention.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.219
It got some praise.

00:40:57.219 --> 00:40:58.135
It got some criticism.

00:40:59.191 --> 00:41:00.440
And it got a lot of questions.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.887
But here's what frustrated me.

00:41:03.887 --> 00:41:05.470
No one was asking
the right questions.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.680
No one really got
what it was all about.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.184
And I'm winding down.

00:41:11.184 --> 00:41:12.850
I know you all have
to get back to work.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.680
But I want to take
a quick minute

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:19.070
and read a passage from my
new book, "Called Again," that

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.490
shares some of my
feelings and frustrations

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.200
right after we finished.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.020
"After the journey
was over, Brew and I

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.110
immediately gave
multiple interviews

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.610
and answered copious
amounts of questions.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:38.245
But no one seemed to be
asking the right questions.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:42.960
No one once asked
what I had learned.

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.120
No one asked what the most
valuable part of the experience

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.090
had been.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.715
Instead, everyone
focused on the numbers.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:55.530
They wanted to talk about
how I hiked, and did not

00:41:55.530 --> 00:42:00.140
run, 46.93 miles per day.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.450
They asked what I had
to eat to consume over

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:05.390
6,000 calories per day.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.627
And they asked if I was scared
to see 36 bears that summer.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.140
Scared?

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.100
That was one of the
highlights of the trip.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.700
Why didn't anyone
ask about the notions

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.770
of living in the present or
choosing something purposeful

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.210
and fulfilling over
something fun and easy?

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.910
What about the necessity
of asking other people

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:31.600
for help and of not succumbing
to the fear of failure,

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.550
or the idea that persistence
and consistency can

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:37.057
be more valuable than
speed and strength?

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.030
Why didn't they
ask about everyone

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.000
else who had helped us?

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.050
Wasn't it clear that this
was a group endeavor?

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:48.120
And what about Brew?

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.850
Why did no one realize that
the most miraculous part

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:52.980
of the summer was
not the record,

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.160
but how well my
husband had loved me

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.650
and served me along the way?"

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.470
I know that records
are misunderstood.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.440
And I don't expect anyone
to leave here today and want

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.950
to go hike 47 miles.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.550
But I hope you do you
leave here knowing

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.280
that when it comes
to the record,

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.790
it's about more
than the numbers.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:19.100
And one thing I really
like about the record,

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.670
or the fastest known time, or
whatever you want to call it,

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:23.720
is that it's an amateur pursuit.

00:43:24.917 --> 00:43:26.500
So you're doing it
for the love of it.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.120
It's based on the honor system.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:32.050
And I promise you, when you get
to the end, there's no trophy.

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.090
There's not even a free t-shirt.

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:35.180
There's nothing there.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.460
But that doesn't mean
there isn't a reward.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.920
And I've hiked in a
lot of different ways.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.086
And that's one thing I love.

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:45.680
It doesn't matter if I'm
backpacking, or guiding a trip,

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.630
or going out for a day
hike with my daughter.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.860
Every time I go outdoors,
there's a reward.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.670
And that's my hope
for all of you.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:55.410
I know you spend a
lot of time indoors

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:57.330
solving all the
world's problems.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:00.600
But I hope that you take some
time to go outdoors and find

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.780
your reward as well.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.593
Thank you.

00:44:03.593 --> 00:44:06.491
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:16.550
So I do have one last slide
show that includes pictures

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.560
from the Appalachian
Trail and our record.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.880
But before I show that, I do
want to introduce my husband.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.510
And if you don't
have to run off,

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:25.060
we'd love to take questions.

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.820
So we'll take about five or
six minutes of questions,

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.930
show the final slide show.

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:31.763
And then if you all are
interested in books,

00:44:31.763 --> 00:44:34.920
Google has them available
at a discount for $10.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.930
And we're happy to sign
those for you as well.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.580
So let's start with questions.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:40.080
Yeah.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.454
AUDIENCE: Have
you done the-- I'm

00:44:41.454 --> 00:44:43.340
going to butcher the
pronunciation-- Kalalau

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.732
Trail on Kauai in Hawaii?

00:44:45.732 --> 00:44:48.030
JENNIFER DAVIS: Oh, is
that the one on the cliffs?

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:50.003
JENNIFER DAVIS: No,
we went to Hawaii.

00:44:50.003 --> 00:44:53.440
Bu we had our then 16
month old daughter.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.730
And we decided that was probably
not a family-friendly hike.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.540
Yeah, stay away from the cliffs.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.270
But we've heard about it.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.660
And the hiking in
Hawaii was incredible.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.540
And we would love to
go back and do more.

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.840
AUDIENCE: Where did
you hike in Hawaii?

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.673
Because I'm looking to
do some hiking there.

00:45:07.673 --> 00:45:10.240
JENNIFER DAVIS: Sure, we were
on the Big Island, in Oahu.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.265
And we hiked a lot.

00:45:12.265 --> 00:45:13.640
BREW DAVIS: The
Big Island, there

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.940
is a place called Waipio
Valley that's west of Hilo.

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:21.820
And we went there, and we hiked
in Volcanoes National Park.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:28.000
And then I guess on Oahu,
we did some shorter hikes

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.940
on the northwest
side of the island.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.480
I can't remember the names.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.610
But the ones that
would be recognizable,

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.490
we hiked around
Diamond Head and--

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:35.550
JENNIFER DAVIS: Manoa Falls.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.860
BREW DAVIS:--Park, like
the close parks, yeah.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:39.960
But there's--

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.110
JENNIFER DAVIS: We
hiked in Volcanoes.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:41.930
Did you say that?

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.170
BREW DAVIS: Yeah, a lot
of good hiking in Hawaii.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:45.070
It's pretty rugged.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:47.634
Because it's just
muddy and slippery.

00:45:47.634 --> 00:45:49.050
JENNIFER DAVIS:
And volcanic, too.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.883
BREW DAVIS: Yeah, Manoa
Falls, that's right.

00:45:52.432 --> 00:45:53.765
JENNIFER DAVIS: Other questions?

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.340
Yeah?

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.465
AUDIENCE: So before you go
out on these long hikes,

00:45:57.465 --> 00:45:59.208
how do you prepare yourself?

00:45:59.208 --> 00:46:01.580
What kind of training do you do?

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.560
JENNIFER DAVIS: Yeah, I
try to train physically.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.140
The thing I think is
most helpful is climbing,

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.560
exercises with climbing.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.760
Cycling is really good.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.500
I like to wear a heavy
pack even when I train.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.275
Because it helps
develop those muscles.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.560
But anything physical
you can do is helpful.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.670
I think it's important
to prepare emotionally.

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.820
Most people get off for
emotional reasons, not

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.480
physical reasons.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.570
So be prepared to be away
from friends and family

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:30.490
and not take showers every day.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.630
You have to kind of wrap
your head around that.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.200
And then some people,
really they'll

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.120
just kind of get in
shape on the trail,

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.460
which you can also do that.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.300
Because with work and
life, sometimes it's

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.550
hard to train or prepare.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.500
And the most important
thing is to not

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.800
try to go too fast too soon,
or carry too much weight.

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.258
Because then you are more likely
to get injured, especially

00:46:50.258 --> 00:46:51.860
if you haven't gotten ready.

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:53.830
AUDIENCE: What would
be your favorite hike

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:56.442
or your favorite place to go?

00:46:57.329 --> 00:46:59.620
JENNIFER DAVIS: The Appalachian
Trail's asked the most.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:00.453
It's given the most.

00:47:00.453 --> 00:47:01.530
So it's my favorite.

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:05.010
But on top of that,
we loved Iceland.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:05.980
We love Corsica.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:09.530
There's 125 mile trail that
runs the length of Corsica.

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:12.065
I really liked Peru.

00:47:13.252 --> 00:47:14.835
BREW DAVIS: We did
the Colorado Trail.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.120
That's about a not quite
500 mile trail from Durango

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:19.780
to Denver.

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.599
And it's really
stunning, especially,

00:47:21.599 --> 00:47:23.265
in the southern part
closest to Durango.

00:47:25.362 --> 00:47:27.070
Tour de Mont Blanc,
did you mention that?

00:47:27.859 --> 00:47:29.650
JENNIFER DAVIS: It was
in the photos, but--

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:31.710
BREW DAVIS: Tour de Mont
Blanc-- Italy, France,

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:33.270
and Switzerland,
that's a good one.

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:34.630
JENNIFER DAVIS: We'd
do them all again.

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:35.338
BREW DAVIS: Yeah.

00:47:36.716 --> 00:47:38.090
JENNIFER DAVIS:
It's the problem.

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:38.590
Yeah?

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:42.573
AUDIENCE: So I heard there was
a current PCT yo-yo attempt.

00:47:42.573 --> 00:47:45.447
Would you be interested in
doing anything like that?

00:47:46.834 --> 00:47:49.000
JENNIFER DAVIS: For me, the
Appalachian Trail record

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.080
was kind of the pinnacle of
these feats of endurance.

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.510
Partly because it's one
of the oldest marks.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:00.850
The first person the yo-yo the
PCT, I think it was in 2006.

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:03.500
So it's a relatively new
thing, and a very hard thing

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.660
to accomplish.

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.250
Plus having a family--
doing it one way

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:10.910
is going to take, even if you
do it really fast, three months.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:14.790
Doing it both ways, you're
gone for half of the year.

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.840
So now, my ultimate goal is
just to get people outdoors

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.450
and to experience the trail
in as many different ways as

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:23.110
possible.

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:25.600
And I'm fortunate that
everything lined up

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.700
and I got to try for the record.

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.140
But now we're section hikers,
meaning we do it in pieces.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.170
And we have the guiding
company at home,

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:34.950
so we get people
outdoors that way.

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:37.720
And it's good.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.260
We take our daughter outside.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.210
It's definitely
a different pace.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:41.930
It's not better.

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:42.630
It's not worse.

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:45.185
It's just all about seasons.

00:48:45.185 --> 00:48:48.090
AUDIENCE: How much time did
you spend planning this hike?

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:49.090
BREW DAVIS: Very little.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.460
We have a friend.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:56.940
He knows the roads around the
Appalachian Trail really well.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:00.480
Because he himself
has hiked it 17 times.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.610
And he's also run
support for people.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:08.940
And so before we started hiking,
we got the data book out.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:11.030
And he would highlight
roads and say,

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:13.580
these are the roads that
you should focus on.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:20.380
And I was teaching middle
school until the day

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.130
before we left for the trail.

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:27.580
And I think I also had sort of
banked knowledge of the trail

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.920
from when she did it in
2008, and I had already

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:30.590
done a support.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.526
So for her, it was she knew
what she was going to do.

00:49:33.526 --> 00:49:34.650
She was just going to hike.

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:38.600
For me, it was using
prior knowledge

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:42.740
and our friend's
knowledge to not get

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:43.940
turned around on the roads.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.660
And I have a pretty good
sense of direction, too.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.710
So I could rely on that.

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:49.390
So we didn't really plan
that part very much at all.

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:51.190
And we kind of
did it on the fly,

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.640
realized that we needed-- it
might be beneficial for Jen

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.377
to have some people
to hike with her

00:49:56.377 --> 00:49:57.710
and give her some help that way.

00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:58.590
JENNIFER DAVIS: Yeah.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:03.080
AUDIENCE: After all this
journey of life that you have,

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.020
how can Jennifer define herself?

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:10.030
JENNIFER DAVIS: Not by
hiking, surprisingly.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:14.190
That's been key for me,
even going for the record,

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.580
is I thought, I
have to be fulfilled

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.380
whether we set this or not.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:24.210
And the trail for me, that
first journey was so important.

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:26.610
Because it taught me
it's OK to just be me.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:27.110
It is.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.570
And the natural setting
helps you feel natural.

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:32.100
It helps you be yourself.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.140
But being a hiker
doesn't define me.

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.890
I have a really wonderful
family and a strong faith.

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:42.970
And as long as I can, I'm going
to hike, and walk, and run.

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:44.840
But it's not the only thing.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:50.210
So I think what frustrated
me about the questions

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:51.940
is everyone focused
on the end result.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:53.990
No one asked about
what got us there.

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:56.109
And no one realized
that the things that

00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:57.650
helped us do well
on the record could

00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:01.030
be applied to anything in life.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:03.630
We run a small company,
and the trail--

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:03.966
BREW DAVIS: It's going to be
like Google in a few years,

00:51:03.966 --> 00:51:04.000
probably.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.310
JENNIFER DAVIS: --was
my business school.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:06.340
Yeah, it's going to
be just like Google.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.950
BREW DAVIS: Right now,
it's kind of small.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:08.900
JENNIFER DAVIS: But the
trail was my business school.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.441
It taught me how to budget, and
work with all different types

00:51:11.441 --> 00:51:13.470
of people, and not give up.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.680
That's a huge thing
with a small business.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.720
So I think it's got a lot
of really good lessons.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.470
And it helps you figure
out your strengths

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.500
while you're out there.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.530
Yeah, so I do think I want
to show the last slide show.

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.760
If you all have more questions,
we'll be hanging out.

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.051
You guys probably need to work.

00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:31.070
But we'll be here.

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:32.270
And we can sign books.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.840
And we want to thank you all,
and really thank Andrew too,

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.070
for making this possible.

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:38.615
So we'll conclude with this
last two minute slide show.

00:51:39.946 --> 00:51:44.682
