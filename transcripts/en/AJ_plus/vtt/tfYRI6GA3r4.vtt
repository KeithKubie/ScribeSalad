00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.350
California became the first "sanctuary
state" in the country this year when it

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.540
enacted new legislation to prevent law
enforcement from carrying out President

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.080
Trump's crackdown on the undocumented.
But now, fears here are growing amid

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.800
reports that ICE is planning to launch a
massive sweep targeting northern

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.570
California. There are almost 400,000
undocumented immigrants in the San

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.280
Francisco Bay Area alone and we're about
to visit the Oakland home of an

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.200
undocumented woman who is preparing her
family for the worst.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.180
Wendy is a 34-year-old single mother from Honduras who cleans houses for a living.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.360
Her two children were born in the U.S. She fled
extreme poverty and remains undocumented

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.760
after living here for 15 years. But she's
defiant, despite the threat of possible deportation.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.940
Why are you so unafraid to
the point where you're okay showing your face?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.540
You know, for a long time I was scared. Then, one day I said,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.920
“Stop, no more."

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.280
She isn't only talking about ICE. Wendy's
partner was abusive for years and nearly

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.280
killed her until she ultimately escaped
with her children to a women's shelter.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.820
Now, she only fears one thing —
 deportation.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.780
The recent threats of massive raids have prompted
Wendy and others like her to literally

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.860
prepare for their nightmare scenario.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.620
There’s this bag.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.100
So that duffle bag is like an emergency bag, just in case you have to go?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.820
Yes, I just get it and that’s it.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.240
What do you have in there? You don’t have to show me.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.360
I have clothes for my kids – two changes for my son, two for my daughter and two for me.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360
Wow.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:30.380
This is the card in case ICE comes to my house. I take this card, and you have it in Spanish and English.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.380
In case ICE comes to your door.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.120
And then how else are
you preparing? What else do you have?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:12.880
I have my papers and my son’s documents. The certificate for my son and my daughter’s papers.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.520
My passport – this is the most important, and I have it with me every day.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.900
You know, I have the process for the U-visa, and I have with me in case something happens.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.780
So you have everything prepared at all times with you?

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.300
Yes, I have this folder with me every day.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.240
Are your kids scared? Or at least your son, who’s older?

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:46.100
Yeah, my son is scared. He cries and looks at the phone and hears other people saying,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.560
“My mom is not from here, my mom will be deported.” He cries and says,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.120
“I depend on you, mom. What's going on with me and my sister if you aren’t here?”

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:04.680
When I wake up every day, I ask him: “God, please, I pray, with my hands, take care of me and my family.”

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.280
Every day, when I go outside, I say, “I’m not scared if you’re with me, you take care of me and my family.”

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.580
And for right now, it’s worked.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.440
