00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.560
I'm Renaldo Lemos, I'm the director of
the Institute for Technology and Society

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.980
of Rio de Janeiro and we're just at the
end of the Artificial Intelligence and

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.789
inclusion seminar that just took place
in Rio. And for me the most important

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.890
thing that we discussed is "what is the
impact of artificial intelligence over inequality?"

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.859
So it seems like artificial intelligence is going to be a game in

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.599
which the winner takes it all, so the
question is, who's going to be the winner?

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.570
Is it the United States? Is it China? So
does that mean that a lot of resources

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.120
are going to flow to those two countries,
and what does it mean for the entire

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.660
geopolitical repercussions of that. Number one thing is to invest in science.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.210
I think developing countries have to take science as a priority.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.000
We cannot afford not to participate in these debates.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.600
Second thing is to invest in education. So training people for new skills is also extremely important

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600
in a moment in which there's a lot of possibilities of job insecurity

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.329
and transformations in the job market. So
these are the new forms of

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.619
infrastructure. The infrastructure of the
future will be investing in people.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.570
Tthat's the way that it will actually
prevent a lot of the bad effects that

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.890
Artificial Intelligence might have. In
Brazil we have the Marco Civil law

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.750
which is a bill of rights for the
internet, and basically what it does it

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.490
regulates from fundamental rights online.
So I think that can be a good

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.920
inspiration for artificial intelligence, especially because the process in which

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.009
it was built was a collaborative process.
We call it a multi-stakeholder process,

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.039
and I think that's the best way to build
public policy regarding technology, when

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.049
all sectors of society actually have a
say in the outcome of regulations.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.429
So I think that this experience that
Brazil has had with the Marco Civil

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.220
can actually inform in terms of process
how we should deal with challenges, for

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.000
instance like artificial intelligence,
and the policy issues that is going to bring.
