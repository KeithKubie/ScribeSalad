00:01:49.354 --> 00:01:53.306
They called me, I think, like 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.771
By 7 o'clock that evening, Carmela and her four children

00:01:56.774 --> 00:01:59.009
were moving into the Church of the Advocate.

00:02:02.827 --> 00:02:06.127
It was an act of resistance against the tone in this country

00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:09.406
and the practice that was going on within the administration

00:02:09.408 --> 00:02:14.557
to attempt to continue to marginalize and criminalize people

00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:16.556
who are coming to this country for asylum.

00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:18.738
Who are coming here for safety and security.

00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:21.404
I have to resist it in any way that I can.

00:02:21.404 --> 00:02:23.053
And that's also part of my faith.

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:29.537
I believe that social justice work

00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:32.360
is part of the DNA of the Church of the Advocate.

00:03:32.364 --> 00:03:37.917
In 1968, we hosted a meeting of the Black Power conference [with] over 5,000 people.

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:42.152
In 1970, it was a Constitutional convention of the Black Panther's party,

00:03:42.152 --> 00:03:44.026
happened right here in this sanctuary.

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:45.781
And then in 1974,

00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:50.288
we hosted the ordination of the first eleven women to the episcopal priesthood.

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:54.232
We knew that we were also, to some extent, chartering new ground

00:03:54.232 --> 00:04:01.392
in terms of having an African-American congregation welcoming someone from Mexico,

00:04:01.392 --> 00:04:04.782
 who was not a native English speaker, does not speak English at all. 

00:04:39.517 --> 00:04:43.076
What we are doing is not harboring Carmela and her family.

00:04:43.076 --> 00:04:47.454
We've made it real clear from the moment that she stepped foot on the premises,

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:51.595
that ICE officials, everybody who need to know that Carmela's here,

00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:53.210
that has been public knowledge.

00:04:54.488 --> 00:04:57.622
So harboring for me suggests that

00:04:57.622 --> 00:04:59.394
we've been trying to conceal this.

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:00.226
And we haven't.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.124
If the officials want to come in and take possession of Carmela and her children,

00:05:05.124 --> 00:05:07.397
as long as they have the proper paperwork,

00:05:07.396 --> 00:05:09.585
they certainly have their right to do that.
