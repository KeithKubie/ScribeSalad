00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.106
"NUMB WITH SORROW.

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.575
"ROY WAS GONE,

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:13.213
AND I WOULD HAVE TO LIVE MY LIFE
WITHOUT HIM."

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.582
- BEHIND ME IS DIANE MASSEY,

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:19.720
ONE-TIME TRAFFIC REPORTER
FOR K.L.O.W.'S LOCAL NEWS.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.121
SOME PEOPLE
CONSIDER HER TO BE

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:24.424
THE ASHLEY TISDALE
OF TRAFFIC REPORTING.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.994
SHE HAS WRITTEN A MEMOIR
ABOUT COPING WITH THE DEATH

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.162
OF HER HUSBAND, ROY.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:31.965
HE DIED IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT,
IRONICALLY ENOUGH.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.834
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?
[light applause]

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.602
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR WRITING THIS.

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:36.937
- OF COURSE.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.439
- RECENTLY, UH...

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:41.441
I RECENTLY LOST MY WIFE.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:46.013
DIANE WAS A SWEET, SAD WOMAN
IN A HIGHLY VULNERABLE STATE.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.016
I GOT TO HAND IT TO LUCILLE.
SHE CALLED IT.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:53.320
AND DIANE'S NEED FOR LOVING CARE
MADE MY TASK ALL TOO EASY.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:57.357
- IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.992
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THERE IS.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:00.961
- OKAY.
OH.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.963
YEAH, OH. OH, GOD.
- MM-HMM.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.166
THE GLAMOUR OF SLEEPING WITH
A FAMOUS WOMAN WAS UNDENIABLE.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.202
BUT ULTIMATELY,
WE WERE JUST PEOPLE,

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:12.072
AND OUR SEXUAL ENCOUNTER WOULD
END THE WAY THEY USUALLY DO.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.107
- OH, NO!

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.811
[crying]
OH, ROY!

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:19.646
OH.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.648
BRING ME ROY.

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:24.184
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT--I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:27.387
- GIVE ME RO--
BRING ME HIS ASHES.

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.389
BRING ME ROY.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:32.125
[sobbing]

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.862
- ALL RIGHT.
- BRING ME HIS ASHES.

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:44.204
OH, MY ROY.

00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:45.672
OH, MY ROY.

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.741
[sobbing]

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.811
- I'LL PROBABLY, UH--
PROBABLY GET GOING THERE.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.180
- YOU CAN CALL ME IF YOU WANT.
- OKAY.
