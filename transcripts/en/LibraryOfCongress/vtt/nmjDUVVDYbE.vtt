&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer:
Well, good afternoon.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.490
My name is Jason Steinhauer.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.850
I'm a Program Specialist with
The John W. Kluge Center.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.530

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.800
Today's program is titled
1871, The Ruins of Paris.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.840
It features Dr. Peter Brooks,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.140 position:56%
currently a Distinguished Visiting
Scholar at The John W. Kluge Center.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.390
While at The Library of Congress
Dr. Brooks has conducted research

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.110
on Gustave Flaubert, his
novel Sentimental Education

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.240
and the tumultuous events
in Paris in 1870 and 1871.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.830
1871 has been called
the terrible year,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.750
as Napoleon's Third Army was
defeated in the Franco Prussian War

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.400
and an insurgency called
the Paris Commune followed.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.880
It was crushed partially by the
National Government and much

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.640
of central Paris was
burned as a result.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.930
Flaubert visited these ruins of
Paris and found in them a lesson,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.140
if only they had understood the
novel he had published some months

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.290
earlier the cataclysmic destruction
never could have happened.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.580
Dr. Brooks will speak about
this today during his talk.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.900
Dr. Brooks is Sterling [Assumed
Spelling] Professor Emeritus

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.790

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.060
[ Applause ]

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.120
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: Just find a
place for my water bottle here.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.070
Jason, thank you very much.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.310
And before I begin I want to
extend my thanks, as well,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.110
to Lou Reyker [Assumed Spelling],
Dan Terello [Assumed Spelling],

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.960
Travis Hensley [Assumed Spelling]
and all my colleagues here

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.000
at The Kluge Center, which has
been an absolutely wonderful place

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.240
to do research and write.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.050
I recommend it to you all.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.780
And the book I've been writing
here, I'm trying to tell the story

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.750
of what the French still call the
terrible years, Jason mentioned,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.350
as lived by two great writers
who were devoted friends,

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.940
Gustave Flaubert and George
Sonde [Assumed Spelling].

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.460
George Sonde, of course, a woman
writer who used that pseudonym.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.920
And to talk, also, about Flaubert's
novel, Sentimental Education,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.310
which he thought should
have kept his patriots,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.550
compatriots from the
catastrophe they were enduring.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.260 position:56%
It was a year of almost unimaginable
suffering, humiliation, defeat,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.040
hatred, fratricidal conflict.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.100
A year where war and surrendered
were followed by siege, cold,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.410
hunger, then class warfare
on a scale never seen before.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.640
A national bloodletting that left
France traumatized on the threshold

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.640
of its most enduring experiment
with Republican Government,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.940
even as it seemed poised
to retreat into Monarchy.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.800
By the end of the so-called Bloody
Week at the end of May 1871 much

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.980
of central Paris was
a smoking ruin and out

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.690
of these ruins modern
France emerged.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.150 position:56%
But to give as a background just the
barest historical sketch of events,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.710 position:56%
Second Empire France under Napoleon
the Third, who became Emperor a year

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.650
after his Coup d'Etat
on December 2nd, 1851,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.630 position:56%
killed off the fragile Second
Republic born of Revolution in 1848.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.460
That Second Empire seemed
immensely wealthy and powerful.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.160
Paris was the undisputed
Capitol of Europe.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.760
But the Empire came to an
abrupt and unexpected end

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.400
in the Franco Prussian War,
which began in July 1870.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.540
The war was totally unnecessary,
I suppose most wars are

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.910
but this one certainly was.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.080
It was the result of
diplomatic blunders

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.380
and the deliberate provocation
of the German Chancellor,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.210
Otto von Bismarck,
who thought that war

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.850
with France would strengthen his
hand and unify the German states

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.640
under Prussian phylogeny
[Assumed Spelling].

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.410
French confidence in its army

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.830
and its vaunted new Chassepot
bolt action, breach loading rifle,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.430
was unbounded but certainly
misplaced.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.730
Appallingly commanded

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.680
and outmaneuvered the French
Army quickly suffered loss

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.670
after loss on the battlefield.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.100 position:56%
Whole Army Corps were made prisoner.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.280
And then on September 2nd
so was the Emperor, himself.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.160
His fall quickly led to a
quick revolution in Paris

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.960
and the declaration of a new
Republic on September 4th.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.840
But the war was not at all over,
the Prussian Army advanced rapidly

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.450
to Paris, captured the outlying
forts built to defend the city

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.400
and put it under a siege that would
last through a long, frigid winter.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.260 position:56%
The Government of National Defense
struggled to maintain the war effort

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.670
and to keep the Capitol alive.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.960
The City of Light went dark.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.570
Paris ran out of fuel and food.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.200
Trees were chopped down,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.200
the [inaudible] Velunya
[Assumed Spelling] raised.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.720
Eating became a greater
problem with each passing day.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.570
The animals in the Paris
Zoo were sacrificed,

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.800
including the beloved elephants,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.530
Castor and Pollack
[Assumed Spelling].

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.390
They went largely to the
tables of the rich, though.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:28.200
Butchers having exhausted horses,
dogs and cats began selling rats.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.670
Urzatz [Assumed Spelling]
food was the rule,

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.240
including coffee made from acorns.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.610
Besides the Prussians began
bombarding the city in the middle

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.690
of the winter since they got
bored with the French Resistance,

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.840
and that made life dangerous
as well as precarious.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.830
By the end of January the
Government reached an armistice

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.950
with the Prussians
with a stipulation

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.520
that a new French Assembly
would be elected and empowered

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.030
to make a final peace treaty.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.530
Paris finally began to see supplies
arrive from the countryside,

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:06.410
but national elections led to
an ultra-conservative Assembly

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.540
with the majority of its members
dedicated to restoring the Monarchy

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.430
with the old political pro
Adultiere [Assumed Spelling]

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.120
as Provisional Chief Executive.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.380
And then to a peace
treaty in February

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.870
that surrendered the
Provinces of Alsace and most

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.340
of Reven [Assumed Spelling] to
the Germans, levied reparations

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:32.820 position:56%
of 5 billion Francs on France and
stipulated a Prussian victory parade

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.890
down the Champs de Sion
[Assumed Spelling] on March 1st.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:42.090
This capitulation seemed a betrayal
of heroic Parisian resistance.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.180
When the new Government
in March then decided,

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.250
this very conservative
new Government decided

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.650
to terminate a moratorium
on rent payments

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.040
and commercial loan repayments and
also the repossession of items left

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.110
in the pawn shops that the
wartime Government had decreed,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.170
there was also a sense
of class betrayal.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.320
The trigger point was
reached on March 18th

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.240
when Thiers decided he needed
to disarm the National Guard,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.270
which was civilian
militia of dubious loyalty

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.900
to the Conservative Government.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.420
He decided to disarm them
by taking away his cannon,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.100
many of which had been purchased
by published subscription

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.570
and bore affectionate nicknames,

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.090
Victor Hugo was the
name of one of them.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.090
So during the night of
the 17th, 18th of March,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.850
1871 official Army troops climbed

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.360
up to the Boot von Maude [Assumed
Spelling] to the Cannon Park,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.360
which you see in this
photograph from the time,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:51.460 position:56%
a very rare photograph, the only one
of that National Guard Cannon Park.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.150
It was early morning and the
populace, mainly women at first,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:59.100
out to buy their bread
moved to protect the cannon.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.670
The troops ordered to
fire on them, refused.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.850
Two Generals were seized and
then executed later that day.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.760
Thiers and his Ministers fled to
their [inaudible] taking the whole

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.460
of the official Government
with them.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.200
So Paris then declared itself
an independent Commune.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.980
I'm not going to discuss
the Commune, itself.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.040
It's a very complex subject,
it still divides historians.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:30.910 position:56%
A sphinx to the bourgeois mind, Karl
Marx called it, it marked an attempt

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.970
at local Government run
by and for the people,

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.810
by people meaning essentially
the Petite Bourgeoisie, artisans

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:43.240
and workers, are Government
without a single ideology

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.630
but with many strange
strands of socialism mingled

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.480
and largely dominated by the
Coulomb [Assumed Spelling] model

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.590
of classic anarchism, the
notion that power should be kept

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:59.310
in the hands of those affected
directly by its exercise.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.660 position:56%
During its brief existence, 72 days,

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.940
the community instituted
some remarkable reforms,

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.910
but it was from the start at
war with the official Government

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.570
in Versailles and its military
effort was never adequate

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.490
to the situation.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.510
Versailles, which is now the
seat of the official Government,

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.560
waited for the regular
Army to reach full strength

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.090
through the release
of prisoners of war.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:29.240
Bismarck was only too happy to aid
in crushing the Paris proletariat.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.900 position:56%
When invasion came, starting on May
21st, 1871, it was swift and brutal.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.640 position:56%
Many of the commanders in charge had
been trained in French colonial wars

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.500
in Algeria and Mexico and they
treated the Parisian working class

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.910
as if they were natives.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.880
They advanced inexorably through
Paris in a methodical massacre.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.530
They're treating [inaudible]
tried to put a wall of fire

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.660
between themselves
and their attackers.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.970
This is a popular lithograph
of the time

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.820
by a man named Fishou
[Assumed Spelling].

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.480
From enemy shelling and from
defensive fires central Paris was

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.020
in flames.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.110
The two contemporary
lithographs, that by Fishou

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:17.460
and this showing the burning of the
Royal Palace, the Tuileries Palace,

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.150
right across from The
Louvre, which we know today.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.190
These fires, of course, were
to come chief among the crimes

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:30.830
of the Commune, along with the
disastrous decision on the part

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:35.900
of the newly created Committee of
Public Safety towards the very end

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.080
of the Commune to execute
hostages held by the Commune,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.330
which included the Archbishop
of Paris, Monsignor del Guam.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.360
It was the other side that
started executing hostages first,

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.210
but still this wasn't
a very good idea.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.020
Reprisal was brutal.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.650 position:56%
Local commanders carried out summary
executions on anyone suspected

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.720
of engaging in the insurrection,

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.370
sending the rest to
Versailles in chains.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:07.200
Estimates vary, but most agree that
around 20,000 Parisians were killed

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.620 position:56%
by the Army during what became known

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.270
as the Bloody Week,
in a single week.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.220
Now the Novelist, Gustave Flaubert,
who had been following events

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:23.530
from afar in his home in Normandy,
came to Paris at the start of June,

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.740
I think just as soon as the
trains began running again.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.130 position:56%
Not sure what date he took the
train, but he was there by June 5th,

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.770
which must have been just
about as soon as was possible.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:39.410
And he toured through the
ruins with his good friend,

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.060 position:56%
Maxim Ducomp [Assumed Spelling], and
it's Ducomp who gives us the report

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.830
that really lies at the
heart of my book project.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.300
Ducomp writes as we were
looking at the blackened carcass

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.500 position:56%
of the Tuileries, of the Treasury
of the Palace of the Legion of Honor

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.820
and I was exclaiming on it,

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:01.470 position:56%
he said to me if they had understood
the Decasiant sante Vantel [Assumed

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.330
Spelling] none of this
would have happened.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.570
Now the Decasiant sante
Vantel, Sentimental Education,

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:13.230 position:56%
was Flaubert's novel published from
18 months earlier, which he intended

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:18.030 position:56%
as the history of his own generation
and which by this point had come

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.570
to seem to him prophetic of the
horrors of the terrible year.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.730
It's a novel that hadn't been
very well received by its critics.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.660
It was largely misunderstood.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.460
In his view if only his
contemporaries had read it

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.490
and understood it they would
have gained a political lesson.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.780
Well, at the end of this talk,
I'll say just a few words

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:43.230
about that novel and why Flaubert
thought it contained a lesson.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.020 position:56%
But mainly I just want to talk
about the ruins and the record given

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.120
by the contemporary photographers.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.600
The photography was
coming of age in 1871

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.440
and catastrophe was
a compelling subject.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.940
Think of the record of the
American Civil War created

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.260 position:56%
by Matthew Brady [Assumed Spelling]
and others just a few years earlier.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.830
Exposure times were too
long to record action.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.590
The most memorable in Brady's
photographs are essentially the

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:20.900
corpses left after the battle,
though there is one notable image

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:26.780
of Paris on fire on the
night of May 24th taken

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.420
by one Epolite Blankou
[Assumed Spelling].

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.360
It's looking over towards the
Edelacite [Assumed Spelling]

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.870
and the Crafectile
Police [Assumed Spelling].

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.760
During the brief reign of the
Commune there were portraits,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.370 position:56%
photographic portraits of its
leaders, often assembled at the seat

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.770
of municipal government, the
Hotel de Ville [Assumed Spelling].

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:53.570
Then there were a number of
posed photos of the barricades

00:15:53.570 --> 00:16:00.330
and those manning them in kind of
staged defiance, including this

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.550
of the barricade in
Minilmonton [Assumed Spelling],

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:08.910 position:56%
workers district, that would in fact
be the last part of Paris to fall

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:13.060
to the Versailles troops
during the Bloody Week.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.950
There's this, which
was the masterpiece

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.890
of the Commune's chief
barricade builder,

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.670
a man named Napoleon Gaem [Assumed
Spelling], who I think figures

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.750
in the background of that picture.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:36.630
I think that's Gaem [Assumed
Spelling] with a lot of whiskers.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:43.160
The barricades were something
of a Communal fetish,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.040
but they proved largely ineffective
since the Versailles troops

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.620
when they arrived would smash
through the houses on either side

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.380
of the barricades, run upstairs to
shoot down on the defenders or come

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.050
up from behind them and
catch them between fires.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:04.410
The Buttebomatta [Assumed Spelling]
where that Cannon Park stood,

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:08.090
where it all began, now
belonged to the Communal.

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:12.030
Wait a second, I've
lost one in here.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.860
There it is, they're out of
order, no, not out of order.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.200
I wanted to show that one first.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.060 position:56%
That's the barricade in front of the
Hotel de Ville [Assumed Spelling],

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.590
the seat of Municipal Government
going back over centuries in Paris,

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:29.340
taken over by the Communal.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.740 position:56%
And this one is taken by a man named
Alfonse Liabear [Assumed Spelling],

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:39.280 position:56%
whom I'll talk more about, one of
the great photographers of the time.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.310
And you can see the
shadow of his camera

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.460
and of himself in the
foreground then.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.960
Yes, back to the Buttebomatta,
where it all began.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:53.260
It now belongs to the Communal, and
this wonderfully evocative photo

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:58.640 position:56%
of cannon looking out from
Buttebomatta over the Paris suburbs.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.550
It was very likely taken by a
man named Bruno Bloquet [Assumed

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.700 position:56%
Spelling], who had made a profitable
business during the Second Empire

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.320
photographing studio nudes,
semi pornography, if you will,

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.540
but apparently became a
Communal sympathizer and was

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.050
in Paris during the
whole of this period.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.850
He recorded this, Bloquet [Assumed
Spelling] recorded in a series

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.400
of remarkable plates the
destruction of a column

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.530
of the elegant Placevandome
[Assumed Spelling], which you know

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:34.100
if you've ever been in Paris that's
as it stands today reconstructed.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.990
It commemorates the first
Napoleon, whose gilded statue

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.190
as Roman Emperor stands
on top of it.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:46.230
It was sheathed originally in brass
baroleafs [Assumed Spelling] made

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.710 position:56%
from the melted down cannon captured
by the French Army at the Battle

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.730
of Austerlitz [Assumed
Spelling] in 1804.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.920
It was by 1871 a familiar
and generally beloved part

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.200
of the Paris landscape, yet it drew
the particular ire of the Communal

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.940
who declared it to be, quote,
a monument to barbarism,

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:12.000 position:56%
a symbol of brute force and false
glory, an affirmation of militarism,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.550
a negation of international law, a
permanent insult of the conquerors

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.370
to the vanquished, a
perpetual attack on one

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:24.330
of the three great principles of
the French Revolution, fraternity.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.170
It surely was all that,

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.340
but its destruction seems a
strange expenditure of energy

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.150
and political capital and it
was, of course, quickly rebuilt

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.040
after the fall of the Commune.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.140
Bloquet [Assumed Spelling] might
be dubbed an early photo journalist

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.870
in a sequence he creates
about the destruction

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.350
of the Vandome [Assumed
Spelling] Column,

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.230
although I give you a
small selection here.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.900
We start with this kind of
celebratory picture of the base

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:56.460
of the Column the day of its
destruction, with lots of Communal,

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.100
mostly in their National
Guard uniform.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:04.230
In theory every active male
belonged to the National Guard

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:10.400 position:56%
and that was the main source of most
people's income during the Commune,

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.540
the pay of the National Guard.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:18.660
But here you also have a
mother with a boy who seems

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.280
to be acting up at her feet.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.670
It's a kind of festive occasion.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.690
The next one shows you the
Column rigged for destruction

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:32.050
and the Placevandome largely
cleared, there are just people

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.520
on the edges, these
three men on horseback,

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.570
as it's about to be pulled over.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:44.220
And then this quite beautiful
high angle shot taken

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.610 position:56%
from a fifth or sixth story balcony.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:50.200
This is by a different prominent
photographer of the time,

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.850
Jue Anvere [Assumed Spelling].

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.650 position:56%
That's the column after it's fallen.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:21:00.330
And to conclude, notably evocative
picture of the statue of Napoleon

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:04.350
from the top of the column,
done up as Roman Emperor,

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.520
falling in the dust like an
assassinated Julius Caesar,

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.640
the orb of the world is
still clutched in his hand.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.170
This, again, by Bruno Bloquet.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:17.040
And I think this picture
more than any other speaks

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.180
to why the Communal wanted
to pull down the column.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:26.560 position:56%
They were against everything
symbolized by the Imperial Napoleon.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.550
Anyway, it's a curious
series in which the Commune

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:33.470
and its photographer seem to
be intent on making a record

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:38.560
of their own folly, willfully
creating a kind of scar on Paris,

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.810
which will be later cited
among their chief crimes,

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.830
anti-monumentalizing
the city, so to speak.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.990
If they think they're effacing
a tribute to militarism

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:53.790
and dictatorship paradoxically they
make starkly visible before us what

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.510
one of the guidebooks is going

00:21:55.510 --> 00:22:00.480
to call A Day Whose Memory
Will Never Be Effaced.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.080
Now crime is a word
that returns frequently

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.300
in the guidebooks published
for tourists in the ruins.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.020
There were a number
of these produced

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.280
with remarkable speed
following the events to profit

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.610 position:56%
from the tourist industry, including

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:19.810
for instance this collection
of postcards.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.870
The word tourist industry
I don't use lightly.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.120
Cooks [Assumed Spelling] in London,
for instance, is offering tours

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.100
of the ruins and there came to be a
resentment on the part of Parisians

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.020
at the number of British
who came to see the ruins

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:39.220
and as the local thought gloat over
the results of French fratricide.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.820
And provincials who had been
locked out of Paris essentially

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.700
for the last year flocked
to the Capital.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.660
Many of the guidebooks are
simple pamphlets with itineraries

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.060
through the ruins and comments
on the destroyed buildings,

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.420
others are heavily
illustrated with etchings

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.730
or rotograph [Assumed Spelling]
years, which one comes to recognize

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.900
as having been made from the
photographs of the ruins.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.740
There was no way of
reproducing photographs

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.560
in printed books at the time.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.070
Efficient photography was
still some years in the future.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:20.550 position:56%
But there were a few albums that
are large format, luxurious affairs,

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.750
containing photographic plates.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.190
These were produced
separately for each edition,

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.290
then glued by hand into the volume.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.260
They're often of astonishing
quality,

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.590
as are many of the
individual photographs produced

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.970
for souvenirs and postcards
and so on.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.700 position:56%
One of the most impressive of these
volumes is Au France Lebere [Assumed

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.090
Spelling], we saw that Lebere of
the Hotel de Ville with the shadow

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.880
of the photographer earlier.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.360 position:56%
This is his book, Lou Paris [Assumed
Spelling], of which The Library

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.840
of Congress fortunately possesses
a copy, and that's its title page.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.790
Just parenthetically you see

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.610
at the bottom there is Entere
Par La Photography American

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:04.910
[Assumed Spelling].

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:11.030
Lebere had originally set
up shop in San Francisco

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:16.230
and become a prominent West Coast
American photographer before

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.170
returning to France.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:23.190
The rhetoric of these guidebooks
is routinely anti-Communal.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.010 position:56%
The tropes [Assumed Spelling] become
familiar - crime, wild beasts,

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.670
insensate destruction, et cetera.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:33.110
As an Author, who calls himself
George Belle [Assumed Spelling],

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:38.830
puts is in his book, Parie Ensandie
[Assumed Spelling], Paris Burnt.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:44.710
In many quarters of Paris one
finds what he calls vede aculatere

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.860
[Assumed Spelling], emptiness
that accuse the perpetrators.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:52.810
This language of the void,
of emptiness is interesting.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:58.100
Another guide tells us, quote, only
photography with its brutal realism

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:02.750 position:56%
and its pitiless precision can
represent these indescribable things

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.720
that were houses, palaces, cities.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.760
Only photography can capture
what now is from what once was.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.560
Then Africet Dornet [Assumed
Spelling], who writes the text,

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.790 position:56%
this preface to Lebere's magnificent
album, notes that warrants

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:25.370
of a war are now past and resemble
a bad dream half forgotten,

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:31.580
but he goes on, this site had the
sun for witness and the sun fixed

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.960
on Bristol paper, that's
photographic paper,

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.960
this Legubria [Assumed
Spelling] souvenir.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:42.010
So photography is presented as
the work of the sun as eye witness

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.090
and the fixing of the
object of witness on paper.

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:49.620
Photography has given what you
might call a quasi-forensic role,

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.120
producing unforgettable
memorializations of sites

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.640
that one would like to
forget as from a bad dream.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.800
Dornet's [Assumed Spelling]
remark captures a notion

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.140
that comes back repeatedly

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.110
in the discourse accompanying
these photographs.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:08.000
The Ruins, which themselves
record a kind of absence

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.100 position:56%
of what was once there are something

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.450
that should be effaced,
blotted out, forgotten.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:17.010
As George Belle puts
it the more one looks

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:21.820
at them the more ardent becomes
the desire to see them disappear.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:26.860
And yet they're irresistibly
made present by the photographs.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:31.210
The principal monuments, most
notably the Hotel de Ville

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.520
and the Tuileries Palace, were
nightmarish unforgettable images

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.130
of both absence and presence.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.550
Absences that refer
to a lost presence,

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:45.240
presences that make absence
present, you might say.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.610
I offer only a selection
from the many,

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.900
many images of the Hotel de Ville.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.270 position:56%
Perhaps the most photographed of all
the ruins, the Renaissance Building

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.330
that had for centuries housed
the Municipal Paris Government

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.500
and which became the
headquarters for the Commune.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.610
This photograph is by the great
Charlee Mataville [Assumed

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.650
Spelling], whom some
of you may know,

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:13.000
he's been much exhibited including
in a big show at the Metropolitan

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.970
in New York a few years ago.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.640
He had originally been commissioned

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.610
to record old Paris
before Napoleon III

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:27.880
and his Lieutenant Baron Olston
[Assumed Spelling] wiped it out.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.090
This was done, as you can see,
a few weeks after the fire

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.810
when the building is already
surrounded by hoardings

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:40.900
and clearance and reconstruction
have already begun.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:45.760
And here is one of the many
stark images of the interior

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.930
of the building, this one also done
by Mataville [Assumed Spelling].

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:55.340
Then I want to show you an
often reproduced Lebere photo,

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.390
which looks like an action photo.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.600
Firefighters attempting

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.930
to extinguish the blazing Hotel
de Ville, but on close inspection

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:10.200 position:56%
and I had the opportunity to inspect
it myself in Paris two summers ago,

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.230
on close inspection it's retouched.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:18.830
Someone has very cleverly drawn
in those firemen, firehoses

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:22.420
and smoke with pen and ink.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.840
This is the original from which
it was made, and you can see how

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:32.460
that tempted the retoucher to
put in more figures and turn it

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:38.280
into an action photo, but
that's from the Lebere volume

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.070
that The Library of Congress has.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:46.700 position:56%
That retouched photo I think you can
consider fairly innocent compared

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.920
to a number of photo montage
from the time, recording events

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.060 position:56%
of the Commune, especially by a man
named Ugen Apere [Assumed Spelling],

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.900 position:56%
who published an album called Le
Crime La Commune [Assumed Spelling],

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.780
The Crimes of the Commune, which
depicted such crucial events

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.180
as the execution of Generals
Claymont Tomar [Assumed Spelling]

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:10.290 position:56%
and Jules Lacont [Assumed Spelling]
on March 18th, the founding violence

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.030 position:56%
of the Commune, and the execution of
Monsieur Dubois [Assumed Spelling]

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.250
and other hostages at the
Rickette Prison [Assumed Spelling].

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:21.000
These fakes are sometimes clever
and were surely taken as evidence

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.290
by many people, though their
wooden quality is made evident

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:28.250
by the genuine photographs, but
they do, these photo montages

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:32.440
which were sold as real without
any mention of what they were,

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:38.450
do urge a certain caution when
using photos as witness to events.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:43.160
Absence and presence was a crucial
issue, too, on the practical level

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.250 position:56%
of stone and mortar and the question

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.810
of rebuilding these
destroyed monuments.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:52.110
The Government that would
soon preach moral order,

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:56.180
that was the slogan of the
reactionary Government that came

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.530
into power after the
Commune, as if watch word,

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:03.100
wanted to reface the Commune by
ridding the Capitol of ruins just

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.000
as soon as possible and most of
the functional public buildings,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.250
such as the Ministry of Finance
and the Palace of Justice

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.550
and the Crue de Comte
[Assumed Spelling],

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:15.220
were quickly rebuilt or replaced.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:19.800
This is very quickly what some
of them looked like as viewed

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.140
by Flaubert and Maxim
Ducomp in early June.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.460
That's the Palay de Justice
[Assumed Spelling] photographed

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.300
by Epolite Bloncoute
[Assumed Spelling]

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.950 position:56%
from inside the Ministry of Justice.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:38.330
That is the Finance, Ministry
of Finance, by Lebere.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:43.620
Yes, that one is by Lebere.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:48.200
And then that one is
by Epolite Bloncoute,

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.870
a really remarkable photograph.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:51.820
The clarity of these photographs.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:57.040
As a colleague of mine said,
photography has gotten faster

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.220 position:56%
since the 1870s but it hasn't gotten
any better, and I think that's true.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:07.340 position:56%
And then the Tatra Lalique [Assumed
Spelling] that would be reborn again

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.930
under a different name
three years later.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.220
And in addition to the
specific destroyed buildings,

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.620
often those were crucial to
the administration of the city

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.720
and the nation, there were
also whole areas of the city

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.360
that suffered heavily from damage.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:28.740
On the right bank, that length of
that major artery, the [inaudible],

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.140
in a photo that gives you a
sense of the remarkable depth

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.890
of field that's achieved
in some of these photos.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.690
And I don't know who that's by.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:41.230 position:56%
I suspect it's Bloncoute or
perhaps Melville [Assumed Spelling],

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.090
but I just present it as anonymous.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.390
And then on the left bank,

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.870 position:56%
not far from Sanjay Marie Prey
[Assumed Spelling], the [inaudible],

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:54.480
the scene of an intense onslaught
against Communal barricades.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.660
That's another photo by Lebere.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:02.450 position:56%
And then a few days after the event,
because someone has already put

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:05.390
up a sign saying that
the shop that used

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:08.360
to be there has moved elsewhere.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.000
[laughter] All these would
have to be made whole again

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.080
and they were with notable speed.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.460
The rapidity of French recovery
from war, siege, invasion

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.720
and then civil war astonished
observers and the rebuilding

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.270
of Paris was an urgent part
of national restoration.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:28.580
Now the Hotel de Ville, which
was commissioned originally

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.130
in the 16th Century by Francois
Pomay [Assumed Spelling],

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:37.460
King Francis the First, was crucial
both practically and symbolically.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:42.180
Some proposed replacing the
ruined building with a new design,

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.450
but the Government
quickly opted to restore

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:51.500
and reuse the Renaissance
Building while going 19th Century

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.980
for the interior.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:57.310
Work proceeded at a pace so
that the many haunting images

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:59.670
of its ruined condition
would become a kind

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.710
of counterproof of French resolve.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.650
It stands today slightly enlarged

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.740
from the original, a
defiant reproduction.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.960
As for the Tuileries Palace,
another of the most dramatic ruins,

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.250
there ensued a long
and heated debate

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.440 position:56%
as to whether and how to restore it.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.990
This is the Saldaymatashore
[Assumed Spelling],

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.960
one of the principal
reception rooms inside

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.680
of the Tuileries Palace,
again by Alfonse Lebere.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.230
Now if the restoration of
the Monarchy in the person

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.850
of the Compdeshonbal [Assumed
Spelling], the Bourbon Pretender,

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:40.770 position:56%
crowned as Henry the Fifth
[inaudible] had taken place in 1873,

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.300
as at one time seemed
really inevitable,

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.850
it is certain the Palace
would have risen again.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.890
But Chombot [Assumed Spelling]
stymied the return of Monarchy

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.600
by refusing to accept the Twekala
[Assumed Spelling] French flag,

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.430
the red-white-and-blue
flag, insisting on a return

00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:01.330
to the white flag of his ancestors,
the Bourbons, with the fleur-de-lis

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:05.200
on a white ground, proving
once again the adage

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.390
that the Bourbons learned
nothing and forgot nothing.

00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:12.880
[laughter] He went back into exile,
and then failure of restoration,

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.260
even the conservative Republic of
Dukes that followed upon the fall

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:21.360
of the Thiers Government had
trouble mustering much enthusiasm

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:27.120
for rebuilding what had come to
seem a symbol of tyranny in excess.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.820
The debate ended only in 1882 when
the Republicans were now firmly

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.570
in charge of the Government with
a decision to raise the ruins

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.290
and remove the debris, thus,

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:40.940
creating the Plasducalasal [Assumed
Spelling] right outside The Louver,

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.740
as we know it today.

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:46.000
Nonetheless, I discovered that
there is still an active National

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.490 position:56%
Committee for the reconstruction of
the Tuileries run by people who need

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:54.940
to have the memories take
literal physical form.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.960
Now the message from the
Government and the official sources

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:02.170
of information was all about
forgetfulness and erasure.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:04.950
The Commune would soon become
virtually unmentionable,

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:09.370
fallen from official history,
and yet there is this phenomenon

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:14.340
of the several guidebooks produced
precisely to publicize the ruins

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.470
and there were the
visitors who purchased them

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.870
and like Flaubert toured the city.

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:24.390 position:56%
What did it meant that these symbols
of national defeat and class warfare

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.440
and heedless destruction
became a privileged site

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.180
of tourism and of sightseeing?

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.860
The rhetoric of wishing to
see and wishing to cover

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.000
over the site returns again
and again in a contradiction

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.090
that I don't think can be resolved.

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:43.090
That work I suppose is our
inevitable attraction to the site

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:47.720
of cataclysmic happenings, from
earthquakes to highway accidents,

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.930
along with the accompanying
wish that they hadn't happened.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.520
But something else seems to
be going on here, as well.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.820
In part, it seems to have
been the eerie beauty

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:59.500
of the ruins themselves
evoked in a number

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.890
of guidebooks and commentaries.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:06.340
So along with the desire to
remove the emblems of destruction

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:11.200
by making present again the
buildings recorded in their absence

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.850
as photographed ruins there was a
concurrent discourse of fascination

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.210
with the beauty of the
ruins, a perverse wish

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.110
that they might be preserved.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:25.020 position:56%
Many Parisians, as well as visitors,
were captivated by the images

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.860
of a living city instantly reduced
to lifeless rubble in the manner

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:34.590
of Pompeii, the ruin created
by an instant cataclysm.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:38.270
The guide Alcavel de Paris
[Assumed Spelling] notes

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.680
that the Rueielle [Assumed
Spelling], which I show you here,

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.550
is the street of another
Pompeii, shaken by the eruption

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:49.570
of the volcano of a populace
blinder in its furies,

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:52.950
more stupidly [inaudible]
than Vesuvius

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:56.270
or Etnam [Assumed Spelling],
that's the Rueielle.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:37:00.630
And that comparison to
Pompeii becomes commonplace,

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:05.260 position:56%
and yet the results of volcanic
eruption, here the volcanic eruption

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.660
of the crowd, are beautiful.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:13.330 position:56%
The same guidebook notes of the
Hotel de Ville that is black, white,

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:17.110
bluish, reddish, rose, so intense
was the furnace they cooked

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.210
and recooked it.

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.530
We have no colored pictures
from the time, of course,

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.410
so we don't really know
what it looks like.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:28.080
But apparently stone set afire with
petrol, which was what they used

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.790
to create these fires, takes

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:34.070
on wonderfully enticing
iridescent colors.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:37.480
The poet, Terfuel Gotiette [Assumed
Spelling] viewing what remained

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.330 position:56%
of the Caldeconte [Assumed Spelling]
said above all we were struck

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:43.300
by the beauty of the ruins.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.540
And the novelist and
art connoisseur,

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.440
Edmund Degon [Assumed Spelling]
wandering through Paris the day

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:53.090
after the fighting ended developed
in his journal the full aesthetic

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:55.360
of the burned Hotel de Ville.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:00.550
He said the ruin is magnificent,
splendid, ruin in tones of rose

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.910
and ash green, of white
hot iron, a ruin shimmering

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:07.310
in the agate color taken
by stone burnt in petrol.

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:10.750
It resembles the ruin of an
Italian palace colored by the sun

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:14.960
of many centuries or better
still the ruin of a magic palace,

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:19.110
lit up in an opera with
shimmering electric reflections.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:21.600
It's a marvel of the picturesque.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.660
It should be preserved.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:28.590
And another guide, the Guilot
Veren [Assumed Spelling],

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:33.060
written by Hans [Assumed Spelling]
notes the Ministry of Finance,

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.300
which in the past was
only a mediocre edifice,

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.670
has become a superb ruin.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:41.100
Fire is a worker of genius.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.420
Again, we have the
Pompeiian reference.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:49.320
It makes one dream of a city
swallowed up by a cataclysm.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.620
To Gottier [Assumed Spelling],

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.130
the Ministry of Finance
looked like the Coliseum.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:57.240
The ruins have a kind of antique
beauty, as here in the remains

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.660
of what was known as the Grainery
debendos [Assumed Spelling],

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:06.220
the Grainery or Storehouse,
which was filled with substances

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:11.400
against possible future
famine, and it was full of wine,

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.750
oil and petrol and, of
course, went up like a torch.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:19.630 position:56%
This is a photograph by Jules Andrea
[Assumed Spelling] recording the

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:21.970
Grainery debendos.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:25.550
So you have the rhetoric of the
guidebooks and tourist reactions

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:31.350
to the ruins, a simultaneous
lament on the destruction wrought

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:36.320
by the Communal, the work of a kind
of human volcano, and a meditation

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:40.520
on the seductive beauty
of this instant Pompeii.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.750
The ruins resurrected the
earlier fascination of romantics

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:46.270
and gothic revival with
a picturesque ruin.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:51.470
The sentiment that led the money
to have instant ruins created

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.510
on their states, for instance,

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:57.250
and a book such as Count Vornet's
[Assumed Spelling] The Ruins

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.550
of Empire.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.870
And then here, of course,
the tourist was

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:03.330
in a sense viewing the
ruins of an empire,

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:07.650
that of Napoleon's Second Empire,
which had seemed such an affluent,

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.060
powerful, enduring regime
until it undid itself

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.810
in the War with Prussia.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:19.350 position:56%
Now you see the ruins aesthetics and
full flower in a rare oil painting

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:23.810 position:56%
of the Tuileries done by Ans Masonet
[Assumed Spelling], who was famous

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:26.590
as a painter of Napoleonic battles

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.840
and became almost an official court
painter under the Second Empire.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.300 position:56%
This first is [inaudible] photograph

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:38.740
of the [inaudible] inside
the Tuileries Palace.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.970
And then here is Masonet's [Assumed
Spelling] using the same general

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.900
sight line through Palace.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:49.410
Possibly working from a photograph,

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:54.780
Masonet looks through the ruined
Saldefet [Assumed Spelling]

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.920 position:56%
of the Palace, out towards the
Arcdetriumphant de Carousel [Assumed

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.780
Spelling], which is still
there, which was originally part

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:05.480
of the Paris Palace
complex, but now stands alone

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.200
in the Tuileries Garden,
itself a kind of evocation

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.620
of the Palace that once was there.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:16.650
Masonet described the arch with its
imperial figure in a chariot drawn

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:21.770
by four horses as, quote, Victory
on Her Chariot Abandoning Us,

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:25.380 position:56%
but others view this glimpse of past
glory through the ruins as promise

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.980
of a better future,
the rebirth of France.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:32.160
The painting, of course, stands in
a tradition going back to people

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.700
like Pyronaisie [Assumed Spelling]
and Uber Orber [Assumed Spelling]

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:41.750 position:56%
of evocative ruins which are often
meditations on the transitory nature

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:44.210
of human works and aspirations.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.450
Masonet explicitly inserts himself
in the tradition of painters

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:52.250
of Roman ruins with the
Latin inscription he puts

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.210
on the inscription at the
bottom of the painting,

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:59.570
Gloria Myorem Per Flamas usques
Superstes [Assumed Spelling],

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:02.400
The Glory of our Forebearers
Survives Through the Flames

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.090
and then May 1871,
predicting a greater future,

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:10.420
the survivors of the flames, an
image of purification by fire

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.840
that would return again and again.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:16.460
And on the walls of the ruins,
though you can't see them

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.340
in this reproduction,
there are inscriptions

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.490
of Marengo [Assumed Spelling]
and Austulitz [Assumed Spelling],

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:24.890
two of the first Napoleon's
great victories.

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:29.390
So I think he kind of captures
that mixture of emotions we find

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:32.910
in the guidebooks, a sense
of irrecoverable loss along

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:36.480
with a fascination with the
ruins left in the wake of loss

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:41.210
and also an obligatory
hope for the future.

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:44.460
Since the work of critics, like
Olenbart [Assumed Spelling]

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.250
and Susan Sontag [Assumed
Spelling] on photography,

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:50.420
we've become acutely aware
I think of the cohabitation

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.970
of the photograph with death.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.760
The haunting sense that
the instant made present

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.860
in the image no longer exists,
that's why it's an image.

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:03.480 position:56%
This death affect is strangely
redoubled in the case of photographs

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.310
of the remains of what once was.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:12.230 position:56%
The point can be starkly
illustrated by the most famous photo

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.950 position:56%
from the Bloody Week, probably taken

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:16.860
by a man named Ugen
Desre [Assumed Spelling],

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.460
who earlier invented the
calling card embellished

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.160
with a photographic portrait,

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.980
which expanded photography
throughout the middle classes.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:31.590
This is bodies of executed
Communal in their coffins.

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.990
The circumstances and intention
of this stark, haunting

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:38.580
and nearly unbearable
photo remained conjectural.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.640
It somehow looks like an
official act of witnessing,

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.580
and someone suggested that Desre
[Assumed Spelling] took the photo

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:49.560
at the behest of the victorious
Versailles to record the dead,

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.390
but that's not very persuasive when
you think of the fact that most

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.970
of the dead went totally
unrecorded and were just thrown

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:57.680
into unmarked mass graves.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.850
In any event, the photo
authenticates more

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:04.180
than any other document I
know the horror of the event.

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.630
And it's incidentally
one of just two

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:10.160
or three authentic
photos of the victims.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.980
There are a lot of other ones
that are posed, of troops

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:19.920
and civilians artfully
arranged bodies.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:24.760
Whereas, Brady's American Civil War
photos often record bodies mowed

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:29.090
down like wheat fields, with
the exception of Desre's photo,

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:31.800
the bodies are largely
absent and probably

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.120
because they were carted off the
scene and hastily buried so quickly

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:40.520
by a Government anxious to
erase any trace of them.

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:44.460
There's also an act of artistic
witnessing less horrifying

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.820
than the photo, but equally tragic
in its way, in a sketchy lithograph

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:52.470
by Edward Manet [Assumed Spelling],
who left Paris after the Armistice

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:58.150
but returned during the Bloody
Week, called simply Civil War.

00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:01.270
The very lack of photos of
the acts of the Bloody Week,

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:05.280
the way in which emphasis has
been thrown forward instead

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:10.350
onto the ruins suggests a
specific form of intervention

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:14.170
of the photograph in the
historiography of this moment.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.270
The visually recorded
history of the life and death

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:21.310
of the Commune is the
ruins left in their wake.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:24.100
The burning of Paris
becomes the unforgettable

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.520
and unpardonable record.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.570
That may explain why the image
of the largely mythic figure

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:34.320 position:56%
of the Pitalours [Assumed Spelling],
the proletarian woman running

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.240
from building to building with
a milk can filled with petrol

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.150
and setting fires,
became so dominant

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.110
in the first journalistic
histories of the Commune.

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:48.440
The petrolist probably never
existed, she's a figure invented

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.350
to create a dramatic
and infernal narrative

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:53.400
of the burning of central Paris.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.470
She's in a sense a fictional
narrative that results

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:59.730
from the photographs of the ruins.

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.740
Recall Alfred Donet's
[Assumed Spelling] words

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.390
in the Lierbere [Assumed Spelling]
volume, this site have the sun

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:08.400
for witness and the sun fixed
the image on photographic paper.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.740
The witnessing of the Commune
is largely in those ruins.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.770
Photography in this
sense inflects history.

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:18.830
It produces fictions of the
events whose outcomes it records.

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:23.070
Though the memorialization of
historical event was by this point

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:27.270
in the 19th Century clearly a
central role for photography,

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:31.590
the ruins of Paris photographs make
a different kind of contribution

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:33.540
to the creation of history.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.950
They take on a forensic role
while the events are still ongoing

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:40.890
in public memory, while the trials
of the Communal, for instance,

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.550
are going forward in Versailles.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:47.660 position:56%
They offer a kind of factual support
for the existence and the death

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:52.700
of the Commune, its trace left in
the destruction of central Paris.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:56.030
Roland Bacter [Assumed Spelling],
once again, writes, quote,

00:46:56.030 --> 00:47:00.150 position:56%
perhaps we have an invincible
resistance to believing in the past,

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:03.540
in history, except
in the form of myth.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:07.090
The photograph for the first time
puts an end to this resistance,

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:10.030
henceforth, the past is
as certain as the present.

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:14.740
What we see on paper is as
certain as what we touch.

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:18.220
It is the advent of the
photograph and not as has been said

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.330
of the cinema, which divides
the history of the world.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:26.510 position:56%
In the absence of action photographs
and the aftermath of the massacre

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.230
of so many of the Communal,
including their leaders,

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.530
the mute testimony

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:35.100
of the photographed ruins allows
the construction of its history.

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.880
There will be other
kinds of memorialization

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.560
in the wake of the Commune.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.590
Since there was an official
wish to silence the history

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:45.480
of the terrible year, most
of the early discourses

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.090
of the Commune are wholly negative.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:52.630
Memoirs by surviving Communal
could not be published in France,

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.550
some of them were published
in Belgium and elsewhere.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:48:01.490 position:56%
Only after the amnesty voted in 1880
and the return of surviving Communal

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:04.540
from their exile in New
Caledonia do we begin

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.410
to have a fuller public
record of the event.

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:09.800
One has to await the
20th Century for there

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:16.380
to be a commemorative plaque to
the dead of the Commune affixed

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.920
to their so-called mildefidehet
[Assumed Spelling] at the foot

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.350 position:56%
of Pierre la Chez [Assumed
Spelling] Cemetery, where a massacre

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:27.910
of Communal took place on the next
to the last day of the Bloody Week,

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:31.440
where they were lined up row
after row and slaughtered.

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.360
The wall became a site of memory

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:39.040
with the annual so-called
Monteomea [Assumed Spelling],

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:43.880
the going up to the wall that from
1880 onward gathered Socialists,

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.420
Communists and other left
formations with tributes oral

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.990
and floral every May in
commemoration of the Bloody Week.

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:53.930
It reached its ephagy [Assumed
Spelling] during the popular front

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:57.600
in 1936 with a crowd
of some 600,000.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:03.180
Now I wanted this context to talk,
but not today, I spare you that,

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:06.770
about some displaced
memorializations of the Commune.

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:09.670
First, Victor Hugo's [Assumed
Spelling] remarkable novel,

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:14.090
93 Catavantaz [Assumed Spelling],
named for the year of the reign

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:17.460
of terror during the original
French Revolution, which he wrote

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.970
in the immediate wake of
offense and published in 1874

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:24.310
with the explicit desire

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:27.050
to reconcile the opposing
camps of his compatriots.

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:33.150
And then another to be somewhat
more sinister kind of novelization

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:35.860
of history in the building
of the Basilica

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.090 position:56%
of the Sacre Curl [Assumed Spelling]
atop the Butte Monmonta [Assumed

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:44.900
Spelling] as expiation for the sins
of Republican France in response

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:47.590
to a so-called national vow.

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:53.030
The complex history of the Sacre
Curl, both the church and the call

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:56.990
to the Sacred Heart of Jesus that
lay behind it, is a notable story

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:59.660
of reactionary France
pushing its views

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:02.370
on the nation in the
wake of disaster.

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:06.320
The building of the Basilica
was declared of public interest

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:10.490
by the National Assembly in 1873,

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:16.140 position:56%
its very conservative Monarchist
assembly, allowing the symbolic site

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.550 position:56%
up on Monmonta [Assumed Spelling]
where the Communal cannons had stood

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:24.970
to be taken by what we
would call eminent domain.

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:28.820
Built where the Commune had
begun its reign, it was designed

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.630
to rise high above the Pantheon,
the home of such impious figures

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:38.790
as Voltaire and Rousseau, the
fathers of Republican France.

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:41.410
Successive Republican
Governments then attempted

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:44.380
to kill the project, but in vain.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:49.810
As finally completed not until 1914
it not only dominates the Paris

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:55.950
skylines, but contains within it
mosaics memorializing some strange

00:50:55.950 --> 00:51:01.510
heroes of the far right, next
to four Archbishops of Paris,

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:06.390
offering the Basilica to Paris.

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:12.710
We have the authors of the National
vow made during the Franco Prussian

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:16.650
War and the subsequent
destruction, to build the church -

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:19.360
Manon Aso Anti [Assumed Spelling]

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.690
and Uber Fluorine [Assumed
Spelling],

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:25.520
and then behind them Generals
Desonis [Assumed Spelling]

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.500
and Cheret [Assumed Spelling],
and the second of them

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.350
in his Papal Zoove
[Assumed Spelling] uniform.

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:32.650
These were descendants

00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:35.350
of the Vondaya [Assumed
Spelling] resistance

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:39.580
to the French Republic
during the great Revolution,

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:47.850
who had then go off to defend the
Pope against Italian Republicans.

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:53.080
And then in December 1870
they joined the French Army,

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:59.520
though as a separate
battalion, under the banner

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:04.060
of the bleeding heart, being
the Sacred Heart of Jesus,

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:10.620
and led a final chivalrous but
absurd charge at the Battle

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:15.760
of Luanye [Assumed Spelling], where
they were both severely wounded

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.260
and accomplished nothing.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:24.080
And then behind them you have Louis
16th and his family, kneeling wall,

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.800
dedicating France to
the Sacred Heart,

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:31.140
which is said to be a vow he
made when he was imprisoned

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:35.170
by the Jacobians during
the French Revolution.

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:38.100
He was going to devote
France to the call

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.010
to the Sacred Heart
if he was released.

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:43.000
When he wasn't released, but
instead was guillotined this call

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.470
to the Sacred Heart became even
stronger among anti-Republicans.

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:51.390
And in the back of the scene,
leaning against a pillar,

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:55.710
you have an indifferent and impious
proletariat, what they called

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:58.400
in the French Revolution Asant
Culate [Assumed Spelling],

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.050 position:56%
who looks disdainfully on the scene.

00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:05.450
Really remarkable, and most French
don't know what's going on up

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:07.820
in those mosaics, they're
hard to see.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:13.950
Gallia Penitence at Devota [Assumed
Spelling] reads the inscription

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.250
over the entrance to the church.

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:20.610
France penitent proclaims her place
as an elder daughter of the church.

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:23.800
I think it's quite odd that
glorious past should be crowned

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.210
with this monument of penitence.

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:30.460
Now the upsurge of nationalist
feeling led also to a new cult

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:33.420
of Joan of Arc, who
came from the Province

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.720
of Lorraine [Assumed Spelling],

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.670
which had now passed
largely into German hands.

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:41.910
Joan was the symbol who finally
could rally both right and left,

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:47.200
the spirit of the nation who saved
the French Monarchy, but also began

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.160
as a humble peasant woman.

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:55.230
Here she is as the heroic
Joan in the gilded statue

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:58.810
by Immanuel Fromere [Assumed
Spelling], erected in 1874

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:02.680 position:56%
that still today stands in the
Place de Pihabide [Assumed Spelling]

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.980
in Paris.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:08.480
And then this somewhat stranger
attempt by the painters,

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.630
Ul Bastion LaPage [Assumed
Spelling] to portray her

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:16.610
as a peasant girl called
to by Saint Michael,

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:20.350
who hovers in the background
in gilded armor,

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:25.610
in her parents' back garden,
their poteget [Assumed Spelling].

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:30.070
As for Flaubert, like the
entire middle class of France,

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:32.380
he thought the Commune
was a criminal mistake.

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:37.040
You don't find anyone in the
French bourgeoisie defending him,

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.500
but he blamed the reaction
to it even more.

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:44.870 position:56%
Those with power and supposedly
with education are the more to blame

00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:47.330
in what he sees as
an immense treason

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:50.150
against civilization, itself.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:56.110
During a visit to Paris in early
June of 1871 he wrote a letter

00:54:56.110 --> 00:55:01.920
to his confidant, George Sonde,
I'm overcome or rather nauseated.

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:05.080
The odor of the corpses
disgusts me less than the swamps

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.100 position:56%
of egotism exhaling from all mouths.

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.310
The site of the ruins
is nothing next

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:12.960
to the immense Parisian stupidity.

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.890
With some very rare exceptions
everyone appeared ready

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:17.190
for the madhouse.

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:20.260
Half the population wishes
to strangle the other half,

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:22.250
which reciprocates the sentiment.

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:24.860
You can read that clearly in
the faces of the passersby.

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.490
And the Prussians no longer exist.

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:30.110
People excuse them and admire them.

00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:33.060
Reasonable people want to
become naturalized Germans.

00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:38.120
I assure you it's enough to make
one despair of the human species.

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:42.470
Now what I claim in my book is
that a rereading of this novel,

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:46.300
Sentimental Education,
published in November of 1869,

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:50.920
that is just shortly before
the war breaks out and leads

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.310
to its awful sequels, when you
set the novel in the context

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:56.750
of the terrible year does read

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:59.610
as a history lesson
to his contemporaries.

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:04.710
It takes its place in a long line
of 19th Century historical novels,

00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:07.670
but in a strangely prophetic mode.

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:11.150
You might say it's part of
a more general novelization

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:17.300
of history going on in this period
that sets large historical forces

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:21.260
in play against the
individual's understanding

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:26.080
or in Flaubert's case more often
non-understanding of the forces

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.280
that he or she has to deal with.

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:31.890
Recall that Marx called
the Commune a sphinx.

00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:37.910 position:56%
Flaubert is much interested in the
sphinx of history, but not convinced

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:40.480
that questioning her
will get you an answer.

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:44.240
He rather wants to make us
understand how we have to live

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:47.710
in the shadow of that
unresponsive sphinx.

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:50.510
Thank you for your attention.

00:56:50.510 --> 00:57:05.040
[ Applause ]

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.340
Thank you.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.900
I would be delighted
to have your questions

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.790
and Jason tells me we do
have about 10 minutes,

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:15.550
so if you have them ask away.

00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:18.040
Yes? Yes, there's a microphone.

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:21.020
&gt;&gt; You showed pictures of ruined
offices, you showed pictures

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.730
of ruined - the Hotel de
Ville, of neighborhoods.

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:27.190
You showed no pictures
of damaged churches,

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:31.240
were there no damaged churches or
were they not photographed or -

00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.580
because Paris has lots
of nice churches?

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:34.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: That's interesting.

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:37.410
There were damaged churches,
particularly in the west

00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:39.770
of the City, in Otet
[Assumed Spelling]

00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.470
and San Klue [Assumed Spelling].

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:44.250
I think that damage came more

00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:48.110
from the Prussian bombardments
than from the Communal.

00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:54.390 position:56%
So far as I know the Communal did
not set fire to any of the churches.

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:58.710
They were anti-clerical
in many ways,

00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:02.140
and a number of the
churches became places

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.940
for political meetings
during the Commune,

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:08.770
but they didn't undertake
any destruction.

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:13.410
The Commune actually was a rather
peaceful period, and there are lots

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:17.040
of contemporary accounts of
how pleasant it was to live

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.490
in Paris under the Commune.

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:24.750
It's just at the time
of the Versailles attack

00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:26.970
that they start burning things.

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:30.720
And one could talk a lot about
the motives of those burnings.

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.620
Essentially I think it was
a defensive maneuver, right,

00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:36.190
set up a wall of flame
between you and that.

00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:39.520
But some of it may have
also been vindictive,

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.020
particularly the Tuileries Palace.

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.340
Some of it may have been
wanting to cover their tracks

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:50.400 position:56%
because when they burned the Hotel
de Ville they burned all the records

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:55.710
of what they had been doing.

00:58:55.710 --> 00:59:00.810
Yes? You'd better wait for the
microphone, which is coming by.

00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:02.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:04.640
At the time he wrote Madam Bovary

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:09.820
in the 1850s [inaudible]
was the French bourgeoisie,

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:15.610
and I was wondering by this
time had he tempered his views,

00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:20.280
the Third Republic was a
bourgeoisie Government, was he -

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:23.230
did he become more
moderate in his estimation

00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:25.710
of the French middle class?

00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:31.180
And he had ever espoused any - I
don't know if he ever did any kind

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:35.840
of empathy for the working
class, the proletariat?

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.070
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: Good questions.

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:43.020
He always remained a bourgeoisie
phobe throughout his life,

00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:46.240
but curiously, almost
without his realizing it,

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:51.840 position:56%
in the wake of the Commune and its
suppression he becomes a Republican.

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:56.490
And he says very interesting
things about the Republic.

00:59:56.490 --> 01:00:02.790
The Republic is unstable for quite
awhile, it's only in the late 1870s

01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:04.690
that it really gets firmed up.

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:07.480
He says he likes it
because it has no ideology,

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:11.280
that it's just getting
on with things.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.540
But he continues to
attack the bourgeoisie.

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:21.050
He reads all the political
platforms of the candidates

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.690
for the Assembly from Normandy.

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:25.090
This is around 1874.

01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:26.920
And he says, he writes
to George Sonde,

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.130
what we have to do is enlighten
the enlightened classes

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.430
because they know nothing.

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:34.510
And he says that, you know,

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:38.730
the proletariat isn't really the
problem, they know nothing, too,

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:40.560 position:56%
but it's the bourgeoisie who pretend

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.680
to run the world and
they know nothing.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.880
Yes? Go ahead?

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:53.730
&gt;&gt; Can you explain for us how
out of this cataclysm of conflict

01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:59.200
between left and right
in the Capitol of France

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.120
within 10 years there
actually was a Republic,

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.800
notwithstanding the decisive
military victory of the right

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:12.180
and the deportation of
the Communal and all that.

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:15.180
How did the Republic actually
succeed given all these forces,

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:20.210
beyond the fact that the King, the
would be King was so unacceptable

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:23.510
that he didn't resume Royalism?

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:25.140
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: That's
an astonishing story.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.620
I don't know quite
how to explain it.

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.290 position:56%
You know, Thiers was a real bastard,

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:35.060
but he was also politically
very adept.

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:39.140
He said the Republic is the
regime that divides us least.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:44.220
And I think that really comes
about in a kind of negative way,

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:49.320
that on the one hand Socialists,
on the other hand Monarchists.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.820
The Republic sort of
slips down the middle.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:58.010
And when the Republic gets
going, following the Commune,

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:01.430
there actually is an
agreement not to decide

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:03.740
on the form of the Government.

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:10.850
In the Assembly in 1871 that's left
as a blank, and the assumption is

01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:13.110
that the Monarchy will be restored.

01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:14.410
And it's only when you get

01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:17.400
to the Velo [Assumed Spelling]
Amendment a few years later

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.760
that it officially is entered into
the record that the Government

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.980
of France will be a Republic and
the Amendment wins by one vote.

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.250
So it's a very precarious thing.

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:33.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:38.000
&gt;&gt; Yes, I was interested when
you were mentioning the sort

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.090
of metaphors of volcanic eruption

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.260
because the same things
were appearing

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.270
in late 19th Century British
narratives of the city,

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:50.460
the sense of people sitting
on a volcanic eruption,

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.290
liable to blow at any moment.

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.260
I'm just wondering was
there something going on,

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:58.600
was there more archeological
evidence of volcanic eruptions

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.110
or was there more narratives
or volcanology?

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:08.450
Why was this metaphor suddenly
appearing for urbanizing societies?

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:10.020
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: That's
an interesting question.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.880
I don't know.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.970
Of course, meditations
on the slope of Vesuvius

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:19.400
and Etna [Assumed Spelling]
are fairly common

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.700
in the early 19th Century.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.100
I mean Byron's child, Harold,

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.570
Chateau Briand [Assumed
Spelling] in France and so on.

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:27.630
So the image of these [inaudible]

01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:31.920
but enormously destructive
volcanoes are there,

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.830
they're not far away
in Italy, right?

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:39.640 position:56%
And so I think this comparison comes
fairly naturally to people's minds.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:45.150
And then to equate the volcano
with the populace, you know,

01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:54.380
for right wing writers is too much
of a temptation to be resisted.

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:58.140
&gt;&gt; I have one comment on
the previous question,

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:05.040
how did the Republic
succeed in carrying the day?

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.550
The explanation I had
when I took history was

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:11.260
that the Royalists were
divided among themselves.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:15.290
You had the legitimate
just Bourbons,

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:18.820
you had early on it's Bourbons,
and then you had Bonapartists,

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.760
and they just couldn't
agree among themselves.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.580
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: Yes, but they did,
they came to a so-called fusion.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:26.830
The Count dechonbal
[Assumed Spelling],

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:30.410
who is the Bourbon pretender
to the throne, was childless,

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:36.560
so the fusion, this worked out in
1873 I think or maybe that summer

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.510
of 1874 - I think it's 1873 -

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:43.460 position:56%
said that Chambo [Assumed
Spelling] become King as [inaudible]

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:46.870
and when he died the throne passed

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:49.190
to the Orleone [Assumed Spelling]
branch, which is the branch

01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:52.280
of Louis Phillipe, right,
and the Count de Paris.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.790
So they had worked
that all out finally.

01:04:54.790 --> 01:05:03.600
It took 75 years, but
they had worked it out.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.490
&gt;&gt; Did any other French
writers write

01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:09.660
about the Commune in their fiction?

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:12.750
Malpassant [Assumed
Spelling], for example?

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:19.320
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: There is - it's
interesting - there is one writer

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:24.560
who writes directly about
his experiences coming out,

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.330
and that's Roux Vales [Assumed
Spelling], though his novel,

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:28.630
Lasiogaine [Assumed Spelling],

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:34.450
doesn't appear till a good
deal later, around mid-1880s.

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:37.010
There are a lot of people
later on who returned

01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:39.940
to the Commune, and it's funny.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:43.810
It's one of these events that as
history has gone on has become more

01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:46.900
and more important,
rather than less important.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:51.890
And the amount of historical
graphical material being produced,

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:53.920
I can't even keep up with it,

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.830
and really very interesting
reinterpretations,

01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:02.100
not only of the politics but
of the aesthetics of the time.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:04.160
I've just been reading a book

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.600
by a woman named Christine
Ross [Assumed Spelling],

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.950
who teaches at NYU, about the
meaning of the destruction

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:16.620
of the column of the Place von Dome
[Assumed Spelling], and the attempt

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:20.810
to create a new kind
of Communal aesthetics.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:23.730
Connected to William Morris
[Assumed Spelling] in England,

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:27.400
who is better known for
his craftsmen movement.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.810
But there was a lot of that,

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:31.980
every man an artist,
participatory artistry.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:36.080
So this is straying a little bit
from your question about novelists,

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:40.240
but it is something which is
I'd say more and more talked

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.070
about by novelists and
artists as time goes by.

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:59.070
&gt;&gt; So, as you were speaking about
the photograph as an eyewitness,

01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:02.980
so the past becomes as certain
as the present, I was thinking

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.830
about in relation to the
obviously manipulated image

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:09.130
that you pointed out earlier.

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:13.710
And I know that later in the
century that that kind of editing

01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:16.970
and manipulation of photographs
became sort of popular.

01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:19.690
I wondered if you came
across any other photographs

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:27.950
that had been edited to present
any particular point of view?

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:29.740
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: Other photographs?

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:33.240
&gt;&gt; Yes, so the photograph that
you showed of the firemen putting

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.210
out the fire, that
had been added later,

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:36.660
did you find any other photographs

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:41.970
that had been manipulated
in that way?

01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:43.300
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: Yes, that's
an interesting question

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.890
about the manipulation
of photographs.

01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:47.520
The ones I showed,
except for that one,

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:52.190
I promise you are not
manipulated, but there are a lot

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:53.510
of manipulated photographs.

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:55.670
And I kept them out
of the show partly

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:57.050
because I didn't want
to confuse people.

01:07:57.050 --> 01:08:03.620
For instance, there's a very
artfully posed pile of corpses

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:06.800
of National Guardsmen, but
as you study it you realize

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.750
that this is a posed picture.

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:14.940
So there's some pictures of killed
children lying in a Paris street.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:21.320 position:56%
But the poses, the way - you realize
that the thing is artificial,

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.630
there's something wrong about it.

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:23.930
Then there's Ugen Apierre
[Assumed Spelling],

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:27.660
who really was an early
exponent of Photoshop, right?

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:33.230
I mean he takes faces from
portraits and he puts them

01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:36.510
on bodies and rearranges them all.

01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:38.910
So there's a lot of
manipulation going on.

01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:41.410
And it's interesting because
people have said that at the trial

01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:45.350
of the Communals the
photographs were used as evidence.

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:47.870
Well, I don't know how much
they counted as evidence,

01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:52.750
but if they did they
shouldn't have, right?

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:56.720
So my point is really the
real evidence is the ruins.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:03.030
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: We
have time for one more.

01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:04.330
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: Okay.

01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:06.790
&gt;&gt; I think I fall in the category
of those who are fascinated

01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:09.640
with the morbid that
you pointed out.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:14.530
but that photo of the
corpses arranged in the grave

01:09:14.530 --> 01:09:19.590
so meticulously it seems,
the first layer they seemed

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:24.320
to be wearing just white, plain
white garments, and those that are

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:30.100
on the layer on top are
more fancily dressed.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:33.600
Is that - was there
any lesson in that or?

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.230
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: It could have been
that the photographer wanted that.

01:09:37.230 --> 01:09:42.730 position:56%
you notice that they have numbers on
them, too, and I think the numbers -

01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:46.900
I can't tell because I've
never examined the original

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.980
of this the way I have of the
Labere [Assumed Spelling],

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:52.800
whether the numbers were added
on the photograph or were they

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.660
on the corpses - I think they're
on the corpses because if you look

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:59.110
in the lower row for instance
it looks as if some of them are

01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:03.510
on paper tickets or
stickers on the corpses.

01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:08.630
So there's evidently some
record being created here,

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:12.170
some register being
kept of the dead,

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:17.020
and I don't know at whose behest.

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:21.370
I think it's an absolutely
stunning photograph, horrible.

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:24.490
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: I think
we will have to stop there.

01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:25.790
So please join me in
thanking Dr. Peter Brooks.

01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:27.090
&gt;&gt; Peter Brooks: Thank you.

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:28.890
Thank you for coming.

01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:32.040
[ Applause ]

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.540
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
