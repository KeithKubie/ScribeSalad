Speaker 1:          00:00          If you are listening to radiolab, Radiolab from [inaudible], W N, y. S. E. N, n. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast. And today since we are right about to have the New York City Marathon Zip through our neighborhoods senior in New York, we have a puzzle. Yeah, it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle. It's a, it's a, yes, it is a puzzle and it comes from, uh, NPRs East Africa correspondent, Gregory Warner. I've prepared for this story by taking a jog through Nairobi. Well, all right, so where do we start with this, Greg? I think we should start in 1968 I mean, there's a lot of places we could start, but let's start there. Let's try it. So 1968 summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico City, thankfully [inaudible] piece on the Olympic opening day, it's 7,900 feet, one of the highest elevated Olympics. And that's difficult for runners because there's less oxygen. And one of the big races that everybody's looking forward to is the 1500 meter between the 23 year old American. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:09          Favorite Jim Ryan. Ryan of America number 300 he's the world record holder and this guy named Kip Chuggy, Kane, Kane, Kenya, number five six five kip Kane's got flip cam. They bill him as an untrained Andy tribesmen from Kenya. He's actually a policeman from a long line of cattle wrestlers. Marvin Woodruff was the winner. And here's what you need to know about Kipp. He's running three different races at this Olympics, 1500 meters, not only the 1500 but also the 5,000 meter and the 10,000 meters. If you include the qualifying measures, he'll be running six Olympic events in eight days. Wow. Six races in eight days, which would never be done today was hardly done then.

Speaker 1:          01:52          So first step, have about the later 10,000 meter race. He's in the lead two laps away from finishing. When he collapses,

Speaker 3:          02:01          it falls off the track. He gets rushed to the Kenyan doctors, a German guy who diagnosed him with a gallbladder infection, Mitch turns out is incredibly painful, actually hurts the most when you take deep breaths, like when you're running and if you don't treat it, your gallbladder could burst. So basically

Speaker 1:          02:21          who the doctor sends, kept bed says there's no way you can run, but Kipp, he runs the next race anyway, ends up getting silver. Wow. He sent to bed by the German doctor again who literally says, okay, this time you have to stay in bed. If you run any more races, you could die

Speaker 2:          02:37          back to the drag for one of the most memorable events are they old games? The 1500 meters,

Speaker 1:          02:42          three days later. It's the big matchup against Jim Ryan and Kipp. Apparently he just leaped out of bed an hour before the race and he said something like, if I die, I'm going to die in the track. It's really complicated. So kip Kaino starts, they're off

Speaker 4:          03:00          and running, three and three quarter labs for the stadium.

Speaker 2:          03:03          He starts out dead last.

Speaker 4:          03:04          Okay. I know running my ass and then moving up to the middle of the pack. Now

Speaker 2:          03:09          how? By the end of the first lap, he's in third

Speaker 4:          03:10          drop out, the Germany's back at and Kipp Kaino third,

Speaker 2:          03:13          third lap. He takes the lead.

Speaker 4:          03:15          Here comes gift k. Now having up with this teammates,

Speaker 2:          03:18          he goes ahead, but that's okay. For Jim Ryan. Jim Ryan's known to have the greatest kick in the sport. Okay, kick right at the end of the race. Every runner gives this extra boost and Ryan's got the best kick in the business. Good. Brian is beginning, so he's thinking there's no way that kip Kaino at altitude suffering a gallbladder infection can hold out against my kick. Very rough in the, in the final lap. It looks like he's right. Starts shooting up the field, gaining on Kipp Kaino who is clearly in pain, sort of reminiscing, reading his teeth.

Speaker 5:          03:57          Hey y'all. Good job. Lurching.

Speaker 2:          04:02          Did the finish line and even though he's in an ungodly amount of pain, even though pain is shooting through his entire body,

Speaker 5:          04:11          amazingly

Speaker 2:          04:13          he does not slow down. Jim Ryan never catches

Speaker 5:          04:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:24          when he hung on around that last turn, it was all, I was hysterical. This is John Manners. I'm a semi retired journalists who for many years had a specialty in covering the exploits of Kenyan runners, African runners in general. He was watching that race in a bar about 50 miles north of New York, but as a kid, manners actually lived in the part of Kenya. The KIP Keto is from my people, and so when Kaino won gold, it sparked a question for manners that he would spend the next 40 years thinking about. I wanted to find a reason why my people, as I chose to regard them were great because on that day in 1968

Speaker 6:          05:12          ushered in an era of east African dominance

Speaker 2:          05:17          in the sport. It's 10 year your, it's kind your, it's can be applied. It is almost hard to believe,

Speaker 5:          05:22          but Kenyans have done it again. One, two,

Speaker 2:          05:27          yeah. It was a once again as the eighth successive gold medal in Olympic history, so 1968 was the beginning of the Kenyan dominance and running. Yeah, but

Speaker 1:          05:41          in the United States we think of Kenyans as being good runners, but really it's this one tiny, small geographic swath within Kenya where all the runners come from. That's David Epstein. He's a senior editor at sports illustrated. He wrote a book called the sports gene, and the swath that he's talking about is in western Kenya. It's a mountainous region spread out about the size of Massachusetts and the people who live there are a particular tribe of Kenyans called the Caligiuri, pretty small group of people. His tribe accounts for about 0.06% of the world's population. But from this one tiny tribe has come this unbelievable fount of talent that I think is unparalleled in any other sport ever.

Speaker 7:          06:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          06:24          there's all kinds of, statistics sort of becomes laughable. Uh, you know, there've been five American high school runners who have broken four minutes in the mile. The first was actually Jim Ryan, but there's one high school, any 10 in Kenya that had four sub four minors at the same time. There's 17 American men in history who have run under two 10 in the marathon. That's about four minutes and 58 seconds per mile pace. 17 American men in history. There were 32 [inaudible] who did it in October of 2011 so you start to look at these statistics and it, and it appears to be the greatest concentration of elite athletic talent ever

Speaker 1:          07:04          in any sport, anywhere in the world. And that's the question. I mean, how does that happen? That was John Manners question 40 years ago. Something has to account for this extraordinary set of numbers, but what [inaudible], and there have been any number of scientists and sports gurus and athletes have gone to this place to figure out what's happening. What's the, what's the secret here? You know, and this, and there's all kinds of theories. Like it's something about the tree that they use to make the spoon, which they used to mix the corn meal. What would the tree do? Well, this was this Swedish scientist who came in and looked at Lugalia, which is a corn meal. It's the basic staple food of, of Kenyans because he wanted to mix it with the water from the spring in the pot that Calonge in use thinking that something chemical was happening that was making these, these guys, you know, run super fast that, I mean, you know, it's kind of silly but, but a lot of people here, Tom, tell me it's the bananas, but people have also suggested some more reasonable theories.

Speaker 1:          08:03          Well John Manners. People talk a lot about altitude and the ability to process oxygen and what have you. Other people have said it's cause the calendar didn't have a high starchy diet or because they run to school. This is a very prominent phenomenon. We know that the runners that come from the calendar and tribe to become great runners, they're much more likely to have run to, to and from school long distances like 10 k to and from school. But there are millions of kids in Kenya who run to and from school or who live in altitude. The problem with all of these is that these are not specific to the Collagen. Yeah. So then you get the socioeconomic arguments. The salary of a runner is a, is attractive, you know, 10 or $20,000 a year seems like a fortune worth striving for, but the country's not so poor that it can't send competitors to the athletic competitions. This is Malcolm Gladwell's argument actually. Very close. Yeah. There's a, there's a social pressure to it. This is how you get out. Yeah. And there's so many role. I mean every village has some kind of champion. Yeah. The problem with that argument, I mean there's actually no problem with the argument. It makes sense, but it doesn't say how the calendar and got so good in the first place that they created these role models. I mean, where did the role models come from?

Speaker 8:          09:08          So the idea you're left with is maybe there's something genetically different about them that makes them better than us.

Speaker 5:          09:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          09:18          this is obviously a dangerous idea. And in fact, when David Epstein was writing his book about sports and athletics, almost backed out of writing the book because I realized I was going to have to address ethnic differences and gender differences. I, I really did almost back out of it. There were scientists who confessed to me that they were withholding data, that they had studies that show to genetic advantage, but they wouldn't show him because they were afraid that they'd lose tenure.

Speaker 8:          09:44          But he says you have to acknowledge the obvious. One aspect of innate biology that clearly helps Calonge and a that's been studied by scientists is their bodybuilding. So the calendar and what's called a, a lot of people they're from, they have ancestry in very low latitude. I was criss crossing the equator when I was visiting their track, their training camps, and when you have your ancestry in a hot and dry climate, you have have a certain body type for cooling and we know this, we've known this for over a century. It's called Alan's rule. That organisms, not just humans, all organisms that evolved and hot and dry climates have a certain body type, namely very long and thin limbs so that there's a lot of surface area through which he can dissipate their limbs, get thinner the farther away they get from their center of gravity. So they have extremely thin ankles and extremely thin calves, which is particularly important because your leg is like a pendulum and the more weight you have farther away from your center of gravity, the more difficult it is to swing.

Speaker 8:          10:39          This has been tested in the lab too, right? So you take a runner and put eight pounds of weight around their waist, it increases the energy they have to use to run at a given pace. But if you take that same eight pounds and put it in the form of two four pound weights around their ankles, it's like over 25% the increase in energy, they need to run at the same pace. So if you have fed ankles, find a different sport, right? You're not going to win the New York marathon if you have a thick ankles. And so it gets you to this place where you think, well, I dunno, maybe halogen from these area, maybe they have this built in advantage. Hmm, it's physics. I don't know. Somehow like I to Sorta just peg it all on physics

Speaker 1:          11:18          smells like an argument that I really don't like. Oh, nobody likes it. I don't think it's a question of like or dislike. I think it's just not the reason I watched the Olympics. I mean, you know, going back to Kipp Kaino. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          11:30          Why? Huh? Who

Speaker 1:          11:32          overcame a gallbladder infection to break the Olympic world record in 1968 he didn't win because he had thin ankles. He won because of something which is the reason we watch sports. You know, it's dead essence that will power or triumph over adversity. Right? The triumph of the human over everything. Yes. And this is where I ran across a completely new, fascinating and somewhat terrifying way of explaining why the [inaudible] are so good and it's an idea that eventually led me to go to calendar and country myself. That's perfect way of beginning a little cow hoot to get to 10 which is in the mountains. The air is cool. There's a lot of cows, lot of people and it around 5:36 AM all you hear is the, the pitter patter of feet and then all these people just pass you all of a sudden and then you know, you wait for a few more seconds to two people pass you again because everybody's running.

Speaker 1:          12:29          I even started morning jogging when I was there. I'm not really a morning jogger, but it just kind of got into the flow. Anyway, while I was there, I met this guy, his name's brother Cole McConnell Colombo. I'm Irish of course, came to Kenya in 1976 famous running coach. He works with a lot of Kenyan runners. So I met him in an Irish pub in Eldoret, which is, um, there's only one when I asked him this question, what is it that bakes the calendar so good. This is what he told me. When you, when you're train an athlete, um, to a high level, you need to remember that they live on the edge of injury. They live on the edge of overtraining. They leave on the age of paint, paint, paint, television, CSF. They look to some degree. Everybody has a runner, talks about this insidious protean nature of pain, how it finds all the places you become breathless and in your lungs have needles.

Speaker 1:          13:27          The best runners have to learn to mentally override these distress signals to run. Despite the page. He actually calls it expanding your pain barrier, but Columbo, Connell says for the calendar, pain is something else entirely. You know your ability to withstand pain, that that in a sense into [inaudible] tradition made you a man. Quite literally the central event of their young lives will come up when they are going to be initiated into the tribe. That's John Manners. Again, remember he spent part of his childhood in calendaring territory and he says when he was a boy, say 12 years old, he would notice his friends had scars on their arms and legs, marks of having burned their arms and legs with the hot coals. He soon learned they were practicing for this initiation moment. And you know, you're facing it for 10 years at least because as a calender and teenager, boy or girl, you have to go through an experience which is so painful. It's a kind of theatrical orgy of pain. And here's what happens. First you have to crawl naked through stinging nettles, um, which is like formic acid, you know, and African stinging nettles are much, much skinnier than the western stinging nettle. But then your, your, your fingers are squeezed together. Then you get beaten on that bony part of your ankle where it really hurts. But that's just warm up because then

Speaker 9:          14:53          one morning

Speaker 1:          14:55          calms the circumcision. Now we have some idea of how circumcision works. Maybe some of us are circumcised. So you perform it on a baby and it's, it's one kind of experience. I've gone through that myself. I've seen it done. I've had to hold the legs also my nephew, it's hard, but the calendar can circumcise somewhere right after puberty. So around age 13 to 17 mm oh, they're four skin is, is not only cut, but it's tied into a bow. The more than that, the tied into the boating thing. Got To stop there. I kind of froze. I don't really know how to describe it past there. I believe that

Speaker 9:          15:33          of the, either the top or the bottom of the foreskin is pierced and then the head of the penis has pushed through the opening.

Speaker 1:          15:41          Uh, and the thing is it's not just the cut. Actually when he undergoes the operation, he is obliged be absolutely stoical still unflinching. So in some versions of this ceremony, mud is caked on the face and then the mud is allowed to dry. If a crack appears in the mud, your cheek may twitch your, your forehead may crinkle. And if that happens, a little crack will appear in the mud. And all the people around will know to immediately start beating you with large sticks. So worst part though is not just the beating, it's that after that moment, if you don't make it through this ceremony, you get labeled a cabby. Tet a coward. You're a pariah in society. You're not part of society. In the olden days, you didn't have access to the economic opportunities to afford what's called the bride price, which is what you, what you need to get a wife.

Speaker 1:          16:35          However, if you show yourself to be a true warrior, if you make it through this experience, then then hey, you get the rights of reproduction. You may even have two or three wives. So manners wondered then he's just speculating here. But maybe if you have 2000 years of this sexual selection of ensuring that the stoical tough guy types get to have babies, the sensitive types don't. Maybe it's not just that the calendar are built for speed, it's not just that they have the body type. Maybe they have some sort of innate ability mentally to persevere through pain. Huh. And is that a cultural ability or would he say that all that selection has filtered into their DNA in some way? Well, so manners this, he isn't sure, and there's certainly no gene for stoicism that that's been discovered. And any athletic success has to be ascribed to a host of factors.

Speaker 1:          17:27          But W can I play one cut? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's here. So, um, all right. So I was in Eaton, I was thinking about that question and I met this kid named Ellie kip cocaine. He's 19 years old. So self-described bookwork from the very beginning. I never wanted to go through the traditional form of circumcision cause I knew the ordeal as in it was so, and actually what he said was please circumcise me in the hospital. I want to do the cowardly way. But his relative said no, you, you chain the entire family and if you don't do it, yeah

Speaker 10:         17:59          you're not a fool man. That's how they put it. So he felt like he had to just do it cause I still had this beatings. You're supposed to stay for night. I was inside the Coldwater then, uh, early in the morning, around seven in the morning. It's a conversation they use, I sharp stick. I hope you understand that. A sharp stick. So it's just,

Speaker 1:          18:25          and he said the whole initiation ritual actually went on for a couple of weeks. It was more than just the cut. And during the whole time he was kept in a hut on the outskirts of the village. Is faced with powdered white like a ghost, and he was told, whenever you leave this hut, you are not allowed to work. You're not allowed to walk. So you're supposed to run very fast. So you only [inaudible] having the opinion. And before the circumcision, Ellie was never a runner. Afterwards, when he was done with initiation and he was back in high school, I said, Oh, let me give it a try so I could run and I feel pain. I feel pain, I'm feeling pain and I wanted to stop [inaudible] let me try. Let me just tell you. They didn't tell him I one one one 21 one time and two minutes later I was at school.

Speaker 1:          19:12          Ellie joined his track team, started running to school and during his lunchtimes and after 24 two weeks and three weeks, I became an expert and I was known as the school cliff after how long? After two weeks salon to Salon. Two weeks. That's how we began. That's a crazy stories. That really true. Yeah, that's true. So probably my ability of running was a bit higher than dressed. Turns out Ellie's mom was an accomplished athlete. Okay, so you're saying you had some physical ability to run, but you just didn't really do it before? I never realized that I could run. So we didn't talk at all about women, but calendars and girls also go through an initiation, right of their own female genital mutilation, the same type of ritual, not the same ceremony, but a similar type of stoical testing ceremony. And to me this made no sense. This is John Manners again.

Speaker 9:          19:58          Obviously the women are not the warriors, they don't need to be brave. Why is it important for them to show courage during this operation? And when I asked this question of my calendar and friends many years ago, they were kind of astonished at the question as though the answer should have been self evident. And the answer they gave me was a woman who chose cowardice during this operation might bear cowardly sons.

Speaker 1:          20:26          So some Collagen might say that Ellie actually got two things from his mom. One was his physical prowess, his speed on the track. The other was a mental ability to persevere through pain. People usually say it's called a blessing in college. [inaudible] blessing is what you get. Probably a father, probably a grandmother. So you wish he blesses you with that activity. That's what you used to see the blessing. That's,

Speaker 11:         20:58          that's pretty interesting, right? It's interesting, although we're using inheriting words are blessing words. What we're really talking about is the pressure of a culture that is simply choosing to deeply, psychically reward certain behaviors and create expectations for those behaviors and create success around those behaviors. Those are all cultural, not biological things, but they, they are the equivalent. I think it's both. Uh,

Speaker 1:          21:27          and I don't know what proportion each contributes to the ultimate result. I, it's, I have no way of judging, but whatever the mechanism and whatever it is, it'll probably stay a mystery of all the explanations out there for why this one group of people is so good at running. This is the first one that's made me want to run. Hmm. Once I met Ellie and talk to these runners in Kenya, you know, this is a embarrassing story because I don't run very fast, but I got to the gym and I was on the treadmill and I was like, I'm taking it up to seven you know, seven miles an hour, like 7.1 actually I went and you know that's not like very fast, but that would usually be my end run like at the last five minutes I'm I do with them. But it went, but I did the whole 25 minutes at 7.1 and I thought, how did, why did I ever think that this was undoable before?

Speaker 1:          22:19          Why was I staying at like 6.8 if we're trying to figure out what makes these runners so great? And our first answer is a totally scientifically, factually true, but somehow demoralizing absolute. That puts one set of people over there and the rest of us over here, we all have our body type that we're born with. But then if the second explanation of this Calonge in advantage, maybe just as inaccessible to the rest of us, but still it feels like a more egalitarian version of advantage, even if we're talking about a very specific culture. Yeah. I think the, if you run with this extreme pain for a month after having been circumcised and somehow that gave you a certain culturally troubling but also real relationship to pain, that feels like a fair advantage to me. Not that I would wish it on anyone. Actually. Even Ellie does not wish it on his kids when he has kids.

Speaker 1:          23:17          The system is changing from the traditional format to the new format right now. I mean, he's part of a new generation of Collagen. He says for his contemporaries, the painfree hospital circumcision is becoming slowly less of a stigma. And I can't imagine my son going through the same procedure as their father. So my son, one of my sons went to go through the same procedure as I did, but um, didn't, I mean, don't you want your son to be, to have the benefits of what you, the benefits only a boot. The perseverance part of it and they believe [inaudible] can get through many ways. He tells himself he's going to be able to pass on those Calonge and values without resorting to the ancient rituals. I will teach him how to persevere and he thinks his kids will still be able to be champion runners if that's what they want to be.

Speaker 12:         24:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          24:24          thanks to Gregory Warner, NPRs East Africa correspondent. Also, we should say thanks to FIA Beneen for production help on this piece. Thank you for you and thank you guys for listening. I'm Chad. I'm Robert. We'll see you next time.
