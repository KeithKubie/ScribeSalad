00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.379
Herpes is super common among humans.

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.340
50 to 80 percent of U.S. adults and more than
2/3 of the world population have it.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.449
And pretty much everyone will be exposed to
it in their lifetime.

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.839
But where did exactly did it come from?

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.629
Herpes simplex is a virus and there are two
types.

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.279
Oral is Type 1 and genital is Type 2 -- when
it comes to oral we’ve always had it.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.039
The virus has been with us since we before
we were considered “modern humans.”

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.160
but Type 2 -- genital herpes is new!

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.670
Evidence shows that when we split from our chimpanzee common ancestor

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.140
about 7 million years ago, we did not have
the herpes simplex 2 virus.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.460
Then somewhere between 3 and 1.4 million years
ago, we got it.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.340
The carrier, it seems, was an intermediate
species unrelated to humans called Paranthropus

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.899
boisei,  which
was “a heavyset bipedal hominin with a smallish

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.850
brain and dish-like face.”

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.930
What a hottie.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.859
This hominin likely contracted the virus by
scavenging infected ancestral chimp meat.

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.940
The virus would have passed from kill to killer
through a bite or open sore.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.559
And the new virus then shared mouth-space
with the simplex 1 virus.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.610
Over time found a happier home in a different
"mucosal niche.”

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.610
The genitals.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.120
It got to us because P. boisei

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.490
and our direct ancestors Homo erectus lived
in close enough proximity for the two genetic

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.610
lines cross and share the virus.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.150
There’s evidence that the Homo erectus butchered
and hunted its food, which means our ancestors

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.850
likely got the herpes type-2 virus by eating
infected meat...

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.720
But… it’s also possible that we got it
through interspecies intercourse with anthropological

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.220
hottie P. Boisei.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.090
From there it was passed around from mother
to child and plain ol’ exposure.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.660
As weird as this is to think about… it actually
says a lot about the resilience of viruses.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.380
It’s not common for a virus to transfer
between species, though we are seeing a rise

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.400
in this happening with things like swine flu,
bird flu, ebola, and even HIV.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.490
It can, unfortunately, happen innocuously
in some instances, say a chance encounter

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.880
with a sick animal while traveling abroad.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.630
But in most cross-species cases, the virus
needs a lucky genetic mutation and a lot of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.440
fluid exchange for this to happen, which is
consistent with BOTH consuming meat and hot

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.360
ancient interspecies sex.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.359
It also helped that P. boisei [boys-ee-eye],
though not a direct relative, was closer to

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.239
homo erectus than some other more distant
mammals.

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.830
Close genes allow a virus to infect a new
host more easily, and now it’s primed to

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.480
spread through the new species.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.510
So, herpes and humans have a pretty long shared
history.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.030
Thanks to either meat eating, or … well
you get it.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.430
Welcome home herpes, I guess?

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.090
Luckily, we’re getting better at managing
those cross-species viruses, but how close

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.920
are we to curing HIV?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.019
We did a video about it here.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.150
Even worse than trans-species viruses?

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.260
Two pathogens can also and morph in your gut,
turning into a brand new and potentially deadly

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.260
virus!

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.760
Yay!
