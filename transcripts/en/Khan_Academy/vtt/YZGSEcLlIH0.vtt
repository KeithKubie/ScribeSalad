00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.710
- [Instructor] So we have
an interesting circuit here.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.210
The goal of this video is to
figure out what is the current

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.850
that flows through this six-ohm resistor?

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.930
Pause this video, and see
if you can work through it.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.150
So the way that I am going to tackle it

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.900
is first simplify the circuit.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.570
Take these two resistors in parallel,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.390
and think about what the
equivalent resistance would be.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.240
And we have seen that before.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.250
One over the equivalent resistance

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.450
is going to be equal to one over 6.0 ohms

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.240
plus one over 12.0 ohms.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.800
1/6 is the same thing as two over 12.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.660
So 2/12 plus 1/12 is 3/12.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.430
And 3/12, you could view that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.290
as the same thing as one over 4.0 ohms.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.320
And so one over the equivalent resistance

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.330
is equal to one over four ohms.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.110
Well, that means that
the equivalent resistance

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.680
is four ohms.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.590
And so we can simplify our circuit now,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.860
where we replace these
two resistors in parallel

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.100
with one resistor of the
equivalent resistance,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.830
and that is going to be
equal to a four-ohm resistor.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.640
Now the next thing we could
do is we could figure out

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.260
what the current is through
this part of the circuit,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.800
which would be the same
thing as the current

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.960
right over there.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.940
We could call that i sub one.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.890
And we can just use Ohm's law for that.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.500
We would have i sub one would
be equal to our voltage drop,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.230
which is 24 volts,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.870
24 volts

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.170
divided by

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.000
the equivalent resistance of
these two resistors in series.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.340
And when you have resistors
in series, you just add 'em up

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.060
to figure out the equivalent resistance.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.720
So this would be divided by 2.0 ohms

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.370
plus four ohms,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.190
plus 4.0 ohms.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.240
24 divided by two plus four,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.600
or 24 divided by six, is four.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.150
And since we're dealing
with two significant digits,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.760
it'll be 4.0.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.900
And we're talking about current,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.650
so this is 4.0 amps, or 4.0 amperes.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.570
Now how do we use that information

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.310
to calculate this current right over here?

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.630
We can call that i sub two.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.600
Now one way to think about it is

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.140
what is going to be your voltage drop

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.060
from this point to this point?

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.890
If you know the voltage drop
from that point to that point

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.050
and if you know that the
voltage drop from this point

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.010
all the way down here is,

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.740
then we can figure out what
the voltage drop from here

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.210
to here is going to be.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.490
So let's do that.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.960
So the voltage drop across
this first resistor,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.220
remember, your change in voltage

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.260
is just equal to your current
times your resistance.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.670
And so this is going to be,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.110
your current is going to be four amperes

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.970
times your resistance is two ohms,

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.413
times two ohms, which is going
to be equal to 8.0 volts.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.360
And so if the voltage
difference between that point

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.210
and that point is 24 volts,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.060
which we know from this voltage source,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.780
but if we drop eight volts
as we go to this point,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.400
well, then the difference
between this point and this point

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.370
or this point and this
point right over here,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.700
this has got to be a 16-volt drop.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.540
If our delta V across the
six-ohm resistor is equal to

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.740
16 volts,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.880
well, then we can use Ohm's
law again to figure out i two.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.730
I sub two is going to be
equal to our drop in voltage,

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.300
so 16 volts, divided by this resistance,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.120
six ohms.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.210
And so what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.210
16 divided by six is 2 4/6 or 2 2/3,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.190
or 2.666666, and if we round
to two significant digits,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.110
you're going to have 2.7 amps.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.210
And so we just figured out
what we wanted to figure out.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.980
This right over here is
2.7 amps, or 2.7 amperes.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.980
But we can keep analyzing it.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.560
For fun, I encourage you to figure out

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.230
what that current is now,
the current i sub three.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.490
And use the exact same technique.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.170
And one thing that you should
feel very comfortable of

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.530
is that this current that is flowing

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.800
through the first resistor,
that four-ampere current,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.950
that current gets split
between i two and i three.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.950
And so i two and i three should add up

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.460
to the original four amps.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.110
So just thinking about it that way,

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.950
if you do the same type
of analysis we just did,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.620
you should get 1.3 amps
for i three because 2.7

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.323
plus 1.3 is going to
be equal to four amps.
