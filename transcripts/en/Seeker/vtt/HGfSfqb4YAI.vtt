00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.950
Turns out that fake weed you can
buy has some very real dangers.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:04.680
I know, shocker.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.510
Hey, this is Annie for D News.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.270
Even as medical
marijuana is legalized

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.100
in a growing number
of US states,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.290
synthetic cannabis
continues to thrive

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.224
as a cheap and legal-ish
way to catch a buzz.

00:00:21.224 --> 00:00:23.140
You might have seen these
around at head shops

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.310
or even gas stations,
under the names K2, Spice,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.165
Black Mamba, Funky Green Stuff.

00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:29.530
You'll know it when you see it.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.800
Often marketed as
incense or potpourri

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.020
and labeled not for human
consumption, wink-wink.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.420
Why do I say legal-ish?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.490
Well, synthetic drugs
are hard to regulate

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.080
because their
compounds can be so

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.140
easily re-formulated to avoid
laws like the 2012 federal ban

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.030
on synthetic drugs,
which has not done much

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.170
to slow their production.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.410
And synthetic cannabis
is actually a misnomer,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.190
because it's not
cannabis at all.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.820
This stuff is basically a
bunch of dried shredded plant

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.660
material with chemical
additives that

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.090
are supposed to produce a
cannabis-like high, elevated

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.470
mood, altered perception.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.972
You know, high.

00:01:01.972 --> 00:01:03.430
And among high
school seniors, it's

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.610
the second most popular way to
get there behind actual pot.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.800
According to the National
Institute on Drug Abuse,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.761
about 11% of the teens
surveyed had tried it.

00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:13.260
And synthetic
cannabinoids have been

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.720
linked to thousands of
hospitalizations, including

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.597
60 in a single
weekend in Colorado.

00:01:18.597 --> 00:01:21.180
Granted it was Labor Day weekend
and there was a Phish concert

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.080
happening, but still, 60.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.860
But even beyond those
hysterical local news headlines,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920
the dangers of synthetic
drugs are increasingly

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.820
supported by medical research.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.000
In a study published in
the Journal of Pediatrics,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.220
the drug K2 was tied
to heart attacks

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.590
in the case of three
hospitalized teens in Texas

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.700
who had smoked it.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.430
And this week, toxicologists
from the University of Arkansas

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.340
confirmed that
synthetic weed can

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.100
produce side effects like
seizures, hallucinations,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.440
kidney damage, and
psychotic behavior

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.501
that can linger for
months in some cases.

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:51.500
But they also determined
that those side effects

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.870
can vary widely from
person to person.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.620
In the meantime, I'm
not going to tell you

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.510
what to do with your
lives, but maybe

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.270
avoid smoking incense you
can buy at gas stations.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.240
Just a thought.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.970
Have you seen any of
these sold in stores

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.530
or heard any stories
about their effects?

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.990
Tell us your story
in the comments.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.490
And as always,
thanks for tuning in.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.400
See you next time.
