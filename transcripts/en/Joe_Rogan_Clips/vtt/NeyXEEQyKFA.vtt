1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.250
We talked about Syria early,
you know,
half the population is displaced.
Yeah.
Uh,

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.210
you know,
you're talking about,
you know,
12,

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:10.650
13 million people internally displaced or fled,
uh,
you know,

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.140
just unimaginable,
unimaginable.

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.000
And it's one of the biggest controversies in this country in terms of what to do

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.150
when the refugees come of what,
what,
what do you do?

7
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:24.570
Some countries are taking them in with open arms.
Some countries are not.

8
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.110
And there's a lot of people that are concentrating on the negative aspects of

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.560
taking these people into your communicate community.
Um,
what,
what is your,

10
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.600
what is your take on watching all this thing happen?

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
Why watching all this time I was,
I spent a Friday and Saturday in,

12
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:41.260
I'm in Houston with a group of Afghan interpreters who had been with in

13
00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:45.270
Afghanistan who got these special immigrant visas and came to America with that,

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.010
with their families.
Um,

15
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.030
I cannot think of a better group of people who are contributing to,
to life here.

16
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.140
I mean,
on the Saturday morning they were,
they were running a food bank.
Um,

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.670
they've got jobs,
they're paying taxes.
Um,
yeah.
I mean,

18
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.060
I think we should welcome them with open arms.
And I think,
you know,

19
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.350
despite our moral obligation to do that,
I think we would benefit from,
from,

20
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:09.610
from doing it.
And you know,

21
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.990
we turned away Jewish refugees during World War II.

22
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.060
You'd think we'd learn from that and say never again.
You know,
I mean,
if you're,

23
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:19.530
if you're an American Christian,

24
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.240
I think Christianity is fairly clear on what to do with refugees.
Yes.
You know?

25
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.590
Um,
so,
so the Viton to,
to not only say no to refugees,

26
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:32.700
but also to vilify them and say,
oh look,
a lot of them are fighting age males.

27
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.610
Yeah.
Clearly Isis sneaking in.
I mean,
that's a level of,

28
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.580
of viciousness and ignorance that I just,
I just can't fathom the ignorance is,

29
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.080
it's,
it's very pervasive,
right?
It's like,

30
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.280
it's one of these things where we don't,
you don't know,
you're,

31
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.840
you're reading these stories in there.

32
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:56.610
There's people were telling you these are fighting age males and that we could

33
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:59.010
very well be letting isis in to our country.

34
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.840
We were very well could be letting in these terrorist cells and allowing them to

35
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:04.674
come in.

36
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.920
But we also could be letting families in that this is a country that's made of

37
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:11.041
immigrants.
I mean,

38
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:14.250
it's one of the weirdest things in this country that this is a country so,

39
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.110
so obsessed with borders and immigration,

40
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.280
but yet it's comprised entirely of immigrants.
Yeah,
there's a great,
um,

41
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.690
do you know,
um,
Gary Young,
the British journalists know,
uh,

42
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.660
he interviews Richard Spencer,
um,
and Richard spent a,

43
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:34.770
Gary Young I think makes it a very similar point.
And Richard Spencer says,
yeah,

44
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:38.770
but this country was built by white people.
Um,
you know,
um,
we,

45
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.320
we came up with that.
He said,
no,
no.

46
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.680
It was literally built by black people carry young says,
he says,
yeah,
yeah,

47
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:47.730
but only because we told them how to do it and it's on camera.
Gary Young says,

48
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:48.564
you know what,

49
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.200
I came to see you cause I thought you were the intellectual argument for the,

50
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:55.110
for supporting Trump.
So I thought I'd might learn something.

51
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.530
Spencer was the heat.
Why do you think that?
I don't know.
But he says,
you're not.

52
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.990
This is just ridiculous.
And he just shuts down the interview,

53
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:04.000
turns around and walks off and good for him.

54
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:08.080
I don't know anything about Richard Spencer other than he always gets mentioned

55
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.280
as a white supremacist.
I literally don't know what he stands for,

56
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.460
what he does or what he says,

57
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.350
and they will say he's well dressed and with a nice heck yeah.
This is,
uh,

58
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.540
yeah.
It's just such a crazy subject.
The idea of,
I mean,

59
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.290
it would be nice if the whole world was up to the same standards of health and,

60
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.240
and prosperity and he didn't have to worry about where you could go if the whole

61
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:39.241
world was essentially like the United States where you could go to where the

62
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:42.970
good parts were.
You know,
if you live in Detroit and you save up your money,

63
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:46.450
you can move to Florida or wherever you want to go.
I mean,
you can do that.

64
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.320
This is the beautiful thing about living inside of a country.

65
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.960
Be fantastic.
If the whole world was like that,

66
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.130
you could just kind of go wherever you would prosper and wherever things would

67
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:57.521
be well.

68
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:01.780
But this the thing about refugees and other countries where we don't understand

69
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:04.500
their language or their culture and then you get scared because you hear that

70
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:09.280
they're Muslims were worried about Muslim terrorists and
it's,
again,

71
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:13.260
it's one more piece of information that just,

72
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.920
it just overwhelms you.
One more.
One more thing to concentrate on.

73
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.580
There is a difference with Muslims in the Catholic Church and child abuse

74
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.520
scandal.
Did a lot of people say,
oh,

75
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:29.020
therefore all Christians are suspicious and all Christians are secretly files,

76
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.900
right?
They're just not telling them,
no,
they didn't.
They didn't.

77
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.460
But they do with Muslims.
Well,
it's fear of the unknown.
You know,

78
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.270
it's a lot of it.
The languages and the,
the fact that we're,
you know,

79
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.490
there's also this,
there has to be this feeling that we've invaded their country,

80
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.940
several countries and been there for a long time.

81
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.270
And there's a deep seated resentment that,
you know,
there's the,

82
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:56.860
the thought of every time you accidentally blow up a wedding party with a drone,

83
00:04:56.861 --> 00:05:01.510
every time you kill civilians,
every,
any times,
any collateral damage,

84
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:06.190
you're creating untold numbers of people that hate the United States.

85
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.390
You know,
having traveled to most of those countries,
I don't see,
don't see that.

86
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.120
And yesterday I was interviewing the Afghan interpreters and I said,

87
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.940
what do you think about negotiating with the Taliban?
I mean,
in one case,

88
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:19.990
a good friend of mine called Thrush,
um,
who's,
who's now living in Houston.

89
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.431
I said,
um,
you know,

90
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:24.830
these guys killed your brother because you are working for the Americans as an

91
00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:25.664
interpreter.

92
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.600
So how do you feel about the Americans now doing a deal with the Taliban?

93
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.010
And what about if the u s leaves and the Taliban finishes off the government and

94
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:35.140
then comes after your family?
He said,
you know what,

95
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.790
America is not going to let that happen.

96
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.890
America has so much power and knows what to do that they will make sure that any

97
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:45.250
agreement they reach with the Taliban will be enforceable and it will be safe.

98
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.140
He had so much faith and I mean far more than me.
Why I'm,
and that's,

99
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.770
that's what I hear far more often than,
than the opposite is it,

100
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:57.040
does that really depend on where you go?
I mean,
cause if you go certain places,

101
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.810
people have a lot of faith in Trump,
you know,

102
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.270
like Donald Trump's going to protect us from evil.
This,

103
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.520
there's places where you go that I may,
it's become a cliche,
but,

104
00:06:05.521 --> 00:06:06.500
but I do think you'll,

105
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.990
you'll find a lot of places as critical of American foreign policy.

106
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.040
That doesn't mean that critical of America.
How do they parse that out?

107
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.980
Um,
I think,
I mean,
Vietnam I think is a good example.
You know,

108
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:21.920
we,
we,
we have defeated communism.

109
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.540
Communism has been defeated in Vietnam just because the new generation grow up

110
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:29.990
and think Western culture,
communism.
I know which one I want.

111
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.750
It's a simple choice.
Um,
and I think that young generation is,

112
00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:37.280
is making that very simple choice and it could just mean democracy.

113
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.920
And you think that is in Afghanistan as well.
Yeah.

114
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.880
That they're recognizing that western culture provides more freedom and more

115
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:48.560
economic opportunity,
more prosperity.
Yeah.
Um,
and I haven't heard,

116
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:49.640
apart from,
from the Taliban,

117
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:53.660
I haven't heard much anti American feeling in Afghanistan at all,
really.
Um,

118
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.710
and also a lot of that,
I mean,

119
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.920
maybe I'm biased because a lot of the people I'm talking to had interactions

120
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:00.300
with,
with Americans.
Um,

121
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.760
but they would even say as many mistakes as were made in the prosecuting of the

122
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:07.160
war with air strikes and nitrates and all that,

123
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.760
the American soldiers and Marines we met,
we knew were good people.

124
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.630
Um,
and,
and it,
like I said,
with,
with strokes,
my interpreter,
it's,

125
00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:18.470
it's incredible how many people still believe that to this day.
