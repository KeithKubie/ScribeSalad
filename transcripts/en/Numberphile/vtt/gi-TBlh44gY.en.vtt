00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
CLIFF STONE: So, how come
we eat pizza the way we do?

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.760
You know, as well as I do:
If I just hold it like this, it flops over.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.719
You know, as well as I do,
that if I curl it like this:

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.719
I can eat.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.710
So, why do we eat pizza like this?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.900
Gauss.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.980
Gauss tells us why.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.810
What does Gauss has to do with it?

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.570
Gauss came up with this absolutely nifty theorem

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.680
called the Theorema Egregium.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.700
Also, in English, called the
Remarkable Theorem.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.520
Curvature is an intrinsic property of surfaces.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.480
Curvature? We all kind of know a curve is. 
What's curvature?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.760
This piece of paper has no
curvature at all. Right?

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.280
It's flat going this way, flat going this way. 
We'll come back to that.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.300
What about a sphere? A sphere clearly has
curvature going outward this way,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.740
and an outward going curvature this way.
 If both curves are outward,

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.640
Gauss says: multiply them together

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.110
This is positive, this is positive. Positive multiplied by positive means

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.689
Oh, this has a positive curvature!

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.610
So this is a positive curvature right here.
Everywhere on a sphere

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.710
it's positive curvature.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.760
What about a banana? For a banana I see along here,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.799
along here,

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.220
it's curving out. Along this way its
curving out,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.240
so this is positive curvature.
But watch this, watch this!

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.009
Over here, oh, it's curving outward along
here, we remember that. But along here

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.170
it's curving inward. So this one
is a negative Gaussian curvature,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.290
this one is a positive. A positive times
a negative means that at this point

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:55.720
I have a negative curvature. So, someplace, 
along a line here,  along  a line here

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.960
the curvature of a banana changes from
being positive Gaussian curvature to

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.689
negative Gaussian curvature.
For a torus, along here,

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.749
it's curving outward, that's cool. Along
this way it's curving outward outward

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.369
Outward times outward is positive. So, that's positive.

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.580
But over on the inside, over here,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.940
it's curving outward there, but inward
here!

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.600
So this means this is negative curvature.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.100
So it's negative curvature around here,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.340
Positive curvature, so some place around this line in a torus,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.940
and along some place around here

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.800
It goes from negative gaussian curvature to positive. That makes sense to me.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.940
What Gauss said in his remarkable theorem:

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.140
This curvature is  intrinsic to the surface.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.080
So, if I have something that starts out

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.080
with a certain integrated Gaussian total curvature

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.720
then, no matter how I stretch
it and turn it around and move it,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.049
it's going to stay the same.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.289
I know that this piece of paper starts
out flat.

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.929
If I bend it... I'll draw a line here.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.340
I'll bend it sort of along that line.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.940
Ok, along there, in this direction

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.480
there's negative curvature .

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.500
But along here,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.280
So it's minus, going along there,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.560
but this has still zero curvature.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.400
So, it's a straight line,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.020
it's a straight
line going that way.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.940
But going this way, it's negative curvature.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.750
Flipping on the other side...

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.450
Look over here! I still have
no curvature in that line.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.100
And a positive curvature over here.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.720
Well what's the Gaussian curvature
right at this point, right here?

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.420
It's some positive number times zero.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.700
Ah! Gauss tells us that Gaussian curvature, 
the multiplication of this direction curvature

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.820
and this direction curvature is
intrinsic to the surface.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.060
That means that if I bend it this way
and I get positive curvature

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.500
at this point, since the surface started out
with no curvature, flat, no curvature at all,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.650
then if I add positive curvature here,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.550
I'd better multiply that by something
that has zero curvature,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.870
which is a straight line.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.500
So, if I have curvature in this direction

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.320
I'd better have no curvature there.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.120
What about a pizza?

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.120
Come here, Brady! Come, come here!

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.980
If I have a flat pizza

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.980
and I lift it up like this

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.190
it's going to bend down!
If it bends this way,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.640
then... Oh! The Gaussian curvature is positive here

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.080
but I have zero going this way.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.920
But I can take advantage of that by saying:

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.640
I will make this have no
curvature along here and

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.980
negative Gaussian curvature,
negative curvature there,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.820
so at each of these points, the
curvature stays the same.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.520
If it tries to flop this way while I'm curving it this way,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.720
the pizza would be violating
Gauss's remarkable theorem.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.960
Pizzas don't like to do that.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.330

sorts of subjects from literature,
history...

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.750
I've been watching some about chess
lately, and of course I've got plenty

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.160
about mathematics.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.430
There are loads of examples I could give.
Just one that I think is really good is

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.520
all about the mathematics of games and puzzles.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.580

And really going into depth about the mathematics

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.840
underlying these games. I think
numberphiles will really love it.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.380

CLIFF STONE: In other words, the reason

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:22.660
why there is a correct way to eat pizza
and this won't flop over

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.280
is that if that  flopped over like this,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:32.050
I would be forcing a point right here to
change its Gaussian curvature.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:40.050
Not just an intrinsic part of a piece of paper,
but an intrinsic part of a piece of pizza.
