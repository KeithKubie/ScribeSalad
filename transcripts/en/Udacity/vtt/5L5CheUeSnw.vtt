We have seen that an out of order processor will track when one instruction uses

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.640
a register produced by another. But, load and store instructions can

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.790
access the same memory location without using the same register for

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.860
it. So let's see how to do them correctly in an out of order processor.
