ZVEZDELINA: It's a game

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:07.919
Attributed to John Conway, a mathematician at Princeton, and it is called Conway checkers.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.360
Conway checkers is a game which is played on an infinite board.

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:19.079
So it's infinite in all directions. You take a line, and you put it somewhere in the middle of your board

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.609
and you're not going to move it. And then what you do is you take a few checkers and you place them underneath the line.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.278
Anywhere you like, it's totally random.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.828
It's up to you what you want to do. And then you start playing by simplified checker rules.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.160
There is only one type of move: you can jump over an adjacent checker...

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.120
and then disappear that checker.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.550
So I can jump

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.849
vertically or I can jump horizontally.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.480
And I can do this left, right, up, or down, so there are four possible moves

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.190
but they're all of the same type. Now

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.570
What is not allowed is if you have three checkers in a row you try to jump like this

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.059
And you land on something. Also, you cannot jump over several checkers.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.990
That's not allowed.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.659
You cannot jump diagonally. You're limited to jumping only horizontally, left and right, or

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.130
vertically, up and down. And of course, at some point you may jump over the line because you will be close to it.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.660
There you go.
BRADY: This is allowed?

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.779
Z: Yep, that's allowed. In fact,

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.438
Your goal is to get as high as possible over the line.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.809
So Conway's challenge to us is if you start

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.080
below the line in whatever

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.000
configuration you wish, as many checkers [as] you wish, and you follow those simple rules,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.160
What is the highest row above the line that you can reach?

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.740
BRADY: Oh, I'm excited! I don't know the answer!

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.560
Z: Well, what do you think?
BRADY: I think the answer is going to be...

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
Disappointingly low.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.420
Z: But is that what your gut feeling says? Or your experience?

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.000
BRADY: Well, part of me thinks if I can use an infinite number of checkers in any configuration

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.759
I want, I should be able to build some mechanism to push quite high, but...
Z: That's right!

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.670
That's what my gut feeling said about the problem. I said, "what kind of question is this? Of course I will somehow...

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.739
create an algorithm, perhaps inductive algorithm, and reach higher and higher and higher rows!"

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.920
BRADY: And you need to just be able to keep feeding the machine.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.800
Z: Exactly, so let's try, and let us be efficient: do I really need a whole army of checkers to reach the first row?

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.009
Well obviously if I put the checkers like this, I'm not gonna go anywhere above the line, but if I put them vertically...

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.379
everyone can play this quite easily, you can jump over and

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.709
you're done. You reached row one, alright.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.429
Let's try row two! Now at this point, the audience should stop the video and really try it

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.500
Because it's not entirely obvious what to do.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.780
[music]

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.140
BRADY: I think we need to put... if we put another two...

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.320
Z: Aha!
BRADY: If we put another two there, we can feed it another one.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.400
Z: So Brady has

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.460
learned a lot of mathematics and his intuition is really good. Indeed, if we start like this...

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.200
Let's see

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.200
one move

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.110
two moves

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.540
and finally three moves and we are in row two above the line.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.370
So

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.649
We're done. Now for an extra challenge: row three

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.579
How many checkers do you think we will need?

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.040
[music]

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.340
BRADY: Two there...

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.440
I think we need another... I think we need another four.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.060
Z: Yes, but the question is in what configuration?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.380
BRADY: Well I think, let me see...

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.680
Z: Um, maybe you can use the smaller ones because they fit better...

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.100
BRADY: Okay, let me use the smaller ones.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.100
So we want two there

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.580
And then we need those two there

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.840
And then we need another two there

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.120
Z: He's so good, you've seen this before!

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.180
BRADY: I haven't, no...

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.780
Z: My goodness, you're my fastest student!
BRADY: How's that?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.640
Z: Brady, you're on. Let's try...

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.640
BRADY: Oh, look, I'm doing so well!

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.680
Z: You think you can play it, or...?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.440
BRADY: Well yeah
Z: yeah, okay, alright, try.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.260
BRADY: So, what we did before

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.740
Z: Yes...

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.840
BRADY: and then... and then that to there.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.200
That's gone.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.060
And that to there
Z: Okay...

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.580
BRADY: That's gone, and then we need to get that to there

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.580
And that's gone. Then we need to get that to there

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.080
Z: Ahh, this looks very promising.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.460
BRADY: Do you know what?

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.660
I don't know how to get any higher, though.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.140
Z: So let's think. We use two,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.940
four, and eight checkers to get to row one, two, and three. This looks...

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.680
very determined process to me. How many checkers shall we try for all four?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.840
BRADY: You want sixteen, do you?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.140
Z: I do, but you know what?

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.780
There isn't a configuration with sixteen.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.240
You will need more.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.960
The pattern breaks! I can show you the configuration

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.260
That actually wins... and there it is! So that's 20 checkers, and the viewers can try to

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.900
play with those checkers and see if you can reach the fourth row. This is actually quite a feat.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.360
[music]

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.039
I'm not going to try, um, to try it on Brady.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:13.480
This is really tough. You start with those 20 checkers, you play play play play, and you get to row four.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.700
In fact, there are other configurations

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.660
with slightly more checkers. For example, 21.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.560
And so the way you do it is you arrange them

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.140
on a 4 by 5. So we're going to have already 20 checkers

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.840
Which is what we had before

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:40.739
But in this particular situation you put one more so you end up with 21 checkers

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.100
And it's kind of a very nice symmetric situation that actually

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.020
capitalizes on our previous attempt to reach row three. So you can try this and indeed

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:59.189
Reach somewhere up row four. Of course, with 21 points, this game

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:06.380
here is less efficient than the previous one which was with 20. And you can ask yourself, "Is there a more efficient game with

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:13.940
19, 18, and so on?", but really that's not the point of the game. And now the challenge is on.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.940
BRADY: Five, row five.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.549
Z: So we have 21 here, well, how many do you think we need for all 5?

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:28.980
We went more than twice up from the previous case so if we go more than twice up, maybe about

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.660
50-ish?

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.140
BRADY: Yeah, 50 or 60. I think it's gonna become impossible. I'm already surprised we got to four.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.700
I think it's gonna become impossible soon.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.140
Z: But I don't see any restriction! What can possibly stop us from reaching the fifth row?

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:51.240
So there is this mysterious entity called a monovariant.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:58.780
A feature that moves only in one direction. It either only increases or only decreases

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.200
and that feature prevents us somehow from reaching the fifth row.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.960
But getting that feature,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.360
extrapolating it from this game is actually quite complex, so let's get to work.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
BRADY: Are you ready to get to work?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:20.720
If so, the proof video showing that you cannot reach row five is on our second channel,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.800
Numberphile2, which is where I put longer, more detailed videos.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:32.380
This is quite a long proof, but it's really interesting, easy to follow, and it involves the golden ratio... loads.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:39.980
I'll also include some links on the screen and underneath to other videos that may be of interest, including our interviews with John Conway himself.
