00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:05.090
And that was what the ordered
part of our specification for

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.970
sort was all about.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.840
Now let's look at the second part which
had to do with whether the elements

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.060
were the same in the output
as they were in the input.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.330
So we're going to begin the same way
we did before and I'd like you, Jared,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.300
see if you can state in
English what it means for

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.610
two vectors X and
Y to have the same elements.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.700
And we're going to call this function
that we're defining same elements as.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.410
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:33.660
Do we need to start by
writing a signature and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.230
going through this whole process.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.860
&gt;&gt; That's the process, yes.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.190
&gt;&gt; So for this function,
we will take two vectors.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.520
A vector X.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.240
Oh, before I forget.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.040
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.300
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And finish what you got.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.170
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.030
I've noticed the flaw, but
we will be taking two vectors.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.200
We'll take a vector X and a vector Y,
and a comparison will happen.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.980
We can assume, and it will return a
boolean value representing whether they

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.880
have the same elements or not.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.225
&gt;&gt; And
what did you label your boolean result?

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:05.850
&gt;&gt; As Y, which is the same,
we've already assigned that.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.004
&gt;&gt; Okay, so obviously,
this is actually a legitimate signature,

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:14.480
well, I shouldn't say it's legitimate.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.830
It's a syntactically correct signature,
but it's not meaningful because we're

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.035
using the same value,
the same letter in two different places.

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:23.150
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; So, as I said before,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.800
the actual letter that we use
doesn't make any difference,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.320
as long as we consistently use it.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.530
So we could say here,
bool Y, we could say bool Z.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.440
As long as it's different than
those input names that we used.
