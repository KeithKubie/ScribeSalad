00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.990
Let's continue our ongoing quiz. This instruction has issued. We have issued

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:14.020
it in cycle 1. It begins executing in cycle 2 because these operands are ready.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.480
The result is going to be 20 over 5, so the result is going to be 4. And

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.340
that result will become available in 2 plus 10. That

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.440
result will be broadcast in cycle 12. And this makes us ready to begin cycle 2.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.520
At the beginning of cycle 2, this reservation station is already freed. And

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.787
we will try to issue this instruction. That instruction will be issued by

00:00:40.787 --> 00:00:45.790
finding a reservation station and a ROB entry. We will write R1. R5 and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.370
R6 are going to come from the register file, are going to be four and

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.010
two. The result will broadcast under the name of ROB2 and

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.792
we have issued this instruction in cycle 2. In cycle 2 also,

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:06.060
the execution of this instruct, of the first instruction has begun. In cycle 3,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.090
we will issue the next instruction and begin executing this one.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.250
So what happens in cycle 4 is we have issued this instruction,

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.390
it's operands were ready already, so at the beginning of cycle 4,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.220
this reservation station is free. That instruction has begun execution. And,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.615
we will consider now issuing this multiplication here. The question for

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:35.890
you regarding this multiplication is, what is going to be here, here,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.150
here, and here? So what is going to be in the reservation station for

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.550
the multiplication once we have issued it. And

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.560
we do issue it in the fourth cycle. And also, which RAT entry,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.820
put the register number, is going to be modified as a result of this? So

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.880
which RAT entry, is it R1, R2, R3, or which one?
