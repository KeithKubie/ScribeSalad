00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.260
Well welcome we are in the world's first

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.180
National Videogame Arcade museum

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.860
I'm the director , I'm one of the folks that work here.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.460
This what you see when you come in,

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.980
The first thing you see when you come in is a massive

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.420
blue hedgehog

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.400
This wall over here will tell you all the game that are in here.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.340
It changes all the time, so there is tonnes to play.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.180
It's not all about playing games,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.180
but its also about making games

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.980
The big thing about this place is we think everyone should be able to play games

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.840
But also we really like, people learning how to make them too.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.380
You see these fantastic people at this desk

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.380
they'll so hello to you just like this

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.240
Hi. Good day.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.200
See exactly like that

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.860
There are arcade machines to play,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.800
there are old things to do too.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.480
And then, another kind of peculiar thing about this building is

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.260
There is lots of stuff that's only here

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.860
So a lot of games that we've commissioned

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.240
you can only play in this building

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.780
The first one that you'll see is this one

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.960
Which is called "Dash and Bash"

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.020
So this is only in the National Vidoegame Arcade

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.120
Its made by a guy called Alistair Aitcheson

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.780
Its a fantastic game that allows you to

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.320
to spot these symbols and you have to

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.760
bash other people out of the way

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.600
and bash the buttons, to get to the right one

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.340
before anyone else does.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.000
So we really wanted to write away, show people

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.780
that games aren't just about kind of standing like this.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.660
They can be about bashing things too

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.840
And that's want we really want to do with this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.480
and lots of people do this as a kind of warm up

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.660
You might want to come through here

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.460
To the Toast bar, now its not just a clever name

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.460
The Toast bar is called the Toast bar

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.080
Mind the step

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.800
because it will, it has a variety of toasts that it will indeed venue.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.600
And lots again of games for you to play

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.480
Tends too be the older stuff in here, Nintendo 64

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.060
You can request a different game from the bar if you want to.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.320
In the summer, cause' it's nice in the summer right

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.180
You can sit outside and play a game

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.100
and eat some toast

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.140
To try and welcome you as much as we possibly can.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.580
So coming over here

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.060
So this is "Mission Control"

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.760
Its a game about making games

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.800
So the idea here is, it's a two player game

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.320
and whilst two people play it, other people

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.740
other people can be changing it

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.180
So you can change the graphics

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.940
You can change the gravity

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.380
You can change the spawn rate of aliens

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.160
Kind of really gently, get people into the idea that

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.860
That they can change

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.320
what games are

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.720
and really see what games are made of

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.640
So a weird thing about games is that you

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.460
not often get

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.520
not often get a look inside the kitchen

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.080
of what they are

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.820
Other things that are just here this is "Room Racers"

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.720
This is a fantastic game by Lieven van Velthoven

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.440
This is like micro machines

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.900
but the magical part of it is

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.660
I'll just start this up for you.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.820
I'm the red car here racing around

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.180
But this is the cool part, any thing we put down

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.960
the car crashes into

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.260
So you end up with a couple of different games happening

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.420
One of them is like a racing game

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.540
another will be people lying on here

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.540
to be raced around

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.760
anything we put there the car can't pass through

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.840
So its about two things, its about playing games

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.440
and racing cars, but its also about what makes a good race track

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.360
This is our big main stairwell,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.400
that goes up and down most of the buildings.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.900
and when you design a museum often what people do

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.560
is try and hide the computers, and hide the way that it works

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.740
and we kind of when the opposite way

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.820
we want to expose everything

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.420
even if you don't know about electronics

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.680
you can see that all of the orange stuff

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.160
is power, all of the purple is network

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.000
So similarly the exhibits that we built here

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.920
if they break, and they DO break sometimes

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.820
we just fix them in front you

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.360
because you can, because you can do that

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.180
We are trying to capture the spirit of, when I was a kid

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.540
if the video recorder broke we would have the back off

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.220
on the kitchen table

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.740
you could put it back together again

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.980
but you would have a go at fixing it

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.220
Its that kind of idea of being able to open stuff up

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.680
an X-Ray it and really get invovled

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.600
is what we are trying to do.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.380
The whole building, we wanted to make transparent

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.880
So gallery two is the hall of inputs

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.280
It ranges from the kind of controllers that

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.320
you are used to having at home

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.060
The game of trials, with a quite complicated

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.460
but none the less, thing you might recognise

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.300
the XBox controller

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.560
to arcade macines

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.740
So joysticks and buttons, you'll be familiar with what they are.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.360
to mouse and keyboard games

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.400
"Indian Jones and the fate of Atlantis"

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.440
fantastic adventure game. Text adventures with "Twine"

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.740
To light gun games with, "Time Crisis" and "Duck Hunt"

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.160
Cockpit games, so driving games, we've got "Star Wars" or "Sonic Racing"

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.460
To the music rooms

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.520
There is "Rock band" or "Guitar Heroes" which can get a bit out of hand.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.640
it can get quite loud in this room from time to time.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.320
This is one of my favorite bits, this is a wall of inputs.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.260
So there are four games, all with quite different

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.280
control mechanisms

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.840
So we've got

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.980
a version of a game called "Tempest"

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.380
which is using a spinner,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.460
which you spin round and shot the aliens

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.200
So a single button game

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.840
OHH, I'm not very good at it though.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.060
Terrible at this game.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.940
And a track ball game, "Missile Command"

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.720
Some of you may remember this

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.940
So your moving the cross-hair around

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.160
with the track ball

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.380
So they are all played in quite different ways

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.980
and what we are trying to do is, in a really gentle way

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.600
is get people to think about

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.100
that not all games are

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.480
controlled with a

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.120
kind of controller that you might have at home

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.140
there is loads and loads of different

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.200
of interfaces of games

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.000
so by gently, we change this around quite often

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.260
we change the games around,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.100
we change the controllers around

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.060
to gently draw attention to the fact that

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.500
the assumptions that you might have about video games

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.700
that might not necessarily be true

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.840
Because a lot of people either play with a keyboard and mouse

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.300
or they play with a game pad

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.640
and there are so many different things that games are

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.700
So we have smaller installations in these rooms

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.680
so these change around every few months

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.400
we will put a different kind of more experiential game in there.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.900
Right now it is "Panoramical"

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.440
which is a generative music game.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.660
like the late 60's on a wall.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.240
And then we move up to gallery three

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.920
So this is our most kind of gallery like gallery, I guess.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.180
The problem of exhibiting video games

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.240
the problem of talking to people about video games,

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.520
is that quite often

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.760
they rely on you as a customer being good at video games.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.740
So if I wanted to talk to you about

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.060
Sonic the hedgehog, right.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.620
and show you what Sonic the hedgehog is

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.920
I could hand you a controller and let you play

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.640
Sonic the hedgehog and hope that you are go at Sonic the hedgehog.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.240
because if you're not then you want be able to see those bits.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.340
So what we are trying to do with this Game inspector

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.780
Is experiment with giving people snapshots of

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.920
specific ideas within games to experience

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.120
So this is "Gang Beasts",

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.640
if you havent played "Gang Beasts"

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.200
you must immediately get "Gang Beasts"

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.140
it's been in made Sheffield

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.660
It's a kind of drunk jelly babies

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.580
fighting in a carpark, physics brawler game.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.220
By a company called "Boneloaf"

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.800
the guys at "Boneloaf" made for us

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.800
a Game inspector. This is a demo

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.020
showing you playing the game over there

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.860
and over here you can play

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.040
with seeing how the physics works

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.640
You can see he turns red at the collision points

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.220
And you can also see how the animation works

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.340
You can see what this person is actually doing

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.520
rolling around on a ball

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.840
which when animated

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.760
you can get a much better scence of the movement

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.880
So this is a look inside the game

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.420
that you are playing, that you would never normally see

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.500
One of the things that I always liked about

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.540
exhibts, classical things, Is the sketchbooks

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.240
rather than the finished things

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.100
they're working it out, how big is the head meant to be

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.000
So in here we invite any developer

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.460
to show work thats not finished yet

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.720
People get to play stuff before its done

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.160
they leave them suggestions

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.800
in the feed the developers box

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.300
So people get to see games before they're done

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.700
and give feed back

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.380
and say things like: it should be faster or slower,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.900
or it's too hard or the colours aren't right.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.120
And it's a look inside games that most of the public never really get.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.860
Most times you encounter a game it's been shrink wrapped

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.560
and it's finished and its beautiful.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.240
Just exposing this fact that

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.540
they are things that aren't made

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.100
It's really really important.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.060
This is the Green house

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.500
And then our most gallery like gallery

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.540
this is our history of video games

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.220
in 100 at least objects,

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.460
roughly 100 objects.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.760
And its a loosly chronolgical journey

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.040
Starting here, so whenever people come in,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.880
they will gravitate to the area they recogonise.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.280
So this would be my childhood

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.360
right here.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.740
And again these are all machines that people can play,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.240
we have a bit of BASIC on the window,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.340
if people want to have a go at programming the BBC.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.300
I'm always really delighted and surprised

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.780
at the amount of time people spend in here.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.160
I think that people of a certain age, like me,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.740
we spend quite a lot of time along this wall

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.320
we are trying to show the social history of games too.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.160
So thing like, and this may not mean much to some of you,

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.340
things like pirated cassettes, from the 80's

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.180
with hand drawn, school boy artwork.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.520
things like maps from video games,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.480
things like spin off board games, and keyboard overlays.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.540
A kind of ephemera of what games are,

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.700
and what games meant to people

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.460
is really what this room is trying to capture.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.140
This isn't just about, again, playing things

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.440
but also things like "Larazade"

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.080
donated by no less than Ian Livingston

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.360
DOOM 2 master.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.380
Like a couple of weeks ago, John Romero turned up here.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.260
So John Romero was a co-designer of DOOM

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.600
the semial first-person shooter

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.340
and this is one of the gold masters of DOOM 2

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.780
An incredibly influential designer

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.860
and just rocked up,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.100
First thing I knew of it was, I was at home,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.300
First thing we heard about it somebody on our

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.220
we have this thing called 'Slack'

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.180
that we use for internal message

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.100
OH MY GOD! John Romero is in the building

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.120
and everyone went nuts,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.400
he did a little talk here for some

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.500
of the Dads how recognized who he was

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.320
It was a very special moment

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.260
People tend to spend most of the day here,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.860
when they come, that combined with

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.560
things like the classes

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.380
if you've got kids that want to learn how to code

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.740
they come on a Saturday morning

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.540
heaps of extra stuff during the week

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.220
and lots and lots of events happening in the evening.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.640
For every group

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.980
we are trying to be

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.020
a community centre, really.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.500
For people who are interested in this kind of stuff

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.640
If you are interested in football you can join a football club

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.280
If you are interested in music you can join an orchestra.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.740
If you are interested in games, or technology,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.720
or interested in culture

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.200
come here and help us make it better

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.040
So that's the National Videogame Arcade
