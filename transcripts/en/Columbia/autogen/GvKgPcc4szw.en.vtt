what I did next was to go out into the
into the village and to have lots and

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940
into the village and to have lots and
 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.560
into the village and to have lots and
lots of conversations with people about

lots of conversations with people about
 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.580
lots of conversations with people about

and create a little map of like as it

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980
and create a little map of like as it
 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.890
and create a little map of like as it
was in the 30s and 40s in that

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900
was in the 30s and 40s in that
 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.710
was in the 30s and 40s in that
particular village and and this is a

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720
particular village and and this is a
 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.060
particular village and and this is a
little this is a smattering of some of

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070
little this is a smattering of some of
 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.590
little this is a smattering of some of
the contents collected hundreds of

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600
the contents collected hundreds of
 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.800
the contents collected hundreds of
conversations and people and most of the

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810
conversations and people and most of the
 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.200
conversations and people and most of the
conversations so those conversations

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210
conversations so those conversations
 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.110
conversations so those conversations
generated a bit of content and a story

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120
generated a bit of content and a story
 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.660
generated a bit of content and a story
and also developed a relationship so

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.670
and also developed a relationship so
 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.610
and also developed a relationship so
without kind of really realizing it I

without kind of really realizing it I
 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.230
without kind of really realizing it I
was doing two things I was creating a

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240
was doing two things I was creating a
 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.810
was doing two things I was creating a
local archive for the village which

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:51.820
local archive for the village which
 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.310
local archive for the village which
happens all over the world people go

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320
happens all over the world people go
 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.840
happens all over the world people go
through this process a lot and I was

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850
through this process a lot and I was
 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.279
through this process a lot and I was
also generating

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289
also generating
 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:59.040
also generating
links and connections and fostering

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050
links and connections and fostering
 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.320
links and connections and fostering
social capital within that community and

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330
social capital within that community and
 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.749
social capital within that community and
I managed to find a whole load of really

I managed to find a whole load of really
 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.909
I managed to find a whole load of really
interesting things this was the road

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919
interesting things this was the road
 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.489
interesting things this was the road
that those gos drove down this was just

that those gos drove down this was just
 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.739
that those gos drove down this was just
before the war when it was a road that

00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:10.749
before the war when it was a road that
 

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:13.290
before the war when it was a road that

around foxes and then setting that dogs
on them but they this is what they were

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520
on them but they this is what they were
 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.389
on them but they this is what they were
doing in the early 1930s on this road

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:32.399
doing in the early 1930s on this road
 

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:35.820
doing in the early 1930s on this road
ten years before this in the very early

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830
ten years before this in the very early

1930s a lady sitting next to that road
 

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:39.329
1930s a lady sitting next to that road
which I heard lots of interesting

00:07:39.329 --> 00:07:39.339
which I heard lots of interesting
 

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:40.799
which I heard lots of interesting
stories about people used to do along

00:07:40.799 --> 00:07:40.809
stories about people used to do along
 

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:44.459
stories about people used to do along
that road and a couple in the village

that ran a hotel which no longer exists
 

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:50.129
that ran a hotel which no longer exists
and then finding out you know the kind

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:50.139
and then finding out you know the kind
 

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:51.719
and then finding out you know the kind
of the rooms within that hotel in the

00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:51.729
of the rooms within that hotel in the
 

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:53.040
of the rooms within that hotel in the
stories and the kind of things that went

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.050
stories and the kind of things that went
 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.649
stories and the kind of things that went
on and just kind of uncovering bit by

00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:55.659
on and just kind of uncovering bit by
 

00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:58.019
on and just kind of uncovering bit by
bit the story of this particular bit of

00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:58.029
bit the story of this particular bit of
 

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:01.170
bit the story of this particular bit of
the world at this particular time even

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.180
the world at this particular time even
 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.209
the world at this particular time even
managed to find some old video footage

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:03.219
managed to find some old video footage
 

00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:05.070
managed to find some old video footage
from the early 1960s of people driving

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080
from the early 1960s of people driving
 

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.969
from the early 1960s of people driving
down this road at one of the earliest

00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:07.979
down this road at one of the earliest
 

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:12.059
down this road at one of the earliest
kind of bits of camcorder footage and

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:12.069
kind of bits of camcorder footage and
 

00:08:12.069 --> 00:08:15.899
kind of bits of camcorder footage and
hardly any cars on it so so what all of

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:15.909
hardly any cars on it so so what all of
 

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:20.519
hardly any cars on it so so what all of
this as I said did was start to show the

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:20.529
this as I said did was start to show the
 

00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:23.509
this as I said did was start to show the
local power of this communal

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:23.519
local power of this communal
 

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:25.290
local power of this communal
storytelling and memory gabbing

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:25.300
storytelling and memory gabbing
 

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.999
storytelling and memory gabbing
experience it was a really lovely thing

00:08:26.999 --> 00:08:27.009
experience it was a really lovely thing
 

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:28.589
experience it was a really lovely thing
to do with that community and he got I

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:28.599
to do with that community and he got I
 

00:08:28.599 --> 00:08:29.759
to do with that community and he got I
got to know them very well they got to

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:29.769
got to know them very well they got to
 

00:08:29.769 --> 00:08:30.779
got to know them very well they got to
know me and they got to know each other

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:30.789
know me and they got to know each other
 

00:08:30.789 --> 00:08:33.149
know me and they got to know each other
better we're at a time now when we don't

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159
better we're at a time now when we don't
 

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.490
better we're at a time now when we don't
really know our neighbors and so

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:35.500
really know our neighbors and so
 

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.259
really know our neighbors and so
alongside the inter generational gap we

00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:37.269
alongside the inter generational gap we
 

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:38.550
alongside the inter generational gap we
were also looking at the way that people

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560
were also looking at the way that people
 

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.730
were also looking at the way that people
could come together with people who they

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:41.740
could come together with people who they
 

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.139
could come together with people who they
live near which is a kind of

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:43.149
live near which is a kind of
 

00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:45.269
live near which is a kind of
increasingly and oddly rare these days

00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279
increasingly and oddly rare these days
 

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:48.990
increasingly and oddly rare these days
and so we then put together the research

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.000
and so we then put together the research
 

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.129
and so we then put together the research
we've been doing on intergeneration

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:50.139
we've been doing on intergeneration
 

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:51.660
we've been doing on intergeneration
ality put together the experiences that

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:51.670
ality put together the experiences that
 

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.550
ality put together the experiences that
I had had and we had had and start to

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:53.560
I had had and we had had and start to
 

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.100
I had had and we had had and start to
develop some ideas for how there was an

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.110
develop some ideas for how there was an
 

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.139
develop some ideas for how there was an
activity which communities could do

00:08:58.139 --> 00:08:58.149
activity which communities could do
 

00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:00.569
activity which communities could do
together which happens

00:09:00.569 --> 00:09:00.579
together which happens
 

00:09:00.579 --> 00:09:05.460
together which happens
you know radically and occasionally in

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:05.470
you know radically and occasionally in
 

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.739
you know radically and occasionally in
different communities around the world

00:09:07.739 --> 00:09:07.749
different communities around the world
 

00:09:07.749 --> 00:09:10.410
different communities around the world
but essentially how could we make it a

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:10.420
but essentially how could we make it a
 

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.049
but essentially how could we make it a
ubiquitous activity how could we kind of

00:09:13.049 --> 00:09:13.059
ubiquitous activity how could we kind of
 

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:16.169
ubiquitous activity how could we kind of
behalf make this activity easier to do

00:09:16.169 --> 00:09:16.179
behalf make this activity easier to do
 

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:17.819
behalf make this activity easier to do
and make it more relevant and more

00:09:17.819 --> 00:09:17.829
and make it more relevant and more
 

00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:19.919
and make it more relevant and more
mainstream aggregated into something

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:19.929
mainstream aggregated into something
 

00:09:19.929 --> 00:09:21.720
mainstream aggregated into something
bigger join it up and make connections

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:21.730
bigger join it up and make connections
 

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.059
bigger join it up and make connections
between all of this work and make it a

00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:24.069
between all of this work and make it a
 

00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:25.350
between all of this work and make it a
little bit more permanent and it's

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360
little bit more permanent and it's
 

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.499
little bit more permanent and it's
self-perpetuating so we had and it's

00:09:28.499 --> 00:09:28.509
self-perpetuating so we had and it's
 

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:30.720
self-perpetuating so we had and it's
really important in all of our work to

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:30.730
really important in all of our work to
 

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.919
really important in all of our work to
recognize that there are lots of

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:31.929
recognize that there are lots of
 

00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:34.009
recognize that there are lots of
behaviors that we want to kind of

00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:34.019
behaviors that we want to kind of
 

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:37.199
behaviors that we want to kind of
inculcate within the mainstream but they

00:09:37.199 --> 00:09:37.209
inculcate within the mainstream but they
 

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:39.389
inculcate within the mainstream but they
are when we start they're normally

00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:39.399
are when we start they're normally
 

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:40.979

example of that in any community there's

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:45.009
example of that in any community there's
 

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:48.059
example of that in any community there's
a kind of eco-warrior people and that

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:48.069
a kind of eco-warrior people and that
 

00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:50.069
a kind of eco-warrior people and that
tends to infect those behaviors to make

day to day activity so that was our main

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:17.589
day to day activity so that was our main
 

00:10:17.589 --> 00:10:19.859
day to day activity so that was our main
challenge and we recognize that as I

00:10:19.859 --> 00:10:19.869
challenge and we recognize that as I
 

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:22.079
challenge and we recognize that as I
made change to begin with and we had we

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:22.089
made change to begin with and we had we
 

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:23.609

started injecting technology and
 

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:39.299
started injecting technology and
creativity and communications into this

and exciting then you could therefore
 

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.889
and exciting then you could therefore
kind of create new associations with the

00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:46.899
kind of create new associations with the
 

00:10:46.899 --> 00:10:48.419
kind of create new associations with the
behaviors around that content it would

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:48.429
behaviors around that content it would
 

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:50.009
behaviors around that content it would
drive them to go out and find it and

00:10:50.009 --> 00:10:50.019
drive them to go out and find it and
 

00:10:50.019 --> 00:10:51.809
drive them to go out and find it and
talk to their grandparents about so we

00:10:51.809 --> 00:10:51.819
talk to their grandparents about so we
 

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:54.960
talk to their grandparents about so we
tried two concepts one was the first

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:54.970
tried two concepts one was the first
 

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.239
tried two concepts one was the first
idea which was to do with scale and to

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:57.249
idea which was to do with scale and to
 

00:10:57.249 --> 00:10:59.429
idea which was to do with scale and to
do with replicability and obviously that

00:10:59.429 --> 00:10:59.439
do with replicability and obviously that
 

00:10:59.439 --> 00:11:01.559
do with replicability and obviously that
16 year old boy test was that the map

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:01.569
16 year old boy test was that the map
 

00:11:01.569 --> 00:11:03.119
16 year old boy test was that the map
didn't actually look like this the mat

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:03.129
didn't actually look like this the mat
 

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:06.030
didn't actually look like this the mat
looked like this which was you know for

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.040
looked like this which was you know for
 

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.609
looked like this which was you know for
every every location there was also a

00:11:08.609 --> 00:11:08.619
every every location there was also a
 

00:11:08.619 --> 00:11:10.859
every every location there was also a
date so this idea of forth by mentally

00:11:10.859 --> 00:11:10.869
date so this idea of forth by mentally
 

00:11:10.869 --> 00:11:13.300
date so this idea of forth by mentally
mapping started to emerge with you

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:13.310
mapping started to emerge with you
 

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.400
mapping started to emerge with you
you would even split a map into a whole

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:15.410
you would even split a map into a whole
 

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.860
you would even split a map into a whole
series of temporal layers this is each

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:17.870
series of temporal layers this is each
 

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.740
series of temporal layers this is each
layer is just a decade here but

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:20.750
layer is just a decade here but
 

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.720
layer is just a decade here but
obviously as the archive got denser it

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:22.730
obviously as the archive got denser it
 

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:23.920
obviously as the archive got denser it
could be split up again and again and

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:23.930
could be split up again and again and
 

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.100
could be split up again and again and
again and and so that was the first

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.110
again and and so that was the first
 

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.230
again and and so that was the first
content we explore which also shows how

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.240
content we explore which also shows how
 

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.970
content we explore which also shows how
you could gather thousands and thousands

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:30.980
you could gather thousands and thousands
 

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.350
you could gather thousands and thousands
and thousands a piece of content in one

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360
and thousands a piece of content in one
 

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.390

splitting it via those those those

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:36.770
splitting it via those those those
 

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.890
splitting it via those those those
layers of time and allow people to

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:38.900
layers of time and allow people to
 

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.269
layers of time and allow people to
explore particular dates in particular

00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:40.279
explore particular dates in particular
 

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:43.510

locations and what list did was we had a

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:43.520
locations and what list did was we had a
 

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.930
locations and what list did was we had a
concept early on which we were kind of

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:46.940
concept early on which we were kind of
 

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.670
concept early on which we were kind of
fascinated by about the idea of every

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680
fascinated by about the idea of every
 

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.760
fascinated by about the idea of every
spot on the planet having this vast

beneath it all in front of it all over
you see time and and and the idea of

00:11:59.380 --> 00:11:59.390
you see time and and and the idea of
 

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.150
you see time and and and the idea of
being able to go to that spot and then

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.160
being able to go to that spot and then
 

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.579
being able to go to that spot and then
immerse yourself within those layers I'm

00:12:03.579 --> 00:12:03.589
immerse yourself within those layers I'm
 

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:05.260
immerse yourself within those layers I'm
kind of fascinated us in this concept of

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:05.270
kind of fascinated us in this concept of
 

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.630
kind of fascinated us in this concept of
4th unnatural mapping mmm I mean that we

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:07.640
4th unnatural mapping mmm I mean that we
 

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.519

can kind of we can sell that idea to

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:09.529
can kind of we can sell that idea to
 

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:12.190
can kind of we can sell that idea to
more people so that was one one part of

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:12.200
more people so that was one one part of

more people so that was one one part of
the big part of the approach the other

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:13.460
the big part of the approach the other
 

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.930
the big part of the approach the other
part was this idea of overlaying old

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:16.940
part was this idea of overlaying old
 

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.020

the challenges of the project but the
 

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.410
the challenges of the project but the
site as I was kind of walk through a

well and they're growing quickly and
 

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:08.990
well and they're growing quickly and
they've won awards and we've got a great

they've won awards and we've got a great
 

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.470
they've won awards and we've got a great
audience and that's growing but it's

moving very quickly and we've had
 

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.220
moving very quickly and we've had
enormous support and growth within the

development budgets we kind of have to

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:50.910
development budgets we kind of have to
 

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.000
development budgets we kind of have to
scramble a bit more to keep up so these

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.010
scramble a bit more to keep up so these
 

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.170

tools are good but probably a year on

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:56.180
tools are good but probably a year on

we've had to work much harder than we

00:16:59.300 --> 00:16:59.310
we've had to work much harder than we

thought to update them kind of every

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:01.110
thought to update them kind of every
 

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.100
thought to update them kind of every
month and and to find the budgets to do

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:04.110
month and and to find the budgets to do
 

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:05.150
month and and to find the budgets to do
that has been quite challenging but

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160
that has been quite challenging but
 

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.140
that has been quite challenging but
we'll talk a bit more about how the

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.150
we'll talk a bit more about how the
 

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.090
we'll talk a bit more about how the
project sustained at the end and but

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100
project sustained at the end and but
 

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:13.579
project sustained at the end and but
essentially the tools are based around a

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.689
recollections and stories and then that
allows people to come back and

00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:26.699
allows people to come back and

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.909
yesterday I did all the way down there
this is a really wonderful collection of

00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919
this is a really wonderful collection of
 

00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:19.460
this is a really wonderful collection of
content over side of the park of a whole

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:19.470
content over side of the park of a whole
 

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.280
content over side of the park of a whole
series of old buildings on on fifth and

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:21.290
series of old buildings on on fifth and
 

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.780
series of old buildings on on fifth and
Anna so really it's a really kind of

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:23.790
Anna so really it's a really kind of
 

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.310
Anna so really it's a really kind of
magic experience when the collections

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320
magic experience when the collections
 

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.530
magic experience when the collections
are really which further this is just

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:27.540
are really which further this is just
 

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.320
are really which further this is just
outside and some Paul's a little bit

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:30.330
outside and some Paul's a little bit
 

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.830
outside and some Paul's a little bit
particularly well we're just showing how

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840
particularly well we're just showing how
 

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.000
particularly well we're just showing how
and actually histamine simples is about

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.010
and actually histamine simples is about
 

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.470
and actually histamine simples is about
exams in some ways it looks exactly the

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480
exams in some ways it looks exactly the
 

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.240
exams in some ways it looks exactly the
same as it did 80 years ago but you can

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:41.250
same as it did 80 years ago but you can
 

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.919
same as it did 80 years ago but you can
overlay a black and white image of the

00:21:42.919 --> 00:21:42.929
overlay a black and white image of the
 

00:21:42.929 --> 00:21:46.909
overlay a black and white image of the
same view but there are there are people

00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919
same view but there are there are people
 

00:21:46.919 --> 00:21:48.110
same view but there are there are people
and things going on that picture but

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120
and things going on that picture but
 

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.200
and things going on that picture but
essentially I mean again this is proved

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:50.210
essentially I mean again this is proved
 

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.060
essentially I mean again this is proved
really the app has grown particularly

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:53.070
really the app has grown particularly
 

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.230
really the app has grown particularly
quickly it's got about five hundred

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240
quickly it's got about five hundred
 

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.299
quickly it's got about five hundred
fifty thousand downloads and will I

00:21:59.299 --> 00:21:59.309
fifty thousand downloads and will I
 

00:21:59.309 --> 00:22:02.299
fifty thousand downloads and will I
think become an increasing way for

00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:02.309
think become an increasing way for
 

00:22:02.309 --> 00:22:04.310
think become an increasing way for
people to digitize content at their own

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320
people to digitize content at their own
 

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.289
people to digitize content at their own
collections as well so people taking a

00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299
collections as well so people taking a
 

00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:09.110
collections as well so people taking a
picture of an old picture rather than

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120
picture of an old picture rather than
 

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.400
picture of an old picture rather than
going through a kind of formal scanning

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:10.410
going through a kind of formal scanning
 

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.720
going through a kind of formal scanning
process is becoming more and more

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:11.730
process is becoming more and more
 

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.700
process is becoming more and more
prevalent as well so in terms of people

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:13.710
prevalent as well so in terms of people
 

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.159
prevalent as well so in terms of people
exploring and adding content the app is

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:16.169
exploring and adding content the app is
 

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:17.620
exploring and adding content the app is
a particular important part of the

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:17.630
a particular important part of the
 

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.840
a particular important part of the
object and then what we do which is

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:19.850
object and then what we do which is
 

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.550
object and then what we do which is
which again what I did down for seven

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:21.560
which again what I did down for seven
 

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.770
which again what I did down for seven
years today and is we invite people to

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:23.780
years today and is we invite people to
 

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.150
years today and is we invite people to
take a modern replica of that old

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:25.160
take a modern replica of that old
 

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.610
take a modern replica of that old
picture which again does to really nice

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:27.620
picture which again does to really nice
 

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.650
picture which again does to really nice

that's grown particularly quickly I

were waiting for a project that was

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520
were waiting for a project that was
 

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.610
were waiting for a project that was
non-commercial and that didn't take any

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:42.620
non-commercial and that didn't take any
 

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.560
non-commercial and that didn't take any
copyright and that had the kind of aims

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:44.570
copyright and that had the kind of aims
 

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.270
copyright and that had the kind of aims
and ambitions that we've had and and so

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:46.280
and ambitions that we've had and and so
 

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.650
and ambitions that we've had and and so
that audience has grown really really

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:47.660
that audience has grown really really
 

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.290
that audience has grown really really
fast and probably about sixty percent of

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:50.300
fast and probably about sixty percent of
 

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.610
fast and probably about sixty percent of
those who in the u.s. about thirty

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:51.620
those who in the u.s. about thirty
 

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.530
those who in the u.s. about thirty
percent in the UK and then about ten

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:53.540
percent in the UK and then about ten
 

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.870
percent in the UK and then about ten
percent in around the world there may be

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880
percent in around the world there may be
 

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.920
percent in around the world there may be
more at twenty percent around the rest

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:56.930

very quickly in that sets as well and
then local community work and I think

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480
then local community work and I think
 

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.850
then local community work and I think
probably which I'll talk a bit more

probably which I'll talk a bit more
 

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.760
probably which I'll talk a bit more
about the project is add its best when

mainstream audience and they divide up
 

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.850
mainstream audience and they divide up
for us into six areas so obviously the

design it just shows their content and
essentially and also shows any stories

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:44.670
essentially and also shows any stories

relation to that content so what what
 

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.400
relation to that content so what what
what a channel does is essentially give

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:52.410
what a channel does is essentially give
 

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.280
what a channel does is essentially give

home on history pin which can then be
 

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.060
home on history pin which can then be
curated obviously all that all the

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:17.490
about fifty percent of all users took
 

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.590
about fifty percent of all users took
them up very quickly and started

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600
them up very quickly and started
 

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.750
them up very quickly and started
designing them and the rest are coming

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760
designing them and the rest are coming
 

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.310
designing them and the rest are coming
on slowly so am and the channels also

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320
on slowly so am and the channels also
 

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.870
on slowly so am and the channels also
the channels essentially based around

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880
the channels essentially based around
 

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.810
the channels essentially based around
this main central panel this is the

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:29.820
this main central panel this is the
 

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.640
this main central panel this is the
Imperial War Museum channel which allows

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:31.650
Imperial War Museum channel which allows
 

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.940
Imperial War Museum channel which allows
the replicates all the same content as

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:34.950
the replicates all the same content as
 

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:36.530
the replicates all the same content as
on the main history pin map but just in

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:36.540
on the main history pin map but just in
 

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.170
on the main history pin map but just in
relation to that users content so the

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:39.180
relation to that users content so the
 

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.450
relation to that users content so the
Imperial War Museum for example

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:40.460
Imperial War Museum for example
 

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.290
Imperial War Museum for example
obviously they liked seeing their

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:42.300
obviously they liked seeing their
 

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.670
obviously they liked seeing their
content mixed up with everyone else's

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:43.680
content mixed up with everyone else's
 

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.650
content mixed up with everyone else's
but they've particularly been drawn to

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:45.660
but they've particularly been drawn to
 

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.170
but they've particularly been drawn to
this idea of showing what is really kind

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:48.180
this idea of showing what is really kind
 

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.470
this idea of showing what is really kind
of very striking content in isolation on

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480
of very striking content in isolation on
 

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.330
of very striking content in isolation on
the map and they can control that

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340
the map and they can control that
 

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.940
the map and they can control that
environment

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:54.950
environment
 

00:28:54.950 --> 00:29:02.389
environment
as as much as they need to and and then

00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399
as as much as they need to and and then
 

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:06.230
as as much as they need to and and then
also yes stories in relation to those

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240
also yes stories in relation to those
 

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.630
also yes stories in relation to those
content can be looked at so within this

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640
content can be looked at so within this
 

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.269
content can be looked at so within this
one a particular event anti-vietnam

00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279
one a particular event anti-vietnam
 

00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:14.450
one a particular event anti-vietnam
processed in protest in 1968 in

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.460
processed in protest in 1968 in
 

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.159
processed in protest in 1968 in
Grosvenor Square in London and a whole

00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:16.169
Grosvenor Square in London and a whole
 

00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:17.389
Grosvenor Square in London and a whole
series and people have added more

00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:17.399
series and people have added more
 

00:29:17.399 --> 00:29:20.960
series and people have added more
stories to that and then also in this

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:20.970
stories to that and then also in this
 

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.370
stories to that and then also in this
particular archive has been quite

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.380
particular archive has been quite
 

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.120
particular archive has been quite
popular for repeats so they can go and

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:26.130
popular for repeats so they can go and
 

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.950
popular for repeats so they can go and
see who's gone and taken some modern

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960
see who's gone and taken some modern
 

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.139
see who's gone and taken some modern
replicas of their they're all pictures

00:29:30.139 --> 00:29:30.149
replicas of their they're all pictures
 

00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:34.009
replicas of their they're all pictures
and so yeah the channels functionality

00:29:34.009 --> 00:29:34.019
and so yeah the channels functionality
 

00:29:34.019 --> 00:29:36.769
and so yeah the channels functionality
is particularly aimed at the the

00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779
is particularly aimed at the the
 

00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:40.610
is particularly aimed at the the
archival community and and one of the

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:40.620
archival community and and one of the
 

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.149
archival community and and one of the
things that goes along with that is

00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159
things that goes along with that is
 

00:29:43.159 --> 00:29:46.340
things that goes along with that is
embeds so this is someone that has

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:46.350
embeds so this is someone that has
 

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:52.250
embeds so this is someone that has
skipped the m2 second story so this is a

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260
skipped the m2 second story so this is a
 

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:56.240
skipped the m2 second story so this is a
bath in time and that he's and they've

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.250
bath in time and that he's and they've
 

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.529
bath in time and that he's and they've
embedded history pin on their own

00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:57.539
embedded history pin on their own
 

00:29:57.539 --> 00:29:59.120
embedded history pin on their own
website so essentially what the channel

00:29:59.120 --> 00:29:59.130
website so essentially what the channel
 

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.490
website so essentially what the channel
allows you to do is grab code take that

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500
allows you to do is grab code take that
 

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.019
allows you to do is grab code take that
code and stick on your own website and

00:30:03.019 --> 00:30:03.029
code and stick on your own website and
 

00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:04.639
code and stick on your own website and
then basically have his stupid tools on

00:30:04.639 --> 00:30:04.649
then basically have his stupid tools on
 

00:30:04.649 --> 00:30:06.919
then basically have his stupid tools on
your site which is proved really popular

00:30:06.919 --> 00:30:06.929
your site which is proved really popular
 

00:30:06.929 --> 00:30:08.990
your site which is proved really popular
more popular than we thought it's very

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000
more popular than we thought it's very
 

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.490
more popular than we thought it's very
simple the way it works and it basically

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500
simple the way it works and it basically
 

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.230
simple the way it works and it basically
allows people to have mapping tools on

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240
allows people to have mapping tools on
 

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.610
allows people to have mapping tools on
their site but they never would have

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:13.620
their site but they never would have
 

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.169
their site but they never would have
been able to invest in themselves and it

00:30:15.169 --> 00:30:15.179
been able to invest in themselves and it
 

00:30:15.179 --> 00:30:17.269
been able to invest in themselves and it
all runs from the channel so all the

00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279
all runs from the channel so all the
 

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:18.620
all runs from the channel so all the
content that's on the institution's

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:18.630
content that's on the institution's
 

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:23.450
content that's on the institution's
channel then flows onto this and yeah I

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460
channel then flows onto this and yeah I
 

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.180
channel then flows onto this and yeah I
mean it's it's because because all the

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:26.190
mean it's it's because because all the
 

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:28.070
mean it's it's because because all the
maintenance and all the moderation is

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080
maintenance and all the moderation is
 

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.789
maintenance and all the moderation is
done on history pin it gives a kind of

00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799
done on history pin it gives a kind of
 

00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:34.220
done on history pin it gives a kind of
very simple quick upgrade of tools to a

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:34.230
very simple quick upgrade of tools to a
 

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.960
very simple quick upgrade of tools to a
whole series of institutions then this

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:35.970
whole series of institutions then this
 

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.909
whole series of institutions then this
is a relatively small local archive in

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919
is a relatively small local archive in
 

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:38.840
is a relatively small local archive in
the UK there never would have been able

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:38.850
the UK there never would have been able
 

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.580
the UK there never would have been able
to afford these kind of tools and now

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:40.590
to afford these kind of tools and now
 

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.830
to afford these kind of tools and now
they can have them on their on their on

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840
they can have them on their on their on
 

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.659
they can have them on their on their on
their own site which has proved a real a

00:30:44.659 --> 00:30:44.669
their own site which has proved a real a
 

00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:47.360
their own site which has proved a real a
real boost for lots of institutions and

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:47.370
real boost for lots of institutions and
 

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.580
real boost for lots of institutions and
it also shows their collections and any

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:49.590
it also shows their collections and any
 

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:54.430
it also shows their collections and any
tools that they've made and and then

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:54.440
tools that they've made and and then
 

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.289
tools that they've made and and then
what goes along with these new tools is

00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:57.299
what goes along with these new tools is
 

00:30:57.299 --> 00:30:59.029
what goes along with these new tools is
the bulk uploader so this is the

00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039
the bulk uploader so this is the
 

00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:00.879
the bulk uploader so this is the
powerhouse museums channel Australia and

00:31:00.879 --> 00:31:00.889
powerhouse museums channel Australia and
 

00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:03.049
powerhouse museums channel Australia and
they've designed it all up and this is

00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:03.059
they've designed it all up and this is
 

00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:04.639
they've designed it all up and this is
showing them using the bulk uploader

00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:04.649
showing them using the bulk uploader
 

00:31:04.649 --> 00:31:07.640
showing them using the bulk uploader
tool which allows so previously

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:07.650
tool which allows so previously
 

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.290
tool which allows so previously
each piece of content would be added one

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:09.300
each piece of content would be added one
 

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.360
each piece of content would be added one
by one this allows a whole batch of

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:11.370
by one this allows a whole batch of
 

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:14.840
by one this allows a whole batch of
files to be added alongside a CSV file a

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:14.850
files to be added alongside a CSV file a
 

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.490
files to be added alongside a CSV file a
spreadsheet with all of the metadata

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:16.500
spreadsheet with all of the metadata
 

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.720
spreadsheet with all of the metadata
related to that you'll see down the left

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:17.730
related to that you'll see down the left
 

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.340
related to that you'll see down the left
hand side there's a unique identifier

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:19.350
hand side there's a unique identifier
 

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.380
hand side there's a unique identifier
for each of those piece of content the

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:21.390
for each of those piece of content the
 

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.750
for each of those piece of content the
CSV files dropped in all the files are

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760
CSV files dropped in all the files are
 

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.210
CSV files dropped in all the files are
dropped in and a few and around the

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220
dropped in and a few and around the
 

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.540
dropped in and a few and around the
thousand i think at once can be added is

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:29.550
thousand i think at once can be added is
 

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.180
thousand i think at once can be added is
that will grow but it essentially a very

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:32.190
that will grow but it essentially a very
 

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.400
that will grow but it essentially a very
simple way of adding lots of content at

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:34.410
simple way of adding lots of content at
 

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.650
simple way of adding lots of content at
the moment there's no we don't have

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:36.660
the moment there's no we don't have
 

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.380
the moment there's no we don't have
api's to allow this to become automated

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:39.390
api's to allow this to become automated
 

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:43.730
api's to allow this to become automated
as such but it's suiting institutions to

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740
as such but it's suiting institutions to
 

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.560
as such but it's suiting institutions to
be able to generate a CSV file from

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:45.570
be able to generate a CSV file from
 

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.290
be able to generate a CSV file from
their own database and then grab a whole

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:48.300
their own database and then grab a whole
 

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.970
their own database and then grab a whole
load of content and then put the two

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:49.980
load of content and then put the two
 

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.500
load of content and then put the two
together on history pin and they

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:51.510
together on history pin and they
 

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.090
together on history pin and they
integrate and then they all become

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100
integrate and then they all become
 

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.100
integrate and then they all become
mapped according to the metadata if

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:55.110
mapped according to the metadata if
 

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.080
mapped according to the metadata if
there is no location or date information

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:57.090
there is no location or date information
 

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.940
there is no location or date information
within the spreadsheets then that

00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:58.950
within the spreadsheets then that
 

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.710
within the spreadsheets then that
content appears on the channel but

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720
content appears on the channel but
 

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.270
content appears on the channel but
doesn't appear on the main map so it'll

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:02.280
doesn't appear on the main map so it'll
 

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.950
doesn't appear on the main map so it'll
appear in the list view and then

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960
appear in the list view and then
 

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.600
appear in the list view and then
institutions can go back through an ad

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:05.610
institutions can go back through an ad
 

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.600
institutions can go back through an ad
date or location or other information as

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:08.610
date or location or other information as
 

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:14.240
date or location or other information as
they find out more about it and that and

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:14.250
they find out more about it and that and
 

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.120
they find out more about it and that and
then they can pull back down an updated

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.130
then they can pull back down an updated
 

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:18.500
then they can pull back down an updated
spreadsheet from our system to update

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:18.510
spreadsheet from our system to update
 

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:20.420
spreadsheet from our system to update
their own systems with it'll be

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:20.430
their own systems with it'll be
 

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.070
their own systems with it'll be
gradually become more sophisticated and

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080
gradually become more sophisticated and
 

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.930
gradually become more sophisticated and
more automated I think one of our people

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940
more automated I think one of our people
 

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.190
more automated I think one of our people
are bit of reluctance at the moment is

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200
are bit of reluctance at the moment is
 

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.380
are bit of reluctance at the moment is
that lots of institutions and archives

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:27.390
that lots of institutions and archives
 

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:28.910
that lots of institutions and archives
libraries museums universities have very

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:28.920
libraries museums universities have very
 

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.190
libraries museums universities have very
different systems there's around 40

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200
different systems there's around 40
 

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.450
different systems there's around 40
systems that are used and and we want to

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460
systems that are used and and we want to
 

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.160
systems that are used and and we want to
have the kind of lowest batha

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:37.170
have the kind of lowest batha
 

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.990
have the kind of lowest batha
participation at the moment we will

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000
participation at the moment we will
 

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.540
participation at the moment we will
allow kind of more and more API and more

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:41.550
allow kind of more and more API and more
 

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.730
allow kind of more and more API and more
and more integration to happen

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740
and more integration to happen
 

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.550
and more integration to happen
automatically and so yeah the bulk up

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:46.560
automatically and so yeah the bulk up
 

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.650
automatically and so yeah the bulk up
that at all is really the the number of

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:48.660
that at all is really the the number of
 

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.930
that at all is really the the number of
within kind of nine weeks the content

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.940
within kind of nine weeks the content
 

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.640
within kind of nine weeks the content
doubled pretty quickly on the back of

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:52.650
doubled pretty quickly on the back of
 

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.050
doubled pretty quickly on the back of
this partly because the channels were

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:54.060
this partly because the channels were
 

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.610
this partly because the channels were
such a big incentive for institutions to

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:55.620
such a big incentive for institutions to
 

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.530
such a big incentive for institutions to
get on test Japan and partly the bulk up

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:57.540
get on test Japan and partly the bulk up
 

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.140
get on test Japan and partly the bulk up
were allowed lots lots more to be shared

00:32:59.140 --> 00:32:59.150
were allowed lots lots more to be shared
 

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:03.920
were allowed lots lots more to be shared
roughly as around kind of 150,000 pieces

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:03.930
roughly as around kind of 150,000 pieces
 

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:07.130
roughly as around kind of 150,000 pieces
of content on there around fifty percent

of content on there around fifty percent
 

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.900
of content on there around fifty percent
of that is from archives libraries

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:08.910
of that is from archives libraries
 

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.190
of that is from archives libraries
museums and around fifty percent of

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200
museums and around fifty percent of
 

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.660
museums and around fifty percent of
those from everyday users which is

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:11.670
those from everyday users which is
 

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:13.850
those from everyday users which is
exactly the kind of balance that we were

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860
exactly the kind of balance that we were
 

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.650
exactly the kind of balance that we were
looking to get that interaction between

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:15.660
looking to get that interaction between
 

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.360
looking to get that interaction between
formal collections and informal

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:17.370
formal collections and informal
 

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.070
formal collections and informal
collections or pro personal I mean

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080
collections or pro personal I mean
 

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.780
collections or pro personal I mean
public and private collections is a

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:20.790
public and private collections is a
 

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:21.539
public and private collections is a
really big part

00:33:21.539 --> 00:33:21.549
really big part
 

00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:24.149
really big part
the project and and then these all of

00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159
the project and and then these all of
 

00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:26.129
the project and and then these all of
these tools are complemented by a

00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:26.139
these tools are complemented by a
 

00:33:26.139 --> 00:33:29.009
these tools are complemented by a
history pen in residence program which

00:33:29.009 --> 00:33:29.019
history pen in residence program which
 

00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:30.989
history pen in residence program which
is where we get people out spending time

00:33:30.989 --> 00:33:30.999
is where we get people out spending time
 

00:33:30.999 --> 00:33:32.399
is where we get people out spending time
from our team within different

00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:32.409
from our team within different
 

00:33:32.409 --> 00:33:34.619
from our team within different
institutions we're aiming to have

00:33:34.619 --> 00:33:34.629
institutions we're aiming to have
 

00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:36.989
institutions we're aiming to have
someone on the ground in New York to be

00:33:36.989 --> 00:33:36.999
someone on the ground in New York to be
 

00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:38.129
someone on the ground in New York to be
able to spend time with lots of

00:33:38.129 --> 00:33:38.139
able to spend time with lots of
 

00:33:38.139 --> 00:33:40.649
able to spend time with lots of
different institutions fairly soon

00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:40.659
different institutions fairly soon
 

00:33:40.659 --> 00:33:43.529
different institutions fairly soon
hopefully it really really helps move

00:33:43.529 --> 00:33:43.539
hopefully it really really helps move
 

00:33:43.539 --> 00:33:45.060
hopefully it really really helps move
things forward and particularly because

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:45.070
things forward and particularly because
 

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.919
things forward and particularly because
we're such a young project and people

00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:46.929
we're such a young project and people
 

00:33:46.929 --> 00:33:47.970
we're such a young project and people
are just getting to know us that

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:47.980
are just getting to know us that
 

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.669
are just getting to know us that
face-to-face time makes a big difference

00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:50.679
face-to-face time makes a big difference
 

00:33:50.679 --> 00:33:52.649
face-to-face time makes a big difference
when it comes to developing ways to

00:33:52.649 --> 00:33:52.659
when it comes to developing ways to
 

00:33:52.659 --> 00:33:54.690
when it comes to developing ways to
collaborate and and then there's also

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:54.700
collaborate and and then there's also
 

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.229
collaborate and and then there's also
access to a whole series of helpdesk

00:33:57.229 --> 00:33:57.239
access to a whole series of helpdesk
 

00:33:57.239 --> 00:33:59.729
access to a whole series of helpdesk
tools and facilities and all that kind

00:33:59.729 --> 00:33:59.739
tools and facilities and all that kind
 

00:33:59.739 --> 00:34:03.060
tools and facilities and all that kind
of stuff so that is where where the

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:03.070
of stuff so that is where where the
 

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:06.419
of stuff so that is where where the
project stands at the moment in relation

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:06.429
project stands at the moment in relation
 

00:34:06.429 --> 00:34:07.819
project stands at the moment in relation
to libraries our community aims and

00:34:07.819 --> 00:34:07.829
to libraries our community aims and
 

00:34:07.829 --> 00:34:11.159
to libraries our community aims and
obviously these three sections overlap

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:11.169
obviously these three sections overlap
 

00:34:11.169 --> 00:34:12.359
obviously these three sections overlap
in lots and lots of ways and I think

00:34:12.359 --> 00:34:12.369
in lots and lots of ways and I think
 

00:34:12.369 --> 00:34:15.539
in lots and lots of ways and I think
what as I said this area the project

00:34:15.539 --> 00:34:15.549
what as I said this area the project
 

00:34:15.549 --> 00:34:19.169
what as I said this area the project
around local communities and how that I

00:34:19.169 --> 00:34:19.179
around local communities and how that I
 

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:21.480
around local communities and how that I
mean one motivation of institutions are

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:21.490
mean one motivation of institutions are
 

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:23.700
mean one motivation of institutions are
lively darker museums participating it's

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:23.710
lively darker museums participating it's
 

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:24.690
lively darker museums participating it's
obviously to get to share their content

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:24.700
obviously to get to share their content
 

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.399
obviously to get to share their content
and interesting ways to open it up to

00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:26.409
and interesting ways to open it up to
 

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:28.980
and interesting ways to open it up to
the public to increase access to allow

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:28.990
the public to increase access to allow
 

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:30.990
the public to increase access to allow
people to contribute to it but another

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000
people to contribute to it but another
 

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.149
people to contribute to it but another
way is is as a as a means of local

00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159
way is is as a as a means of local
 

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.799
way is is as a as a means of local
community engagement so what we'd love

00:34:37.799 --> 00:34:37.809
community engagement so what we'd love
 

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:39.750
community engagement so what we'd love
to be doing in New York over the next

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760
to be doing in New York over the next
 

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.700
to be doing in New York over the next
year is to be designing a whole series

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:41.710
year is to be designing a whole series
 

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.169
year is to be designing a whole series
of projects across New York around

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:43.179
of projects across New York around
 

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:44.399
of projects across New York around
particular collection to a particular

00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:44.409
particular collection to a particular
 

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:46.049
particular collection to a particular
ambitions and I'll speak a bit more

00:34:46.049 --> 00:34:46.059
ambitions and I'll speak a bit more
 

00:34:46.059 --> 00:34:48.059
ambitions and I'll speak a bit more
about how we design those projects but

00:34:48.059 --> 00:34:48.069
about how we design those projects but
 

00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:49.799
about how we design those projects but
essentially that that allows this

00:34:49.799 --> 00:34:49.809
essentially that that allows this
 

00:34:49.809 --> 00:34:54.000
essentially that that allows this
activity to happen and as I described at

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.010
activity to happen and as I described at
 

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:56.359
activity to happen and as I described at
the beginning that process of natural

00:34:56.359 --> 00:34:56.369
the beginning that process of natural
 

00:34:56.369 --> 00:34:58.650
the beginning that process of natural
mutually compelling intergenerational

00:34:58.650 --> 00:34:58.660
mutually compelling intergenerational
 

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.630
mutually compelling intergenerational
storytelling is a big big part of the

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640
storytelling is a big big part of the
 

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.819
storytelling is a big big part of the
project and flows out naturally from the

00:35:02.819 --> 00:35:02.829
project and flows out naturally from the
 

00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:04.260
project and flows out naturally from the
process of trying to gather and pin

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:04.270
process of trying to gather and pin
 

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:08.490
process of trying to gather and pin
content and and and the way that that

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:08.500
content and and and the way that that
 

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.260
content and and and the way that that
can then feed exhibitions and community

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:10.270
can then feed exhibitions and community
 

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.829
can then feed exhibitions and community

force for Digital Inclusion and I don't

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:16.089
force for Digital Inclusion and I don't
 

00:35:16.089 --> 00:35:17.280
force for Digital Inclusion and I don't
actually know what the digital exclusion

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:17.290
actually know what the digital exclusion
 

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.620
actually know what the digital exclusion
numbers here are in the UK there's about

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:19.630
numbers here are in the UK there's about
 

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.569
numbers here are in the UK there's about
eight million people that aren't online

00:35:21.569 --> 00:35:21.579
eight million people that aren't online
 

00:35:21.579 --> 00:35:24.299
eight million people that aren't online
and around 20 more million people that

00:35:24.299 --> 00:35:24.309
and around 20 more million people that
 

00:35:24.309 --> 00:35:25.980
and around 20 more million people that
use internet so irregularly that they

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:25.990
use internet so irregularly that they
 

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.319
use internet so irregularly that they
don't really count as being online and

00:35:28.319 --> 00:35:28.329
don't really count as being online and
 

00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:30.900
don't really count as being online and
that those rates are relatively low i'm

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:30.910
that those rates are relatively low i'm
 

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.180
that those rates are relatively low i'm
sure it's higher here but that is

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:33.190
sure it's higher here but that is
 

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.760
sure it's higher here but that is
creating a kind

and even bigger inter generational
 

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.110
and even bigger inter generational
divide and an intercultural and kind of

lot of the reasons for that are a kind

lot of the reasons for that are a kind
 

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.310
lot of the reasons for that are a kind
of refusing it culture that the internet

flick a dozen is a bit more metadata

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:43.070
flick a dozen is a bit more metadata
 

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.910
flick a dozen is a bit more metadata
around date and location so often it's a

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920
around date and location so often it's a
 

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.160

there's a simple answer nor longer
answer but there's the the simple answer

very close to extending that which will
 

00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:35.730
very close to extending that which will
do probably over the next few weeks

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:35.740

of the reasons why we started off with

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:43.210
of the reasons why we started off with
 

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:45.420
of the reasons why we started off with
recorded content is because we wanted to

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:45.430
recorded content is because we wanted to
 

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:48.030
recorded content is because we wanted to
create a line between subjective and

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.040
create a line between subjective and
 

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.849
create a line between subjective and
objective and that a pin would represent

objective and that a pin would represent
 

00:38:50.859 --> 00:38:53.250
objective and that a pin would represent
recorded history that you couldn't just

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:53.260
recorded history that you couldn't just
 

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.309
recorded history that you couldn't just
make up and you could add subjective

00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319
make up and you could add subjective
 

00:38:56.319 --> 00:38:57.930
make up and you could add subjective
things to that so people could interpret

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:57.940
things to that so people could interpret
 

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.839
things to that so people could interpret
and and and kind of gather narrative

00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:00.849
and and and kind of gather narrative
 

00:39:00.849 --> 00:39:02.700

kind of channel plus feature or
 

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:02.250
kind of channel plus feature or
something like that so you have a

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:02.260
something like that so you have a
 

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.510
something like that so you have a
standard channel and then if you want a

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520
standard channel and then if you want a
 

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.130

as an institution you pay a subscription
or something like that but the idea is

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:08.680
or something like that but the idea is
 

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.190
or something like that but the idea is
to keep the commercial bits as far away

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200
to keep the commercial bits as far away
 

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.470
to keep the commercial bits as far away

in any way but it's yeah an ongoing
 

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.520
in any way but it's yeah an ongoing
challenge and as I said the hardest bit

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:20.530
challenge and as I said the hardest bit
 

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:22.320
challenge and as I said the hardest bit
is we need we really need half a million

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:22.330
is we need we really need half a million
 

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:23.370

that's our kind of that's what we should

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:25.690
that's our kind of that's what we should

that's our kind of that's what we should
be spending we're spending about third

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280
be spending we're spending about third
 

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.970
be spending we're spending about third
of that at the moment which is where

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:29.980

Bulgaria comes in handy
but and to get that bit is most hard

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:36.270
but and to get that bit is most hard
 

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:37.760

you run something like this without
commercializing it and which we never

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440
commercializing it and which we never
 

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:03.380
commercializing it and which we never
will but it's a for it to meet them Ames

interesting crowdsourcing projects going
 

00:47:59.929 --> 00:48:04.599
interesting crowdsourcing projects going
on and they tend to be most intend to be

00:48:04.599 --> 00:48:04.609
on and they tend to be most intend to be

which are really nice but I think we're

which are really nice but I think we're
 

00:48:08.959 --> 00:48:10.389
which are really nice but I think we're
particularly interested in in

00:48:10.389 --> 00:48:10.399
particularly interested in in
 

00:48:10.399 --> 00:48:12.189
particularly interested in in
crowdsourcing that you can't do on your

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:12.199
crowdsourcing that you can't do on your
 

00:48:12.199 --> 00:48:14.139
crowdsourcing that you can't do on your
own then you have to talk to people

00:48:14.139 --> 00:48:14.149
own then you have to talk to people
 

00:48:14.149 --> 00:48:17.829
own then you have to talk to people
about or you have to research or you

00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839
about or you have to research or you
 

00:48:17.839 --> 00:48:18.879
about or you have to research or you
know get involved in some kind of

00:48:18.879 --> 00:48:18.889
know get involved in some kind of
 

00:48:18.889 --> 00:48:20.439
know get involved in some kind of
discussion that photo of my ground at

00:48:20.439 --> 00:48:20.449

the beginning there's only two people

00:48:21.489 --> 00:48:21.499
the beginning there's only two people
 

00:48:21.499 --> 00:48:23.379
the beginning there's only two people
alive now that know the story behind

alive now that know the story behind
 

00:48:23.389 --> 00:48:25.449
alive now that know the story behind
that and therefore there's a kind of

00:48:25.449 --> 00:48:25.459
that and therefore there's a kind of
 

00:48:25.459 --> 00:48:28.539
that and therefore there's a kind of
there has to be a mass to this kind of

there has to be a mass to this kind of
 

00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:30.339
there has to be a mass to this kind of
crowd sourcing it's not something that

00:48:30.339 --> 00:48:30.349
crowd sourcing it's not something that
 

00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:33.389

just a few people can do you know in

community conversation so yeah this is

00:48:40.809 --> 00:48:40.819
community conversation so yeah this is

technological development it's also
 

00:48:43.159 --> 00:48:46.479
technological development it's also
about how we pull in expertise from lots

00:48:46.479 --> 00:48:46.489
about how we pull in expertise from lots
 

00:48:46.489 --> 00:48:49.719

about how we funnel and channel the
 

00:49:00.409 --> 00:49:04.749
about how we funnel and channel the
conversations into a green metadata the

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800
purpose and some some parameters and or
 

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.860
purpose and some some parameters and or
it could be yeah we're going to tell the

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:08.870
it could be yeah we're going to tell the
 

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:10.630
it could be yeah we're going to tell the
history of this particular street corner

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640
history of this particular street corner
 

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.750
history of this particular street corner
or this person or when we have the

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760
or this person or when we have the
 

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.040
or this person or when we have the
message crowdsourcing tools the

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:15.050
message crowdsourcing tools the
 

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:16.510
message crowdsourcing tools the
challenge might be these are ten

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520
challenge might be these are ten
 

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.820
challenge might be these are ten
thousand images we know nothing about

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:17.830
thousand images we know nothing about
 

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:20.140
thousand images we know nothing about
let's find out as much as we can about

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:20.150
let's find out as much as we can about
 

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:21.970
let's find out as much as we can about
over the next six months we just did a

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:21.980
over the next six months we just did a
 

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.440
over the next six months we just did a
really nice test with Brooklyn Museum

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:23.450
really nice test with Brooklyn Museum
 

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:25.360
really nice test with Brooklyn Museum
they had 500 pieces of content that they

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:25.370
they had 500 pieces of content that they
 

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.790
they had 500 pieces of content that they
had no geolocation data fall and they

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:27.800
had no geolocation data fall and they
 

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.200
had no geolocation data fall and they
put them at the community and said let's

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:29.210
put them at the community and said let's
 

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.060
put them at the community and said let's
pin all of these pieces of content and

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:31.070
pin all of these pieces of content and
 

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.560
pin all of these pieces of content and
by the end of it within about three

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:32.570
by the end of it within about three
 

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:34.690
by the end of it within about three
weeks they had all the location data for

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:34.700
weeks they had all the location data for
 

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.730
weeks they had all the location data for
all these pieces of content and so

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:36.740
all these pieces of content and so
 

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.520
all these pieces of content and so
challenges and tasks is what will

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:39.530
challenges and tasks is what will
 

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:41.320
challenges and tasks is what will
undoubtedly dominate history pin within

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:41.330
undoubtedly dominate history pin within
 

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:43.510
undoubtedly dominate history pin within
probably about six to nine months and

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520
probably about six to nine months and
 

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.130
probably about six to nine months and
when you come to history pin you will of

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:45.140
when you come to history pin you will of
 

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.750
when you come to history pin you will of
course always find the big map through

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:46.760
course always find the big map through
 

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.020
course always find the big map through
time but actually you're more likely to

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:50.030
time but actually you're more likely to
 

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:52.840
time but actually you're more likely to
find a world of small groups of people

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:52.850
find a world of small groups of people
 

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:54.700
find a world of small groups of people
working on particular tasks and those

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:54.710
working on particular tasks and those
 

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:56.740
working on particular tasks and those
tasks aggregating and cross pollinating

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:56.750
tasks aggregating and cross pollinating
 

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.860
tasks aggregating and cross pollinating
in lots of interesting ways so to walk

00:50:59.860 --> 00:50:59.870
in lots of interesting ways so to walk
 

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.260
in lots of interesting ways so to walk
through I mean and what's the idea of

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:02.270
through I mean and what's the idea of
 

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:04.900
through I mean and what's the idea of
the next 12 months in New York is to

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:04.910
the next 12 months in New York is to
 

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:06.520
the next 12 months in New York is to
work in partnership with a series of

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:06.530
work in partnership with a series of
 

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:09.130
work in partnership with a series of
different partners arm as we develop

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:09.140
different partners arm as we develop
 

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:12.340
different partners arm as we develop
these the kind of open source tools on

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:12.350
these the kind of open source tools on
 

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:15.910
these the kind of open source tools on
five or six projects and that we get

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920
five or six projects and that we get
 

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:16.990
five or six projects and that we get
some people get someone on the ground

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000
some people get someone on the ground
 

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.750
some people get someone on the ground
here that can support that and we define

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760
here that can support that and we define
 

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.850
here that can support that and we define
them together and kind of support them

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:21.860
them together and kind of support them
 

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.680
them together and kind of support them
and managed activities together so these

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:26.690
and managed activities together so these
 

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:28.480
and managed activities together so these
yeah these challenges could have

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:28.490
yeah these challenges could have
 

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.630
yeah these challenges could have
particular aims and targets so this is

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:31.640
particular aims and targets so this is
 

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.589
particular aims and targets so this is
the Fleischmann bakery down was on the

00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599
the Fleischmann bakery down was on the
 

00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:38.410
the Fleischmann bakery down was on the
corner of eleventh and something else

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:38.420
corner of eleventh and something else
 

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.200

Broadway movie and a famous building

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:41.210
Broadway movie and a famous building
 

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:42.430
Broadway movie and a famous building
with a really rich history to it that

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:42.440
with a really rich history to it that
 

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.809
with a really rich history to it that
now is something completely different an

00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:43.819
now is something completely different an
 

00:51:43.819 --> 00:51:45.880
now is something completely different an
example of a challenge could be to find

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:45.890
example of a challenge could be to find
 

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:46.960
example of a challenge could be to find
out as much as possible about this

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:46.970
out as much as possible about this
 

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.940
out as much as possible about this
building and what that immediately does

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:48.950
building and what that immediately does
 

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:50.710
building and what that immediately does
which is really nice and we found again

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720
which is really nice and we found again
 

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.890
which is really nice and we found again
and again is it it immediately rates and

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:53.900
and again is it it immediately rates and
 

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.329
and again is it it immediately rates and
makes that activity relevant to a

00:51:55.329 --> 00:51:55.339
makes that activity relevant to a
 

00:51:55.339 --> 00:51:57.280
makes that activity relevant to a
particular community so one of the

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:57.290
particular community so one of the
 

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:59.200
particular community so one of the
projects we've done on a council estate

00:51:59.200 --> 00:51:59.210
projects we've done on a council estate
 

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:03.099
projects we've done on a council estate
in North London and which now doesn't

00:52:03.099 --> 00:52:03.109
in North London and which now doesn't
 

00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:04.480
in North London and which now doesn't
exist but it was these huge old

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:04.490
exist but it was these huge old
 

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:07.410
exist but it was these huge old
buildings that were taken down and

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:07.420
buildings that were taken down and
 

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.329
buildings that were taken down and
thousands of people know somebody that

00:52:09.329 --> 00:52:09.339
thousands of people know somebody that
 

00:52:09.339 --> 00:52:12.010
thousands of people know somebody that
lived in those buildings or has a story

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:12.020
lived in those buildings or has a story
 

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:13.990
lived in those buildings or has a story
attached to those buildings and it a

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000
attached to those buildings and it a
 

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.490
attached to those buildings and it a
community of interest immediately

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:15.500
community of interest immediately
 

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.349
community of interest immediately
develops around that particular project

00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359
develops around that particular project
 

00:52:17.359 --> 00:52:19.329
develops around that particular project
so I think what's nice about the project

00:52:19.329 --> 00:52:19.339
so I think what's nice about the project
 

00:52:19.339 --> 00:52:21.370
so I think what's nice about the project
model or these cysts and history

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:21.380
model or these cysts and history
 

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.319
model or these cysts and history
challenges we call them is that they

00:52:23.319 --> 00:52:23.329
challenges we call them is that they
 

00:52:23.329 --> 00:52:24.910
challenges we call them is that they
they bring together a particular group

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:24.920
they bring together a particular group
 

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.530
they bring together a particular group
of people with a particular interest and

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:26.540
of people with a particular interest and
 

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.079
of people with a particular interest and
ambition so yeah the theme when the

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:29.089
ambition so yeah the theme when the
 

00:52:29.089 --> 00:52:31.089
ambition so yeah the theme when the
subject is defined the audience and the

00:52:31.089 --> 00:52:31.099
subject is defined the audience and the
 

00:52:31.099 --> 00:52:33.190
subject is defined the audience and the
participants naturally define themselves

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200
participants naturally define themselves
 

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.410
participants naturally define themselves
and then the activities and events do as

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:35.420
and then the activities and events do as
 

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.200
and then the activities and events do as
well so and I'll talk a bit more about

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:38.210
well so and I'll talk a bit more about
 

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:40.210
well so and I'll talk a bit more about
one project we've done in in real depth

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:40.220
one project we've done in in real depth
 

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.609
one project we've done in in real depth
but essentially the community became

00:52:42.609 --> 00:52:42.619
but essentially the community became
 

00:52:42.619 --> 00:52:44.500
but essentially the community became
filled with events and activities and

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:44.510
filled with events and activities and
 

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.839
filled with events and activities and
meetups and hangouts of people trying to

00:52:46.839 --> 00:52:46.849
meetups and hangouts of people trying to
 

00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:48.880
meetups and hangouts of people trying to
break down bits of the bits of the

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:48.890
break down bits of the bits of the
 

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:51.940
break down bits of the bits of the
challenge in hand so once this challenge

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:51.950
challenge in hand so once this challenge
 

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:55.329
challenge in hand so once this challenge
is being established and then there is

00:52:55.329 --> 00:52:55.339
is being established and then there is
 

00:52:55.339 --> 00:52:57.400
is being established and then there is
there it has I mean and this is kind of

00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:57.410
there it has I mean and this is kind of
 

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:59.140
there it has I mean and this is kind of
talking about what worked for us but it

00:52:59.140 --> 00:52:59.150
talking about what worked for us but it
 

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:00.370
talking about what worked for us but it
won't necessarily define all projects

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:00.380
won't necessarily define all projects
 

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.140
won't necessarily define all projects
the role for champions has been

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:02.150
the role for champions has been
 

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:04.120
the role for champions has been
particularly important people who take

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:04.130
particularly important people who take
 

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:07.420
particularly important people who take
this challenge up and and promote it and

00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:07.430
this challenge up and and promote it and
 

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:09.609
this challenge up and and promote it and
further it and I get really involved in

00:53:09.609 --> 00:53:09.619
further it and I get really involved in
 

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:12.160
further it and I get really involved in
it and a big role for obviously cultural

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:12.170
it and a big role for obviously cultural
 

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:15.250
it and a big role for obviously cultural
heritage institutions sometimes one but

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:15.260
heritage institutions sometimes one but
 

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.559
heritage institutions sometimes one but
actually normally around any particular

00:53:17.559 --> 00:53:17.569
actually normally around any particular
 

00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:20.290
actually normally around any particular
area or era or subject there are a whole

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:20.300
area or era or subject there are a whole
 

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.819
area or era or subject there are a whole
series of different archives that are

00:53:21.819 --> 00:53:21.829
series of different archives that are
 

00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:22.780
series of different archives that are
going to be able to contribute in some

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:22.790
going to be able to contribute in some
 

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:24.760
going to be able to contribute in some
way so with the one I'll talk through

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:24.770
way so with the one I'll talk through
 

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:27.220
way so with the one I'll talk through
more about there were nine heritage

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:27.230
more about there were nine heritage
 

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:29.050
more about there were nine heritage
institutions and archives that also

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:29.060
institutions and archives that also
 

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:33.069

their communities but these these kind
 

00:53:56.930 --> 00:54:00.009
their communities but these these kind
of projects are a way to do that is if

00:54:00.009 --> 00:54:00.019
of projects are a way to do that is if
 

00:54:00.019 --> 00:54:02.140
of projects are a way to do that is if
you're working together on the history

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:02.150
you're working together on the history
 

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:05.410
you're working together on the history
of a particular area so yeah as one of

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:05.420
of a particular area so yeah as one of
 

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:09.160
of a particular area so yeah as one of
the projects we so within this reading

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:09.170
the projects we so within this reading
 

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:10.029
the projects we so within this reading
project which I'll talk more about

00:54:10.029 --> 00:54:10.039
project which I'll talk more about
 

00:54:10.039 --> 00:54:11.529
project which I'll talk more about
reading university got very heavily

00:54:11.529 --> 00:54:11.539
reading university got very heavily
 

00:54:11.539 --> 00:54:13.689
reading university got very heavily
involved within the kind of East Palo

00:54:13.689 --> 00:54:13.699
involved within the kind of East Palo
 

00:54:13.699 --> 00:54:15.120

Alto project we've been developing

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:15.130
Alto project we've been developing
 

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:17.049
Alto project we've been developing
Stanford have got heavily involved and

00:54:17.049 --> 00:54:17.059
Stanford have got heavily involved and
 

00:54:17.059 --> 00:54:19.150
Stanford have got heavily involved and
it's a it's really good for the

00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.160
it's a it's really good for the
 

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.880
it's a it's really good for the
University and for the students to be

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:21.890
University and for the students to be
 

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:23.949
University and for the students to be
collaborating on something rather than

00:54:23.949 --> 00:54:23.959
collaborating on something rather than
 

00:54:23.959 --> 00:54:27.219
collaborating on something rather than
just kind of I guess investigating

00:54:27.219 --> 00:54:27.229
just kind of I guess investigating
 

00:54:27.229 --> 00:54:30.069
just kind of I guess investigating
sniffing around so it though it's a

00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079
sniffing around so it though it's a
 

00:54:30.079 --> 00:54:32.079
sniffing around so it though it's a
really it's proved a really nice way of

00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:32.089
really it's proved a really nice way of
 

00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:33.519
really it's proved a really nice way of
universities coming together with their

00:54:33.519 --> 00:54:33.529
universities coming together with their
 

00:54:33.529 --> 00:54:35.789
universities coming together with their
communities and institutions as well and

00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:35.799
communities and institutions as well and
 

00:54:35.799 --> 00:54:38.229
communities and institutions as well and
schools within these projects play a

00:54:38.229 --> 00:54:38.239
schools within these projects play a
 

00:54:38.239 --> 00:54:41.289
schools within these projects play a
very important role and and then have

00:54:41.289 --> 00:54:41.299
very important role and and then have
 

00:54:41.299 --> 00:54:43.719
very important role and and then have
added lots and lots of activity and

00:54:43.719 --> 00:54:43.729
added lots and lots of activity and
 

00:54:43.729 --> 00:54:45.359
added lots and lots of activity and
engagement to all of them and

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:47.390
universities I said are becoming more
 

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:48.699
universities I said are becoming more
and more important to all of our work

and more important to all of our work
 

00:54:48.709 --> 00:54:51.789
and more important to all of our work
and the idea that which we found really

00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799
and the idea that which we found really
 

00:54:51.799 --> 00:54:54.609
and the idea that which we found really
compelling that there is a obviously an

interest in the process itself how you

00:55:03.009 --> 00:55:03.019
interest in the process itself how you
 

00:55:03.019 --> 00:55:04.630
interest in the process itself how you
go from not only very much about

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640
go from not only very much about
 

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.669

something via thousands of people to
knowing a lot about things is a

00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:08.420
knowing a lot about things is a
 

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:11.910
knowing a lot about things is a
fascinating process to examine in itself

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920
fascinating process to examine in itself
 

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:16.809
fascinating process to examine in itself

designed particularly interfaces this is
 

00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:21.669
designed particularly interfaces this is
an example of a challenge that we ran

00:55:21.669 --> 00:55:21.679
an example of a challenge that we ran
 

00:55:21.679 --> 00:55:23.349
an example of a challenge that we ran
for the last couple of months as you

00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359
for the last couple of months as you
 

00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:25.179

developed a particular interface for it
 

00:55:42.199 --> 00:55:45.370
developed a particular interface for it
to give it some distinctiveness and put

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:45.380
to give it some distinctiveness and put
 

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:49.209
to give it some distinctiveness and put
lots of resource on it and then lots and

published in different places is really
 

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.150
published in different places is really
important this is an example of

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160
important this is an example of
 

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.230
important this is an example of
something we were doing with the San

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240
something we were doing with the San
 

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.589

Francisco Metropolitan Transport archive

00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599
Francisco Metropolitan Transport archive
 

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:25.230
Francisco Metropolitan Transport archive
where a lot of the content that got

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240
where a lot of the content that got
 

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.700
where a lot of the content that got
gathered through a project we are

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:26.710
gathered through a project we are
 

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:29.099
gathered through a project we are
working on got overlaid onto bus

00:56:29.099 --> 00:56:29.109
working on got overlaid onto bus
 

00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:31.079
working on got overlaid onto bus
shelters so you can look through the bus

00:56:31.079 --> 00:56:31.089
shelters so you can look through the bus
 

00:56:31.089 --> 00:56:35.010
shelters so you can look through the bus
shelter at the modern thing behind it so

00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:35.020
shelter at the modern thing behind it so
 

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.150
shelter at the modern thing behind it so
that building which you can't see very

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160
that building which you can't see very
 

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.849
that building which you can't see very
well is behind the bus shelter and so it

00:56:38.849 --> 00:56:38.859
well is behind the bus shelter and so it
 

00:56:38.859 --> 00:56:40.500
well is behind the bus shelter and so it
creates that overlay effect which is

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:40.510
creates that overlay effect which is
 

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:42.900
creates that overlay effect which is
really nice and there's low what what I

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:42.910
really nice and there's low what what I
 

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:45.329
really nice and there's low what what I
mean again this it can be books it can

00:56:45.329 --> 00:56:45.339
mean again this it can be books it can
 

00:56:45.339 --> 00:56:48.420
mean again this it can be books it can
be exhibitions it can be projections

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:48.430
be exhibitions it can be projections
 

00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:49.859
be exhibitions it can be projections
there's lots of ways of bringing this

00:56:49.859 --> 00:56:49.869
there's lots of ways of bringing this
 

00:56:49.869 --> 00:56:51.780
there's lots of ways of bringing this
content back out once it's been gathered

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:51.790
content back out once it's been gathered
 

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:54.599
content back out once it's been gathered
and and now we're just scratching the

00:56:54.599 --> 00:56:54.609
and and now we're just scratching the
 

00:56:54.609 --> 00:56:55.560
and and now we're just scratching the
surface of this i think the

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:55.570
surface of this i think the
 

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:57.270
surface of this i think the
possibilities for what communities can

00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280
possibilities for what communities can
 

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.130
possibilities for what communities can
achieve when they come together around

00:56:59.130 --> 00:56:59.140
achieve when they come together around
 

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.809
achieve when they come together around
particular citizen history tasks and

00:57:00.809 --> 00:57:00.819
particular citizen history tasks and
 

00:57:00.819 --> 00:57:03.240
particular citizen history tasks and
then what they can take back out is is

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:03.250
then what they can take back out is is
 

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:05.190
then what they can take back out is is
really exciting and will go a lot of

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200
really exciting and will go a lot of
 

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.240
really exciting and will go a lot of
interesting places we're not expecting

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:06.250
interesting places we're not expecting
 

00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:10.319
interesting places we're not expecting
and so i will now yeah so and then

00:57:10.319 --> 00:57:10.329
and so i will now yeah so and then
 

00:57:10.329 --> 00:57:12.900
and so i will now yeah so and then
obviously out of all of that we're

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:12.910
obviously out of all of that we're
 

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:14.609
obviously out of all of that we're
particularly interested in defining and

00:57:14.609 --> 00:57:14.619
particularly interested in defining and
 

00:57:14.619 --> 00:57:15.920

teams and universities they'll be
 

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.400
teams and universities they'll be
interested in some of the kind of

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:26.410
interested in some of the kind of
 

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:28.829
interested in some of the kind of
research conclusions but these ones are

00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:28.839
research conclusions but these ones are
 

00:57:28.839 --> 00:57:30.420
research conclusions but these ones are
the kind of things that we measure

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:30.430
the kind of things that we measure
 

00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:33.150
the kind of things that we measure
within these projects and so to walk you

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160
within these projects and so to walk you
 

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.740
within these projects and so to walk you
through an example of one of these

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:34.750
through an example of one of these
 

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:39.930
through an example of one of these
projects and reading which which is very

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:39.940
projects and reading which which is very
 

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.339
projects and reading which which is very
difficult not to pronounce reading if

00:57:41.339 --> 00:57:41.349
difficult not to pronounce reading if
 

00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:43.890

our pilot project at the end of last
 

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.940
our pilot project at the end of last
year partly because it's regarded as

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:50.950
year partly because it's regarded as
 

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:53.520

quite a boring place but actually where
 

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:55.440
quite a boring place but actually where
you kind of change train but actually

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:55.450
you kind of change train but actually
 

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:58.740
you kind of change train but actually
when you scratch the surface it sort of

00:57:58.740 --> 00:57:58.750
when you scratch the surface it sort of
 

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:01.319
when you scratch the surface it sort of
very rich history to it and it was

00:58:01.319 --> 00:58:01.329
very rich history to it and it was
 

00:58:01.329 --> 00:58:03.599
very rich history to it and it was

biscuits and
 

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:08.470
biscuits and
bulbs but and while we were running this

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480
bulbs but and while we were running this
 

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.540

project actually the final be closed

00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:10.550
project actually the final be closed
 

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:12.450
project actually the final be closed
down so the final brewery closed down

around the court five months preparing
and then we had a three months public

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:34.340
and then we had a three months public
 

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:36.310
and then we had a three months public
engagement phase during that public

00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:36.320
engagement phase during that public
 

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.630

actually and we found that it broke

00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:43.340
actually and we found that it broke
 

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.710
actually and we found that it broke
itself down into lots of much smaller

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720
itself down into lots of much smaller
 

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.050
itself down into lots of much smaller
challenges as we'll talk a bit more

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:47.060

it routing ran an exhibition to which
 

00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:16.150
it routing ran an exhibition to which
17,000 people came to and it proved so

obviously the selectivity doesn't stop

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:21.950
obviously the selectivity doesn't stop
 

00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:23.530

at the end of a delivery period it

00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:23.540
at the end of a delivery period it
 

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:26.740
at the end of a delivery period it
continues in evolves and perpetuates and

and and visited the content online and
 

00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.050
and and visited the content online and
and then from all of that during those

00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:35.060
and then from all of that during those
 

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.760
and then from all of that during those
three months around just over four

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:36.770
three months around just over four
 

00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:38.260

thousand pieces of content were gathered

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:38.270
thousand pieces of content were gathered
 

00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:40.630
thousand pieces of content were gathered
and then since the project ended in

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640
and then since the project ended in
 

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:44.140
and then since the project ended in
December around a lot of three thousand

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:44.150
December around a lot of three thousand
 

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:45.880
December around a lot of three thousand
have continued to be added so what's so

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:45.890
have continued to be added so what's so
 

00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:47.349
have continued to be added so what's so
exciting for us is that this activity

00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359
exciting for us is that this activity
 

00:59:47.359 --> 00:59:50.200
exciting for us is that this activity
stuck within the community and continued

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:50.210
stuck within the community and continued
 

00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:53.260
stuck within the community and continued
and group and then measuring all of this

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:53.270
and group and then measuring all of this
 

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:54.849
and group and then measuring all of this
really closely as we did we got we

00:59:54.849 --> 00:59:54.859
really closely as we did we got we
 

00:59:54.859 --> 00:59:56.260
really closely as we did we got we
always get external evaluators to come

00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:56.270
always get external evaluators to come
 

00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:58.780
always get external evaluators to come
and look at the impact of our work the

00:59:58.780 --> 00:59:58.790
and look at the impact of our work the
 

00:59:58.790 --> 00:59:59.920
and look at the impact of our work the
effects are learning more about local

00:59:59.920 --> 00:59:59.930
effects are learning more about local

heritage is one area we wanted to

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:01.250
heritage is one area we wanted to
 

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:03.849
heritage is one area we wanted to
examine came out really strongly I think

01:00:03.849 --> 01:00:03.859
examine came out really strongly I think
 

01:00:03.859 --> 01:00:05.140
examine came out really strongly I think
if it hadn't come out strongly would

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:05.150
if it hadn't come out strongly would
 

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:07.180
if it hadn't come out strongly would
have been surprised because this

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:07.190
have been surprised because this
 

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:08.530
have been surprised because this
obviously the project was about local

01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:08.540
obviously the project was about local
 

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:13.089
obviously the project was about local
heritage but the diversity of appeal of

01:00:13.089 --> 01:00:13.099
heritage but the diversity of appeal of
 

01:00:13.099 --> 01:00:14.560
heritage but the diversity of appeal of
local heritage which is really was

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:14.570
local heritage which is really was
 

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.960
local heritage which is really was
really impressive and effect on ppl

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:16.970
really impressive and effect on ppl
 

01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:18.340

01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:22.100
community result of participating was
 

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.230
community result of participating was
really strong we were really pleased

really strong we were really pleased
 

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.800
really strong we were really pleased
with that and people just that kind of

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:26.810
with that and people just that kind of
 

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:28.660
with that and people just that kind of
shared sense of place that people are

often missing were they move in and out

01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:30.500
often missing were they move in and out
 

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.730
often missing were they move in and out
of communities quickly or when they just

don't develop a relationship with their
 

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.810
don't develop a relationship with their
neighbors that sense of place was

01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:37.820
neighbors that sense of place was
 

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:39.220
neighbors that sense of place was
something we wanted to measure closely

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:39.230
something we wanted to measure closely
 

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:42.640
something we wanted to measure closely
and came out strongly and interesting

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:42.650
and came out strongly and interesting
 

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:44.500
and came out strongly and interesting
the regularity so in that quote on the

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:44.510
the regularity so in that quote on the
 

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:47.590
the regularity so in that quote on the
bottom left hand corner and coming here

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:47.600
bottom left hand corner and coming here
 

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.120
bottom left hand corner and coming here
every Friday and interacting with the

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:49.130
every Friday and interacting with the
 

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:50.200
every Friday and interacting with the
broader range of people has been useful

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:50.210
broader range of people has been useful
 

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:51.760
broader range of people has been useful
looking a bit more about differed as a

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:51.770
looking a bit more about differed as a
 

01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:53.680
looking a bit more about differed as a
software so that first point coming in

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:53.690
software so that first point coming in
 

01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:56.170
software so that first point coming in
every Friday the regularity of it was

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:56.180
every Friday the regularity of it was
 

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.750
every Friday the regularity of it was
really important and ultimately we kind

01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:58.760
really important and ultimately we kind
 

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.210
really important and ultimately we kind
of yes project by project but we want it

01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:01.220
of yes project by project but we want it
 

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.340
of yes project by project but we want it
to be a become a permanent activity and

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:05.350
to be a become a permanent activity and
 

01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:07.810
to be a become a permanent activity and
yeah the kind of role of regularity

01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:07.820
yeah the kind of role of regularity
 

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.430
yeah the kind of role of regularity
within community activities came out

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440
within community activities came out
 

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.490
within community activities came out
recently and effects on relations in a

01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:12.500
recently and effects on relations in a
 

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.140
recently and effects on relations in a
generation this was really strong and

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:14.150
generation this was really strong and
 

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:15.910
generation this was really strong and
and and we've seen this in all the

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920
and and we've seen this in all the
 

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.200
and and we've seen this in all the
projects we've run that it's just a

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:17.210
projects we've run that it's just a
 

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:19.300
projects we've run that it's just a
natural force we never talk about it as

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:19.310
natural force we never talk about it as
 

01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:21.160
natural force we never talk about it as
an intergenerational project and we

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:21.170
an intergenerational project and we
 

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.320
an intergenerational project and we
never say the young person dear old

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:23.330
never say the young person dear old
 

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:24.430
never say the young person dear old
person please come and talk about

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.440
person please come and talk about
 

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.430
person please come and talk about
history we just put on activities that

01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440
history we just put on activities that
 

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.650
history we just put on activities that
are appealing to both groups and out of

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:29.660
are appealing to both groups and out of
 

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:32.920
are appealing to both groups and out of
it comes quite often I mean it isn't set

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:32.930
it comes quite often I mean it isn't set
 

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:34.930
it comes quite often I mean it isn't set
like this but quite often the younger

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:34.940
like this but quite often the younger
 

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.610
like this but quite often the younger
people are playing the role of kind of

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:36.620
people are playing the role of kind of
 

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.070
people are playing the role of kind of
digital activists and doing a lot of the

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:39.080
digital activists and doing a lot of the
 

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.590
digital activists and doing a lot of the
digitization and pinning and the other

01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:41.600
digitization and pinning and the other
 

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.910
digitization and pinning and the other
people that become the kind of

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:42.920
people that become the kind of
 

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.250
people that become the kind of
gatekeepers to local memory and are very

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:45.260
gatekeepers to local memory and are very
 

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.200
gatekeepers to local memory and are very
valued within that role and the two

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:47.210
valued within that role and the two
 

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:49.960
valued within that role and the two
combined into into a really nice set of

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:49.970
combined into into a really nice set of
 

01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:52.840
combined into into a really nice set of
social outcomes and then finally

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:52.850
social outcomes and then finally
 

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:55.690
social outcomes and then finally
probably our most important stats about

01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:55.700
probably our most important stats about
 

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.310
probably our most important stats about
forty percent of participants became

01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:57.320
forty percent of participants became
 

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.720
forty percent of participants became
more involved in activities in their

01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:58.730
more involved in activities in their
 

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:00.730
more involved in activities in their
community since taking part in the

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:00.740
community since taking part in the
 

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:03.100
community since taking part in the
project which was which we was higher

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:03.110
project which was which we was higher
 

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:05.020
project which was which we was higher
than we were expecting so having people

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:05.030
than we were expecting so having people
 

01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:07.390
than we were expecting so having people
having come to a few you know community

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400
having come to a few you know community
 

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.300
having come to a few you know community
archiving projects then when out via

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:10.310
archiving projects then when out via
 

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.590
archiving projects then when out via
those connections and that community

01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:11.600
those connections and that community
 

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.240
those connections and that community
confidence and became involved in a lot

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:13.250
confidence and became involved in a lot
 

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.060
confidence and became involved in a lot
more when they in their community which

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:16.070
more when they in their community which
 

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:19.780
more when they in their community which
we were really pleased about and so we

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:19.790
we were really pleased about and so we
 

01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:22.270
we were really pleased about and so we
yeah so this is an example of a project

01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:22.280
yeah so this is an example of a project
 

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.520
yeah so this is an example of a project
that was it was quite well funded and it

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:24.530
that was it was quite well funded and it
 

01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:27.610
that was it was quite well funded and it
was very heavily evaluated but our aim

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:27.620
was very heavily evaluated but our aim
 

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.700
was very heavily evaluated but our aim
is now to to run

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:30.710
is now to to run
 

01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:34.510
is now to to run
you know in New York in particular to

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520
you know in New York in particular to
 

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.940
you know in New York in particular to
run a whole series of these projects and

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:36.950
run a whole series of these projects and
 

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:38.770
run a whole series of these projects and
while we're doing it to develop the

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:38.780
while we're doing it to develop the
 

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:40.570
while we're doing it to develop the
tools that allow anybody to set them up

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:40.580
tools that allow anybody to set them up
 

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.820
tools that allow anybody to set them up
on the site at the moment we set up

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:42.830
on the site at the moment we set up
 

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:44.620
on the site at the moment we set up
projects and challenges and we manage

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:44.630
projects and challenges and we manage
 

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:45.670
projects and challenges and we manage
them and curate them and work with

01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680
them and curate them and work with
 

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.950
them and curate them and work with
partners to do that but by the early

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:47.960
partners to do that but by the early
 

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.599
partners to do that but by the early
next year the idea is that anybody can

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:49.609
next year the idea is that anybody can
 

01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:51.250
next year the idea is that anybody can
come and set up and run a project of

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:51.260
come and set up and run a project of
 

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:54.910
come and set up and run a project of
their own shooting and so yeah so so one

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920
their own shooting and so yeah so so one
 

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.430
their own shooting and so yeah so so one
of the aims of obviously this visit and

01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440
of the aims of obviously this visit and
 

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.500
of the aims of obviously this visit and
this particular torque is to you know

01:02:59.500 --> 01:02:59.510
this particular torque is to you know
 

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:01.510
this particular torque is to you know
tell you more about is beeping how to

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520
tell you more about is beeping how to
 

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.099
tell you more about is beeping how to
contribute and how to get collections on

01:03:03.099 --> 01:03:03.109
contribute and how to get collections on
 

01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:04.390
contribute and how to get collections on
there and one of it is to get people

01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400
there and one of it is to get people
 

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.740
there and one of it is to get people
thinking about how we might work

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:05.750
thinking about how we might work
 

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:09.760
thinking about how we might work
together on particular project a project

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:09.770
together on particular project a project
 

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:11.410
together on particular project a project
I'm you know probably at its best when

01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:11.420
I'm you know probably at its best when
 

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.410
I'm you know probably at its best when
there is a I mean I would you know

01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:14.420
there is a I mean I would you know
 

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.240
there is a I mean I would you know
something like university campuses

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:16.250
something like university campuses
 

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:18.609
something like university campuses
actually got a good example or

01:03:18.609 --> 01:03:18.619
actually got a good example or
 

01:03:18.619 --> 01:03:21.040
actually got a good example or
particular neighborhood and because it's

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:21.050
particular neighborhood and because it's
 

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:22.030
particular neighborhood and because it's
often quite a lot of archival

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:22.040
often quite a lot of archival
 

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.160
often quite a lot of archival
collections connected to it there's

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:24.170
collections connected to it there's
 

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:25.210
collections connected to it there's
people there's a lot of people who have

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:25.220
people there's a lot of people who have
 

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.990
people there's a lot of people who have
got a kind of a buy into that those

01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.000
got a kind of a buy into that those
 

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.790
got a kind of a buy into that those
memories and a part of those memories

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:30.800
memories and a part of those memories
 

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.570
memories and a part of those memories
and yeah so so we just to give you an

01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:34.580
and yeah so so we just to give you an
 

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:35.589
and yeah so so we just to give you an
example of one that we're really

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599
example of one that we're really
 

01:03:35.599 --> 01:03:37.660
example of one that we're really
gathered here there is a kind of budding

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:37.670
gathered here there is a kind of budding
 

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:40.599
gathered here there is a kind of budding
Queens memory project Queens which I

01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:40.609
Queens memory project Queens which I
 

01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:42.160
Queens memory project Queens which I
haven't been to before which is as

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:42.170
haven't been to before which is as
 

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:46.030
haven't been to before which is as
diverse places I'd ever visited and and

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:46.040
diverse places I'd ever visited and and
 

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.329
diverse places I'd ever visited and and
and an amazing that kind of we've been

01:03:49.329 --> 01:03:49.339
and an amazing that kind of we've been
 

01:03:49.339 --> 01:03:51.700
and an amazing that kind of we've been
looking at how the tools can reflect

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:51.710
looking at how the tools can reflect
 

01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:55.359
looking at how the tools can reflect
different layers of migration and and

01:03:55.359 --> 01:03:55.369
different layers of migration and and
 

01:03:55.369 --> 01:03:57.250
different layers of migration and and
the impact of that migration on all kind

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:57.260
the impact of that migration on all kind
 

01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.730
the impact of that migration on all kind
of local culture and queens seems to

01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:00.740
of local culture and queens seems to
 

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:03.970
of local culture and queens seems to
kind of you know replace itself its

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:03.980
kind of you know replace itself its
 

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:05.410
kind of you know replace itself its
communities very very quickly so that

01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:05.420
communities very very quickly so that
