00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.500
Disney has produced numerous films you love
and enjoy; that you have probably seen over

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.510
and over again.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.370
The Disney animators work on the same scene,
if not same frame for days to make the films

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.880
perfect for our delight.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.420
Still, sometimes mistakes fall through the
cracks and these blunders are fun to spot.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.300
Let’s take a look at some of these Disney
oversights and when you see one from your

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:39.340
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Mistakes
Disney NEVER Noticed In Their Movies.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:47.649
The Incredibles

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.219
When the Incredibles family and Frozone face
off the new and improved robot provided by

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.510
Syndrome, the junior high school Violet gets
her hands on the remote control.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.440
As the kids fumble with the remote to turn
off the robot, Elastigirl takes the remote

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.510
and clicks a button that turns off an engine
that Mr. Incredible holds.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.490
Mr. Incredible tells her to press the same
button again and when she presses a button

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.120
the engine takes off.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.080
Take a look at the button she pressed, it
was a completely different button.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.700
At least the button didn’t cause the engine
to self explode.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.460
Beauty and the Beast

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.930
When the Prince turns away the old lady, she
curses him by turning him into a Beast that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.490
was his big mistake.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.480
The animators of Beauty and the Beast made
a few mistakes themselves during the production

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.090
of the Oscar winning film.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.360
In the third act of the film Belle can be
seen wearing a white apron, then in another

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.820
scene she can be seen not wearing the apron
but then later on its back on again.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:48.520
Maybe the apron is cursed like the Beast or
came to life like the clock and candle stick.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.850
Inside Out

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.550
When the Anderson family moves to San Francisco,
Riley is not too excited about the big move

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.550
they made.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.350
One reason for her hesitation is because her
room is a little scary.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.310
Her first night in her room she sleeps on
the floor and when lights flow across her

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.730
room they scare her.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.110
As the lights cross the room, take a look
at the open door.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.680
Then in the next shot when her mom walks into
the room she opens the door.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.849
Maybe Riley had a reason to be scared.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.920
Maybe a scarier from Monsters Inc. made her
a visit.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.920
The Lion King

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.670
In the 1994 film, The Lion King the characters
of Timon and Pumba stole the show.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.610
They taught us that hakuna matata means no
worries and that we shouldn’t stress about

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.280
the little things in life.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.439
One little thing in life we shouldn’t worry
about is our costumes or at least we learned

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.560
that from a scene in The Lion King.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.420
When Timon stands with his back to the camera
we see no lei or flowers but when he turns

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.420
around.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.420
Walla!

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.500
He has a lei around his neck and flowers in
his hair, that’s an impressive trick Timon.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.500
Frozen

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.940
Coronation day is a big day for Queen Elsa
but it seems to be an even bigger day for

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.940
Princess Anna.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.609
She’s been locked up in her home for so
long she’s excited to get out and meet people.

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.569
As she sings, “For the First Time in Forever”
she imagines herself in paintings that are

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.840
around her home.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.819
When she walks through the door look at the
painting on the right side of the frame.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.569
When she jumps from this seat and bounces
into that picture we can’t help to wonder

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.319
where that chair came from.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.290
Did she bounce from one room to another room
because there is no chair like that in this

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.060
room?

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.700
Toy Story 2

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.640
It’s common knowledge that if Andy loves
you as a toy he writes his name on the bottom

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.720
of your shoe.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.120
This is what all the toys want because it
means you are part of the group.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.370
When Woody is being repaired and cleaned up
by Geri the Cleaner he repaints Woody’s

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.439
boot covering Andy’s name.

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.629
Later on when Woody is feeling homesick he
rubs off the paint and reveals the name Andy

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.829
again.

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:53.180
This time the name is upside down.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.620
Wreck-It Ralph

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.540
King Candy is the villain in the film Wreck-It
Ralph and he stops at nothing to stop Venelope

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.099
from resetting the game.

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.760
Still, like any good Disney film the villain
loses and Venelope saves the day with the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.969
help of Ralph.

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:11.189
Once she crosses the finish line the game
resets and all the markings of King Candy

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.719
are supposed to be gone.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.579
Later in the segment when Ralph and Venelope
are talking, King Candy’s logo and face

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.120
can be seen at the opening of the track in
the background.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.340
Hercules

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.940
After Hercules saves the day with the help
of his sidekick Phil, all the Gods are excited

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.940
for them.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.320
One God in particular is Hermes, the Olympian
God of herds and flocks.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.790
He must also be the God of magicians because
when he throws flowers to show his appreciation

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.060
of the heroes the flowers are red.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.940
But when Phil catches a flower it is a yellow
flower.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.640
Looks like Hermes is a God of tricks and mischief
as they say.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.070
Zootopia

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.940
Nick Wilde is a sly fox and he gets away with
a lot in the film Zootopia.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.620
He tricks Judy numerous times but only once
by having her step into a slab of concrete.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.720
As they talk the concrete hardens and her
feet are stuck in place.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.760
As her feet get stuck she talks to Nick in
one position but when he leaves and turns

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.590
back to see her she has turned ninety degrees.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.140
Look at the disappointment on Judy’s face,
even she knows the animators made a mistake.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.130
Tangled

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.450
At the end of the film Tangled when Flynn
makes the ultimate sacrifice and cuts Rapunzel’s

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.290
hair take a look at his hand as he brushes
her hair.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.920
It is shackle free but in the next shot his
wrist is bound in a shackle and chains.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.640
We know Flynn is a wanted man but we’re
pretty sure he doesn’t know how to escape

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.830
from shackles.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.390
Looks like just another mistake Flynn made,
but he ultimately gets the girl so he must

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.450
have done something right.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:52.200
There you have it ten Mistakes Disney NEVER
Noticed In Their Movies.
