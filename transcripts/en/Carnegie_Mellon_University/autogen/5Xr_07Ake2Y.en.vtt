Thank You Alison so I wanted to start

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069
Thank You Alison so I wanted to start
 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.999
Thank You Alison so I wanted to start
off by saying coming coming from the

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009
off by saying coming coming from the
 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.859
off by saying coming coming from the
point of view of brain function as a

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869
point of view of brain function as a
 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.199
point of view of brain function as a
biologist and so one of the reasons why

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209
biologist and so one of the reasons why
 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.990
biologist and so one of the reasons why
I love these types of discussions is the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000
I love these types of discussions is the
 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.030
I love these types of discussions is the
brain is really complex it's made up

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040
brain is really complex it's made up
 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.369
brain is really complex it's made up
different cell types so just like we

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379
different cell types so just like we
 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.360
different cell types so just like we
have muscle cells bone cells that

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370
have muscle cells bone cells that
 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.710
have muscle cells bone cells that
perform different functions for example

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720
perform different functions for example
 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.479
perform different functions for example
your muscle cells move your skeleton

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489
your muscle cells move your skeleton
 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.800
your muscle cells move your skeleton
around and your whole body's held

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810
around and your whole body's held
 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.229
around and your whole body's held
together by skin cells the brain is made

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239
together by skin cells the brain is made
 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.780
together by skin cells the brain is made
up of these of different cells that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790
up of these of different cells that
 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.880
up of these of different cells that
perform different functions so we know

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890
perform different functions so we know
 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.550
perform different functions so we know
that we also know that brain neurons are

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560
that we also know that brain neurons are
 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.690
that we also know that brain neurons are
connected to each other

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700
connected to each other
 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.819
connected to each other
some rain neurons are not connected to

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829
some rain neurons are not connected to
 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.789
some rain neurons are not connected to
each other so there's connections

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799
each other so there's connections
 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.380
each other so there's connections
synaptic connections between neurons and

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390
synaptic connections between neurons and
 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.990
synaptic connections between neurons and
also those synaptic connections can be

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000
also those synaptic connections can be
 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.300
also those synaptic connections can be
strong or weak so those are some

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310
strong or weak so those are some
 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.039
strong or weak so those are some
fundamental properties of brains that we

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049
fundamental properties of brains that we
 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.360
fundamental properties of brains that we
know and we know a whole bunch of other

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370
know and we know a whole bunch of other
 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.089
know and we know a whole bunch of other
properties about how proteins and

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099
properties about how proteins and
 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.440
properties about how proteins and
molecules function in individual neurons

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450
molecules function in individual neurons
 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.009
molecules function in individual neurons
given this complexity and kind of

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019
given this complexity and kind of
 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.809
given this complexity and kind of
thinking in terms of what can we learn

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819
thinking in terms of what can we learn
 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.520
thinking in terms of what can we learn
in our lifetime I'm actually a little

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530
in our lifetime I'm actually a little
 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.740
in our lifetime I'm actually a little
pessimistic that we can understand brain

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750
pessimistic that we can understand brain
 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.619
pessimistic that we can understand brain
function in our in our life so then the

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629
function in our in our life so then the
 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.750
function in our in our life so then the
best strategy for my point of view is

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760
best strategy for my point of view is
 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.509
best strategy for my point of view is
actually to come up with what are the

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519
actually to come up with what are the
 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.369
actually to come up with what are the
good strategies to understand the brain

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379
good strategies to understand the brain
 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.699
good strategies to understand the brain
and so as neuroscientists we're normally

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709
and so as neuroscientists we're normally
 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.979
and so as neuroscientists we're normally
open to new ways of thinking about

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989
open to new ways of thinking about
 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.439
open to new ways of thinking about
things in fact computational tools have

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449
things in fact computational tools have
 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.809
things in fact computational tools have
been very helpful and ultimately

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819
been very helpful and ultimately
 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.110
been very helpful and ultimately
algorithmic understanding of things that

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120
algorithmic understanding of things that
 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.089
algorithmic understanding of things that
look like consciousness could really

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099
look like consciousness could really
 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.849
look like consciousness could really
help my research but also you can think

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859
help my research but also you can think
 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.210
help my research but also you can think
of algorithm basis of consciousness as a

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220
of algorithm basis of consciousness as a
 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.610
of algorithm basis of consciousness as a
separate venue which I think we'll hear

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620
separate venue which I think we'll hear
 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.409
separate venue which I think we'll hear
from some of the other speakers so

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419
from some of the other speakers so
 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.809
from some of the other speakers so

some of that micro circuit connectivity
 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.830
some of that micro circuit connectivity
is actually sufficient to predict the

awake so when you're asleep you tend to

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250
awake so when you're asleep you tend to
 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.860
awake so when you're asleep you tend to
have synchronized activity when you're

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870
have synchronized activity when you're
 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.219
have synchronized activity when you're
awake it's less synchronized so we're

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229
awake it's less synchronized so we're
 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:06.510

sound all right so on their review so

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570
sound all right so on their review so

sound all right so on their review so
they have a theory of consciousness

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620
they have a theory of consciousness
 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.490
they have a theory of consciousness
which is called the work space theory

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500
which is called the work space theory
 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.110
which is called the work space theory
and the idea that they want to propose

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120
and the idea that they want to propose
 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.630
and the idea that they want to propose
is that what makes for consciousness is

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:37.640
is that what makes for consciousness is
 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.510
is that what makes for consciousness is
that you broadcast this information

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520
that you broadcast this information

that you broadcast this information
broadly into the brain and that's what

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:43.760
broadly into the brain and that's what
 

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.030
broadly into the brain and that's what
they're inferring from this really

couldn't ask it questions you couldn't
have a conversation with it and so in

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:13.809

following sort of what Wayne was saying

00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:15.129
following sort of what Wayne was saying
 

00:15:15.129 --> 00:15:17.729
following sort of what Wayne was saying
is that a reasonable test of whether

00:15:17.729 --> 00:15:17.739
is that a reasonable test of whether
 

00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:20.159
is that a reasonable test of whether
something is whether that's sort of

00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:20.169
something is whether that's sort of
 

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:23.009
something is whether that's sort of
consciousness or AI so in my lab as I

00:15:23.009 --> 00:15:23.019
consciousness or AI so in my lab as I
 

00:15:23.019 --> 00:15:24.569
consciousness or AI so in my lab as I
said we focus on try to understand

00:15:24.569 --> 00:15:24.579
said we focus on try to understand
 

00:15:24.579 --> 00:15:25.919
said we focus on try to understand
people's behaviors through technologies

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:25.929
people's behaviors through technologies
 

00:15:25.929 --> 00:15:29.759
people's behaviors through technologies
so if we could build at being a some

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:29.769
so if we could build at being a some
 

00:15:29.769 --> 00:15:32.220
so if we could build at being a some
kind of form that could

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:33.690
she said was I am NOT a therapist right
 

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.299
she said was I am NOT a therapist right
and so the whole point of this was

00:22:35.299 --> 00:22:35.309
and so the whole point of this was
 

00:22:35.309 --> 00:22:36.860
and so the whole point of this was
actually to do sort of early screening

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:36.870
actually to do sort of early screening
 

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.509
actually to do sort of early screening
or early detection if there's a problem

00:22:38.509 --> 00:22:38.519
or early detection if there's a problem
 

00:22:38.519 --> 00:22:40.940
or early detection if there's a problem
so I do think that as dave said for

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:40.950
so I do think that as dave said for
 

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.380
so I do think that as dave said for
certain tasks these things definitely

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:42.390
certain tasks these things definitely
 

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.470
certain tasks these things definitely
have their place I might just add to

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480
have their place I might just add to
 

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.379
have their place I might just add to
that that the issue about tasks is

00:22:48.379 --> 00:22:48.389
that that the issue about tasks is
 

00:22:48.389 --> 00:22:50.180
that that the issue about tasks is
really important so if you go back to

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:50.190
really important so if you go back to
 

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.860
really important so if you go back to
Turing's test I mean that's a you might

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:51.870
Turing's test I mean that's a you might
 

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.320
Turing's test I mean that's a you might
think that's a really high bar right

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:54.330
think that's a really high bar right
 

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.789
think that's a really high bar right
being able to carry on this conversation

00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799
being able to carry on this conversation
 

00:22:55.799 --> 00:22:58.009
being able to carry on this conversation
where you can really trick you know a

00:22:58.009 --> 00:22:58.019
where you can really trick you know a
 

00:22:58.019 --> 00:22:59.299
where you can really trick you know a
smart person on the outside

00:22:59.299 --> 00:22:59.309
smart person on the outside
 

00:22:59.309 --> 00:23:01.759
smart person on the outside
interrogating or being a good therapist

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:01.769
interrogating or being a good therapist
 

00:23:01.769 --> 00:23:03.409
interrogating or being a good therapist
and you might say well maybe the way

00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419
and you might say well maybe the way
 

00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:04.549
and you might say well maybe the way
that we should approach these problems

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559
that we should approach these problems
 

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:06.620
that we should approach these problems
is to have a sort of more narrow of you

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:06.630
is to have a sort of more narrow of you
 

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.419
is to have a sort of more narrow of you
so maybe what we should try and do is

00:23:08.419 --> 00:23:08.429
so maybe what we should try and do is
 

00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:11.120
so maybe what we should try and do is
just emulate any kind of therapist even

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.130
just emulate any kind of therapist even
 

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.799
just emulate any kind of therapist even
bad therapist right I mean if you could

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:12.809
bad therapist right I mean if you could
 

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:14.360
bad therapist right I mean if you could
emulate a bad therapist and you

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:14.370
emulate a bad therapist and you
 

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.250
emulate a bad therapist and you
recognize it bad therapist that would be

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260
recognize it bad therapist that would be
 

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.019
recognize it bad therapist that would be
some achievement maybe it would be a lot

00:23:18.019 --> 00:23:18.029
some achievement maybe it would be a lot
 

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:20.299
some achievement maybe it would be a lot
easier than emulating a good one right

00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:20.309
easier than emulating a good one right
 

00:23:20.309 --> 00:23:22.190
easier than emulating a good one right
so how do you define your problems if

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200
so how do you define your problems if
 

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.110
so how do you define your problems if
you're going to go into this business of

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120
you're going to go into this business of
 

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.669
you're going to go into this business of
trying to figure out how say the brain

00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679
trying to figure out how say the brain
 

00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:27.169
trying to figure out how say the brain
gives rise to the mind or how you might

00:23:27.169 --> 00:23:27.179
gives rise to the mind or how you might
 

00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:30.590
gives rise to the mind or how you might
produce an artificial mind having maybe

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600
produce an artificial mind having maybe
 

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.389
produce an artificial mind having maybe
there may be the approach in response to

00:23:32.389 --> 00:23:32.399
there may be the approach in response to
 

00:23:32.399 --> 00:23:34.700
there may be the approach in response to
these I think correct worries is just to

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:34.710
these I think correct worries is just to
 

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.669
these I think correct worries is just to
kind of limit the goal in some ways

00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679
kind of limit the goal in some ways
 

00:23:37.679 --> 00:23:39.320
kind of limit the goal in some ways
right but you don't to go too far right

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:39.330
right but you don't to go too far right
 

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.180
right but you don't to go too far right
as you might say well if I've created

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:41.190
as you might say well if I've created
 

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.639
as you might say well if I've created
some kind of visual detector I've I've

00:23:43.639 --> 00:23:43.649
some kind of visual detector I've I've
 

00:23:43.649 --> 00:23:46.159
some kind of visual detector I've I've

right I mean your cameras then come your

00:23:48.379 --> 00:23:48.389
right I mean your cameras then come your
 

00:23:48.389 --> 00:23:50.659
right I mean your cameras then come your
iPhone camera comes across as a kind of

how do you negotiate that I think that's

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:56.850
how do you negotiate that I think that's
 

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:58.250
how do you negotiate that I think that's
one of the issues probably that we would

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260
one of the issues probably that we would
 

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.970
one of the issues probably that we would
have to if we think that the Turing test

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980
have to if we think that the Turing test
 

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.450
have to if we think that the Turing test
is a bit too high of a par so Sandia I'd

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460
is a bit too high of a par so Sandia I'd
 

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.399
is a bit too high of a par so Sandia I'd
like you to respond to this a little bit

00:24:07.399 --> 00:24:07.409
like you to respond to this a little bit
 

00:24:07.409 --> 00:24:09.019
like you to respond to this a little bit
because you know there's a lot of effort

00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:09.029
because you know there's a lot of effort

because you know there's a lot of effort
that's going into reconstructing in

that's going into reconstructing in
 

00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:14.720
that's going into reconstructing in
great detail the neural circuits of the

and that that is the challenge of you

00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:36.659

what is clear from a vantage point of
 

00:25:42.229 --> 00:25:44.930
what is clear from a vantage point of
somebody doing lots of experiments is is

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940
somebody doing lots of experiments is is
 

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.239
somebody doing lots of experiments is is
one key ingredient is and this also came

00:25:47.239 --> 00:25:47.249
one key ingredient is and this also came
 

00:25:47.249 --> 00:25:49.249
one key ingredient is and this also came
up in the simulations and in fact the

00:25:49.249 --> 00:25:49.259
up in the simulations and in fact the
 

00:25:49.259 --> 00:25:50.719
up in the simulations and in fact the
simulations that you saw a word from

00:25:50.719 --> 00:25:50.729
simulations that you saw a word from
 

00:25:50.729 --> 00:25:53.690
simulations that you saw a word from
this euro project is that one neuron

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.700
this euro project is that one neuron
 

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:58.159
this euro project is that one neuron
appears to partake in different ensemble

00:25:58.159 --> 00:25:58.169
appears to partake in different ensemble
 

00:25:58.169 --> 00:26:00.199
appears to partake in different ensemble
activities and this is something that we

00:26:00.199 --> 00:26:00.209
activities and this is something that we
 

00:26:00.209 --> 00:26:02.479
activities and this is something that we
also see in in the lab and so how do you

00:26:02.479 --> 00:26:02.489
also see in in the lab and so how do you
 

00:26:02.489 --> 00:26:04.190
also see in in the lab and so how do you
have this multiplexing of neural

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200
have this multiplexing of neural
 

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.279
have this multiplexing of neural
function to understand that the next

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:07.289
function to understand that the next
 

00:26:07.289 --> 00:26:09.469
function to understand that the next
thing we need to do experimentally is to

00:26:09.469 --> 00:26:09.479
thing we need to do experimentally is to
 

00:26:09.479 --> 00:26:11.209
thing we need to do experimentally is to
actually measure many behavioral

00:26:11.209 --> 00:26:11.219
actually measure many behavioral
 

00:26:11.219 --> 00:26:13.639
actually measure many behavioral
parameters at the same time so sort of

00:26:13.639 --> 00:26:13.649
parameters at the same time so sort of
 

00:26:13.649 --> 00:26:15.499
parameters at the same time so sort of
the ideal experiment right now in the

00:26:15.499 --> 00:26:15.509
the ideal experiment right now in the
 

00:26:15.509 --> 00:26:19.519

00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299
want to be able to do in her case is fix
 

00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:05.629
want to be able to do in her case is fix
her broken brain to bring her back to a

00:30:05.629 --> 00:30:05.639
her broken brain to bring her back to a
 

00:30:05.639 --> 00:30:07.700
her broken brain to bring her back to a
healthy brain and that means you

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:07.710
healthy brain and that means you
 

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:08.869
healthy brain and that means you
actually have to know what you're doing

00:30:08.869 --> 00:30:08.879
actually have to know what you're doing
 

00:30:08.879 --> 00:30:10.519
actually have to know what you're doing
right as opposed to just having a really

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:10.529
right as opposed to just having a really
 

00:30:10.529 --> 00:30:12.470
right as opposed to just having a really
big simulator if you had enough euros

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480
big simulator if you had enough euros
 

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.990
big simulator if you had enough euros
and a patient enough European Union

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000
and a patient enough European Union
 

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.159
and a patient enough European Union
right you could just keep pumping money

00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:16.169
right you could just keep pumping money
 

00:30:16.169 --> 00:30:17.450
right you could just keep pumping money
into it so you had this huge

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:17.460
into it so you had this huge
 

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.369
into it so you had this huge
supercomputer and if you only knew

00:30:19.369 --> 00:30:19.379
supercomputer and if you only knew
 

00:30:19.379 --> 00:30:20.690
supercomputer and if you only knew
physics and knew nothing about how

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700
physics and knew nothing about how
 

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.399
physics and knew nothing about how
brains worked but you had a good enough

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:22.409
brains worked but you had a good enough
 

00:30:22.409 --> 00:30:23.869
brains worked but you had a good enough
electron microscope and a big enough

00:30:23.869 --> 00:30:23.879
electron microscope and a big enough
 

00:30:23.879 --> 00:30:25.009
electron microscope and a big enough
supercomputer you could imagine

00:30:25.009 --> 00:30:25.019
supercomputer you could imagine
 

00:30:25.019 --> 00:30:27.889
supercomputer you could imagine
simulating her diseased brain but if you

00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899
simulating her diseased brain but if you
 

00:30:27.899 --> 00:30:29.720
simulating her diseased brain but if you
want to fix her diseased brain so it's

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:29.730
want to fix her diseased brain so it's
 

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.149
want to fix her diseased brain so it's
not diseased anymore now yeah it you

00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159
not diseased anymore now yeah it you
 

00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:33.950
not diseased anymore now yeah it you
have to know how brains work right and

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960
have to know how brains work right and
 

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.450
have to know how brains work right and
that's in my opinion centuries off at

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460
that's in my opinion centuries off at
 

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.840
that's in my opinion centuries off at
best you want to add anything to that

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:41.850
best you want to add anything to that
 

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.749
best you want to add anything to that
I guess just on the last plate I mean I

00:30:44.749 --> 00:30:44.759
I guess just on the last plate I mean I
 

00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:45.560
I guess just on the last plate I mean I
think you bring up an interesting

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:45.570
think you bring up an interesting
 

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:50.269
think you bring up an interesting
question is it harder to fix a brain a

00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279
question is it harder to fix a brain a
 

00:30:50.279 --> 00:30:52.490
question is it harder to fix a brain a
broken brain than to construct one I

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:52.500
broken brain than to construct one I
 

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.080
broken brain than to construct one I
don't know if you've ever worked with

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:54.090
don't know if you've ever worked with
 

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.990
don't know if you've ever worked with
somebody's code it's kind of easier to

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000
somebody's code it's kind of easier to
 

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.960
somebody's code it's kind of easier to
make a new code but on the other hand it

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:02.970
make a new code but on the other hand it
 

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.270
make a new code but on the other hand it
in you know

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:05.280
in you know
 

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.540
in you know
epilepsy it actually on some level you

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:08.550
epilepsy it actually on some level you
 

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.250
epilepsy it actually on some level you
don't have to understand the brain and

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260
don't have to understand the brain and
 

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.980
don't have to understand the brain and
they can actually take out chunks of

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:12.990
they can actually take out chunks of
 

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.960
they can actually take out chunks of
brain and because there's extreme

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:14.970
brain and because there's extreme
 

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.870
brain and because there's extreme
plasticity or adaptability of the brain

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880
plasticity or adaptability of the brain
 

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.590
plasticity or adaptability of the brain
it fixes itself so maybe it is it easier

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600
it fixes itself so maybe it is it easier
 

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.080
it fixes itself so maybe it is it easier
problem actually to fix a brain if you

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:24.090
problem actually to fix a brain if you
 

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:28.930
problem actually to fix a brain if you
can harness these these plasticity so

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:28.940
 

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.220
when you refer to something in your

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:31.230
when you refer to something in your
 

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.960
when you refer to something in your
slides about you had a nice slide with a

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:32.970
slides about you had a nice slide with a
 

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.060
slides about you had a nice slide with a
brain on one side and a circuit board on

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:35.070
brain on one side and a circuit board on
 

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:38.660
brain on one side and a circuit board on
the other so there's the idea that we

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:38.670
the other so there's the idea that we
 

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.190
the other so there's the idea that we
might see all the circuits we could

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200
might see all the circuits we could
 

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.510
might see all the circuits we could
reconstruct all the circuits for

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520
reconstruct all the circuits for
 

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.820
reconstruct all the circuits for
somebody and and then perhaps that would

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:43.830
somebody and and then perhaps that would
 

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:46.460
somebody and and then perhaps that would
be sufficient to give us some insight

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:46.470
be sufficient to give us some insight
 

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.470
be sufficient to give us some insight
into their cognitive processes but you

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480
into their cognitive processes but you
 

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.910
into their cognitive processes but you
made this distinction between the

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:49.920
made this distinction between the
 

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.060
made this distinction between the
circuits and the minds can you tell me -

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:53.070
circuits and the minds can you tell me -
 

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:55.400
circuits and the minds can you tell me -
tell us elaborate that on that a little

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:55.410
tell us elaborate that on that a little
 

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.560
tell us elaborate that on that a little
bit so even if we get the circuits

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:57.570
bit so even if we get the circuits
 

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:03.680
bit so even if we get the circuits
what's different about the mind so in

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:03.690
what's different about the mind so in
 

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.420
what's different about the mind so in
that first slide that I showed you the

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:05.430
that first slide that I showed you the
 

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.450
that first slide that I showed you the
thought was no it's okay if you remember

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460
thought was no it's okay if you remember
 

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.400
thought was no it's okay if you remember
the two brains right so the thought was

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:10.410
the two brains right so the thought was
 

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.980
the two brains right so the thought was
that not all circuitry is going to give

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:12.990
that not all circuitry is going to give
 

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.620
that not all circuitry is going to give
rise to a mind or consciousness and so

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:15.630
rise to a mind or consciousness and so
 

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.420
rise to a mind or consciousness and so
there's one question what's special

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:17.430
there's one question what's special
 

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:21.020
there's one question what's special
about certain circuits because you don't

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:21.030
about certain circuits because you don't
 

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.290
about certain circuits because you don't
you know go from you can't just read off

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:24.300
you know go from you can't just read off
 

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.770
you know go from you can't just read off
if you'd like brain circuitry and say oh

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:26.780
if you'd like brain circuitry and say oh
 

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.300
if you'd like brain circuitry and say oh
we have consciousness there right sir

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:29.310
we have consciousness there right sir
 

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:30.770
we have consciousness there right sir
well it's a very hard problem to

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:30.780
well it's a very hard problem to
 

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.080
well it's a very hard problem to
understand how to show those connections

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:33.090
understand how to show those connections
 

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:34.790
understand how to show those connections
in a way that's informative you can

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:34.800
in a way that's informative you can
 

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.010
in a way that's informative you can
understand why there's a mind there so

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020
understand why there's a mind there so
 

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.890
understand why there's a mind there so
in that sense brain doesn't equal mind

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:39.900
in that sense brain doesn't equal mind
 

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.450
in that sense brain doesn't equal mind
because certain parts of the brain don't

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460
because certain parts of the brain don't
 

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.150
because certain parts of the brain don't
give rise to the mind that of course

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:44.160
give rise to the mind that of course
 

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.600
give rise to the mind that of course
file is consistent saying what obligate

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:47.610
file is consistent saying what obligate
 

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:49.090
file is consistent saying what obligate
which is I think most of us believe

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:49.100
which is I think most of us believe
 

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.380
which is I think most of us believe
which is of course the brain of the mind

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:51.390
which is of course the brain of the mind
 

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.650
which is of course the brain of the mind
is dependent on the brain you know I

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:54.660
is dependent on the brain you know I
 

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.540
is dependent on the brain you know I
think in these sort of reconstruction

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:56.550
think in these sort of reconstruction
 

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.730
think in these sort of reconstruction
ideas the idea of preserving brain

00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740
ideas the idea of preserving brain
 

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.500
ideas the idea of preserving brain
function and hoping that in the future

someone can reconstruct your mind you

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:05.280
someone can reconstruct your mind you
 

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.340
someone can reconstruct your mind you
know it does bring us back to the

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:07.350
know it does bring us back to the
 

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:10.100
know it does bring us back to the
Turing's test and sort of how you would

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:10.110
Turing's test and sort of how you would
 

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.740
Turing's test and sort of how you would
know that you've been successful because

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:12.750
know that you've been successful because
 

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.390
know that you've been successful because
you've physically duplicated the brain

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:14.400
you've physically duplicated the brain
 

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.669
you've physically duplicated the brain
that's sufficient to get right give rise

00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679
that's sufficient to get right give rise
 

00:33:16.679 --> 00:33:18.140
that's sufficient to get right give rise
to the same mind

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:18.150
to the same mind
 

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:20.510
to the same mind
is it sufficient to give rise to a mind

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:20.520
is it sufficient to give rise to a mind
 

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.580
is it sufficient to give rise to a mind
let's say that the technology requires

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:22.590
let's say that the technology requires

let's say that the technology requires
not that we do it in organic materials

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:24.540
not that we do it in organic materials
 

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.990
not that we do it in organic materials
but it's a lot easier to do it in

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000
but it's a lot easier to do it in
 

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.400
but it's a lot easier to do it in
organic materials and you know the same

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:28.410
organic materials and you know the same
 

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:30.050
organic materials and you know the same
questions are going to rise so I think

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:30.060
questions are going to rise so I think
 

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.930
questions are going to rise so I think
that's the gap right about thinking

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:32.940
that's the gap right about thinking
 

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.810
that's the gap right about thinking
about a physical system like a circuit

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:35.820
about a physical system like a circuit
 

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.120
about a physical system like a circuit

are some clues another another clue is
actually in the visual system you are

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:32.070
actually in the visual system you are
 

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.220
actually in the visual system you are
getting light information that goes to

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:34.230
getting light information that goes to
 

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.310
getting light information that goes to
your unconscious brain your hypothalamus

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320
your unconscious brain your hypothalamus
 

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.500
your unconscious brain your hypothalamus
about light levels and that's what in

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:39.510
about light levels and that's what in
 

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.480
about light levels and that's what in
trains our circadian rhythms when we

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:41.490
trains our circadian rhythms when we
 

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:43.460
trains our circadian rhythms when we
literally have a little biological clock

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:43.470
literally have a little biological clock

so if you're late at night getting blue

00:37:47.299 --> 00:37:47.309
so if you're late at night getting blue
 

00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:49.599
so if you're late at night getting blue
light from from your computer screens

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:49.609
light from from your computer screens
 

00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:52.279

kind of crazy thing they can think of
 

00:39:39.389 --> 00:39:41.359
kind of crazy thing they can think of
and then hoping that the neuroscientist

00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:41.369
and then hoping that the neuroscientist
 

00:39:41.369 --> 00:39:43.759
and then hoping that the neuroscientist
can can use that language to talk about

00:39:43.759 --> 00:39:43.769
can can use that language to talk about

think it's important to remember that

00:39:47.959 --> 00:39:47.969
think it's important to remember that
 

00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:50.089
think it's important to remember that
you know brains are biological systems

00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099
you know brains are biological systems
 

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:52.009
you know brains are biological systems
that evolved with lots of constraints

and so the way they do things may not be

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880
and so the way they do things may not be
 

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:58.579
and so the way they do things may not be
the best way to accomplish cognition it

00:39:58.579 --> 00:39:58.589
the best way to accomplish cognition it
 

00:39:58.589 --> 00:39:59.480
the best way to accomplish cognition it
just is the

00:39:59.480 --> 00:39:59.490
just is the
 

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:01.040
just is the
local minima that they've settled into

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:01.050
local minima that they've settled into
 

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:04.280
local minima that they've settled into
and so it might it might be that there's

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:04.290
and so it might it might be that there's
 

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.859
and so it might it might be that there's
inspiration from the biology but it

00:40:06.859 --> 00:40:06.869
inspiration from the biology but it
 

00:40:06.869 --> 00:40:08.810
inspiration from the biology but it
might also be that the biology will lead

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:08.820
might also be that the biology will lead
 

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.080
might also be that the biology will lead
you down some some false roads and that

it then it's a mine but it's not really
 

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.560
it then it's a mine but it's not really
her so these are really hard questions

social interactions and I think those

it's how to even just get to that point

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:57.310
it's how to even just get to that point
 

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:59.820
it's how to even just get to that point
where you think you might but it's got

where you think you might but it's got
 

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:01.440
where you think you might but it's got
broader ramifications and I think that's

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:01.450
broader ramifications and I think that's
 

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:04.590
broader ramifications and I think that's
important too soon so I'd like to take

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:04.600
important too soon so I'd like to take
 

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.560
important too soon so I'd like to take
this opportunity now to let people in

this opportunity now to let people in
 

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:09.330
this opportunity now to let people in
the audience ask questions and I think

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:09.340
the audience ask questions and I think
 

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.859
the audience ask questions and I think
we can pass her on the mic just so that

really fascinating stuff so my question
 

00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:34.120
really fascinating stuff so my question
is sort of I killed on the last set of

is sort of I killed on the last set of
 

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:37.030
is sort of I killed on the last set of
comments and thinking about the you look

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040
comments and thinking about the you look
 

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.950
comments and thinking about the you look
at a brain or you look at a computer and

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960
at a brain or you look at a computer and
 

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.720
at a brain or you look at a computer and
from the outside you couldn't possibly

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:40.730
from the outside you couldn't possibly
 

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.910
from the outside you couldn't possibly
know what's going on and it's kind of a

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920
know what's going on and it's kind of a
 

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.300
know what's going on and it's kind of a
an issue of accumulated experience over

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:46.310
an issue of accumulated experience over
 

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:47.410
an issue of accumulated experience over
time that's what makes us all

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:47.420
time that's what makes us all
 

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.450
time that's what makes us all
individuals so I'm wondering if you

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:49.460
individuals so I'm wondering if you
 

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.710
individuals so I'm wondering if you
could address something about this is

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720
could address something about this is
 

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:54.180
could address something about this is
more really for the neuroscientists is

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:54.190
more really for the neuroscientists is
 

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:57.370
more really for the neuroscientists is
that accumulated experience something

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:57.380
that accumulated experience something
 

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:00.099
that accumulated experience something
that is being explored do we understand

00:45:00.099 --> 00:45:00.109
that is being explored do we understand
 

00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:04.930
that is being explored do we understand
how a brain in a mind develops based on

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:04.940
how a brain in a mind develops based on
 

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.180
how a brain in a mind develops based on
what they're exposed to over the court

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:07.190
what they're exposed to over the court
 

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:10.390
what they're exposed to over the court
life history of their experience to

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400
life history of their experience to
 

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.890
life history of their experience to
understand how memory works do we

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:11.900
understand how memory works do we
 

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.200
understand how memory works do we
understand how these kind of things can

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:14.210
understand how these kind of things can
 

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:15.819
understand how these kind of things can
be recalled to do we have two rats that

00:45:15.819 --> 00:45:15.829
be recalled to do we have two rats that
 

00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:17.800
be recalled to do we have two rats that
have exactly the same experiences and

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:17.810
have exactly the same experiences and
 

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:27.250
have exactly the same experiences and
have exactly the same brain there's kind

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:27.260
have exactly the same brain there's kind
 

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.760
have exactly the same brain there's kind
of two fields of studies that are

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:29.770
of two fields of studies that are
 

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:32.260
of two fields of studies that are
addressing that one is something called

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:32.270
addressing that one is something called
 

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:34.750
addressing that one is something called
critical period plasticity this idea

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:34.760
critical period plasticity this idea
 

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.210
critical period plasticity this idea
that your early life experiences during

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:37.220
that your early life experiences during
 

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.190
that your early life experiences during
this especially in particular when

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200
this especially in particular when
 

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.530
this especially in particular when
you're young have a very potent impact

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:41.540
you're young have a very potent impact
 

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:45.670
you're young have a very potent impact
on brain function and Wilkin based on

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680
on brain function and Wilkin based on
 

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.240
on brain function and Wilkin based on
how that impact is you will further set

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:49.250
how that impact is you will further set
 

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:52.630
how that impact is you will further set
kind of your lifelong learning and yeah

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640
kind of your lifelong learning and yeah
 

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.970
kind of your lifelong learning and yeah
there's research going on here and many

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:54.980
there's research going on here and many
 

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.650
there's research going on here and many
universities on this critical period

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:56.660
universities on this critical period
 

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.500
universities on this critical period
plasticity in terms of memory that's

00:45:59.500 --> 00:45:59.510
plasticity in terms of memory that's
 

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:01.569
plasticity in terms of memory that's
typically studied unfortunately

00:46:01.569 --> 00:46:01.579
typically studied unfortunately
 

00:46:01.579 --> 00:46:03.490
typically studied unfortunately
fortunately by a different set of

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:03.500
fortunately by a different set of
 

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.130
fortunately by a different set of
neuroscientists and that's thought to a

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:06.140
neuroscientists and that's thought to a
 

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.290
neuroscientists and that's thought to a
lot of attention is put into the

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:08.300
lot of attention is put into the
 

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.329
lot of attention is put into the
hippocampus a specific brain region and

00:46:10.329 --> 00:46:10.339
hippocampus a specific brain region and
 

00:46:10.339 --> 00:46:13.660
hippocampus a specific brain region and
understanding how you first recognize

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:13.670
understanding how you first recognize
 

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:16.720
understanding how you first recognize
kind of a novel scenario you store that

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:16.730
kind of a novel scenario you store that
 

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:19.030
kind of a novel scenario you store that
information and then you have to

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040
information and then you have to
 

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.250
information and then you have to
consolidate and ship that information

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:21.260
consolidate and ship that information
 

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:22.780
consolidate and ship that information
into different brain areas so it's a

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:22.790
into different brain areas so it's a
 

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:25.210
into different brain areas so it's a
quite a bit of work is going on on those

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:25.220
quite a bit of work is going on on those
 

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.150
quite a bit of work is going on on those
levels yeah I would just add I think one

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160
levels yeah I would just add I think one
 

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.640
levels yeah I would just add I think one
of the really interesting things about

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:29.650
of the really interesting things about
 

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:33.430
of the really interesting things about
trying to see the physical changes that

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440
trying to see the physical changes that
 

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.350
trying to see the physical changes that
happen

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:34.360
happen
 

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.350
happen
in memory for example requires not only

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:37.360
in memory for example requires not only
 

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.390
in memory for example requires not only
a structural understanding of how

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400
a structural understanding of how
 

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.830
a structural understanding of how
neurons talk to each other

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:40.840
neurons talk to each other
 

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.780
neurons talk to each other
but there's a number of other dynamic

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:42.790
but there's a number of other dynamic
 

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:44.660
but there's a number of other dynamic
things that are happening for example

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:44.670
things that are happening for example
 

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:47.580
things that are happening for example
sandy mentioned circadian rhythms right

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:47.590
sandy mentioned circadian rhythms right
 

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:48.870
sandy mentioned circadian rhythms right
you have all these sort of hormonal

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880
you have all these sort of hormonal
 

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.350
you have all these sort of hormonal

modifications to DNA that change the

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:54.580
modifications to DNA that change the
 

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.030
modifications to DNA that change the
responsibility of a cell and so it's the

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040
responsibility of a cell and so it's the
 

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.220
responsibility of a cell and so it's the
information is not just contained in the

00:46:59.220 --> 00:46:59.230
information is not just contained in the
 

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:01.680
information is not just contained in the
structure it's contained in the dynamics

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:01.690
structure it's contained in the dynamics
 

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.890
structure it's contained in the dynamics
as well and so it might be that to

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:04.900
as well and so it might be that to
 

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.010
as well and so it might be that to
capture all of that you need not only a

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:08.020
capture all of that you need not only a
 

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.070
capture all of that you need not only a
physical anatomical circuit sort of

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:11.080
physical anatomical circuit sort of
 

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.350
physical anatomical circuit sort of
diagram but you also need to know

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:13.360
diagram but you also need to know
 

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.600
diagram but you also need to know
something about how those pieces worked

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:15.610
something about how those pieces worked
 

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:17.250
something about how those pieces worked
with each other which can be very

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:17.260
with each other which can be very
 

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:23.210
with each other which can be very
individual other questions that's it

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220
individual other questions that's it
 

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:27.090
individual other questions that's it
yeah I just follow on your last comments

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:27.100
yeah I just follow on your last comments
 

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.630
yeah I just follow on your last comments
and I think currently we are assuming

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640
and I think currently we are assuming
 

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.610
and I think currently we are assuming
everything on a deterministic framework

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:34.620
everything on a deterministic framework
 

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.140
everything on a deterministic framework
so essentially we're thinking of four

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:37.150
so essentially we're thinking of four
 

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:40.230
so essentially we're thinking of four
connectivity's determines where the

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240
connectivity's determines where the
 

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.240
connectivity's determines where the
consciousness come from but what if

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:42.250
consciousness come from but what if
 

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:46.110
consciousness come from but what if
that's not the case what if the is a

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:46.120
that's not the case what if the is a
 

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.670
that's not the case what if the is a
dynamic as the moderator just point out

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680
dynamic as the moderator just point out
 

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.010
dynamic as the moderator just point out
that conscious where the consciousness

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:53.020
that conscious where the consciousness
 

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.280
that conscious where the consciousness
come from then all the brain circuitry

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:56.290
come from then all the brain circuitry
 

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:59.520
come from then all the brain circuitry
and hoping that the circuitry were

00:47:59.520 --> 00:47:59.530
and hoping that the circuitry were
 

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:02.250
and hoping that the circuitry were
determined where the memory forms it's

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:02.260
determined where the memory forms it's
 

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.530
determined where the memory forms it's
always the role of window and it doesn't

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:04.540
always the role of window and it doesn't
 

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:05.720
always the role of window and it doesn't
work that way

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:05.730
work that way
 

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:07.980
work that way
III think this is a question for Wayne

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:07.990
III think this is a question for Wayne
 

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.350
III think this is a question for Wayne
really sort of Cartesian you know can we

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:10.360
really sort of Cartesian you know can we
 

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.040
really sort of Cartesian you know can we
can we take the brain and extract from

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:14.050
can we take the brain and extract from
 

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:15.240
can we take the brain and extract from
that something that's sort of more

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:15.250
that something that's sort of more
 

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:24.210
that something that's sort of more
dynamic was it a question for me well so

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:24.220
dynamic was it a question for me well so
 

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.890
dynamic was it a question for me well so
the thought was I guess if I understand

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:25.900
the thought was I guess if I understand
 

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.780
the thought was I guess if I understand
we've been focusing on something more

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:27.790
we've been focusing on something more
 

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:31.500
we've been focusing on something more
static in a sense of connections and the

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:31.510
static in a sense of connections and the
 

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:33.300
static in a sense of connections and the
thought was that if you could reproduce

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:33.310
thought was that if you could reproduce
 

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.840
thought was that if you could reproduce
that that would be enough to reproduce

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:35.850
that that would be enough to reproduce
 

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:37.950
that that would be enough to reproduce
consciousness and then the alternative

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:37.960
consciousness and then the alternative
 

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.440
consciousness and then the alternative
think thought was that well you have to

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:40.450
think thought was that well you have to
 

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:41.910
think thought was that well you have to
think about the dynamic aspects of it

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920
think about the dynamic aspects of it
 

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.040
think about the dynamic aspects of it
and that might not follow from simply

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:44.050
and that might not follow from simply
 

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:45.290
and that might not follow from simply
just looking at the connections

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300
just looking at the connections
 

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.200
just looking at the connections
something to that effect

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:48.210
something to that effect
 

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:49.880
something to that effect
that might be right I mean this question

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:49.890
that might be right I mean this question
 

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:53.000
that might be right I mean this question
about going from either these two cases

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:53.010
about going from either these two cases
 

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.940
about going from either these two cases
to consciousness and the mind I think

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:55.950
to consciousness and the mind I think
 

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:58.280
to consciousness and the mind I think
what I meant earlier when I said you

00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:58.290
what I meant earlier when I said you
 

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:01.040
what I meant earlier when I said you
know those bridges are not so clear it's

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:01.050
know those bridges are not so clear it's
 

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:02.780
know those bridges are not so clear it's
partly informed by these you know three

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:02.790
partly informed by these you know three
 

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:05.630
partly informed by these you know three
possibilities right it's not going to be

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640
possibilities right it's not going to be
 

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.640
possibilities right it's not going to be
easy to answer how something like

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:07.650
easy to answer how something like
 

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:10.460
easy to answer how something like
consciousness comes about it may be that

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:10.470
consciousness comes about it may be that
 

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.260
consciousness comes about it may be that
thinking to statically about it may not

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:12.270
thinking to statically about it may not
 

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:13.550
thinking to statically about it may not
be the right way to go about it so in

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:13.560
be the right way to go about it so in
 

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.020
be the right way to go about it so in
that sense I agree I think I think the

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:15.030
that sense I agree I think I think the
 

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:17.210
that sense I agree I think I think the
possibility is how to explain how you

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:17.220
possibility is how to explain how you
 

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.950
possibility is how to explain how you
get a mind or consciousness from a

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960
get a mind or consciousness from a
 

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.810
get a mind or consciousness from a
physical structure like out of these two

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:20.820
physical structure like out of these two
 

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:22.579
physical structure like out of these two
cases I think it's an open question so I

00:49:22.579 --> 00:49:22.589
cases I think it's an open question so I
 

00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:23.870
cases I think it's an open question so I
think that's right I'm at least we

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880
think that's right I'm at least we
 

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:30.170
think that's right I'm at least we
should be open to these alternatives so

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180
should be open to these alternatives so
 

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.660
should be open to these alternatives so
I have a point and a question well so

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:32.670

it so I think if we're studying

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720
it so I think if we're studying
 

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.180
it so I think if we're studying
consciousness which seems kind of

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:41.190
consciousness which seems kind of
 

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:42.830
consciousness which seems kind of
ineffable in some ways because it's

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:42.840
ineffable in some ways because it's
 

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.150
ineffable in some ways because it's
really hard to describe no one's got a

definition of it it might be enough that
you can track it so if you want to study

00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:49.609
you can track it so if you want to study
 

00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:53.150
you can track it so if you want to study
imagery some of you have studied all

right as long as you can generate images

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:54.740
right as long as you can generate images
 

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.960
right as long as you can generate images
consistently and you can report that

that might be enough to get at that

00:51:59.660 --> 00:51:59.670
that might be enough to get at that
 

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:05.020
that might be enough to get at that
right at least to see coral it's so

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:05.030
right at least to see coral it's so

for that but I think you're right I mean
 

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.120

know good work and connecting then the
brain or artificial sir yeah systems to

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:22.530
brain or artificial sir yeah systems to
 

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:24.680

that I don't have an answer that Jim but

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:24.690
that I don't have an answer that Jim but
 

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:25.940
that I don't have an answer that Jim but
I think it's good to highlight that

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:25.950
I think it's good to highlight that
 

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:28.820
I think it's good to highlight that
that's part of the major challenge that

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:28.830
that's part of the major challenge that
 

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:30.380
that's part of the major challenge that
question over here I think is the money

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:30.390
question over here I think is the money
 

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:36.560
question over here I think is the money
yes this is certainly this is a pull up

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:36.570
yes this is certainly this is a pull up
 

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:37.970
yes this is certainly this is a pull up
and I hope you'll forgive me I will

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:37.980
and I hope you'll forgive me I will
 

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:42.050
and I hope you'll forgive me I will
formulate my question um is this better

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:42.060
formulate my question um is this better
 

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:44.450
formulate my question um is this better
yeah okay so I'm gonna formulate my

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460
yeah okay so I'm gonna formulate my
 

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:47.270
yeah okay so I'm gonna formulate my
question on the fly and I'll also first

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280
question on the fly and I'll also first
 

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.520
question on the fly and I'll also first
make a point and then ask a question

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:49.530
make a point and then ask a question
 

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:51.830
make a point and then ask a question
it'll be easier for me this way so

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:51.840
it'll be easier for me this way so
 

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.870
it'll be easier for me this way so
regarding the Turing test one of the

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880
regarding the Turing test one of the
 

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.609
regarding the Turing test one of the
things that always have bothered me

00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619
things that always have bothered me
 

00:52:55.619 --> 00:52:58.730
things that always have bothered me
about it is not so much the machines

00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.740
about it is not so much the machines
 

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.530
about it is not so much the machines
that do not pass the test that human

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540
that do not pass the test that human
 

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:03.950
that do not pass the test that human
beings like let's say human being

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960

doesn't pass the Turing test what does

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:05.730
doesn't pass the Turing test what does
 

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.460
doesn't pass the Turing test what does
this mean I mean I'm sure that there are

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:07.470
this mean I mean I'm sure that there are
 

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:09.410
this mean I mean I'm sure that there are
plenty of them that do not and then what

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:09.420
plenty of them that do not and then what
 

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.720
plenty of them that do not and then what
does this mean do they not have mind the

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:11.730
does this mean do they not have mind the
 

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:14.330
does this mean do they not have mind the
consciousness and then starting to think

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:14.340
consciousness and then starting to think
 

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:15.059
consciousness and then starting to think
about this a bit

00:53:15.059 --> 00:53:15.069
about this a bit
 

00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:18.709
about this a bit
more we're using these constructs like

00:53:18.709 --> 00:53:18.719
more we're using these constructs like
 

00:53:18.719 --> 00:53:22.589
more we're using these constructs like
memory perception but there are

00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599
memory perception but there are
 

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:24.779
memory perception but there are
individuals for example who lose all of

individuals for example who lose all of
 

00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:26.880
individuals for example who lose all of
their memory and there are individuals

who for example do not have visual
 

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.930
who for example do not have visual
perception at least sometimes they do

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:30.940
perception at least sometimes they do
 

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:34.499
perception at least sometimes they do
not have even tactile perception but

00:53:34.499 --> 00:53:34.509
not have even tactile perception but
 

00:53:34.509 --> 00:53:37.289
not have even tactile perception but
they could potentially still be aware

00:53:37.289 --> 00:53:37.299
they could potentially still be aware
 

00:53:37.299 --> 00:53:39.359
they could potentially still be aware
right there could still be consciousness

00:53:39.359 --> 00:53:39.369
right there could still be consciousness
 

00:53:39.369 --> 00:53:42.120
right there could still be consciousness
there and from Phylis so both

memory of specific events so what's left
 

00:54:08.559 --> 00:54:14.189
memory of specific events so what's left
then guess that's my question so it's

00:54:14.189 --> 00:54:14.199
then guess that's my question so it's
 

00:54:14.199 --> 00:54:17.749
then guess that's my question so it's
it's not clear that a human being who

00:54:17.749 --> 00:54:17.759
it's not clear that a human being who
 

00:54:17.759 --> 00:54:21.209
it's not clear that a human being who
never had any sensory input would be

00:54:21.209 --> 00:54:21.219
never had any sensory input would be
 

00:54:21.219 --> 00:54:24.299
never had any sensory input would be
recognizable as human people who in

boat they stole their minds were formed

00:54:32.099 --> 00:54:32.109
boat they stole their minds were formed
 

00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:34.799
boat they stole their minds were formed
by their sensory experiences and so then

00:54:34.799 --> 00:54:34.809
by their sensory experiences and so then
 

00:54:34.809 --> 00:54:35.939
by their sensory experiences and so then
you can say well they're you know

00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:35.949
you can say well they're you know
 

00:54:35.949 --> 00:54:37.589
you can say well they're you know
they're aware they just can't

00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599
they're aware they just can't
 

00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:38.999
they're aware they just can't
communicate at least through those

00:54:38.999 --> 00:54:39.009
communicate at least through those
 

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:42.390
communicate at least through those
modalities but if you took something if

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400
modalities but if you took something if
 

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.670
modalities but if you took something if
you took a human baby and this is a

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.680
you took a human baby and this is a
 

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.650
you took a human baby and this is a
horrible thing to think about and

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:46.660
horrible thing to think about and
 

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.349
horrible thing to think about and
disconnected it from sensory input it's

00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359
disconnected it from sensory input it's
 

00:54:49.359 --> 00:54:52.259
disconnected it from sensory input it's
unlikely that it would even survive

00:54:52.259 --> 00:54:52.269
unlikely that it would even survive
 

00:54:52.269 --> 00:54:54.839
unlikely that it would even survive
right and if it did if you were able to

00:54:54.839 --> 00:54:54.849
right and if it did if you were able to
 

00:54:54.849 --> 00:54:56.339
right and if it did if you were able to
keep it alive it's unlikely that would

00:54:56.339 --> 00:54:56.349
keep it alive it's unlikely that would
 

00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:57.959
keep it alive it's unlikely that would
develop in a way that we'd be

00:54:57.959 --> 00:54:57.969
develop in a way that we'd be
 

00:54:57.969 --> 00:55:01.829
develop in a way that we'd be
recognizably human so I'm not sure it

00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839
recognizably human so I'm not sure it
 

00:55:01.839 --> 00:55:03.959
recognizably human so I'm not sure it
makes sense to say that somebody could

00:55:03.959 --> 00:55:03.969
makes sense to say that somebody could
 

00:55:03.969 --> 00:55:05.219
makes sense to say that somebody could
fail the Turing test because they're

00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:05.229
fail the Turing test because they're
 

00:55:05.229 --> 00:55:07.319
fail the Turing test because they're
they're blind or deaf well the Turing

00:55:07.319 --> 00:55:07.329
they're blind or deaf well the Turing
 

00:55:07.329 --> 00:55:09.779
they're blind or deaf well the Turing
test is just it's a suggestive of a way

00:55:09.779 --> 00:55:09.789
test is just it's a suggestive of a way
 

00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:12.959
test is just it's a suggestive of a way
of demonstrating mental capacity right

00:55:12.959 --> 00:55:12.969
of demonstrating mental capacity right
 

00:55:12.969 --> 00:55:14.699
of demonstrating mental capacity right
and if you if you can't see well then

00:55:14.699 --> 00:55:14.709
and if you if you can't see well then
 

00:55:14.709 --> 00:55:16.620
and if you if you can't see well then
we'll give you the test or auditorally

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:16.630
we'll give you the test or auditorally
 

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:18.359
we'll give you the test or auditorally
and if you can't see we're here then

00:55:18.359 --> 00:55:18.369
and if you can't see we're here then
 

00:55:18.369 --> 00:55:20.099
and if you can't see we're here then
we'll do it by tapping on your skin

00:55:20.099 --> 00:55:20.109
we'll do it by tapping on your skin
 

00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:21.900
we'll do it by tapping on your skin
right but if you can if there's some way

00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:21.910
right but if you can if there's some way
 

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:23.519
right but if you can if there's some way
that you can demonstrate complex mental

00:55:23.519 --> 00:55:23.529
that you can demonstrate complex mental
 

00:55:23.529 --> 00:55:25.979
that you can demonstrate complex mental
processes you could in theory pass the

00:55:25.979 --> 00:55:25.989
processes you could in theory pass the
 

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:27.329
processes you could in theory pass the
Turing test but if there's nothing there

00:55:27.329 --> 00:55:27.339
Turing test but if there's nothing there
 

00:55:27.339 --> 00:55:29.009
Turing test but if there's nothing there
right if you've then

00:55:29.009 --> 00:55:29.019
right if you've then
 

00:55:29.019 --> 00:55:31.229
right if you've then
just disconnected from the sensorium

00:55:31.229 --> 00:55:31.239
just disconnected from the sensorium
 

00:55:31.239 --> 00:55:34.469
just disconnected from the sensorium
from from conception and there's just

00:55:34.469 --> 00:55:34.479
from from conception and there's just
 

00:55:34.479 --> 00:55:37.380
from from conception and there's just
nothing there and the fact that you have

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:37.390
nothing there and the fact that you have
 

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:39.120
nothing there and the fact that you have
the same chromosome count as everybody

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:39.130
the same chromosome count as everybody
 

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:41.579
the same chromosome count as everybody
else doesn't really make you human in my

00:55:41.579 --> 00:55:41.589
else doesn't really make you human in my
 

00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:44.819
else doesn't really make you human in my
opinion can I just add something to that

00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:44.829
opinion can I just add something to that
 

00:55:44.829 --> 00:55:46.799
opinion can I just add something to that
but which is um I think the thing about

00:55:46.799 --> 00:55:46.809
but which is um I think the thing about
 

00:55:46.809 --> 00:55:49.289
but which is um I think the thing about
you're worried about the test is that

00:55:49.289 --> 00:55:49.299
you're worried about the test is that
 

00:55:49.299 --> 00:55:51.569
you're worried about the test is that
it's not meant passing it is not meant

00:55:51.569 --> 00:55:51.579
it's not meant passing it is not meant
 

00:55:51.579 --> 00:55:54.359
it's not meant passing it is not meant
to be a necessary condition for having a

00:55:54.359 --> 00:55:54.369
to be a necessary condition for having a
 

00:55:54.369 --> 00:55:56.159
to be a necessary condition for having a
mind so if you fail that that doesn't

00:55:56.159 --> 00:55:56.169
mind so if you fail that that doesn't
 

00:55:56.169 --> 00:55:58.199
mind so if you fail that that doesn't
show that you're you're lacking a mind

00:55:58.199 --> 00:55:58.209
show that you're you're lacking a mind
 

00:55:58.209 --> 00:56:02.519
show that you're you're lacking a mind
right so but going back to a lot of

00:56:02.519 --> 00:56:02.529
right so but going back to a lot of
 

00:56:02.529 --> 00:56:04.079
right so but going back to a lot of
issues that have come up is it

00:56:04.079 --> 00:56:04.089
issues that have come up is it
 

00:56:04.089 --> 00:56:06.479
issues that have come up is it
sufficient well yeah if something passed

00:56:06.479 --> 00:56:06.489
sufficient well yeah if something passed
 

00:56:06.489 --> 00:56:07.829
sufficient well yeah if something passed
it you might really think very hard

00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839
it you might really think very hard
 

00:56:07.839 --> 00:56:10.499
it you might really think very hard

back to this issue of like yeah let's

00:56:13.949 --> 00:56:13.959
back to this issue of like yeah let's
 

00:56:13.959 --> 00:56:15.630
back to this issue of like yeah let's
think hard about you know how are we

00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:15.640
think hard about you know how are we
 

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.509

you probably program it in right yeah I

you probably program it in right yeah I

mean if we imagine that we don't have

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:42.830
mean if we imagine that we don't have

mean if we imagine that we don't have
the compute power to represent the brain

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:44.360
the compute power to represent the brain
 

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.240
the compute power to represent the brain
and so that we're sort of optimizing how

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:46.250
and so that we're sort of optimizing how
 

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:47.700
and so that we're sort of optimizing how
we're leveraging that computing power

00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:47.710
we're leveraging that computing power
 

00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:51.760
we're leveraging that computing power
and there's this threat essentially to

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:51.770
and there's this threat essentially to
 

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:53.650
and there's this threat essentially to
its performance then it can sort of

00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:53.660

power more towards this but I think the

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:57.710
power more towards this but I think the
 

00:58:57.710 --> 00:59:02.740
power more towards this but I think the
question is is much more subtle I don't

00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:02.750
question is is much more subtle I don't
 

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:15.150
question is is much more subtle I don't
think so I really just don't think so

00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:15.160
 

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:22.150
ok so I have another potential kind of

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160
ok so I have another potential kind of
 

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.580
ok so I have another potential kind of

something is is in fact sentient or
 

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:32.230
something is is in fact sentient or
conscious so basically it's a kind of

00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240
conscious so basically it's a kind of
 

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.410

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:34.420
know it when you see it thing where
 

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:37.030
know it when you see it thing where
right now we have I don't like the

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040
right now we have I don't like the
 

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.500
right now we have I don't like the
pornography test no I I know it's the

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:41.510
pornography test no I I know it's the
 

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:42.640
pornography test no I I know it's the
same words but it's a different meaning

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:42.650
same words but it's a different meaning
 

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:45.400

I'm so I'm a fallibilist

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:45.410
I'm so I'm a fallibilist
 

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:47.020
I'm so I'm a fallibilist
so I believe that knowledge consists of

00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:47.030
so I believe that knowledge consists of
 

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:50.260
so I believe that knowledge consists of
explanation so if we knew what

00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:50.270
explanation so if we knew what
 

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:53.260
explanation so if we knew what
consciousness was and and we knew how to

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:53.270
consciousness was and and we knew how to
 

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:54.880
consciousness was and and we knew how to
what the algorithmic

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:54.890
what the algorithmic
 

00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:57.880
what the algorithmic
was behind it we could explain it so

00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:57.890
was behind it we could explain it so
 

00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:59.440
was behind it we could explain it so
right now because we're lacking the

00:59:59.440 --> 00:59:59.450
right now because we're lacking the
 

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:00.759
right now because we're lacking the
knowledge we're looking for some

01:00:00.759 --> 01:00:00.769
knowledge we're looking for some
 

01:00:00.769 --> 01:00:03.490

empirical tests but this is not really

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:03.500

an empirical thing in the same way that
 

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.309
an empirical thing in the same way that
if you're thinking about pure math it's

if you're thinking about pure math it's
 

01:00:09.319 --> 01:00:12.519
if you're thinking about pure math it's
not empirical right something what makes

01:00:12.519 --> 01:00:12.529
not empirical right something what makes
 

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:14.680
not empirical right something what makes
up a triangle or what makes up

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:14.690

consciousness is something that you you
 

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:23.490
consciousness is something that you you
understand in a in a knowledgeable way

01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:23.500
understand in a in a knowledgeable way
 

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:28.559
understand in a in a knowledgeable way
so we know for example that a

01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:28.569
so we know for example that a
 

01:00:28.569 --> 01:00:30.460
so we know for example that a
intelligence system would have to have

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:30.470
intelligence system would have to have
 

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:31.930
intelligence system would have to have
some kind of representation for

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:31.940
some kind of representation for
 

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.150
some kind of representation for
knowledge and we know that for for a

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160
knowledge and we know that for for a
 

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.920
knowledge and we know that for for a
conscious to be conscious like a human

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:35.930
conscious to be conscious like a human
 

01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:38.819
conscious to be conscious like a human
you must have sense perceptions so

01:00:38.819 --> 01:00:38.829
you must have sense perceptions so
 

01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:42.039
you must have sense perceptions so
qualia and we don't really have very

01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:42.049
qualia and we don't really have very
 

01:00:42.049 --> 01:00:44.230
qualia and we don't really have very
good definitions for these things but if

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240
good definitions for these things but if
 

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.450
good definitions for these things but if
we found the algorithmic process then we

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:46.460
we found the algorithmic process then we
 

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.950
we found the algorithmic process then we
would be able to create a definition and

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:47.960
would be able to create a definition and
 

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.539
would be able to create a definition and
we would know what that was and we would

01:00:49.539 --> 01:00:49.549
we would know what that was and we would
 

01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:52.420
we would know what that was and we would
know it was conscious and if we found a

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:52.430
know it was conscious and if we found a
 

01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:54.670
know it was conscious and if we found a
definition for that then we could

01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:54.680
definition for that then we could
 

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.589
definition for that then we could
definitely create an algorithmic process

01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599
definitely create an algorithmic process
 

01:00:56.599 --> 01:00:58.539
definitely create an algorithmic process
and then we can use the definition to

01:00:58.539 --> 01:00:58.549
and then we can use the definition to
 

01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:59.920
and then we can use the definition to
show that the algorithmic process

01:00:59.920 --> 01:00:59.930
show that the algorithmic process
 

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:01.539
show that the algorithmic process
achieves it and then we would also know

01:01:01.539 --> 01:01:01.549
achieves it and then we would also know
 

01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:05.259
achieves it and then we would also know
that that was sentient so panelists you

01:01:05.259 --> 01:01:05.269
that that was sentient so panelists you
 

01:01:05.269 --> 01:01:08.529
that that was sentient so panelists you
have a opinion about that I think it's

01:01:08.529 --> 01:01:08.539
have a opinion about that I think it's
 

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:09.970
have a opinion about that I think it's

we'd get to that definition that would

01:01:15.009 --> 01:01:15.019
we'd get to that definition that would
 

01:01:15.019 --> 01:01:16.480
we'd get to that definition that would
be sufficient for us to create the

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:16.490
be sufficient for us to create the
 

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:17.710
be sufficient for us to create the

huge challenge that I don't think we're

01:01:22.839 --> 01:01:22.849
huge challenge that I don't think we're
 

01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:24.430
huge challenge that I don't think we're
prepared to answer at least at this

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.440
prepared to answer at least at this
 

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.549
prepared to answer at least at this
point so I think the word consciousness

01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:27.559
point so I think the word consciousness
 

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:30.339
point so I think the word consciousness
is like the word cool it's a it's a

01:01:30.339 --> 01:01:30.349
is like the word cool it's a it's a

measurable phenomenon and so

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.000
measurable phenomenon and so
 

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.850
measurable phenomenon and so
consciousness is what we define it to be

01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:40.860
 

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.650
all right we have one last question here

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:43.660
all right we have one last question here
 

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:50.040

to think abstractly cognizance I guess

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:11.650
to think abstractly cognizance I guess
 

01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:16.020
to think abstractly cognizance I guess
you can call it forgetting about
