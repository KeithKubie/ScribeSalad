00:00:02.404 --> 00:00:04.070
INTERVIEWER: Thank
you, thank you Holly.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.040
And welcome, Tamara.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.850
We're so excited to
have you here today.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.438
TAMARA MELLON: I'm
excited to be here.

00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:10.063
INTERVIEWER: So before
we jump into it,

00:00:10.063 --> 00:00:12.180
I have to call out the
elephant in the room.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.930
TAMARA MELLON: OK.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.710
INTERVIEWER: I am only
wearing one Jimmy Choo shoe.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.000
I wanted to wear two, but one
was really all I could muster.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.270
Have you ever been interviewed
by someone only wearing

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.850
one shoe?

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.480
TAMARA MELLON: No I haven't.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.750
This is a new experience.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.160
INTERVIEWER: OK, hopefully
we can make it a great one.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.100
So your new book,
"In My Issues,"

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.620
is a very honest memoir,
a tell-all if you will.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.780
As Holly mentioned about your
early career at British "Vogue"

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.320
through to co-founding
Jimmy Choo,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.930
and then exiting the
company and really turning

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.740
a new leaf in your life.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.830
So why now?

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.157
What prompted you to
write the book now?

00:00:48.157 --> 00:00:49.990
TAMARA MELLON: Well,
starting a new chapter,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.750
I thought it was a great
way to close one chapter

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.054
and enter a new one.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.220
And I also thought, no one's
going to really believe

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.427
what was really going on behind
the scenes at Jimmy Choo.

00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:01.760
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, there's
some pretty salacious stories

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.150
there-- really, really exciting
and challenging, certainly.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.480
So you're somewhat of a
self-taught business women.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.067
In the book, you talk about
your father's influence.

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:14.150
Tamara's father, for those
of you that don't know,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.310
co-founded Vidal Sassoon.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.460
So, a very savvy businessman
in his own right.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.290
But you talk about how
he offered you insights

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.220
and guidance, but a great
deal of your learning

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.010
was through trial and error.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.810
So for example your
experience with private equity

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.730
deals and your troubles there.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.950
So for those of us
in the audience who

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.230
have an entrepreneurial
bent, or perhaps

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.027
want to start our own companies,
what advice do you have?

00:01:43.027 --> 00:01:45.610
TAMARA MELLON: Well when I set
out, when I founded Jimmy Choo,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.680
you know obviously my goal
was to make beautiful shoes.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.180
I didn't realize that I'd be
getting into the private equity

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.120
world.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.020
And I entered it
because Jimmy decided

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.003
to sell his shares in 2001.

00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:58.660
And obviously he had a right to
sell them to whomever wanted.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.400
And that's how private equity
came into the business.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.640
So I had to learn very quickly.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.350
I was dealing with investment
bankers, the financial world,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.150
and so it was really
a self-education.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.150
INTERVIEWER: Definitely.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.130
And something you
just mentioned,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.130
going through the
business world,

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.365
I imagine that sometimes it felt
very much like a man's world.

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:21.740
What were the
challenges that you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.850
found in being a woman in
this sometimes man's world?

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.740
TAMARA MELLON: It was-- yeah,
I faced things which I really

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.900
didn't expect to face
in today's world.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.865
Very much as a woman, you still
get diminished and discounted.

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:40.690
Your Opinions are
very much discounted.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.440
And strangely enough
I ended up being

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.590
on the board of Jimmy
Choo with 10 men.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.060
And I was the only woman, which
is sort of illogical, really,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.640
if you think about it.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.080
And also I was dealing
with unequal pay.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.557
So discovering all these
things on my journey

00:02:57.557 --> 00:02:59.140
was also part of why
I wrote the book.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.480
Because I wanted to really
address a lot of these issues.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.330
And things I noticed
about women's behavior

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.090
in the workplace compared
to men was very different.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.610
And I wanted to address
that in the book as well.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.068
INTERVIEWER:
Fantastic, yes there's

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:15.250
definitely a theme of
empowerment as a woman,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.010
as a businesswomen in the book.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.330
You also have some
fantastic charitable efforts

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.170
that we'd love to
hear more about.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.750
TAMARA MELLON: Well I'm going
to be starting a foundation when

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.040
the Tamara Mellon brand.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.250
And its to work
on women's rights,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.890
for gender discrimination
and equal pay

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.502
and also dealing with
the sex-slave trade.

00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:32.460
INTERVIEWER: Wonderful.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.910
Wonderful.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.840
You became something
of a celebrity

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.880
during the course of
running Jimmy Choo shoes.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.600
A funny out take from
your book, which I loved,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.760
someone came up to you and
asked for your autograph

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.410
on their receipt from their
first pair of Jimmy Choo shoes.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.910
So a great indicator of this
fan base that you created.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.160
So I'd love to hear a little
bit more about that experience,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.207
and how you really leveraged
it to build the brand.

00:03:58.207 --> 00:04:00.040
TAMARA MELLON: What's
important for a brand,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.700
particularly starting
off, is that you

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.300
have someone that embodies the
brand, and a story to tell,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.910
and someone that they can
buy in to, or identify with.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.860
So really, if you think
about most big brands,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.850
they have a
personality attached.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.029
And you buy into that person.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.451
You buy the story
they're telling.

00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:23.200
Because when you're
also creating a brand,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.870
you're creating a woman.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.190
So it's a fancy
in my head, maybe,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.970
about the woman I want to be.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.912
And maybe other women
want to be that as well.

00:04:32.912 --> 00:04:35.370
So when you're creating the
product, when you're creating--

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.980
it's one woman, it's her world.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.910
And it's a vision.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.690
INTERVIEWER: And you really
lived that life to a degree.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.320
TAMARA MELLON: And then I ended
up-- I didn't expect that.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.980
But then when we realized
that journalists wanted

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.927
to do interviews
about the company,

00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:52.760
that was really the
only one who could do it

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.830
because I was
creating the product

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.180
and I was running the
operations of the business.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.555
So that really I
was the only one

00:04:58.555 --> 00:05:00.910
that could speak to what was
going on in the business.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.100
So it happened to me
by default, really.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.502
And then once you're
in the limelight,

00:05:07.502 --> 00:05:09.710
then people become fascinated
with your personal life

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.630
and they become sort of--
so it all kind of opens up.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.500
INTERVIEWER: Right.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.590
So you talked a little bit about
really understanding this woman

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.480
that you're catering
to and her aesthetic.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.230
With the launch of your need
collection, the Tamara Mellon

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.270
Namesake Collection,
which is coming out very,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.150
very soon-- it includes
ready-to-wear accessories,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.140
handbags, and more.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.150
What type of woman
are you designing for?

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.290
You mentioned a lot that you
inject your own personal DNA,

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.200
you know, being a working
mother, as well as

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.940
a globetrotter,
being very modern.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.840
These are aspects that we've
seen in the Jimmy Choo line.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.510
Are they things that we'll also
see in the Tamara Mellon line?

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.470
TAMARA MELLON: Definitely
it follows with me

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.540
because it's my DNA.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.100
But in a very modern way.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.850
The most exciting thing
with the new brand

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.760
was starting with a clean slate.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.560
And thinking about the
woman today, particularly

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.280
with the business model.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.390
That's very different.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.426
Of our psychology and how
we want to shop today.

00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:07.800
Because the world has changed
since I started Jimmy Choo.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.547
We're living in a
very different world.

00:06:09.547 --> 00:06:10.630
INTERVIEWER: Right, right.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.760
Well nobody's a bigger digital
enthusiast than we are.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.040
And the way you're using
digital to launch your new brand

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.695
is very, very interesting.

00:06:18.695 --> 00:06:21.790
You're really turning the
traditional model on its head.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.510
So you're leading with digital.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.210
The e-commerce platform
is going to be pretty much

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.720
the primary outlet for this
brand with brick and mortar

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.550
locations coming
up later next year.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.650
Can you tell us a little
bit about that strategy?

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.900
TAMARA MELLON: It's-- when
I looked at the way we live

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.857
today, what happens is a fashion
show goes up online as soon

00:06:43.857 --> 00:06:44.440
as it happens.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.140
And everybody sees it.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.390
And that never used to happen.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.598
Only the press and buyers
would see the fashion show.

00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:51.460
And the customer
would see the product

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.120
when it was in a magazine
and went into a store.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.910
So as a customer, we're looking
at that product for six months

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.832
before it gets into the store.

00:06:59.832 --> 00:07:02.040
So by the time it's the shop
floor, we're a bit like,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.580
oh god, I've over it now.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.280
I've looked at it for too long.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.110
And we want the next new thing.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.879
And also the world
is-- we're buying

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:12.920
things in the wrong season
because the department

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.670
stores have really pushed
to get things on the floor

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.010
early so they can sell it.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.390
They can beat their customers,
which means we've ended up with

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.110
coats on the floor in July,
spring/ summer dresses going

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.920
in in January.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.850
Who wants to but that?

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.080
I don't want a coat in July.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.500
And I don't know any woman
that wants to do that.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.812
Or who can even
think about a product

00:07:32.812 --> 00:07:34.770
that they're going to
wear in four months time.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.330
You want to buy
something now and you

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.890
want to wear it tomorrow.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.640
So I have a business
model that is seasonless.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.070
And it goes into stores monthly.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.640
And it's a different
fashion concept every month.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.807
But it's what you're going to
want to wear in that month.

00:07:49.807 --> 00:07:51.390
INTERVIEWER:
Interesting, interesting.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.930
And how are you
finding that this

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.990
is being received in
the fashion industry?

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.284
Because again, this is
not the traditional model.

00:07:57.284 --> 00:07:58.950
I don't know why
you're the first person

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.930
to do this because it
makes so much sense.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.850
But I'm wondering how
you found the reception.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:09.580
TAMARA MELLON: The customer
is clear and loud, yes.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.300
I mean I love communicating
with my customers

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.700
on Twitter and Instagram.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.240
And the messages
I'm getting back

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.760
is thank god someone's
finally doing this.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.670
This is what we want.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.426
So the customer is there.

00:08:21.426 --> 00:08:23.300
The industry, we're
pushing them a little bit

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.300
to get on board with it.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.240
Department store, you
know-- they bought it.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.380
We're going to be in Bergdorf's,
Nieman's, and Net-a-Porter.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.090
Net-a-Porter is actually there.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.000
They're also pushing
designers to do it.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.260
But the traditional
bricks-and-mortar department

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.590
stores are worried about, well
if you have new product going

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.960
in January when all our
autumn/winter is on sale, how's

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.210
it going to look on the floor?

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.680
How's the customer
going to react?

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.950
But I'm pushing,
and I'm just saying,

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.491
you know what, just
test the customer

00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:51.100
because I know it's
what she wants.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.000
So I think once they see
the customer's response,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.062
then they'll really
get behind it.

00:08:57.062 --> 00:08:58.770
INTERVIEWER: So this
isn't the first time

00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.910
you've pushed the envelope.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.290
With Jimmy Choo, you definitely
pushed the creative envelope

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.999
and launched new products.

00:09:04.999 --> 00:09:06.790
What was your favorite
throughout your time

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.321
being there?

00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:09.070
Was there a specific
collection or project

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.360
you worked on that comes to
mind as being a favorite?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.050
TAMARA MELLON: Oh I have a
lot of babies from Jimmy Choo.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.170
But I would say
my favorite things

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.910
are animal prints, leopard
prints, zebra, I love fringe,

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.861
studs, glitter.

00:09:26.861 --> 00:09:29.485
So if you see a product with any
of those things on, you know--

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:32.730
INTERVIEWER: A little
bit of rock 'n roll, OK.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.770
So just going back to
your new collection,

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.190
the way it's being
released, this

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.250
puts an even larger
importance on staying ahead

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.120
of trend, which is something
that fashion brands grapple

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.510
with all the time.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.420
How do you manage to
say ahead of trends?

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.110
TAMARA MELLON: Well a
normal fashion brand designs

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.510
a year ahead.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.730
And it's often what you
want in you life then.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.290
But you've got to
wait a year for it.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:56.750
It's very frustrating.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.070
So now I can design something.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.120
And I can have it on the shop
floor three months later.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.700
So from design, from a
sketch, to on shop floor,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.370
it's a much shorter window.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.804
So I can really gauge the
temperature of the customer

00:10:10.804 --> 00:10:12.220
and what we're
feeling and what we

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.627
want right then in that moment.

00:10:14.627 --> 00:10:15.460
INTERVIEWER: OK, OK.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.640
So you are all about
taking on challenges

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.190
and reinventing
yourself to a degree.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.707
What's next for you?

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:24.540
TAMARA MELLON: Next?

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.560
I've hardly started
this one yet.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.402
INTERVIEWER: Well
in your book-- I'm

00:10:29.402 --> 00:10:31.110
sure you guys will
all enjoy reading it--

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.080
but Tamara takes on
challenge after challenge,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.360
often at the same very time.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.150
So while you were
working on Jimmy Choo,

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.319
you also started
reinventing Houston.

00:10:39.319 --> 00:10:40.110
TAMARA MELLON: Yes.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.514
INTERVIEWER: And so it
wouldn't be out of character

00:10:42.514 --> 00:10:44.555
for you to take on multiple
projects at the time.

00:10:44.555 --> 00:10:46.160
But I could
completely understand

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.950
if a vacation was what you
needed in the near future.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.950
TAMARA MELLON: You're
absolutely right actually.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.480
While I was writing the
book, launching a new brand,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.790
I decided to renovate my
apartment at the same time.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.350
INTERVIEWER: Yes.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.280
TAMARA MELLON: So yeah.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.400
INTERVIEWER: And you
have a young daughter

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.560
Minty Melon whose name I'm
very jealous of-- that's

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.102
the best name ever.

00:11:02.102 --> 00:11:04.060
And you're splitting your
time between New York

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.820
are London as well.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.170
TAMARA MELLON: And yeah, I
have a design studio in Paris

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.140
and here in New York.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.590
All my shoes and bags are
manufactured in Italy.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.120
I'm working with
the same factories

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.440
that I've worked
with for 15 years.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.390
So it's a pure luxury product.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.400
But what I'm doing is I'm going
to take a smaller margin so I

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.250
can deliver an amazing product
to my customer at a more

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.110
affordable price point.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.589
And then also the
ready-to-wear is--

00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:35.380
what I've done with
the pricing is actually

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.790
an interesting hybrid.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.100
Because the ready-to-wear
dress is about $800,

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.630
a skirt is $600, which is
a contemporary price point.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.400
It's not a pure designer luxury.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.180
If you had a brand
at that price point,

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.454
you'd normally find
the shoes at $300.

00:11:51.454 --> 00:11:52.245
INTERVIEWER: Right.

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:53.710
TAMARA MELLON: But
my shoes are higher

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.876
because they're pure luxury.

00:11:54.876 --> 00:11:57.470
So I have high contemporary
clothing, and pure luxury shoes

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:58.339
and bags.

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:00.130
INTERVIEWER: Is there
a brand in the luxury

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.686
space or the
contemporary market,

00:12:01.686 --> 00:12:03.060
or even unrelated,
that you think

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.560
is doing a really great job
of establishing themselves

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.880
as a brand but also activating
themselves digitally?

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.000
TAMARA MELLON: Burberry has been
a real pioneer in that area.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.620
And I'm really working
with social media today.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.560
Because for me also
it's different from when

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.620
I started Jimmy Choo.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.330
We didn't have social media.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.640
And times have changed.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.650
And just having that direct
communication with the customer

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.860
is the most important
thing today.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.810
When I started Jimmy Choo,
there was a new wave.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.210
Accessories where exploding.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.110
And magazines realize that
if they put an actress

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.290
on the cover, their
readership went up.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.190
So the whole celebrity and
fashion relationship started.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.130
And that's why I took
Jimmy Choo to the Oscars

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.080
within the first two
years of business.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.430
But today, it's
very different now.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.240
Now it's direct the customer.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.600
Is communicating with them
on Instagram, on Twitter,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.150
on things like YouTube, Android.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.480
All these get you
direct communication,

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.960
which is what they want now.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.410
INTERVIEWER: Do you
find that there's

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.780
a challenge between asserting
yourself as a luxury brand

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.780
but also having that
two-way communication,

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.530
because that's certainly a lot
of what we hear in the luxury

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.270
sector, that you want
to establish yourself

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:29.090
as being elite and sophisticated
and top-of-market, but also

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.540
approachable and
someone that you

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.940
can communicate with as a brand.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.846
So do you have any strategy
in terms of social media

00:13:35.846 --> 00:13:37.220
and how you're
going to structure

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.080
that for the Tamara Mellon line?

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.090
TAMARA MELLON: I
think that being elite

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.260
is an old-fashioned view.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.040
I think you can be
absolutely luxury

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.070
and still communicate
with your customer.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:54.410
So, no I'm direct all the
time, myself talking with them.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.000
And I don't think designers
should sit in their ivory tower

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.510
and not communicate
with their customer.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.260
INTERVIEWER: Right,
you mentioned Twitter.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.220
Is your favorite social
media platform right now?

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.640
TAMARA MELLON: I like Instagram.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.380
Yeah, Instagram is a really fun.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.360
And now you can put little
videos out, which is great.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.870
Yeah, so Twitter, Instagram.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.282
We still do pretty
much everything.

00:14:16.282 --> 00:14:17.240
INTERVIEWER: Wonderful.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.220
Wonderful.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.140
Well thank you so much for
sharing all this with us.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.860
We love your new book.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.500
Again it's at the back if anyone
would like to pick up a copy.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.958
I'd love to turn
it to the audience

00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.990
and ask if you guys have
any questions, anything

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.200
we haven't touched on.

00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:35.447
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.810
TAMARA MELLON: In November.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.680
Yeah, it'll be in Bergdorf's,
Nieman's and Net-a-Porter

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.930
and Harrod's in London in case
anyone's there in November.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.300
AUDIENCE: I have one.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.400
You mentioned, while you
were in your discussion,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.830
that at one point you were
one woman out an entire board

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.290
of all men, especially
for products

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.790
that are targeted towards women.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.210
How did you feel
in those moments?

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:12.210
And was there ever a time where
you had to strongly advocated

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.830
particularly from like
a female perspective?

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.990
TAMARA MELLON: The
difficult thing

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.800
was that all the men on my board
were from the private equity

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.800
industry.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.530
So your interests are
not really always aligned

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.420
with their interests.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.960
They're really looking at just
getting [INAUDIBLE] profits up

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.820
so they can sell.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.190
They want to come in and
out as quickly as they can.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:37.574
And as a founder,
you really care

00:15:37.574 --> 00:15:39.740
about the quality of the
product, the people working

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.570
in the business.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.450
And also, what's very difficult
for them, because it's not

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.240
tangible, is it's an
emotional business.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.900
It's an emotional
connection with the product.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.100
So you could predict
something that's

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.950
going to sell in the
future but they may not

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.990
have the confidence to put the
money behind it because they

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.210
don't understand why.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.130
But it's just an
emotional connection.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.820
INTERVIEWER: So I have one
last question before we wrap.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.910
You share with us so
many personal stories

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.010
in "In My Shoes," really
difficult things that you went

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.399
through your childhood,
in your adult life.

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:20.940
And something that really shines
through as you read the book

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.490
is how resilient you are.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.940
And that you use these
tumultuous experiences really

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.970
to become a stronger person.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.990
And that's something
that led you

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.320
through even to your
business career.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.660
How did you manage to do that?

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.880
Because I think that's
something that we as people

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.560
struggle with.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.480
And you've done an amazing job
at just growing and becoming

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.290
even stronger through
those difficult times.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.940
TAMARA MELLON: Well
part of it really

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.216
is growing up in
an alcoholic home.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:50.810
It actually-- the
only benefit, you

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.210
have a very high
tolerance level for abuse,

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.150
or dealing with
difficult situations

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.830
because you're used to it.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:06.329
Other than that, and
then knowing really it's

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.630
believing in yourself.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.050
You've just got to
believe in yourself.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.020
And passion.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.869
You've got to keep
following your passion.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:19.609
I always say, passion
is the number one thing.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:24.319
Once you have that,
everything else follows.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.859
But I think because
I was so passionate

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.470
about the product,
and that company,

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.420
it ran through my veins like
the blood runs through my veins,

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.964
that I kept fighting for it.

00:17:36.964 --> 00:17:38.880
INTERVIEWER: OK, well
thank you so much again.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.110
It was a pleasure
having you here.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.600
Best of luck with the new
collection and everything else.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.266
I'm sure we'll hear
about something else

00:17:44.266 --> 00:17:45.670
that you're launching very soon.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:46.790
TAMARA MELLON: Thank you,
thanks for having me.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.730
INTERVIEWER: Thank you so much.
