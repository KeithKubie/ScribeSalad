00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.200
Hi.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.180
Andy Granowitz here, developer
advocate for Google Analytics.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.670
Today, I'm going to talk a
little about Google Analytics

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.900
and why you might
want to use it.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.540
Google Analytics is a tool
to collect and analyze

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.060
data on user interactions
with your business.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.870
It exists to help you improve
and optimize those interactions

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.340
and your business as a whole.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.080
It's free to use and is
very popular for mobile apps

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.920
and websites, but
you can measure

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.640
important actions your
users take offline

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.090
in Google Analytics as well.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.970
Whatever the task, many
people in any organization

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.600
will find using Google Analytics
valuable-- for example,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.880
marketers.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.240
Marketers use it to optimize
campaigns and determine

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.890
the most effective
marketing channels.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.000
Designers use Google
Analytics to understand

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.060
how users are interacting with
their website or app as well

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.580
as the impact on
interface design changes

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.530
that they may make.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.790
Front end developers take
advantage of the ability

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.050
to measure page load times,
broken links or 404 pages,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.080
JavaScript errors, and so on.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.100
For these reasons,
I highly recommend

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.040
giving everyone in your
organization access

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.900
to Google Analytics, so
they're empowered to dig deep

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.420
into the data on their own.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.650
This is a big advantage over
siloed data analytics systems

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.940
that only a few people
have access to or know

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.660
how to use or only
produce static reports

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.790
on a periodic basis.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.500
All of your Google
Analytics data

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.080
can be accessed at any
time, and the interface

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.780
is really great for ad hoc
analysis, impromptu analysis,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.460
things like that.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.470
I should note, if you do have
sensitive data like sales

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.750
or marketing spend that
you may not want everyone

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.900
in your organization to
see, you can restrict access

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.030
to certain parts
of Google Analytics

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.400
while still having the benefit
of giving many people access

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.020
to the data that they need.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.420
It's important to spend some
time thinking through what

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.670
your primary objectives
are as a business

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.440
and think about how
this trickles down

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.110
to your analytics.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.030
For example, if your goal is
customer acquisition or getting

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.960
people to sign up
for your service,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840
this will translate
into specific metrics

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.480
that you can optimize for.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.050
One such metric is, of
course, total user sign ups.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.900
But you might also want to
consider user trials, repeated

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.950
visits to informational pages,
the number of email newsletter

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.820
sign ups, and so on.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.350
These data points will be
important to understand

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.900
and measure the effectiveness
of different activities

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.110
and changes that you make.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.697
You can do this type of
analysis in Google Analytics.

00:02:28.697 --> 00:02:30.280
See the impact of a
change that you've

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.344
made on the metrics
that indicate success.

00:02:34.344 --> 00:02:35.760
So take some time
and think about,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.010
what are your high level
business objectives?

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.400
What are the objectives
of your website, app,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.220
or any other digital properties
you operate, and then

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.260
specific measurable goals
for these digital properties

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.650
that you're trying to optimize?

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.720
In fact, you can tell Google
Analytics what your goals are,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.207
and then it will help you
optimize for these goals.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:56.290
In Google Analytics when
someone completes a goal,

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.640
it's called a goal conversion.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.174
Watch the next
video to learn more

00:03:00.174 --> 00:03:01.590
about some of the
important things

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.200
to consider when setting up
Google Analytics for the very

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.020
first time.
