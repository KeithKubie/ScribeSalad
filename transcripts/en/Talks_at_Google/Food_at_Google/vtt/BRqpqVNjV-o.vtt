[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.790
SAM ZIEN: So thank
you for having me.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.840
And I appreciate
Francesca's intro.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.280
I'm not trying to make
people leave their jobs.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.300
That's not the goal.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.550
It was for me.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.890
So let's see.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.140
I was never somebody
that grew up

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.500
knowing what he
wanted to do in life.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.100
No doctor, no teacher, no
accountant, no bus driver,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.810
no clue, like
literally, no clue.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.900
My father would take me
to see big band music.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.270
I'm from Vancouver, Canada.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.590
And the intermission,
we'd stand.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.820
He'd have a cocktail.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.940
And we'd just be in the lobby.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.650
And he'd say, oh, there's
Joe Smith, my friend,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.310
and there's Harry whatever.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.310
And I was always
saying, what does he do?

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.990
What does he do?

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.656
What does he do?

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:02.580
I was hoping to hear something
that would catch my ear

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.920
and I'd be like, that sounds
like an interesting job.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.900
I could do that.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.310
Well, that didn't work.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.490
And when it came time to
graduate from high school

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.070
and go to college, I did exactly
what one of my brothers did.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.140
I went and took a
marketing program.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.530
And then I went into advertising
because that's what he did

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.780
and it seemed like
a reasonable thing.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.060
Seemed sort of creative,
and I felt like maybe I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.850
had slight creative leanings.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.030
And then I started
to get bored with it.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.955
I got engaged to
my now wife, which

00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:36.330
makes it sound like there was
another wife along the way.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.590
That's not what I meant.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.090
We've been married a long time.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.770
And we moved to Toronto.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.567
I worked for an
advertising agency

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:45.150
that wouldn't hire
me in the beginning

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.450
because I didn't
have any experience.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.060
And finally, I said
to them one day,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.562
we've had three interviews.

00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:51.270
I'd love to be here
and you're telling me

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.560
I don't have any experience.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.840
So let's do this.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.230
Hire me for three
months and don't pay me.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.930
At the end of three months,
if you think I'm useless,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.010
you say goodbye.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.320
I haven't cost you a cent.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.350
But if at the end of three
months you think I'm useful,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.449
then you start paying me.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.550
And not only do I
know the business,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.820
but I know your
particular business.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.350
I know where the copier is.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.350
I know how to get to
the client's offices.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.980
I know what goes on here.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.714
And they said, well,
let's think about it.

00:02:23.714 --> 00:02:24.630
They took the weekend.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.280
They called back and they said,
OK, we're going to hire you.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.240
So they hired me
without paying me.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.990
And at the end of three
months, they said,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.392
this has gone really well.

00:02:32.392 --> 00:02:34.350
We'd like to hire you
now and start paying you.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.960
I said, that's very cool,
but one of your clients

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.580
just made me an
offer and I said yes.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.490
So I start there on the
weekend or next week.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.620
So now, I was the employee.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.350
Now, I became the
client and it was great.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.080
It was a marketing position
in a sporting goods company

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.560
in Toronto that got
sold to a French parent

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.300
company in Montreal.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.970
They wanted me and my wife to
move to Montreal and neither

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.240
of us speak French.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.740
And then-- this is
30-ish years ago--

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.940
not speaking French in
Montreal was a bit of a hassle.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.709
It really limited
what you could do.

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.000
AUDIENCE: Outside of Montreal--

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.380
SAM ZIEN: Anyway.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.790
I love the French.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.840
And I like the real French too.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.230
So I said no.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.970
I said no.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.230
And that's how they feel.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.990
The real French look down
on the French Canadians.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.620
And the French Canadians
are pissed about it.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.570
But so we chose not to go.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.200
And I go, now I can do what
I've really wanted to do.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.505
I want to be in film.

00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:39.900
Not in front of the camera, I
wanted to be behind the camera.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.300
So I got a job as a
production assistant

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.760
at a production
company in Toronto.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.640
And remember, Toronto
is a huge home

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.290
to tons of movie, film,
and television in Canada.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.030
Big industry, but it also looks
like a bunch of big cities.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.540
So you pick Toronto,
you pay Canadian wages.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.370
The dollars are less up there.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.360
The production crews
are just as good.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.450
And it looks like New York
or Detroit or whatever.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.860
So I did that.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.560
It was just the worst
job in the world,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.140
being a production assistant,
because it's literally

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.160
the worst stuff they can
think of to make you do.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.860
Oh, the actor's dog just
took a crap over there.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.329
Can you get that?

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.430
We need some dry
cleaning taken in.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.810
We need this cable walked
four miles down the street.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.450
It was just awful.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.240
So I did that.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.370
It was not nearly as
glamorous as I hoped.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.010
And in that time, my advertising
brother called up and he says,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.150
one of our clients, place
called Penguin's Frozen Yogurt,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.452
is doing really well.

00:04:37.452 --> 00:04:39.660
How do you feel about us
going into the frozen yogurt

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.480
business?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.900
I was like, yes, in two seconds.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.280
And we're going to do it in
Phoenix, even more exciting.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.650
Get out of that horrible,
horrible Toronto weather,

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.590
go to Phoenix, do something new.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.490
So I started off
marketing, then ended up

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.330
in an advertising agency, then
end up in the movie thing.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.960
And then before I go to frozen
yogurt, I quit the movie thing.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.960
I deliver pizzas in
Toronto for a few months.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.060
We go to Phoenix.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.150
We open up a Penguin's
Frozen Yogurt.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.110
It's going great.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.140
Some guy that has the rights
to Penguin's in Tucson

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.210
wants to buy the Phoenix market.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.310
He buys it from us.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.750
We just break even, don't
really make any money.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.639
Now what do I do?

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.180
Now, I have nothing
to do and I still

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.820
don't know what I want
to do when I grow up.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.890
So now what?

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.100
So I did what many
people do when they don't

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.780
know what they want to do.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.140
I went into real estate.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.740
It's an admirable profession.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.940
I hated it, but I did it.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.790
I got my license in Arizona.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.620
And the day the license
came in the mail,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.690
we decided to move to
California because we

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.950
had some family in San Diego.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.170
We came here, got my
California license.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.960
It was much more
difficult than Arizona.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.470
If you're going to get your
license, go to Arizona.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.570
It's easier than it
is in California.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.130
Sold houses for five years,
couldn't stand a second of it.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.520
Hated it.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.780
I said to myself, something
good will come of this one day,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.210
I honestly believe.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.072
Finally, I sold a house to a guy
who started a biotech company--

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:11.280
worked for a biotech company.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.850
Sold him a house.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:12.870
Called me up a
couple years later.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.030
He goes, I'm starting
my own biotech company.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.140
Can you help me with
a commercial property?

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.292
I said, yes.

00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:20.250
I didn't know anything
about it, but my manager

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.580
told me he'd help me.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.370
And in that process, he says,
I like working with you.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.240
We get along.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.620
This is a good relationship.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.274
Come work for the
biotech company.

00:06:30.274 --> 00:06:31.440
I go, what am I going to do?

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.040
I don't know anything
about biotech.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.560
He goes, you'll be the director.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.330
You'll be the
facilities manager.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.825
You know real
estate, construction.

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:39.450
It'll work out.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.600
It'll be fine, blah, blah, blah.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.266
So I go to work for
the biotech company.

00:06:42.266 --> 00:06:45.900
I love it for five years and
then I start to hate it again.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.550
It was the classic
three bears thing.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.610
I could not find anything
I was comfortable doing.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.590
And this is not rare.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.450
I don't know how many
of you in this room

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.780
grew up knowing you wanted to
be a geek and work at Google.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.630
I mean, when I grew up
there wasn't Google.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.463
There weren't geeks.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.780
And I mean that in the
nicest way possible.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.711
I didn't just wreck this, did I?

00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:09.210
Come on.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.350
You guys all know it.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.680
You can't not work here and--

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.880
OK.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.630
So I go, something
good will come of this.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.963
Now, I'm in the biotech company.

00:07:16.963 --> 00:07:17.910
I can't stand it.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:18.840
Can't stand it.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.520
And now, I'm at home on Sundays
with the "San Diego Union"

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.390
help wanted general ad section
in front of me, cup of coffee

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.200
in one hand.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.460
And now, I'm going
down the columns.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.900
Help wanted general.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.910
I'm looking for a career.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.840
Help wanted general--
accounting, advertising,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.720
automotive, banking, brake
alignment, bookkeeping,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.720
candy making, cookie
thing, dance instructor,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.600
delivery driver.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.270
I mean, I could do
the whole alphabet.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.470
And I was waiting for
divine intervention.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.770
I imagined one day
my finger would

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.150
hit a job title or description.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.110
I'd get a little chill.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.650
It would be God talking
to me, saying, Sam,

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.790
this is what you should do.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.530
And I'm going to tell
you, it didn't happen.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.080
It doesn't happen like that.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.450
I might as well have
been throwing darts

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.931
against a board with
job titles on it.

00:08:10.931 --> 00:08:12.930
So now, I'm sitting in
my biotech office one day

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.190
and I'm mulling over this.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.740
I'm very upset.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.740
I can't figure this out.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.410
I'm miserable.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:17.910
I'm unhappy.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.660
And I say to myself, I'm going
about this the wrong way.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.910
I'm literally trying
to take my square peg

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.990
and cram it into a round hole,
and that's not the thing to do.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.270
So what if somebody walked in
my office door and said to me,

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.900
OK, you can go do
anything you want

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.179
for a living, no
regard for making

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.099
money, what people thought,
providing for your family.

00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:40.890
What's the thing that
you would want to do?

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.210
Answer it quick, Sam.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.919
And my answer
instantly was I wanted

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.700
to go back to Tokyo where
I'd been a year before.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.320
My brother-in-law
went on business.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.800
I went for my 40th
birthday to myself.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.330
And I know what you're thinking.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.315
He's already past 40?

00:08:56.315 --> 00:08:57.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.030
Joking.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.630
So I want to go back to Tokyo.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.320
And I'm a fairly practical,
pragmatic person.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.960
So at that moment,
I start trying

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.020
to figure out how to get myself
back to Tokyo for a career now,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.110
not just a vacay.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.010
I could become a pilot
or flight attendant,

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.380
but I don't really like
to fly all that much.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.170
I get sick on planes.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.680
And God knows, I
don't want to have

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.290
to be nice to a
group of strangers

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.890
for like 14 hours at a time.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.550
And have you seen
how people treat

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.850
flight crew on an airplane?

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.620
They're basically snapping their
fingers and they're rude as F,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.530
and it's awful.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.050
So I don't want to do that.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.100
I could teach English
as a second language.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.050
I come from Canada.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.970
I believe I have a
pretty damn good command

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.050
of the English language.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.707
I do speak the Queen's English.

00:09:41.707 --> 00:09:43.290
But the idea of
coming home and saying

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.470
to my wife and three sons,
we're moving to Tokyo,

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.080
we're going to live
in 14 square feet,

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.801
we'll sleep standing up because
laying down is overrated,

00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:52.800
it's going to be great--

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.780
that wasn't going to work.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.110
And literally, that moment,
as I'm thinking this,

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.590
I'm also thinking about
a horrible newscast,

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.400
local newscast I'd
seen the night before.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.274
Like wait a minute, what if
I did a kind of travel thing?

00:10:10.274 --> 00:10:11.940
Because when I came
back and told people

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.940
that I spent most of my time
in Tokyo alone, certainly

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.390
during the day, my
friends were like,

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.024
I don't know if I
could do that, dude.

00:10:19.024 --> 00:10:20.190
You can't read the language.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.420
You don't know what the food is.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.420
You can't get the signs.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.567
You can't understand.

00:10:23.567 --> 00:10:25.150
But for me, that was
kind of exciting.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.580
I thought, maybe
I could do that.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.530
And within about 15 minutes,
I had thunk up a perfect job.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.900
I would go to foreign locations.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.250
I would shoot some footage.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.400
I'd put together a
little travel series.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.220
I would come back and I
would air three or four

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.349
minutes a night on a
local news channel.

00:10:44.349 --> 00:10:46.140
(NEWSCASTER VOICE) Stay
tuned all next week

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.500
while our travel guy shows you
the ins and outs of Tokyo--

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.020
or Hong Kong or
Bali or whatever.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.260
It was a great idea.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.830
I quit my biotech
job, say goodbye.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.300
See ya, suckers.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.960
I'm out of here.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.420
I was so excited.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.830
Pulled together
this little crew.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.020
Nobody's getting paid,
but we're getting a trip

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.810
to Tokyo and Hong Kong
to shoot demo footage.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.700
I'd managed to convince the Hong
Kong tourist board and a hotel

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.030
association in Japan to
sort of underwrite the trip.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.950
Nobody gets money,
but we get flights

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.790
and travel and accommodation.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.280
It's great.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.240
All excited, things
are going beautifully,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.320
until a month before
we're supposed to go,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.620
and 9/11 happens.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.010
And I always tell this part of
the story the exact same way.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.260
I say, that day
changed thousands

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.690
of other people's lives
much more significantly

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.460
than it changed mine.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.390
But it still changed my life
because after September 11

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.450
of 2001, nobody was
buying a travel show.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.760
Nobody was getting on planes.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.160
Nobody was buying a
travel show, especially

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.100
from a guy who barely
had ever traveled

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.680
and certainly had never
been on television.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.780
What was I thinking?

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.250
Well, I was thinking that
I wanted to be happy.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.650
That's what I was thinking.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.650
So now, September
11 comes and goes.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.840
It's literally the week after.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.060
I'm sitting now in that
same spot on the couch

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.860
where I'm going
through the newspaper.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:16.020
And my wife goes to work and she
says, what are you going to do?

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.640
I go, I don't know.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.050
I don't know.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.510
I wanted to encourage
people to travel,

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.800
do something they hadn't done.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.100
And I liked that idea, but
what could I do with that?

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.410
So one day she goes to work.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.300
I'm watching KUSI.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.430
And on comes the
worst cooking segment

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.990
I've ever seen in my life.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.745
I'm telling you,
it was horrific.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.270
The chef, who could probably
kick my ass all over a kitchen,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.220
was as boring as they came.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.810
But he didn't need
to be exciting.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.340
He's in the back, cooking food.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.600
He's wearing his chef whites.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.120
The anchors couldn't
pronounce creme fraiche.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.230
It was idiotic.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.190
It was boring.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.880
The camera stayed on this
pot of butternut squash soup

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.760
for like a solid
30 plus seconds.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.800
I go, this is awful television.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.222
Somebody should do this better.

00:13:03.222 --> 00:13:04.805
And then bing, there's
the light bulb.

00:13:04.805 --> 00:13:07.234
And I go, crap, I
should do this better.

00:13:07.234 --> 00:13:08.400
My wife comes home that day.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.695
I go, I've got it.

00:13:09.695 --> 00:13:10.320
She goes, what?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.520
I go, cooking show.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.170
Instead of short
travel segments,

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.970
I'll do short cooking segments.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.120
She goes, I think that's a
fantastic idea, just one thing.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.620
I go, what?

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.860
She goes, you can't cook.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.410
I go, well, here's the thing.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.600
Instead of watching a
cooking segment thinking that

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.530
looks good and complicated, but
now I'm hungry, let's go out,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.530
people will watch and go,
that looks good and easy.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.180
I'll be my own weakest link.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.000
I can make that.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.820
Now, my wife in all of
this, you have to understand

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.060
is the real genius
because in her mind,

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.360
there was no way that the travel
thing was ever going to work.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.120
But what it was
going to do, it was

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.870
going to get me out
of the biotech company

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.710
where I was very comfortable.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:53.214
I was safe.

00:13:53.214 --> 00:13:55.130
And it's like, I was in
my bed in the morning,

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.300
the covers around my neck.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.260
It was cozy.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.610
I didn't want to get up.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:59.900
I needed something.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.510
I needed a life kick in the ass.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.782
She knew the travel
thing wouldn't work,

00:14:04.782 --> 00:14:06.740
but then two, three months
later, there I'd be.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.370
Now, I'd be forced
to find something.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.730
So travel goes, cooking comes.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.680
She's still thinking
the same thing.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.960
I call the crew, I go, boys--

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.980
because it was only men.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.140
There would be women
today, I promise.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.180
I've worked with a lot
of really talented women,

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.737
but it was only guys then.

00:14:23.737 --> 00:14:25.570
I go, we're not going
to Tokyo or Hong Kong.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.986
We're going to
shoot in my kitchen

00:14:26.986 --> 00:14:28.930
and make a little cooking thing.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.460
We shot, put it together.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.140
I'm telling you,
you're going to see it.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.290
It was my "Gone with the
Wind," my "Godfather"--

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:42.400
I like that-- my "Godfather."

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.150
So we'll watch it.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.281
And just know, there's a
little stutter for those of you

00:14:46.281 --> 00:14:46.780
in the room.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.000
People watching this after
the fact will see it fine.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.510
So now, understand is Sam
the cooking guy before he

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.460
was really Sam the cooking guy.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.180
And I want you to try
and notice the mistakes.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.374
You'll see the shadow
of the camera guy's head

00:15:01.374 --> 00:15:02.290
on one of my cabinets.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:03.250

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.760
There's a shot out the window
and there's a big C stand

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.810
that they use to hold equipment
that had tarps and junk on it.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.150
And I can't find
my whisk in this.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.270
The guy says, let's
cut that part out.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.215
And I go, no, it feels
kind of authentic.

00:15:17.215 --> 00:15:17.840
We'll leave it.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.440
So this is me before me was me.

- Hi, I'm Sam, the cooking guy.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.720
Today, we're going to make
lemon teriyaki salmon.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.360
I call it rainy day salmon
because back home, we

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.800
used to make it on
rainy days all the time.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.540
And it takes no time at all.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.800
We start very
simply with one pot.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.560
We're going to put the following
seven ingredients into it.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.150
Soy sauce, 1/2 cup.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.260
1/4 cup of sake.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.140
If you don't have
this, you should

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.250
because it's great to drink and
it's excellent to cook with.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:54.160
1/3 cup sugar, teaspoon of
mint ginger, clove of garlic,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.660
juice of one whole lemon--

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.290
juice going everywhere--
a teaspoon of dry mustard.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.094
We're done.

00:16:01.094 --> 00:16:03.260
We're going to put this on
the stove for 10 minutes,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.220
let it simmer.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.800
In that time, we're going to
heat the oven, cut our salmon,

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.450
and we're almost set.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.960
Really, it only needs to be
there for maybe 10 minutes

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.307
maximum.

00:16:13.307 --> 00:16:15.140
You just want it to
thicken up a little bit.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.315
Grab my whisk.

00:16:16.315 --> 00:16:17.630
OK, hang on.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.600
I can't find my whisk.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.190
OK, we're not going
to use a whisk.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.880
You just need to stir it around.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.380
All we're going to do now
is we're going to baste it.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.940
It doesn't get any easier
than this, honestly.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.640
We're going to pop
this under the broiler.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.640
Five minutes on this side, five
on other side, and that's it.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.994
If you bring this salmon to
the table looking like this,

00:16:37.994 --> 00:16:39.410
people are going
to be blown away.

It's like anything.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.140
The first time you do it,
you're maybe OK at it.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.430
The 10th time, you get better.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.644

while to find my voice.

accent was thicker.

00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:10.160
It was.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.420

any O-U words yet.

I'll get there.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.500
So we take that demo
and I send it out.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.040
I managed to put
together five names

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.790
of people in the industry.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.690
My ultimate goal,
our local stations.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.670
The idea was like, make
it once and sell it

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.484
1,000 times around the country.

00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:32.150
But I don't want to
go to local stations

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.090
first because if they
hate it, they're not going

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.010
to watch it if I get it fixed.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.864
By the way, hi.

00:17:37.864 --> 00:17:38.780
You just came in late.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.363
You missed a lot of
really good stuff.

I'm sorry.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.290
Really good stuff.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.600
And I've given out really
good prizes so far.

The next person's talk, you
might want to come earlier.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:52.310
So I don't want to send
it to a local station

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.700
because they're not going to
watch it a second time if I

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.140
figured out that it blows.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.230
So I send it to outside people.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.370
Nobody likes it.

in Chicago actually says--

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.580
can I swear?

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.110
I'll just say the letter.

He actually said, you don't
have an effing chance.

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:14.360
But he didn't say effing.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.500
He said the whole word.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.660

would say that to you?

now I'm so pissed.

to a couple local stations

Do you want to do it now?

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.314
You want me to come back?

00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:02.480
What's good for your sched--

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.170
right?

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:03.930
It's crazy.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.730
I also sent it to channel 6,
which then was a Fox station.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.300

month later from a guy named

president of programming.

I got your tape.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.280
I put it in.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.125
I watched it.

00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:25.250
He goes, I really liked it.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.980
He goes, you're kind
of like a little odd--

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.940
what you guys watched.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.100
That made me odd.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.270
Goes, you're a little odd, but
we'd love to talk with you.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.090
So I go in.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:40.190
They put me on TV twice a
week doing a 90-second segment

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.539
on their morning news,
Monday and Friday.

00:19:44.539 --> 00:19:45.080

Here's the first one.

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:47.060
Here's the first one.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.530
So I go that first day.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.020
I'm going to be on
at like 10 to 8:00.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.400

about quarter to 8:00.

I'm in the green room,
which-- they're never green,

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.261
by the way.

00:19:59.261 --> 00:20:01.260
And he goes, we've got
to bump you a little bit.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.884
And I go, uh oh, here it comes.

00:20:02.884 --> 00:20:03.800
They watched it again.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.027
They realized I'm a fake.

00:20:05.027 --> 00:20:06.110
They're not putting me on.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.490
He goes no, no, no.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.640
We just need to
put you 10 after.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.600
And I think he could
see how nervous I was.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.810
I mean, honestly, my heart
was moving in and out

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.280
of my sweater.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.990
So he took me into
the control room

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.090
where I could see
the studio behind me.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.670
I could see the big
board and all the TVs

and stuff they look at.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.029
And it calmed me down.

00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.820
And then I went in.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:29.370

going to use this to make it.

We're going to use these.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.210

I like to start with a 10-ounce
Italian crust, bought it

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.090
from the store.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.610
We're going to take and we're
going to brush barbecue sauce

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.860
on the crust, just about--

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.440
oh, I don't know-- about 2
tablespoons' worth of it.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.650
On top of that, we're
going to put maybe 1/4

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:11.300
cup of smoked gouda cheese.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.540
I've got 2 cups of
shredded chicken.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.150
I bought a deli roasted
chicken at the supermarket.

You can make your own.

This is much easier.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.800
I've mixed it with a couple
tablespoons of barbecue sauce

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.710
as well.

minutes exactly.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.230
Let's pull our pizza out
and see how it looks.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.690
See, that's just perfect.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.400
Put it on here.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.491
We're just going to cut it
because that's what you do.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.310
You can use one of those
pizza wheel cutters,

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.688
but I just like to
use a regular knife.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.900
I think the last
thing I'm going to do

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.960
is I would throw just a
little fresh, chopped cilantro

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.995
on the top of this.

00:22:27.995 --> 00:22:31.065
We'll take one bite just so
you can see I eat my own food.

00:22:31.065 --> 00:22:32.965
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.230
Maybe we won't take one bite.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.370
It's awesome.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.370
I'm the cooking guy.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.489
I'll see you next time.

00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:46.030
- Very, cool.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:46.640
- There he is.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.530
- We want to welcome Sam,
the cooking guy, to the show.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:50.160
- Thank you.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.277
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:51.277 --> 00:22:52.110
SAM ZIEN: All right.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.770
So they asked me, where did
you learn to cook, your mom?

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.980
I go, my mom is a great cook.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.300
I take the tape and I send it to
her, a VHS, and send it to her.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.790
She calls me up and she goes--

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.370
I go, hello?

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.661
She goes, I was a good cook?

00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:08.160
I go, what?

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:08.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.668
She goes, I watched the tape.

00:23:09.668 --> 00:23:10.830
You said I was a good cook.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:11.425
I go, no, mom.

00:23:11.425 --> 00:23:12.550
I said you're a great cook.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.924
She goes, you said
I was a good--

00:23:13.924 --> 00:23:16.400
I'm not arguing with my mother
about what I said on TV.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:24.330
So a year after these segments,
we win two Emmys, a local Emmy.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.870
Same statue, but it can't
be seen by more than 50%

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:29.010
of the country.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.185
You win Emmys for 90
seconds of television.

00:23:31.185 --> 00:23:33.930
It's fantastic.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.210
I was like, hey, what?

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:41.640
You can win Emmys for a
commercial's length of stuff?

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.950
So then it becomes
a half-hour show.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.010
By the way, this whole
year that I'm doing this,

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.770
I'm not making a cent.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.060
They didn't offer me money.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.020
I didn't ask for money.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.930
It's not that I'm
independently wealthy,

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.870
but I knew I needed them
more than they needed me.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.910
They actually kicked
a guy, a chef, off

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.757
of their channel to put me in.

00:24:02.757 --> 00:24:04.590
And I don't think it
was because I was free,

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.730
I think it was because
I was different.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.070
I wasn't the same.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:14.880
So then, it becomes a half-hour
show that was produced,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.440
shot, edited by channel 6 and
the county television network,

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.590
shared.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.810
After a year, that
won two Emmys.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:28.170
Like holy smokes, this
Emmy thing is fun.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.544
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:37.920
The general manager of
channel 6 at the time

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.030
takes me in his office.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.040
I'm eventually making money.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.230
By the time the
first year ends, I'm

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.700
making a couple hundred
dollars each time these things

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.200
air, so like 400 bucks a
week, which is excellent.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.480
And when the half-hour
show-- he sits me down.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.090
He goes, here's what
we're going to do.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.589
We're going to pay
you the same way.

00:24:53.589 --> 00:24:55.680
Every time it airs,
you're going to get this.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.110
First time I get a paycheck
after the half hour

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.710
show starts airing, there's
no half-hour money on it.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.800
I call the payroll
people and they go,

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.430
oh, he just needs to tell us.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:06.600
We'll get it going.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.342
I call him up.

00:25:07.342 --> 00:25:08.550
I say, hey, blah, blah, blah.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.556
He goes, I never said that.

00:25:10.556 --> 00:25:12.180
I go, wait, sorry,
you never said what?

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.250
He goes, I never said I'd pay
you for the half-hour shows.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.605
Well, I stood in your office.

00:25:16.605 --> 00:25:17.730
You were at the flip chart.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:18.480
You did the thing.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.980
We had the whole conversation.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.830
Al was there.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.750
He goes, I never
said I would pay you.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.530
I go, oh, OK.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.642
Hang up the phone.

00:25:26.642 --> 00:25:29.100
Now, I start finding out that
this guy-- this is this guy's

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.180
MO.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.190
Says one thing,
does something else.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:33.390
Pretends to be religious.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:34.890
He's a religious guy.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:38.550
His denomination doesn't matter,
but he wore it like a jacket,

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:42.390
except he was a piece
of you know what.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.100
Say one thing, do
something else.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.260
I said, I won't work
for this guy anymore.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.210
But I know if I walk
up to him and say

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.347
I'm going to quit
in two weeks, he's

00:25:50.347 --> 00:25:51.930
going to say, tell
you what, quit now.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.256
You're done.

00:25:53.256 --> 00:25:55.380
And I didn't want to just
go quietly into the night

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.740
and not have people that were
following my segments on TV

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.210
just think that I'd quit.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:04.260
Because social media
15, 14 years ago

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.720
wasn't really like it is now.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.610
I didn't have a huge following.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.900
So I decided I would take
myself off the air myself.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.270
So one day-- it's a Friday.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.820
And just as the
segment's ending,

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:17.895
I'm sitting there
talking to the anchors.

00:26:17.895 --> 00:26:18.900
And I go, guess what?

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.410
Big news.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:19.993
They go, what?

00:26:19.993 --> 00:26:20.790
I go, next Friday.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.510
They go, yeah?

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.070
I go, is my last day.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.260
By the time I got home,
there was an email,

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.310
don't bother coming back.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.400
But at least I got
to say my last day.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.980
So now, along comes
the Discovery Networks

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:35.890
to do a show.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.140
Would you be interested
in doing a show?

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.630
Of course I would.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.790
So we shot something
called "Just Cook This"

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.170
with Sam the cooking guy.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.750
And they go, but
Discovery Health

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.790
is the network it will air on.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:48.960
We like to do healthy stuff.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.841
What would your angle be?

00:26:50.841 --> 00:26:52.965
Because it's not like you're
known for health food.

00:26:52.965 --> 00:26:54.310
I go, it would be this.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.200
Here's a pizza.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.570
Here's lots of cheese and
pepperoni, stuff like this.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:58.960
Don't eat the whole thing.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.770
The guy laughed.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:00.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.450
And he bought it
and I had a show.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.470
It was kind of that.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.690
Until Oprah came along and
bought, literally bought,

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.300
the Discovery Health
number on the dial

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.860
everywhere and turned it into
the Oprah Winfrey Network, OWN.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.430
And I'm not bitter that she
had to have her own freaking

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:24.840
network and felt that her people
felt that my stuff was too

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.040
male oriented.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.560
But it's not.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.930
I mean, I think a lot of
guys watch my show, maybe

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.330
more than generally watch
straight cooking shows.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.790
But still, the predominance
of my audience is female.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.790
No, they didn't like me.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.560
So that's fine.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.460
Meanwhile, a publisher
comes along and says, would

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.633
you like to do a cookbook?

00:27:45.633 --> 00:27:49.160
I'd love to do a cookbook.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.880
Cookbook comes
out, the first one.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.605
There's now three.

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:57.510
They go, we got you a
spot on the "Today Show."

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.960
That's fantastic,
the "Today Show."

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.269
It's great.

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:02.310
I go to the "Today Show."

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.160
It's in New York.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.990
It's a big deal.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:10.220
Matt Lauer had not been
fingered as a bad guy yet.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.390
America was so
innocent in those days.

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:14.390
I do the segment.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:20.030
I'm making chicken enchiladas,
white chicken enchiladas.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.140
They're on the website.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.030
They're in my first cookbook.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.730
There's cream and
there's cheese.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.766
And Hoda Kotb, in the
middle of this as I'm

00:28:29.766 --> 00:28:31.640
putting cream and cheese
in, she goes, uh oh.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.640
I go, what?

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.470
There's a lot of something
there, a lot of fat.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:41.000
I go, well, if a recipe
says, serves six, it should.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.170
Don't eat the whole
thing yourself.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.770
Second I say that, I said, don't
eat the whole frickin' thing

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:46.490
yourself.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:47.930
The crew laughs.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.720
And I think, uh oh, is this
bad that I've said "frickin' "

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.010
on the "Today Show?"

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.270
Segment ends.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.790
I'm walking down the
street with my wife.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:29:00.380
I get a text from the "Today
Show," two important questions.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.850
Can you come back
in three weeks?

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:06.636
My wife's like, what, what?

00:29:06.636 --> 00:29:08.700
I go, they want me back.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.022
She goes, they do?

00:29:10.022 --> 00:29:11.230
Well, thanks for the support.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:12.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.670
Yeah, they do.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.040
I go, and there's
another question.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.210
She goes, what?

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:19.780
I don't know.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.571
It's not important.

00:29:20.571 --> 00:29:23.107
She goes, what is it?

00:29:23.107 --> 00:29:23.690
And I read it.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:26.500
She goes, everybody
here wants to know

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.032
where your wife got her boots.

00:29:29.032 --> 00:29:30.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.360
So here's the moral.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.490
Just when you think
it's all about you,

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.610
it's about your wife's boots.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.540
Anyway, I go back.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.240
I go back.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.024
And here's my second
time on the "Today Show."

00:29:43.024 --> 00:29:43.690
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.690
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.370
- We're back with
"How Low Can You Go"

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.950
and how to make delicious
dishes on a budget.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.770
- Now according to Sam Zien,
the four most common items

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.550
found in your kitchen
cabinets are these--

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.100
bread, peanut butter,
pasta, and tuna.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.400
So Sam, who's the author
of "Sam the Cooking

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.220
Guy," just a bunch of
recipes, is here to show us

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.444
how to turn cheap staples
into new and exciting dishes.

00:30:05.444 --> 00:30:07.860
And Sam, I know especially now
with the way the economy is

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.485
going, everyone is
trying to figure out

00:30:09.485 --> 00:30:11.517
how to stretch the dollar,
how to make it work.

00:30:11.517 --> 00:30:12.850
- We got all this stuff at home.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:13.891
You might as well use it.

00:30:13.891 --> 00:30:17.374
It's easy stuff, simple, quick
little things that you can do.

00:30:17.374 --> 00:30:19.290
And it's not going to
cost you a lot of money.

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:20.748
- New ways to look
at old products.

00:30:20.748 --> 00:30:23.932
- Don't make the same things
the same way over and over.

00:30:23.932 --> 00:30:24.499
- That's what we're
trying to say, Sam.

00:30:24.499 --> 00:30:25.490
- Yes, that's what
we've been saying.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.323
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:26.323 --> 00:30:29.215
- OK, right off the
bat, right off the bat.

00:30:29.215 --> 00:30:29.840
Come over here.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:29.970
Come here.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:30.990
- All right, let's go.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.440
What are we making?

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.910
- Kathie's giving
me the OK, Sam.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:33.770
So we're making a tuna--

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:34.580
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.320
- We're making a tuna--

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.278
- Tuna's the second thing
we have in our house.

00:30:37.278 --> 00:30:38.310
- Please, can I talk?

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.510
I watch this show everyday.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.510
Everybody has issues with
a lot of chatter back here.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.450
Pay attention one minute.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:45.636
Oh, that seemed to work.

00:30:45.636 --> 00:30:47.840
- I hope you enjoy your--

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.340
- Hoda, hope you enjoyed your
last time on the "Today Show."

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:50.870
I'm only kidding.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:51.430
- Hey, it's been fun.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.680
- And I've already
complimented you

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.392
on how pretty your dress is.

00:30:53.392 --> 00:30:54.300
- I was lying about
your eyebrows.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.506
I think they're shabby.

00:30:55.506 --> 00:30:57.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.280
- OK.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.540
Onion-- I don't even
know what I got--

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.880
cucumber, tomato,
Kalamata olives.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.380
We're basically making
a standard Greek salad.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.110
- All right.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.400
- We take some feta cheese.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.012
I love to buy the
block feta cheese.

00:31:10.012 --> 00:31:11.970
I can hear the crew back
there going, this guy,

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.176
it's his last day for sure.

00:31:14.176 --> 00:31:15.550
- They've been
around a long time

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.216
because they don't
talk to us like that.

00:31:17.216 --> 00:31:18.636
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:18.636 --> 00:31:20.234
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.980
SAM ZIEN: So my
editor's with me there.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.360
We leave.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.390
We go for brunch or breakfast.

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.940
And there's no talk about
that being problematic.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.680
There's no talking about
that being problematic.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.710
He just goes, look, it's just
another good "Today Show"

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.380
appearance.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.330
So the "Today Show,"
they send a car

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:45.030
to take you back to the
airport and I'm in the car.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.330
And my wife, who's
now a few hours

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.780
ahead of me or behind,
she's now watched it.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.520
And now people are texting her.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.680
And she's texting me, oh my god.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.510
I go, what?

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:57.780
She goes, I can't believe
what they're saying.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.660
I go, what are they saying?

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.284
She goes, they're
saying you're a hero.

00:32:00.284 --> 00:32:01.680
I go, a hero for what?

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.150
She goes, for telling Kathie
Lee Gifford to shut up.

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:05.330
I go, I never said shut up.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:06.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.786
I said, please, please
can I talk one minute?

00:32:09.786 --> 00:32:11.910
She goes, well, they think
you did something great.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.310
I go, this can't go well for me.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.410
So anyway, that was a Thursday.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.610
By Saturday, Sunday,
it had been online.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.520
It had been watched
like 50,000 times.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.150
Now, it's at 1.7 million
or something like that.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.930
I go to Seattle two
weeks after that.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:26.940
And I get off the
plane in Seattle

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.648
and there's a text
from the "Today Show."

00:32:28.648 --> 00:32:30.070
Hey, we'd like you to come back.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.840
I go, great.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.470
Can you call?

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:35.820
So I call and they go,
that segment was great

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.590
and it generated a lot of buzz.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.600
We'd like you to come
in and address it

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:47.506
with them and we'll have a
coach here to deal with--

00:32:47.506 --> 00:32:48.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.700
An etiquette coach.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.870
So they had a good coach.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:53.190
That was my third time.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.710
It's not been watched very much.

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.910
It was awkward AF.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:58.980
I'm telling you,
Kathie Lee Gifford

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.507
stood beside me and in
the middle of my talking--

00:33:01.507 --> 00:33:03.840
so there was this little
conversation with the etiquette

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.540
coach and then goodbye,
and then I'm cooking.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.010
And she's standing beside me.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.300
She's rubbing my face.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.340
She goes, are we
making you nervous?

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.347
She wasn't making me
nervous, it was just weird.

00:33:13.347 --> 00:33:15.180
And then she takes her
fingers and puts them

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.034
underneath my armpit.

00:33:18.034 --> 00:33:19.450
And she goes, oh,
you're sweating.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.290
OK, A, I had like two
layers of clothing on.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.610
So no, that wouldn't
have been possible.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:26.940
B, I'm a Jewish male.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.031
We don't sweat.

00:33:28.031 --> 00:33:28.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.000
So it was just creepy.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Anyway, I've been there 12
times in total, every other time

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.110
not with them.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.540
They've always put me
with somebody else.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.180
But one of the upshots of
this is I get a phone call

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.300
from a producer at the Stern
show one day, who said, boy, we

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.830
just found that clip.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.284
So here's just
the audio of that.

00:33:48.284 --> 00:33:49.575
HOWARD STERN: What's this clip?

00:33:49.575 --> 00:33:49.844
ROBIN QUIVERS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:49.844 --> 00:33:51.969
HOWARD STERN: A cook telling
Kathie Lee to be quiet

00:33:51.969 --> 00:33:52.727
today on--

00:33:52.727 --> 00:33:54.060
ROBIN QUIVERS: Let me hear that.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.180
HOWARD STERN: Whoever
this is, is a genius,

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.060
if this is for real.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:57.770
Let me hear this.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.340
The cook's name is Sam
Zien, Z-I-E-N, Zien.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.800
And his website is
thecookingguy.com.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.219
And he is my hero.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.070
And I love this guy.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.326
And I think he's a real man.

00:34:15.326 --> 00:34:18.239
And too bad he had to do the mea
culpas back there afterwards.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:19.080
He shouldn't have.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.380
ROBIN QUIVERS: But he
still kept it light.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.354
He's an entertainer.

00:34:22.354 --> 00:34:24.270
HOWARD STERN: That is
the greatest single clip

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.339
that should be played
every day on this show.

00:34:27.339 --> 00:34:28.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:31.380
SAM ZIEN: All right, my
moment on the Stern show.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.270
And by the way, I'm a
huge Howard Stern fan.

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:35.580
Anybody else?

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.120
You got the new app?

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.996
Video, it's got video.

00:34:38.996 --> 00:34:39.960
It's great.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.909
Anyway.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:45.480
So then the
publisher comes back.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.670
They want two more books.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.405
We do the books.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:56.530
Look, the point of the story
for me is really simple.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:58.750
I just wanted to be happy.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:01.320
I say to people, the
guy that you see on TV,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.230
and hopefully the guy you're
seeing now, is the same person.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.880
There's no fake.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:11.190
There's not one on-camera
persona and then another one.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.030
There's just me.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:13.750
If you like me,
great, watch the show.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.590
If you don't like me,
don't watch the show.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:19.050
And honestly, you don't need
to send me an email telling me

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.100
why you don't like me.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:20.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.560
I don't need that.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.910
I have a-- getting to be
a robust YouTube channel.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:30.930
And with that
comes the comments.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:31.979
You're this, you're that.

00:35:31.979 --> 00:35:33.520
You can't do this,
you can't do that.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.478
I watched that episode.

00:35:34.478 --> 00:35:35.010
It sucked.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:36.390
Then I watched that
one and it sucked.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:38.250
And then I watched
that one and it sucked.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.270
I mean, stop watching
me, for God's sakes.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:41.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:43.905
But the concept of--

00:35:43.905 --> 00:35:45.960
look, in the beginning,
I cut myself a lot.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.250
I burned myself a lot because
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:54.522
It's that 10,000 hours concept.

00:35:54.522 --> 00:35:56.480
You do something enough,
you get to do it well.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.970
My third cookbook, I wrote,
cooking is like riding a bike.

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.080
The more you do it,
the better you get.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.780
The reality is, everything
is like riding a bike.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.440
The first time we all rode a
bike, the same thing happened.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.290
We fell off and
we hurt ourselves.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:13.200
And a day later or maybe that
afternoon, you finally get up

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.640
and you can ride a bike.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:19.350
First time you make a
pineapple upside-down cake,

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:20.580
maybe you burn it.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.800
Maybe you follow
the recipe to the T

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.670
and 350 for 55
minutes in your oven

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.760
is wrong because your
oven is not calibrated.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.209
It's really 385.

00:36:32.209 --> 00:36:33.750
Who knows what their
oven temperature

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.880
is unless you have a little
thing that will calibrate?

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.620
So what's the point?

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.852
The point is, when
you do something,

00:36:40.852 --> 00:36:42.810
you should enjoy it
because you'll do it better

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:43.660
than anybody else.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.160
That's true.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.701
There's that book, "Do What You
Love, The Money Will Follow."

00:36:46.701 --> 00:36:48.690
I say it should be
called "Do What You Love,

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.065
You'll Be Really Damn Happy."

00:36:50.065 --> 00:36:51.440
And then maybe
the money follows.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.860
And if it does, it's a bonus.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.320
But literally on the
last day on this planet,

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.030
nobody's going to
remember the money.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:59.250
You're going to remember
how you feel inside.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.180
And that's really
all that matters.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:05.070
The last thing I'll
show you is my now demo.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.740
I wish it didn't stutter,
but it's my demo from today.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:12.030
And now, after all these
years, I found out who I was.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.210
That first demo you saw, I had
all my food all chopped up,

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.340
pre-prepped in little
bowls in front of me

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.010
because that's what cooking
shows did in those days.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.540
You had all that stuff set.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.550
And I didn't know to be myself.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:26.500
I just knew to try and
be like everybody else.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.430
It took me awhile.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:29.160
I finally got it figured out.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.060
And now, I'm happy.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.140
It's me.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.980
It works.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.030
You like me, great.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.730
If you don't like me,
please don't watch.

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:37.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:39.030
Unless you have
one of those boxes

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:43.800
that measures audience watching,
and then watch me and then

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.520
turn it off.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.442
But don't email me.

00:37:46.442 --> 00:37:47.930

00:37:48.979 --> 00:37:50.270
- Hey, I'm Sam the cooking guy.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:51.728
And this is about
me showing people

00:37:51.728 --> 00:37:54.800
how to make regular, everyday,
but really good food.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.150
[CHUCKLES] Look at
them going already.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.117
Little bit more
pepper for color.

00:38:00.117 --> 00:38:00.700
And that's it.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.200
Wow.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.460
Man, is that good.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.710
Tell me that doesn't look
beautiful and pretty and

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.520
amazing.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.680
Look at the colors
in this scene.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.210
That, you just put that out.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:13.110
And I mean food that
anyone can make, anyone.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:13.840
That's a burger.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.950
Look at that.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:17.110
This is a very pretty pizza.

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.780
Why do I now have to start
mixing my own dressing?

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.280
You can if you want to.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.890
I'm here to teach you things
that you can do quickly

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:24.430
and simply.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:27.136
1, 2, 3, 4 ingredients.

00:38:27.136 --> 00:38:28.510
We've got the
raspberries in here

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.695
that went in frozen, the cake,
the peaches in heavy syrup,

00:38:31.695 --> 00:38:33.820
a little bit of butter over
the top, and that's it.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:34.660
Bingo, we're done.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.940
In fact, they call it
a reality cooking show.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.450
Whatever really happens when
we shoot stays in the show.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:41.340
Oh, oh.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.600
Hot, really hot.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.620
Welcome back to the zoo.

00:38:50.956 --> 00:38:53.130
[LAUGHS] Ready for this move?

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:53.630
Here we go.

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.598
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:57.566 --> 00:38:58.310
Nice.

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.310
We're going to take them
and we're going to go--

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.230
Hi, I'm Rachael Ray.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:07.240
And welcome to
"30 Minute Meals."

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.360
Oh god.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.510
Whoa, whoa.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:11.220
And unlike some
other cooking shows,

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.510
there's no fancy ingredients.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.990
In fact, everything comes from
a regular, everyday supermarket.

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:17.520
So we had this idea.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.710
We thought we'd do a
whole show about potatoes

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:23.320
because everybody
likes potatoes, right?

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:27.560
Ready bacon, one of my
favorite things ever.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.040
We did pesto.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.440
We did the goat
cheese, tomatoes,

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.450
the melted mozzarella.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:35.730
This thing, two ingredients.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:37.170
Come on, let's get going.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.570
And the line that I use,
things that are big in taste

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:40.980
and small in effort.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.240
Come on now.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.300
This is crazy good.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.850
You have no idea how
good these guys smell.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:49.500
Cocoa powder on top,
and then the last thing,

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.450
a little bit more of
the powdered sugar.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.680
That makes the cocoa
powder look pretty.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.500
It's perfect.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.180
We've done a good
job here today.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.754
And unlike other
stand-and-stir cooking shows,

00:39:59.754 --> 00:40:01.170
we don't just stay
in the kitchen.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.070
We get out.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.990
We really get out.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:07.820
Today is Sam the
Cooking Guy out at sea

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.610
with the USS Ronald Reagan.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:13.750
Today, we're starting our cool
kitchens on the Light Star.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.820
It's time for the San
Diego County Fair.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.190
Today, we're having
a ball inside.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.910
Let's go.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.320
Come on, everybody.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.010
Let's not just cook with
the coconut oil from Fiji,

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.850
let's go to Fiji.

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:27.880
And we did.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.430
So it only seems right, since
we're in the Mexican Riviera,

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.710
we do some Mexican
Riviera kind of cocktail.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.680
This is my hometown,
Vancouver, British Columbia.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.740
I love this place.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.020
I grew up in this place.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.200
I've been watching the
food on the "Today Show"

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.190
while in Vancouver.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.120
And it's been nice, but
it was time somebody

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.030
did this, something that
everybody could make.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.010
I say this is Canada's
culinary gift to the world.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.900
And so that's it.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.370
Lots of entertainment,
great food, tons of fun.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:53.930
I mean, what more do you
want out of a cooking show?

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:55.850
Why hasn't somebody
thought of this already?

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:58.174
I have no idea.

00:40:58.174 --> 00:40:59.170
What?

00:40:59.170 --> 00:40:59.990
What?

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.610
Oh.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.380
So that's a bunch
of years, but it's

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:22.090
being happy and comfortable
and really liking what you do.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.250
And I get to wake up.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:26.790
I mean, A, I don't have
a very far commute.

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:29.030
It's downstairs.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.380
And I get to do all
kinds of fun stuff.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:35.870
We've shot three shows with the
Navy, two on aircraft carriers,

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.410
and one on a fast
attack nuclear sub

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:42.190
that we got to spend 24
hours on each one of them.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.740
And the Navy is amazing.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.820
It's nothing but
practice, get your game

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.130
down perfect for
the moment when you

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:54.560
have to be able to do everything
without even thinking about it.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.020
It's really spectacular.

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:59.050
There's nothing like being on
the deck of an aircraft carrier

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.720
with those things landing
right in front of you.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.300
It's unbelievable.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:09.070
And the only part that had
been sort of-ish lacking

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.070
is the restaurant thing.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:12.520
And I get that
question all the time.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.420
Sorry.

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.230
And finally, we'll answer it.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:20.770
We're going to open a very
small thing this summer

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.190
in what will become the
new Little Italy food hall.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.650
There will be six
restaurants in there.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:30.574
Mine is called "Not Not
Tacos" because they're tacos,

00:42:30.574 --> 00:42:31.990
but they're not
tacos in the sense

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:34.060
that they're carnitas
or carne asada

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:37.360
or pollo or chorizo,
nothing Mexican.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:41.650
It will be things like
Asian salmon and pastrami

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:44.530
with crispy onions and
melted cheese and coleslaw,

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:47.950
an over-easy egg on top
and that kind of stuff.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.972

SAM ZIEN: We believe it'll be
June 25, last week of June.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.990
But there's six places
that have to all be ready,

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:13.080
and the project itself.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.600
They've closed off Date Street
between India and Columbia.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:21.970

there, really beautiful
spot, beautiful location.

So all the rest
of this stuff has

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:28.360
got to be done
before health permits

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.540
and all that stuff happens.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.500
But it's looking like it's
going to be a good thing.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.000
Yeah.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.240

will follow or something.

00:43:38.274 --> 00:43:40.030
SAM ZIEN: How did I
afford daily expenses

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:41.470
when I wasn't making any money?

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:42.544
Because I didn't.

00:43:42.544 --> 00:43:44.210
That first year, I
didn't make anything.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.750
The second year, I think
I made $16,000, which

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.597
averaged out to $8,000 a year.

00:43:49.597 --> 00:43:50.680
OK, I'm going to admit it.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.413
I was part of the
housing crisis problem.

00:43:53.413 --> 00:43:54.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.690
The banking issue.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.540
I pulled money out
of my house that I

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.640
wish I still had in my house.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.490
But those were the
days when you could

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:15.760
get a loan from the bank to buy
a house with seemingly nothing.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.570
You have a job, you
have warm blood, fine.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:23.020
We'll give you a couple hundred
thousand dollars for a house.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.730
That's what I did.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.740
My wife worked.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.240
And so that's not
completely true.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.980
So my wife worked, that's true.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.700
But I continued to consult for
biotech for a couple of years

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.000
after that.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.270
So I made money that way.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.870
I hated it.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:39.610
I was miserable.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.940
What struck me, as Francesca
was walking me around today

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:47.126
and we got to your tap room--

00:44:47.126 --> 00:44:48.000
and I'm just curious.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.310
I go, are there limitations,
have all the beer you want,

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:52.810
but after four
o'clock or something?

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:56.170
She goes, no, doesn't matter.

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:59.530
So I went from being
the facilities manager

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.780
to the director of operations
at the biotech company.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.080
We're about 125 people.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.640
I reported directly
to the president.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.800
And I go to him one day
and I go, got an idea.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.350
We had a small campus,
four buildings.

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:15.720
And I go, I'm going to
put a basketball hoop

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.400
in between the engineering
and the, whatever, biology

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.150
building.

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:25.580
And he looks at me and he
goes, well, what's that for?

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:30.010
And I go, it's for basketball.

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:31.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:35.650
And he goes, why are
you putting it there?

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:37.615
I go, because a couple
of people have asked.

00:45:37.615 --> 00:45:38.740
I think it's a great thing.

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.730
You go blow off a little steam.

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:43.541
He goes, we're not putting
a basketball hoop in.

00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:46.700
I go, I want you to
think about this.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.455
It's good.

00:45:47.455 --> 00:45:51.760
He goes, I don't want that
scientist spending all his time

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.520
playing basketball, not
being at the bench working.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.190
I said, he doesn't
report to you.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:00.995
He has his own boss, the
director of chemistry.

00:46:00.995 --> 00:46:01.870
And think about this.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.580
Two things are going to happen.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:07.230
He spends all his day
time playing basketball

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:09.540
and now, we know the
guy does nothing.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.650
And he gets fired.

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:14.500
We're getting rid of
terrible dead wood.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:18.880
Or he's working on a really
complex chemical reaction.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.430
He's having trouble
making it come together.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:24.450
He needs to clear his head
instead of sitting at his desk

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.200
and looking at chemistry books.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:26.920
He goes outside.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:31.120
He plays hoops for 15 minutes
or Horse by himself or whatever.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:31.810
It comes to him.

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:34.570
He comes inside and he
fixes it, and it works.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:35.740
That's success.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.900
Either case, it's success.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.780
And he goes, oh, OK.

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.820
We're not putting a
basketball hoop any time

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.040
while I'm president
of this company.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.560
That was the day I
said I need to leave.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.480
I won't work for this guy.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.026
It took me two years
to actually pull

00:46:51.026 --> 00:46:52.900
the trigger on the whole
thing and figure out

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.140
because I didn't want to just
go to another biotech company.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.887
But just look at how
far things have come.

00:46:58.887 --> 00:47:00.970
Honestly, I don't think
that guy would do anything

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:02.125
different today.

00:47:02.125 --> 00:47:03.474
He was like that.

00:47:03.474 --> 00:47:04.890
And he knows how
I feel about him.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.150
We've talked about,
this is ridiculous.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:11.380
But hopefully you guys are in
a good spot, great company,

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:14.200
doing things that
you really like.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.836
And if you don't, then quit
and just don't mention my name.

00:47:16.836 --> 00:47:18.002
I had nothing to do with it.

00:47:18.002 --> 00:47:19.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.400
I'll tell you something.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:21.983
You know what?

00:47:21.983 --> 00:47:25.150
So when I had the idea
to do the cooking show

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:27.910
and then I started looking
for a kitchen, remember,

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:29.770
I only knew what I saw on TV.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:34.800
So I went looking for a kitchen
that looked like a kitchen

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.116
in a cooking show studio.

00:47:37.116 --> 00:47:38.740
AUDIENCE: I'd think
that would ruin it.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.031
SAM ZIEN: So here's what I did.

00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:42.280
I took my real
estate background,

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.320
and I went to a lot of
the real estate offices

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.650
and I gave them flyers, the
tony, fancy ones, Rancho Santa

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.287
Fe, Del Mar, Fairbanks Ranch.

00:47:49.287 --> 00:47:51.370
Do you have a client that
would like their kitchen

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.810
to be featured in
a TV show pilot?

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:54.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:55.690
It wasn't a pilot.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:56.740
It was nothing.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.170
It was a dream.

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.360
It was as close to
being a pilot as me

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.180
dreaming about having kids
one day when I was like 18.

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.530
I'm going to have kids one day.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:07.051
It was that.

00:48:07.051 --> 00:48:08.800
And I went and I looked
at a few kitchens.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.850
And there's always something
wrong, too many windows,

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:17.380
not too many windows,
but ugly countertops.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:21.550
So I'm sitting in my kitchen
one day, my older kitchen,

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.470
writing notes about
what I needed to do.

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:26.675
And there was a
moment, I'm thinking.

00:48:26.675 --> 00:48:27.550
I look at my kitchen.

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:29.650
I go, this show's
for regular people.

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:33.260
I don't want a 2,000 square
foot kitchen in Rancho Santa Fe

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:33.760
home.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.710
I want my kitchen.

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:37.330
So that made sense.

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:40.990
Cutting myself, leaving that
in when I do that on the show

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:42.070
made sense.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:44.200
I heard that Rachael Ray,
one of her first times

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.620
on her show, "30 Minute
Meals," she cut herself.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.720
They stop the tape.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.370
They got the blood off.

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:52.570
They Krazy Glued it--

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:53.615
which you can do that.

00:48:53.615 --> 00:48:56.003
It won't hurt you.

00:48:56.003 --> 00:48:57.750
I've done it so many times.

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.130
They Krazy Glued her finger,
put a little makeup on it,

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:01.713
rolled the tape back,
and then carried

00:49:01.713 --> 00:49:03.984
on like it didn't happen.

00:49:03.984 --> 00:49:05.650
Well, if I drop
something or burn myself

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:08.290
or whatever, that to me, is--

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.382
I said it-- reality
cooking show.

00:49:10.382 --> 00:49:12.340
But you have to specify
reality because there's

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.510
a lot of fake
reality these days.

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:21.760
You're not going to find 10
white supremacists with a 10

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.775
all-black church choir on the
same little island that have

00:49:25.775 --> 00:49:27.955
to live together for 10 days.

00:49:27.955 --> 00:49:29.080
That's not going to happen.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.280
That's not reality.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.190
That's made up stuff
that producers force.

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:34.840
This is realistic.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.870
If my doorbell rings in
the middle of the show,

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:40.465
I might yell at whoever it is,
but we leave that kind of stuff

00:49:40.465 --> 00:49:40.970
in.

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:42.130
And that's when people
will come up and go,

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.020
you make me feel
like I can cook,

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.110
like you've given me license
to screw up and make mistakes.

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:48.370
Well, that's what it is.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:50.950
That's what cooking is.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.416
Until you start doing it,
don't stay out of a kitchen

00:49:54.416 --> 00:49:56.540
because you don't think
that you can make mistakes.

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:57.040
You can.

00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:00.660
I make them all the
time, big ones too.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.650
Lost a piece of the
end of my finger once.

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.630
The crew called it finger
halibut for months.

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.446
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:07.766 --> 00:50:09.390
It was really good
until the end of it.

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:11.990
And we're like, oh, I do not
know where that piece of finger

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.490
went.

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:14.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:15.370
Seriously.

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.200
It was such a creepy,
horrible moment.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.928
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.490
Good.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:23.940
AUDIENCE: Is it
still the same crew?

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.110
SAM ZIEN: No, it's changed
so many times since then.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:27.550
It really has, yeah.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:30.370
But always, the people
have been great.

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:33.130
And when people have
taken the spot of somebody

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:36.160
else and they didn't know if
they could do that kind of--

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.790
it's very different
television because apart

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:41.890
from a very small
period of time,

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:46.390
it's one camera, which
is a bit of a dance

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.340
that you have to learn.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.900
Three cameras--
three cameras here.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.150
There are Food Network shows--

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:53.590
Tyler Florence had
a show, I can't

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:55.090
remember what it was called--

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:58.810
they shot the same
food three times.

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:02.540
One shot wide, you'd see the
whole kitchen and all of him.

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.540
The second one, you'd see
him from the waist up.

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.800
And the third one,
just his hands.

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.510
And he'd make that same
pasta carbonara three times,

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:12.250
far, medium, close.

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:15.070
And then an editor sits
with three separate lines

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:16.850
and builds it all together.

00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:17.830
I don't like that.

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:20.800
I like a relationship
with one camera.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.050
People say, I feel like
you're talking to me.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:25.390
And I think that's
because of how we shoot,

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:27.707
partially me because
I'm weird, whatever,

00:51:27.707 --> 00:51:29.290
but partially because
it's one camera.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:33.708
I can look right at that camera
like I'm talking to somebody.

00:51:33.708 --> 00:51:34.333
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:34.333 --> 00:51:37.080
It's like the new sitcoms where
they do the single cameras

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:37.830
like "The Office."

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:38.496
SAM ZIEN: Right.

00:51:38.496 --> 00:51:40.210
Exactly.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:41.310
That's exactly what it is.

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.610
It really works for me.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:47.280
I shot an infomercial
last February

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.770
and another one this
past February in Tampa.

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.240
And there were like six cameras.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:55.281
And that's a weird
thing to get used to.

00:51:55.281 --> 00:51:57.030
You really have to
know which one at which

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:58.860
times and there's a lot of this.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.502
No, that one right now.

00:52:00.502 --> 00:52:01.637
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:01.637 --> 00:52:03.720
And you're looking here
and you hear the snapping,

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.570
and you don't want to
take your gaze off.

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:07.320
But it's fine.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.010
It's fine.

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:08.950
Yeah.

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:09.450
All right.

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:10.325
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:10.325 --> 00:52:11.536
SAM ZIEN: Oh.

00:52:11.536 --> 00:52:13.410
When we started, my wife
did all the cooking.

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:15.510
The only thing I
did back in that day

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:18.300
when I said I'm going to start
a cooking show, the only thing I

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.710
did was grill.

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:22.830
And that's because I'm a guy.

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:24.360
We're supposed to.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.001
We pee standing up
and we're supposed

00:52:26.001 --> 00:52:27.000
to be able to grill too.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:30.591
And I couldn't do things yet.

00:52:30.591 --> 00:52:32.040
I couldn't grill.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.710
I mean, I did it because
it was kind of my job.

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:37.525
And I would go take a steak
out or burger or chicken,

00:52:37.525 --> 00:52:38.400
ruin it, bring it in.

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.500
We'd eat it quietly
without talking

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:44.550
about how much I had ruined it.

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:47.796
But now I, most of the
time, pee sitting down.

00:52:47.796 --> 00:52:48.920
Too much information, but--

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:49.726
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.190
My grill game has
really been elevated.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:55.590
There may be something to this.

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:56.700
Let me make a suggestion.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:58.116
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:58.116 --> 00:53:00.948
AUDIENCE: Spread
too thin [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:00.948 --> 00:53:03.780
SAM ZIEN: That's right.

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:07.390
See, I'm as stupid in person
as I am on television.

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.840
Five years ago,
we started a thing

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.330
called "The Sam Livecast."

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.760
And it was actually
live, for anywhere

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.290
from 30 minutes to an hour and
a half, a couple days a week.

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.590
And it was great.

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:26.520
It was too long.

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.380
It didn't need to be live.

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.250
People don't need
to be watching live.

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:34.260
And we've changed it.

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:39.120
It's now an average of
three to five minutes.

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.722
We had almost 70,000
subscribers now,

00:53:42.722 --> 00:53:45.180
that have really grown literally
in the past couple months.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.960
We found a three- to five-minute
thing that really works.

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.770
And people like it.

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:53.040
Most of those short things,
you don't even see the person.

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.610
It's just like the
tasty things, the pot

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:59.562
from the top down and the
hands, and then takes it away

00:53:59.562 --> 00:54:01.270
and comes back, cook,
that kind of stuff.

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:04.440
So there's more personality
in mind, talk through it.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.260
You see me sometimes,
but we like

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.680
it and people seem to be
really liking it, so yeah.

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.680
And as my son, who shoots
most of my stuff now,

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.113
says F television.

00:54:17.113 --> 00:54:18.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.310
He goes, dad, people
don't care anymore.

00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:22.110
It doesn't matter.

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:23.325
They want the content.

00:54:23.325 --> 00:54:24.365
Yeah.

00:54:24.365 --> 00:54:25.254
FRANCESCA: Thank you
for coming, guys.

00:54:25.254 --> 00:54:26.545
SAM ZIEN: Yeah, thank you guys.

00:54:26.545 --> 00:54:28.640
[APPLAUSE]
