00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.040
Hangover cures-- science
has got the real deal.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.796
And I know you need
them, you drunks.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.106
Hey, everyone, Laci
Green here for D News.

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:14.480
There are 101
hangover cures that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.329
have been passed
down through the ages

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.792
by those older, wiser,
and drunker than us.

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:21.500
And now scientists
are adding to the mix.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.040
A new study published in the
journal Food and Function

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.945
took a good, hard look at how
various non-alcoholic beverages

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:30.910
affect a hangover, 57 different
beverages, actually, including

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.090
herbal teas and
carbonated drinks.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.840
And what was the winner of
a hangover helper trials?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.210
It was Sprite.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.449
First, I was like, OK,
did Sprite fund this?

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:39.990
Or what's up?

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.650
But they actually did not fund
the study's favorable findings,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.532
so I guess I'll
give it a chance.

00:00:44.532 --> 00:00:46.490
In order to understand
how Sprite of all things

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.823
helps a hangover, first, we
got to talk about hangovers,

00:00:48.823 --> 00:00:51.686
my favorite subject in
the world, basically.

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:54.140
Hangovers aren't caused by
booze itself, but by the way

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.570
your body breaks it down.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.640
While you're passed
out on the couch,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.380
your liver is breaking
down the alcohol,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.460
which produces an
absolutely evil chemical

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.417
byproduct called acetyldehyde.

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:04.500
This is a chemical is
responsible for cute things,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.340
like headaches, light
sensitivity, thirst, sweat,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.220
and vomiting.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.430
Eventually your body converts
acetyldehyde to acetate,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.330
which means no more
hangover for you.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.160
So in order to
eliminate a hangover,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.830
you want to convert it to
acetate as fast as possible.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.330
What they found was
that herbal teas

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.280
slow the activity of enzymes
that convert it over.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.720
So just say no to herbal teas.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.761
But Sprite-- and
actually use soda water

00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:30.510
if you don't want all
the sugar-- speed up

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.140
the enzyme activity that's
needed to get over a hangover.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.390
Not a fan of Sprite
or soda water?

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.000
Don't worry.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.750
There are other remedies
that help clear acetyldehyde

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.410
from the body.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.360
Apparently there's a famous
soup from New Orleans

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.276
called yaka mein soup.

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:45.630
It has a salty broth, some
kind of meat, chicken or beef,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.594
onions, and a sliced egg.

00:01:47.594 --> 00:01:49.010
Scientists at UC
Davis say there's

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.210
a reason this soup
is called Old Sober.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.500
The eggs in the soup help
to clear the acetyldehyde

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.230
from the body, while the
salty broth helps replace

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.600
important salts lost in all
the peeing you're doing,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.270
which then speeds up
the recovery process.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.920
Scientists say, however, that
the best hangover treatment

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.990
is not to get a hangover at all,
an important nugget of wisdom

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.806
I probably won't follow.

00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:11.430
So you can prevent a hangover by
eating fatty foods to regulate

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.804
the body's absorption
of alcohol,

00:02:12.804 --> 00:02:15.200
by drinking a glass of
water between drinks,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.370
and by avoiding
dark drinks, which

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.780
have higher levels of
hangover-exacerbating

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.390
congeners.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.015
So it is Friday,
the end of the week.

00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:25.000
Let's put that scientific
wisdom to work.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.870
Thanks for joining me, folks.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.370
If you have your
own hangover cures,

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.684
you should share down below.

00:02:28.684 --> 00:02:30.350
And we'll be back
with more D News soon.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.150
See you then.
