00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:03.637
- HEY, GUYS.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.439
FIRST OF ALL,
I JUST WANT TO SAY

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.774
WE ARE GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE.
IT'S BEEN GREAT.

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:12.079
- YES, AND WE HAVE NOTICED
THAT YOU HAVE GOTTEN VERY...

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.781
C-COMFORTABLE,
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY COMFORTABLE

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.350
WITH YOUR COMFORTABLENESS.

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.318
- I'M SO COMFORTABLE
WITH YOU GUYS BEING HERE,

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.187
BUT BE CAREFUL.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.256
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
INJURING YOURSELVES AT NIGHT

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.924
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING OUT,

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:25.993
AND NIGHTTIME'S A VERY
DANGEROUS TIME TO WORK OUT.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:29.062
- ANYWAY, UH,
GIVEN, YOU KNOW,

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:31.965
THE EVENTS
OF THE LAST DAY OR SO,

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.335
WE'VE REVISED THE PROPOSAL
THAT WE HAD THE OTHER DAY

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.304
TO SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE APROPOS.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.406
ADAM.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.141
WE GIVE YOU...

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:43.544
THE GAYLORD'S FORCE!
- HA-HA?

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.245
THE GAYLORD'S FORCE.

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.648
IF YOU CAN TAKE
THE PAIN OF A MAN'S UNIT

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:49.650
PRESSING INTO YOUR [bleep],

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:52.119
YOU'VE GOT THE STRENGTH
TO DO ANYTHING.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.354
- IS ONE SLOGAN
THAT WE'RE TOYING WITH.

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:55.656
- YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
HAVEN'T SEEN THIS T-SHIRT,

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.057
AND I DON'T APPROVE OF IT.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.195
OKAY? BUT I WILL
BE A JUNIOR MEMBER OF THE CREW,

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:03.197
SO, I SHOULD PROBABLY
AUDITION FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.264
CHECK THIS OUT.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:07.334
FROOT LOOPS EVERYWHERE!
- WHOO!

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.803
- YEAH. AND I'M GEARING UP
FOR THE REAL THING!

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.371
A FREAKIN' PHONE BOOK!
LET'S DO THIS!

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:12.706
- GIVE IT TO 'EM, ADAM.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.541
- I DON'T HAVE
MY PHONE BOOK HERE.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.810
I'M SO SORRY. I DON'T HAVE IT.
- GET THE PHONE BOOK.

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:18.445
- HURRY UP, HURRY UP.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.980
- SO, YOU SEE WHERE
WE'RE GOING WITH THIS, RIGHT?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.582
IT'S BASICALLY A POWERFUL,
HEALTHY MESSAGE

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:23.116
THAT BEING GAY
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE WEAK,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.085
OR, UM...
- MMM...

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.087
- OKAY, WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.489
- ARE YOU HAVING SEX
WITH EACH OTHER?

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:31.458
- WE'RE NOT HAVING SEX.
WE'RE JUST...

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.527
SOAKING.
- [chuckles]

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.462
YEAH, BUT I THINK
THIS SOAK

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.131
IS ABOUT TO TURN
INTO A POWER WASH,

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:41.268
SO, IF YOU BOYS
WOULDN'T MIND SCOOTING ALONG.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.136
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
- [clears throat]

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.273
- I DON'T MIND HAVING YOU HERE.
RIGHT?

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.509
I DON'T EVEN MIND ALL
THE SUCKIN', AND THE SCREWIN',

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:50.711
AND THE SCREAMIN'
WHEN YOU EJAC.

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:53.547
BUT I NEED TO KNOW IF YOU WANNA
BE A PART OF THIS SHOW OR NOT.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.818
'CAUSE IF YOU DO, I NEED YOU
TO PULL OUT OF HIS [bleep]

00:01:57.851 --> 00:01:59.887
AND GET TO WORKING!
DO YOU GET ME?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.488
- OKAY, OKAY, RELAX.
SOUNDS COOL.

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:03.257
- WE'RE INTERESTED.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.058
- ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH!

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.895
OH, OH, HAND CRAMP.
HAND CRAMP. THAT HURTS.
