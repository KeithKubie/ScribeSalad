00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.440
Okay Michael, what's the answer?

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.560
&gt;&gt; Well, there's the answer to the question that

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.660
I thought you were asking and then there's the question

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.790
that you then at the end actually asked. It

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.230
seems like at the end you asked what is the

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.550
difference between the two, the distance between the two

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.810
lines and I I feel that, like that's just The,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.200
like the norm of x1 minus x2. But, the difference

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.340
between these equations is going to be well ,uh, W transpose.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.470
&gt;&gt; Well why not write down what you're, what you're telling over in the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.360
side over here and then we can put the final answer in the box.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.230
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.920
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what now?

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.580
&gt;&gt; W transpose. X1 minus x2, equals two.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.760
&gt;&gt; Right, so you used ,ah, the power of subtraction

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.590
to make that work. Okay, very good. Okay, so that's

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.740
the difference between those two equations, now how am I

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.470
going to go from there to figuring out the distance between

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.160
x1 and x2?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.360
&gt;&gt; I still feel like its just that norm of x1 minus x2.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.720
&gt;&gt; Okay, but I want you to tell it to me

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.250
in terms of w. And what I want you to tell

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.510
it to me in terms of w, because the only thing

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.730
we have to play with here is w, well w and

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.590
b. That's what defines our line. And so I want to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.235
find the right line, the only thing I get to play

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.910
with, W and b. So, I'd like to know something about

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.960
the relationship between w and the distance between x1 and x2.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.350
&gt;&gt; Well, w transpose times their differences too.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.990
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's true.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.160
&gt;&gt; That's not telling us the distance, though.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.740
So what is the distance in terms of W?

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.600
&gt;&gt; Well what if I told you w was a number? What would you do if it was just a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.100
simple scalar and you had this equation, and I wanted

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.210
to know what x1 minus x2 was. What would you do?

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.710
&gt;&gt; And I wanted it in terms of W?

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wanted to know what x1 minus x2 was equal to.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.240
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.585
So, if I divide it by w, that would be

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:46.580
helpful' cus then x1 minus x2 would be two over w.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.950
&gt;&gt; Right, but you can't do that because w is a

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.720
vector, and you can't really divide by a vector, at least

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.350
not in the world that we're talking about. So how are

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.680
you going to... Make that work. Would you like a hint?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.289
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.830
&gt;&gt; Well here's a hint ,we want to move w over from one side to the other.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.320
We could start doing all kinds of tricks with inverses, and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.110
with the inverse of a vector. There's all kinds of things

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.130
that you could do, but actually the easiest thing way of

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.070
doing it is getting rid of w on one side. And

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.820
the easiest way to do that. Is to divide both sides

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.080
by the length of W. So, rather than dividing both sides

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.140
by W. We divide them by the length of W. Now

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.160
what is dividing W by the length of W, give you?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.010
&gt;&gt; So, right. So W divided

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.750
by the length of W, is a normalized version of W. So it's like

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.910
Something that points in the same direction as W, but sits on the unit's sphere.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.660
&gt;&gt; Right. No, that's exactly right! Alright, in fact it is a sphere

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.200
because it's a, it's a hyper sphere I suppose. right! So we do that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.850
and that effectively is like giving you a value one, like you said it's a unit

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.570
sphere. And so now we're actually talking about the difference between

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.920
the vector X one and the vector X two projected onto

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.107
the unit sphere and that's equal to two over the [CROSSTALK].

00:03:07.107 --> 00:03:09.131
&gt;&gt; Wait. That's what X minus two is

00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.640
perjected onto the W vector The normalized W vector.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.250
&gt;&gt; Right, the doubilized norm, the normalized

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.850
&gt;&gt; The double normalized U vector,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.795
right

00:03:19.795 --> 00:03:20.940
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So does that help you?

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.570
&gt;&gt; Does that actually answer the question? Doesn't seem like it does.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.750
&gt;&gt; no, it does.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.020
&gt;&gt; So is that, okay, alright, hang on [LAUGH] ,so ,the x one minus x two,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.600
dotted with W. So W, W, we don't know. It could be anything. Can it? So.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.250
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.330
&gt;&gt; We've taken x one minus x two, projected

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.710
it onto W. So it's like the, the length

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.890
of x one minus x two, but in the w direction.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.420
&gt;&gt; Exactly. That's exactly right. So, the link, which, by the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.110
way, is, well, is exactly right. So, what we've just done is

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.820
we have found the link of x1 and x2 in the W

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.420
direction. What do we know about w with relationship to the line?

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.280
&gt;&gt; W is the parameter to the line.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.850
&gt;&gt; Yes, but in particular. As with, in the case with any

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.650
hyper plane, W actually represents a vector that's perpendicular to the line.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.720
&gt;&gt; And since we chose X1 and X2, so that they would in fact, their

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.450
distance or the difference, would in fact

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.880
be perpendicular to the line. What we've just

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.870
done is projected. That rose the difference

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.520
between those two vectors onto something that is

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.300
also perpendicular to the line. And so what that ends up giving us is, in fact,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.980
its length. So we maximize the length. Of x1 minus x2 with doing what with W.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.479
&gt;&gt; I see so the thing on the left is,infact, have we answered

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.225
the quiz yet by the way, or are we still working on that?

00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:51.700
&gt;&gt; I'm going to say we are still working on it.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.840
&gt;&gt; Oh men ,alright this is a hard quiz. The thing on left, not just

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.150
were the braces are, that actually turns out

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.660
to be the distance between the two. Hyperplanes.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.610
&gt;&gt; Right, let's let's give that a letter. Let's call it M.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.540
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.650
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.140
&gt;&gt; And, we're saying that equals two over the norm of W. And

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.460
that's, so, if we want to maximize that The only thing that we have

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.670
to play with is W and that is made larger and larger as

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.150
W gets smaller and smaller, in other words, pushing it toward the origin.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.240
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.290
&gt;&gt; So it set Ws to all zeroes, and we should be golden.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.590
&gt;&gt; Right, except if we push all the Ws to zero, we might not be

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.740
able to correctly classify our points but what this does tell us is that we have

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.230
a way of thinking about The distance of

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.030
this vector and where the decision boundary ought

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.470
to be. We want to find the parameters of

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.450
the hyperplane such that we, maximize this distance

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.900
over here represented by this equation while still being

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.380
consistent with the data. Which makes sense because that's actually

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.110
what we said in the first place. By the

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.570
way, this thing has a name and it's. The reason

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.870
why I chose M, it's called the margin, and

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.230
what all of this exercise tells you is that your

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.200
goal is to find a decision boundary that maximizes

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.560
the margin, subject to the constraint that you actually want

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.040
to correctly classify everything, and that is represented

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.890
by that term. Now somehow, it feels like

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.180
having gone through all this we outta be

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.760
able to use it for something and turn in

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.760
into some other problem we might be able

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.830
to solve. Might be able to maximize for ,uh,

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.370
so that we can actually find the best line. And it turns out we can do that.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.950
&gt;&gt; Have we answered the quiz yet?

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.560
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah we did. Which is in fact what I wanted so the answer is.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.540
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.270
Somebody gets that, that would be pretty impressive.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.310
&gt;&gt; That would be very impressive. Or

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.870
anything similar to this I would accept. [LAUGH]

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.400
In fact I probably better will. Okay good. So, it turns out

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.820
that this whole notion of thinking about finding the optimal. Decision boundary

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.530
is the same as finding a line that maximizes the margin. And

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.850
we can take what we've just learned, where we've decided the goal is

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.610
to maximize two over the length of w and turn

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.730
it into a problem where we can solve this directly.
