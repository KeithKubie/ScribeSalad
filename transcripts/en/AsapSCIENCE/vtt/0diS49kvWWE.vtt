00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
Food is a favorite pastime for many
which is convenient because we needed to

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.220
live but what would happen to you in
your body if you were to completely stop

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.170
eating food right now in the first six
hours all is fairly normal your body

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.740
begins to break down glycogen which
stores energy in your body into glucose

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.130
which are cells use as fuel around 25%
of energy generated this way is used for

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.050
your brain alone while the rest goes
some muscle tissue and red blood cells

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.830
but after about six hours this method of
energy production halts as the glycogen

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.190
stores deplete which can lead to the
notorious Hangry or hungry and angry

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.329
feeling that many of us know too well at
this point your body at his estate

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.469
called ketosis as it begins to fast or
starve because there's very little

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.680
glucose in your blood your body must
begin to break down fat for energy this

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.640
fat is in turn broken down into fatty
acids however your brain can't use long

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.230
chain fatty acids which is a problem
because there's no more glucose and the

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.109
faster too large to cross the blood
brain barrier your brain changes modes

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.739
and begins to use ketone bodies for
energy which are short-changing

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.030
relatives of fatty acids this works for
the time being but ultimately only 75%

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.979
of the brain's energy requirements can
come from ketones it still needs glucose

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.299
which means your cognitive functioning
becomes impaired now it's important to

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.000
mention that you don't have to be
starving to be in ketosis many people

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.200
enter this phase if they're on a low
carb diet or professional athletes who

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.909
use all their carbs for an extended
period of time like marathon runners

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.759
will be in this state as well however
beyond 72 hours not only will your mood

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.270
and energy suffer but your brain will
start to break down your body's own

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.170
protein the proteins release amino acids
which can be converted into glucose

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.340
which is great news for your brain but
bad news for your body basically your

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.590
body is cannibalizing itself by
destroying your muscle mass

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.810
in women under nutrition often shut down
the menstrual cycle as the body tries to

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.310
reduce energy expenditure bone density
diminishes and both men and women may

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.509
experience loss of libido within a few
weeks the body's immune system will be

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.750
so we can without any vitamins or
minerals that many will die from disease

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.709
otherwise it will continue to use up all
energy sources in till there was no

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.390
glucose fat tissue or muscle man left
one of the more common causes of death

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.180
is cardiac arrhythmia or heart attack
due to the tissue degradation in the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.390
heart diaphragm and body this is fairly
common in those suffering from anorexia

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.380
of course the body experiences severe
organ failure all around

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.650
starvation can lead to death in a short
as three weeks or up to seventy days as

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.890
documented during the Irish hunger
strikes in 1981 though the duration of

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.970
survival is greatly influenced by how
hydrated you are and the amount of fat

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.829
reserves your body has which some ways
is incredible that the body can sustain

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.170
for so long with no food and get
approximately seven hundred and ninety

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.220
five million people around the world
have to deal with this reality the good

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.510
news is that the seven richest countries
have pledged to lift 500 million people

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.980
out of hunger and malnutrition by 2030
but we need to hold them accountable

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.970
we're working with an organization
called global citizen to do just that

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.609
and here's a really easy way that you
can help out to buy sharing this video

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.170
and then heading to the global citizen
website forum here you'll be adding her

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.419
voice to an important educational
movement towards ending hunger worldwide

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.250
you can click the screen or use the
links in the description it really only

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.420
takes a few moments

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.709
