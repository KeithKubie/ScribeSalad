00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.910
According to official company statements,
Ronald McDonald is “second only to Santa

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.460
in terms of recognition”.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.649
While this may or may not have been true at
one point in time, you might have noticed

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.829
of late that the formerly prominent fast-food
mascot has almost completely disappeared from

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:33.829
the lime-light.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.850
So how did Ronald McDonald come about in the
first place and where has he disappeared to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.260
in recent years?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.460
The original idea behind the character of
Ronald McDonald was to more or less capitalize

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.420
on the popularity of the iconic Bozo the Clown,
with initial efforts on this front simply

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.550
advertising on that children’s show in the
Washington D.C. area.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.850
When this succeeded in getting kids to drag
their parents to McDonald’s, in 1963 McDonald’s

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.330
decided to create their own similar character,
with the first to portray the Bozo knock-off

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.420
being none other than Willard Scott, who would
later go on to much more prominent fame for

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.750
his decades of work on The Today Show.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.369
Wanting to expand the character, McDonald’s
hired Ringling Bros. clown Michael Polakovs,

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.679
better known as Coco the Clown, to re-do the
look of Ronald McDonald.

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.979
You see, at the time Ronald’s garb featured
a cardboard tray for a hat and a paper cup

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.110
over his nose- not exactly prime time material.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.670
What Polakovs came up with is the now iconic
look of the character.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.590
With this, Ronald McDonald was ready for the
big-time, at which point Scott was promptly

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.590
fired from the role in 1966 and Bev Bergeron
was hired to take his place.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.259
While you’ll often read Scott was fired
for being too fat, which would be kind of

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.789
ironic if true, this seems unlikely as Bev
Bergeron had many more tires in his trunk

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.289
than Scott at the time.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.830
From this, it seems more likely that Bergeron
was probably hired as he was vastly more qualified

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.360
for the role, with an extremely impressive
resume as an entertainer, magician, and clown.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.690
In fact, later in life he would actually receive
a Lifetime Achievement Fellowship Award from

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.870
the Academy of Magic Arts and Sciences.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.019
Speaking of that switch, “officially”
McDonald’s publicly only recognises nine

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.769
men as having played the character since the
1960s when he was created.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.370
Or to put it another way, if McDonald’s
is to be believed, more men have walked on

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.980
the moon than played Ronald McDonald.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.099
The reality though is that hundreds, if not
thousands of actors have portrayed Ronald

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.780
over the years, with said actors usually being
tasked with being the Ronald for a specific

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.080
area or set of McDonald’s restaurants.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.889
Save for a few scant references to the handful
of men known to have portrayed Ronald in an

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:07.120
official capacity, McDonald’s as a company
otherwise insists that Ronald is real and

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.640
that there is only one of him.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.840
Towards this end, the company has rules in
place that prevent two or more Ronalds from

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.909
ever appearing in costume at the same place
at the same time, with the one apparent exception

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.139
being a secret convention the company holds
for Ronalds it sometimes refuses to admit

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.459
actually happens.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.150
In an attempt to catch McDonald’s out, The
Baltimore Sun once reached out to the company

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.950
and asked how Ronald seemingly appeared in
so many places at once if there was only one

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.950
of him.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.459
In response, the company issued a statement
they claimed was from Ronald himself reading:

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.060
“If I told you all my secrets, they wouldn’t
be secrets anymore.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.379
Let’s just say that between you, me and
Santa, it’s magic.”

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:54.349
Meaning it’s the official position of McDonald’s
as a company that not only is Ronald McDonald

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.299
real, but that he has magic powers.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.930
So as to not break the carefully crafted illusion
that Ronald is real, men playing him are forbidden

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.879
from disclosing their real identity in costume
and even from taking the costume home with

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:10.879
them.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.249
As an idea of how seriously the actors playing
Ronald take this, we’re aware of at least

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:20.790
one example of a Ronald being detained by
police as a direct result of the “no admitting

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.580
you’re just an actor while playing Ronald”
policy handed down by McDonald’s.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.130
Specifically, after an actor in full Ronald
McDonald costume and makeup got into a minor

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.110
car crash in Saginaw, Michigan in 2000, they
were temporarily detained after being asked

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.880
to give their real name and hilariously refusing
to respond with any other name than “Ronald

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.449
McDonald” to the police.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.319
In addition to being expected to never disclose
that they’re an actor just playing a part

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.509
while in costume, out of costume actors who
play Ronald similarly aren’t supposed to

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.669
acknowledge that fact, instructed to refer
to themselves as “Ronald’s helpers”

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.300
when asked what their job is.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.919
Understandably, given the character’s position
as the face of their brand, McDonald’s takes

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.580
the training of prospective Ronalds incredibly
seriously, putting anyone wanting to don his

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.199
iconic outfit through an extensive and grueling
training program.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.740
While this training program has evolved somewhat
over the years to reflect the changing climate

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.330
surrounding the brand and its products (more
on that in a moment), it is mostly the same

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.870
as it was back in the 1970s and follows the
rules and guidelines set out in a book titled

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.650
Ronald and How.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.139
This was penned by a former Ronald named Aye
Jaye, with the help of advertising executive

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.139
Roy Bergold.

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:42.009
At this point, Jaye was serving as the company’s
“boss clown” (a role that mainly involved

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.850
overseeing the hiring and training of Ronalds).

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.479
As you might have guessed from the title,
the book teaches actors everything they need

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.629
to know about being Ronald McDonald.

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.699
For example, along with containing information
about the character’s history, Ronald and

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.389
How gives practical advice on everything from
applying makeup to walking around in those

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.229
ridiculous shoes.

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.720
The book also teaches Ronalds how to interact
with children in a non-creepy way, which when

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.850
playing a clown is always a difficult task.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:16.259
For example, given the rampant stigma against
strange men interacting with random children,

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.610
the book carries a stark warning- “never
to initiate a hug”, instead suggesting Ronalds

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:27.099
respond to a child trying to hug them by turning
to the side and patting the child on the back.

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.330
With this in mind, it’s probably not all
that surprising that prospective Ronalds are

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.099
also subjected to extensive background checks.

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:39.780
Ronalds are also constantly tested on their
suitability for the role by official Ronald

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.949
trainers who are given the power to fire a
Ronald on the spot for any reason if they

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:48.490
ever don’t measure up to the exacting demands
of the company.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.770
Amazingly, these trainers also have the power
to put actors playing the character on “Ronald

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.009
probation” to let them know they need to
literally get their act together.

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:02.850
According to Geoffrey Giuliano, who played
Ronald for about a year and a half in the

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.180
late 1970s, one of the more unusual rules
they also have to follow is never eating McDonald’s

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.820
food in costume.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.970
This is reportedly as it might smudge their
makeup.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:17.539
Giuliano has also claimed that he was forbade
by McDonald’s brass from informing children

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:19.379
how McDonald’s hamburgers were made.

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:24.300
Instead, if a child asked where hamburgers
came from, the Ronalds are instructed to give

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.889
a stock response about McDonald’s burgers
being grown in patches where they are picked

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:30.000
whole.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.889
This was presumably done so as to maintain
consistency with a series of McDonald’s

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:39.200
ads from the early 1970s aimed at children
which claimed that hamburgers grew in a special

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.789
patch in a place called McDonaldland, instead
of made by slaughtering approximately half

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:47.530
a million cows per year…

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.749
According to canon established by the ads,
McDonaldland is a place in which McDonald’s

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:58.190
food grows naturally in a world being populated
with things like french fry bushes (which

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.159
we actually think is a way better name for
the potato plant), trees that bear piping

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:08.909
hot McDonald’s apple pies, and volcanoes
filled with milkshakes instead of lava, which

00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:13.210
would have made the whole historic destruction
of Pompeii a lot more fun.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:18.270
One can only imagine how Pliny the Eldar’s
supposed “Fortune favors the brave” statement

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.400
might have morphed.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.389
As you might have guessed, Ronald McDonald
hails from this magical land and throughout

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:31.830
the 1970s seemed able to travel between it
and our own world at will somehow.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.250
As time went on though, Ronald was shown visiting
McDonaldland less and less, with modern ads

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:41.400
and promotional material suggesting that he
has seemingly decided to live in our world

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.400
permanently.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.170
A fact that segues nicely to the training
of more recent Ronalds.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:51.510
You see, in recent years McDonald’s has
been attempting to rebrand Ronald and distance

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:57.010
themselves from accusations that the character
exists only to peddle junk food to children,

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:02.269
with some even going so far as comparing Ronald
McDonald to the old Joe Camel cigarette ads,

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:07.380
which while officially not aimed at teens,
studies showed a full 1/3 of teen smokers

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.470
in the U.S. chose to smoke Camel cigarettes
before the less comic-like version of the

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.010
character was phased out because of the public
backlash.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:20.180
In an attempt to get around similar negative
PR, but still keep their iconic mascot, McDonald’s

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.110
has recently pushed Ronald as an advocate
for health instead…

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.630
A thing worth noting is that, according to
McDonald’s, Ronald’s goal has never been

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:34.850
to sell McDonald’s food but promote values
the company considers integral to its brand.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:40.209
In fact, officially Ronald’s position within
McDonald’s is that of national spokesman.

00:09:40.209 --> 00:09:45.060
McDonald’s maintains then that Ronald is
merely an ambassador for goodwill and happiness

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.130
and that his main concern has always been
fun as well as educating children about “important

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:56.130
subjects, such as fire safety, exercise, health
and hygiene, anti-bullying, self-esteem and

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.250
literacy”.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:02.649
Of course, many of these lessons take place
inside McDonald’s restaurants, not to mention

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:08.220
all of the ads with Ronald where he’s clearly
trying to sell McDonald’s food to children,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.820
but we digress.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.470
The first rumblings that McDonald’s were
considering ways to revamp Ronald came about

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:20.460
in 2002 when rumors began circulating that
they were going to reduce visibility of the

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.560
character in promotional material in the wake
of sustained negative coverage of the brand

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.470
and accusations that it was playing a role
in the childhood obesity epidemic.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.620
While McDonald’s did admit that the character
was going to play a reduced role in advertising,

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.080
top brass in the company stated the reason
for this was due to research suggesting the

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:44.220
character didn’t resonate with children
anymore, with one executive noting simply:

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.680
He reminds me of Mickey Mouse — iconic but
dated.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.949
The kids have moved on.

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:56.130
A year later in 2003 McDonald’s began trying
in earnest to revamp Ronald’s image, announcing

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.820
that the character had promoted from mascot
to “Chief Happiness Officer”- a new position

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.120
created just for him.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.790
Exactly what, if any, official duties a Chief
Happiness Officer HAS aren’t really clear,

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.910
with one McDonald’s executive noting that
Ronald doesn’t even get paid, and further

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:16.399
noting about the question of Ronald’s salary:
“Ronald doesn’t go out to work.

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:17.899
He goes out to have fun.”

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:22.790
In truth, it would appear from accounts of
former Ronald McDonalds, the gig pays anywhere

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:27.740
from about $40,000 per year on up to nearly
half a million dollars per year, depending

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:33.160
on what district one is assigned, how prominently
McDonald’s chooses to use you, etc.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.380
In fact, the top Ronalds reportedly even get
their own fancy office with secretaries and

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.720
bodyguards to boot, with the latter apparently
necessary as older children sometimes like

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.880
to throw things at Mr. McDonald, and some
adults also behave badly towards him.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:53.370
In any event, in 2005, McDonald’s pitched
Ronald as a “global ambassador of fun, fitness

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.529
and children’s well-being”, releasing
a series of ads showing him tearing it up

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:00.140
on a snowboard and juggling fruit.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.890
These ads coincided with a fundamental shift
in how McDonald’s trained Ronalds, with

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.900
the company making it known that any actor
wanting to play the character now had to be

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.899
fit enough to sell the idea they could do
everything Ronald did in the ads.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:18.149
According to insiders, McDonald’s went as
far as to straight up fire long-time Ronalds

00:12:18.149 --> 00:12:19.790
it felt were too out of shape.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:24.440
At the same time the company also began training
Ronalds to give basic health and nutrition

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.630
advice to children as well as to teach games
that doubled as exercise.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:34.240
However, to ensure uniformity amongst Ronalds,
the advice they are able to give is limited

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.940
to stock, scripted answers handed down by
McDonald’s, and Ronalds are under strict

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:44.050
instructions to never, ever go off script,
being told to tell any curious children or

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.509
adults asking questions they don’t have
a scripted answer for to “ask someone wearing

00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:50.290
normal shoes”.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:55.540
Following this and the somewhat lackluster
response from the public to this change, McDonald’s

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.260
once again slowly began downplaying the role
of the character in advertising, occasionally

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.459
responding to comments and queries about Ronald’s
continued status as the company’s mascot

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:09.480
by saying that, while Ronald was still around,
he was focusing his efforts on promoting Ronald

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.460
McDonald House Charities.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:16.110
And here we should note that while Ronald
was less visible in McDonald’s advertising,

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.810
the company still had hundreds of official
Ronalds on its payroll across the globe to

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:24.200
promote the brand in person and at various
events.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.790
Unwilling to let go of the character, however,
in 2012, McDonald’s decided to try and revamp

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:35.149
Ronald again, quietly hiring Tony Award winning
designer Ann Hould-Ward to secretly work on

00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:36.449
updating his look.

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:42.220
Unveiled to the world in 2014, the new Ronald
ditched his old yellow jumpsuit for a goofy

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.959
looking shirt and bow tie combo, accessorised
with a garish red blazer.

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:51.270
The change in look coincided with an announcement
from McDonald’s that Ronald would be taking

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:56.350
an active role on social media and that he
was looking forward to hearing feedback about

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.350
his new outfit.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:01.960
Although McDonald’s would later claim that
Ronald’s foray onto social media was a rollicking

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.839
success, his new look was near-universally
derided to the point that the top trending

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:10.120
phrase on Twitter the day the new outfit was
revealed was “NotLovinIt”.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.120
(Oh Internet denizens…

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.120
Never change.)

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.660
Commentators additionally noted that the change
came off as more desperate than anything and

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:20.690
that it was clear the company had attempted
to make Ronald look less, well, clown-like.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:25.000
In addition to giving Ronald a new look, McDonald’s
announced that he was “setting out on a

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.290
global mission to rally the public through
inspiring events”, a fairly nebulous goal

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.790
the company declined to elaborate on.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.069
Ronald however did, being quoted as saying:

00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:36.300
Selfies …here I come!

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.190
It’s a big world and now, wherever I go
and whatever I do…I’m ready to show how

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.589
fun can make great things happen.

00:14:43.589 --> 00:14:47.850
Since then, at least according to McDonald’s,
Ronald has basically spent his time doing

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.940
what they as a company claim he’s always
done- tout the benefits of an an active, healthy

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.420
lifestyle to children worldwide.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.700
In fact, if McDonald’s are to be believed,
along with not paying Ronald, apparently Mr.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.670
McDonald has literally never taken a day off
since he joined the company in 1963, save

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:08.920
for a brief period in 2016 when all those
creepy clown sightings happened…

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.569
In response to these events, McDonald’s
released a statement noting that Ronald would

00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:17.139
be limiting the amount of public appearances
he made due to the “current climate around

00:15:17.139 --> 00:15:18.320
clown sightings in communities”.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:25.940
Officially, as of 2018, Ronald is still very
much (apparently) a slave labor employee of

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:30.020
the McDonald’s corporation and the company
maintains that he’s not only real but have

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.800
acknowledged that he possesses both magical
powers and is presumably immortal due to the

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.470
fact they’ve noted he will likely continue
to serve in his role as a brand ambassador,

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:45.010
spokesman and advocate for a healthy lifestyle
forever, and has never appeared to age.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:50.589
So, just to recap, rather than admit that
its company mascot is just a series of guys

00:15:50.589 --> 00:15:55.779
in a costume, McDonald’s instead maintains
that one of their employees is actually an

00:15:55.779 --> 00:16:01.260
ageless magical clown hailing from another
dimension that can bend reality, space and

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.130
time to his will and tries to attract children
to his abode.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:27.279
A fact that’d be hilarious if it wasn’t
also the exact plot 

00:16:27.279 --> 00:17:10.110
of IT.

00:17:10.110 --> 00:18:39.120
If you’ve ever wondered why there is often
a second capital letter in surnames starting

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.169
with “Mac” or “Mc”, this is because
“Mac” and “Mc” are prefixes that mean

00:18:43.169 --> 00:18:44.169
“son of”.

00:18:44.169 --> 00:18:49.080
Early inconsistencies in records are what
led to having both Mc and Mac prefixes.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.910
Mc is just an abbreviation of Mac, and both
can actually be abbreviated further to the

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.260
much less common M’.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.550
So someone with the last name of MacDonald
is sort of like someone with the last name

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:05.059
of Johnson—likely, each had ancestors with
the name of Donald or John respectively.

00:19:05.059 --> 00:19:09.440
From this, you can probably see why Mc and
Mac names typically contain a second capital

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440
letter.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.510
Since proper nouns are capitalized, you would
write “son of Donald,” not “son of donald.”

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:21.500
In the same way, you would usually write MacDonald
rather than Macdonald, but there are obviously

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.500
exceptions.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:27.130
Surnames have been around so long that sometimes
they get changed, and in some families, the

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.510
second capital letter was gotten rid of.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.919
There was also a prefix for “daughter of”
but these mostly fell out of favour.

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:37.240
The daughter prefix was Nc, short for the
Gaelic “nighean mhic.”

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.230
Surnames for women like NcDonald were fairly
popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, but

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.490
after that time there were only a few secluded
mentions of them.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.620
To a lesser extent, “Vc” was used to denote
“grandson of,” so that a person would

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:55.050
have two surnames, like John MacDonald Vcmaster
for John being the son of Donald who in turn

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:59.500
was the son of a master of some sort, but
this tradition was never incredibly popular

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:16.470
and 
is 

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.670
not as prevalent today.
