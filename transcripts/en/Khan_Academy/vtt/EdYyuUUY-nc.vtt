00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.040
In the last video, we
started with a star

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.840
in its main sequence,
like the sun.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.670
And inside the
core of that star,

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.300
you have hydrogen
fusion going on.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.680
So that is hydrogen fusion,
and then outside of the core,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.370
you just had hydrogen.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.170
You just hydrogen plasma.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.930
And when we say plasma, it's
the electrons and protons

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.600
of the individual atoms
have been disassociated

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.066
because the temperatures
and pressures are so high.

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.940
So they're really just
kind of like this soup

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.390
of electrons and protons,
as opposed to proper atoms

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.140
that we associate with
at lower temperatures.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.970
So this is a main sequence
star right over here.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.510
And we saw in the last
video that this hydrogen

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.160
is fusing into helium.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.570
So we start having more
and more helium here.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.380
And as we have more
and more helium,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.320
the core becomes
more and more dense,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.300
because helium is a
more massive atom.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.290
It is able to pack more
mass in a smaller volume.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.710
So this gets more
and more dense.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.485
So core becomes more dense.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.900
And so while the core is
becoming more and more dense,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.340
that actually makes the fusion
happen faster and faster.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.710
Because it's more dense,
more gravitational pressure,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.080
more mass wanting
to get to it, more

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.600
pressure on the
hydrogen that's fusing,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.670
so it starts to fuse hotter.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.400
So let me write this, so
the fusion, so hydrogen

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.470
fuses faster.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.220
And actually, we even
see this in our sun.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.070
Our sun today is
brighter and hotter.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.960
It's fusing faster
than it was when

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.382
it was born 4.5 or
4.6 billion years ago.

00:01:47.382 --> 00:01:49.340
But eventually you're
going to get to the point

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.020
so that the core,
you only have helium.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.040
So there's going to
be some point where

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.310
the entire core is all helium.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.800
And it's going to be way denser
than this core over here.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.397
All of that mass over there has
now been turned into helium.

00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:03.980
Not all of it.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.672
A lot of it has been
turned into energy.

00:02:05.672 --> 00:02:07.380
But most of it is now
in helium, and it's

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.207
going to be at a much,
much smaller volume.

00:02:09.207 --> 00:02:11.290
And the whole time, the
temperature is increasing,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.490
the fusion is getting
faster and faster.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.280
And now there's this
dense volume of helium

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.850
that's not fusing.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.930
You do have, and we saw this in
this video, a shell around it

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.520
of hydrogen that is fusing.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.490
So this right here is
hydrogen fusion going on.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.019
And then this over here
is just hydrogen plasma.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.810
Now the unintuitive
thing, or at least this

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.870
was unintuitive
to me at first, is

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.180
what's going on the
core is that the core is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.740
getting more and more dense.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.530
It's fusing at a faster rate.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.150
And so it's getting
hotter and hotter.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.360
So the core is
hotter, fusing faster,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.860
getting more and more dense.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.740
I kind of imagine it's
starting to collapse.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.100
Every time it collapses, it's
getting hotter and more dense.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.850
But at the same time
that's happening,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.280
the star itself
is getting bigger.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.690
And this is actually
not drawn to scale.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.865
Red giants are much, much
larger than main sequence stars.

00:03:09.865 --> 00:03:11.490
But the whole time
that this is getting

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.350
more dense, the
rest of the star is,

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.370
you could kind of view
it as getting less dense.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.580
And that's because this is
generating so much energy

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.270
that it's able to more
than offset, or better

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.192
offset the gravitational
pull into it.

00:03:27.192 --> 00:03:28.650
So even though this
is hotter, it's

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.090
able to disperse the
rest of the material

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.700
in the sun over a larger volume.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.100
And so that volume is so big
that the surface, and we saw

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.550
this in the last video, the
surface of the red giant

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.710
is actually cooler-- let me
write that a little neater-- is

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.660
actually cooler than the
surface of a main sequence star.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.910
This right here is hotter.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.360
And just to put
things in perspective,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.490
when the sun
becomes a red giant,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.430
and it will become a
red giant, its diameter

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.780
will be 100 times the
diameter that it is today.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.120
Or another way to be put it,
it will have the same diameter

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.390
as the Earth's orbit
around the current sun.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.120
Or another way to view it
is, where we are right now

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.110
will be on the surface or
near the surface or maybe even

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.660
inside of that future sun.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.690
Or another way to put it, when
the sun becomes a red giant,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.470
the Earth's going to be
not even a speck out here.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.990
And it will be
liquefied and vaporized

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.070
at that point in time.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.660
So this is super, super huge.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.840
And we've even thought about it.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.970
Just for light to
reach the current sun

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.840
to our point in orbit,
it takes eight minutes.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.620
So that's how big one
of these stars are.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.390
To get from one side of the star
to another side of the star,

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.310
it'll take 16 minutes
for light to travel,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.785
if it was traveling
that diameter,

00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:50.740
and even slightly
longer if it was

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.440
to travel it in a circumference.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.682
So these are huge,
huge, huge stars.

00:04:55.682 --> 00:04:57.640
And we'll talk about
other stars in the future.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.950
They're even bigger than this
when they become supergiants.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.590
But anyway, we have the
hydrogen in the center-- sorry.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.660
We have the helium
in the center.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.290
Let me write this down.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.460
We have a helium
core in the center.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.490
We're fusing faster
and faster and faster.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.830
We're now a red giant.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.830
The core is getting hotter
and hotter and hotter

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.300
until it gets to the temperature
for ignition of helium.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.464
So until it gets to
100 million Kelvin--

00:05:26.464 --> 00:05:28.380
remember the ignition
temperature for hydrogen

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.590
was 10 million Kelvin.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.760
So now we're at 100 million
Kelvin, factor of 10.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.490
And now, all of a
sudden in the core,

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.205
you actually start to
have helium fusion.

00:05:41.562 --> 00:05:43.270
And we touched on this
in the last video,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.982
but the helium is fusing
into heavier elements.

00:05:45.982 --> 00:05:47.440
And some of those
heavier elements,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.540
and predominately, it
will be carbon and oxygen.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.880
And you may suspect this is how
heavier and heavier elements

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.200
form in the universe.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.210
They form, literally, due to
fusion in the core of stars.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.260
Especially when we're talking
about elements up to iron.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.440
But anyway, the core is now
experiencing helium fusion.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.556
It has a shell around it of
helium that is not quite there,

00:06:13.556 --> 00:06:14.930
does not quite
have the pressures

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.090
and temperatures to fuse yet.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.460
So just regular helium.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.330
But then outside
of that, we do have

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.170
the pressures and
temperatures for hydrogen

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.690
to continue to fuse.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.035
So out here, you do
have hydrogen fusion.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.590
And then outside
over here, you just

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.140
have the regular
hydrogen plasma.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.370
So what just happened here?

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.990
When you have helium fusion
all of a sudden-- now

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.790
this is, once again,
providing some type

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.810
of energetic outward
support for the core.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.944
So it's going to counteract
the ever-increasing contraction

00:06:49.944 --> 00:06:52.360
of the core as it gets more
and more dense, because now we

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.820
have energy going outward,
energy pushing things outward.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.280
But at the same time
that that is happening,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.290
more and more hydrogen in this
layer is turning into helium,

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.790
is fusing into helium.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.820
So it's making this inert
part of the helium core

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.850
even larger and larger and
denser, even larger and larger,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.600
and putting even more
pressure on this inside part.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.590
And so what's actually going
to happen within a few moments,

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.660
I guess, especially from a
cosmological point of view,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.330
this helium fusion is
going to be burning super--

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.642
I shouldn't use-- igniting or
fusing at a super-hot level.

00:07:30.642 --> 00:07:32.600
But it's contained due
to all of this pressure.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.490
But at some point, the pressure
won't be able to contain it,

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.019
and the core is
going to explode.

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:41.560
But it's not going to be one of
these catastrophic explosions

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.430
where the star is
going to be destroyed.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.860
It's just going to release a
lot of energy all of a sudden

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.060
into the star.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.610
And that's called
a helium flash.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.450
But once that happens, all of
a sudden, then now the star

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.130
is going to be more stable.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.180
And I'll use that in quotes
without writing it down

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.120
because red giants, in
general, are already

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.450
getting to be less stable
than a main sequence star.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.440
But once that
happens, you now will

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.470
have a slightly larger volume.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.650
So it's not being contained
in as small of a tight volume.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.530
That helium flash kind
of took care of that.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.871
So now you have helium fusing
into carbon and oxygen.

00:08:21.871 --> 00:08:24.120
And there's all sorts of
other combinations of things.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.390
Obviously, there's many elements
in between helium and carbon

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.040
and oxygen.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.820
But these are the
ones that dominate.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:38.100
And then outside of that,
you have helium forming.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.250
You have helium
that is not fusing.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.260
And then outside of that, you
have your fusing hydrogen.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.740
Over here, you have
hydrogen fusing into helium.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.700
And then out here in
the rest of the radius

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.390
of our super-huge
red giant, you just

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.530
have your hydrogen
plasma out here.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.742
Now what's going to
happen as this star ages?

00:09:00.742 --> 00:09:02.950
Well, if we fast forward
this a bunch-- and remember,

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.470
as a star gets denser
and denser in the core,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.500
and the reactions happen
faster and faster,

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.833
and this core is expelling
more and more energy outward,

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:10.940
the star keeps growing.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.790
And the surface gets
cooler and cooler.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.080
So if we fast forward
a bunch, and this

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.580
is what's going to happen to
something the mass of our sun,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.790
if it's more massive,
then at some point,

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.290
the core of carbon and
oxygen that's forming

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.302
can start to fuse into
even heavier elements.

00:09:24.302 --> 00:09:26.010
But in the case of
the sun, it will never

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.410
get to that 600 million
Kelvin to actually fuse

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.140
the carbon and the oxygen.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.570
And so eventually you will have
a core of carbon and oxygen,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.100
or mainly carbon and
oxygen surrounded

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:51.420
by fusing helium surrounded by
non-fusing helium surrounded

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.860
by fusing hydrogen,
which is surrounded

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.790
by non-fusing hydrogen, or just
the hydrogen plasma of the sun.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.340
But eventually all of
this fuel will run out.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.140
All of the hydrogen will
run out in the stars.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.770
All of this hydrogen, all
of this fusing hydrogen

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:09.510
will run out.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.520
All of this fusion
helium will run out.

00:10:13.974 --> 00:10:15.140
This is the fusing hydrogen.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.620
This is the inert helium,
which will run out.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.670
It'll be used in
kind of this core,

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.890
being fused into the carbon
and oxygen, until you

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.420
get to a point where
you literally just have

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.225
a really hot core of
carbon and oxygen.

00:10:31.225 --> 00:10:32.100
And it's super-dense.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.558
This whole time,
it will be getting

00:10:33.558 --> 00:10:36.497
more and more dense as heavier
and heavier elements show up

00:10:36.497 --> 00:10:37.080
in the course.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.140
So it gets denser and
denser and denser.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.540
But the super dense thing will
not, in the case of the sun--

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.550
and if it was a more massive
star, it would get there--

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.580
but in the case of
the sun, it will not

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.380
get hot enough for the carbon
and the oxygen to form.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:57.260
So it really will just be this
super-dense ball of carbon

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.782
and oxygen and all of the
other material in the sun.

00:10:59.782 --> 00:11:01.115
Remember, it was superenergetic.

00:11:01.115 --> 00:11:03.170
It was releasing tons
and tons of energy.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.260
The more that we
progressed down this,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.960
the more energy was
releasing outward,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.630
and the larger the radius
of the star became,

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.470
and the cooler the
outside of the star

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:15.360
became, until the outside just
becomes this kind of cloud,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:22.140
this huge cloud of gas around
what once was the star.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.210
And in the center-- so I could
just draw it as this huge--

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.840
this is now way far
away from the star,

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.890
much even bigger than the radius
or the diameter of a red giant.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:37.610
And all we'll have left is
a mass, a superdense mass

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:42.200
of, I would call it,
inert carbon or oxygen.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.150
This is in the case of the sun.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.000
And at first, when it's hot, and
it will be releasing radiation

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.020
because it's so hot.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.400
We'll call this a white dwarf.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.800
This right here is
called a white dwarf.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.080
And it'll cool down over many,
many, many, many, many, many,

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.300
many, years, until it
becomes, when it's completely

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.590
cooled down, lost
all of its energy--

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:12.530
it'll just be this superdense
ball of carbon and oxygen,

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:17.720
at which point, we would
call it a black dwarf.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.080
And these are obviously
very hard to observe

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.680
because they're
not emitting light.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.360
And they don't have quite
the mass of something

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.650
like a black hole that
isn't even emitting light,

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.417
but you can see how it's
affecting things around it.

00:12:33.417 --> 00:12:35.250
So that's what's going
to happen to the sun.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.480
In the next few
videos, we're going

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.730
to talk about what would
happen to things less massive

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.160
than the sun and what would
happen to things more massive

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:41.980
than the sun,
although I think you

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.188
can imagine the more massive.

00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:47.220
There would be so much
pressure on these things,

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.606
because you have so
much mass around it,

00:12:48.606 --> 00:12:50.397
that these would begin
to fuse into heavier

00:12:50.397 --> 00:12:53.670
and heavier elements
until we get to iron.
