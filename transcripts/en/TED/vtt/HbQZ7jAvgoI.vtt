00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:14.485
Hi, I'm Jack,

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.134
and I'm transgender.

00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:19.090
Let me take a guess at some of thoughts

00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:21.448
that might be running
through your head right now.

00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:22.622
"Transgender?

00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:25.964
Wait, does that mean that they're
actually a man or actually a woman?"

00:00:25.988 --> 00:00:28.632
"I wonder if he's had the surgery yet ...

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:30.299
Oh, now I'm looking at his crotch.

00:00:30.323 --> 00:00:32.658
Look to the right,
that's a safe place to look."

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.053
"Yes, I knew it!
No real man has hips like those."

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:36.973
"My friend's daughter is transgender --

00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:39.131
I wonder if they know each other."

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:41.966
"Oh my gosh, he is so brave.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.871
I would totally support his right
to use the men's bathroom.

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:46.808
Wait, but how does he use the bathroom?

00:00:46.832 --> 00:00:47.990
How does he have sex?"

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:51.010
OK, OK, let's stop
those hypothetical questions

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:52.934
before we get too close for my comfort.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.259
I mean, don't get me wrong,

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:57.856
I did come here today to share
my personal experiences being transgender,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.682
but I did not wake up this morning
wanting to tell an entire audience

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:02.967
about my sex life.

00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:06.027
Of course, that's the problem
with being trans, right?

00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:08.797
People are pretty much always
wondering how we have sex

00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:11.884
and what kind of equipment
we're working with below the belt.

00:01:12.318 --> 00:01:14.746
Being trans is awkward.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.752
And not just because the gender
I was assigned at birth

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.474
mismatches the one I really am.

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:20.801
Being trans is awkward

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:24.488
because everyone else gets awkward
when they're around me.

00:01:24.512 --> 00:01:28.216
People who support me and all other
trans people wholeheartedly

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.503
are often so scared to say to wrong thing,

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:33.107
so embarrassed to not know
what they think they should,

00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:34.947
that they never ask.

00:01:35.263 --> 00:01:38.544
Part of what was so nerve-racking
about coming out as transgender

00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:41.798
was knowing that people
wouldn't know what I meant.

00:01:42.198 --> 00:01:43.818
And when someone comes out as gay,

00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:45.203
people know what that means,

00:01:45.227 --> 00:01:46.772
but when you come out as trans,

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:48.464
you have to face the misconceptions

00:01:48.488 --> 00:01:50.988
that will color other people's
impressions of you

00:01:51.012 --> 00:01:52.932
even after you've educated them ...

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:55.669
And you will have to educate them.

00:01:55.693 --> 00:01:56.843
When I came out,

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:58.852
I wrote at 10-page encyclopedic document

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:01.368
with a zip-file attachment
of music and videos

00:02:01.392 --> 00:02:03.707
that I sent to every
single person I came out to.

00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:04.817
(Laughter)

00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:07.601
And I kept it in my email signature
for months afterwards,

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:10.085
because you also
don't ever stop coming out.

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:14.046
I came out to the accountant
helping me with my taxes

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.761
and the TSA agents who didn't know
which one of them should pat me down,

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:19.253
the man or the woman.

00:02:19.902 --> 00:02:22.546
I mean, I just came out
to everyone watching this.

00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:25.656
When I came out to my dad,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.514
to my great relief, he was totally cool
with me being trans,

00:02:28.538 --> 00:02:31.784
but as soon as I started talking
about physically transitioning,

00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:32.974
he freaked.

00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:36.275
And I quickly realized it was because he,
like so many other people,

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.725
think that physical transition
means just one thing:

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:40.954
the surgery.

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:42.616
Now, listen,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.443
if there were one magical surgery

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:47.316
that could turn me into a tall, muscular,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.111
societally perfect image
of a man overnight,

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:51.688
I'd sign up in a heartbeat.

00:02:52.228 --> 00:02:54.478
Unfortunately, it isn't that simple.

00:02:54.502 --> 00:02:57.481
There are dozens of different
gender-affirming surgeries

00:02:57.505 --> 00:03:00.280
from chest surgeries to bottom surgeries

00:03:00.304 --> 00:03:03.239
to facial feminization and man-sculpting.

00:03:03.263 --> 00:03:07.780
Many trans people will only ever undergo
one procedure in their lifetime, if that.

00:03:07.804 --> 00:03:10.140
Maybe because they don't
personally feel the need

00:03:10.164 --> 00:03:12.483
but also because they're expensive,

00:03:12.507 --> 00:03:15.004
and health insurance
is only beginning to cover them.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.390
Instead, the first step for a trans person
seeking physical transition

00:03:19.414 --> 00:03:21.691
is usually hormone replacement therapy.

00:03:22.022 --> 00:03:26.285
Hormones are why I have a deeper voice
and some sparse whiskers on my neck

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:29.013
and a giant pimple on my chin.

00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:32.184
Basically, they put you
through a second puberty ...

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:33.445
it's a blast.

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:34.578
(Laughter)

00:03:34.602 --> 00:03:38.239
Now, because our transitions
are slower and steadier

00:03:38.263 --> 00:03:40.899
than historic misconceptions
can lead people to believe,

00:03:40.923 --> 00:03:42.218
there can be some confusion

00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:45.278
about when to call someone
by their new name and pronouns.

00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:48.107
There's no distinct point
in physical transition

00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:51.210
at which a trans person
becomes their true gender.

00:03:51.234 --> 00:03:53.719
As soon as they tell you
their new name and pronouns,

00:03:53.743 --> 00:03:55.711
that's when you start using them.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.775
It can be difficult to make the change.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.480
You might slip up here and there;

00:03:59.504 --> 00:04:01.854
I've slipped up myself
with other trans people.

00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:03.280
But I always think to myself,

00:04:03.304 --> 00:04:06.798
if we can change from calling
Puff Daddy to P. Diddy,

00:04:06.822 --> 00:04:10.886
and if we apologize profusely
when we've used the wrong gender pronoun

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.473
for someone's pet cat --

00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:15.015
I mean, I think we can make
the same effort

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.649
for the real humans in our lives.

00:04:17.143 --> 00:04:22.565
Now, there is no topic that makes other
people more awkward about trans people

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:24.294
than public bathrooms.

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:26.309
Ah, the bathrooms --

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:29.284
the latest political flash point
for LGBT opponents.

00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:31.447
Here's a fun fact about bathrooms:

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:35.770
more US congressmen have been convicted
of assaulting someone in a public bathroom

00:04:35.794 --> 00:04:37.344
than trans people have been.

00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:39.471
(Laughter)

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:43.608
The truth is we trans people are so much
more scared of you than you are of us.

00:04:43.632 --> 00:04:46.062
It's a huge point of discussion
in trans communities

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:48.234
about which bathroom
to start using and when,

00:04:48.258 --> 00:04:51.594
so we don't attract attention
that could lead to violence against us.

00:04:51.618 --> 00:04:53.594
I personally started using the men's room

00:04:53.618 --> 00:04:58.007
when I started getting confused
and frightened looks in the women's room,

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.015
even though I was petrified
to start going into the men's room.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.775
And often we opt to just
not go to the bathroom at all.

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:06.243
A 2015 national survey of trans people

00:05:06.267 --> 00:05:09.398
found that eight percent of us
had had a urinary tract infection

00:05:09.422 --> 00:05:10.653
in the past year

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:12.653
as a result of avoiding restrooms.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.256
These bathroom bills
aren't protecting anyone.

00:05:16.724 --> 00:05:17.882
All they're doing

00:05:17.906 --> 00:05:21.226
is ensuring that when trans people
are assaulted in bathrooms,

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.064
the law will no longer be on our side
when we report it.

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.358
Being trans means a daily onslaught
of these misconceptions.

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:33.047
And I have it pretty easy.

00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:35.215
I am a white, able-bodied guy

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:38.420
sitting nearly at the peak
of privilege mountain.

00:05:39.382 --> 00:05:40.714
For non-binary people,

00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:43.057
for trans women,

00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:45.113
for trans people of color,

00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:47.508
it is so much harder.

00:05:48.903 --> 00:05:51.706
So I've given you a starter pack
of trans knowledge

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.427
that I hope will lead
to more learning on your own.

00:05:55.608 --> 00:05:57.078
Talk to trans people.

00:05:57.653 --> 00:05:58.849
Listen to us.

00:05:59.587 --> 00:06:01.140
Amplify our voices.

00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:04.379
Take the heat off of us
and educate those around you

00:06:04.403 --> 00:06:05.933
so we don't have to every time.

00:06:06.957 --> 00:06:09.120
Maybe someday, when I say,

00:06:09.144 --> 00:06:11.592
"Hi, I'm Jack, and I'm transgender,"

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.593
the only response I'll get is,

00:06:14.617 --> 00:06:16.450
"Hi, nice to meet you."

00:06:18.256 --> 00:06:19.407
Thank you.

00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:23.085
(Applause)
