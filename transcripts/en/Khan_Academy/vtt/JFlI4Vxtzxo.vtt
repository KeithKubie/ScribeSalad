00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:02.558
- [Instructor] So I have some
data here in the spreadsheet

00:00:02.558 --> 00:00:05.051
you could use Microsoft
Excel or you could use

00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:06.488
Google Spreadsheet

00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:08.694
and we're gonna use the spreadsheet

00:00:08.694 --> 00:00:11.260
to quickly calculate some parameters.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.767
Let's say this is a population.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.153
Let's say this is, we're looking
at a population of students

00:00:15.153 --> 00:00:17.133
and we wanna calculate some parameters

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.284
and this is their ages,

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.990
and we wanna calculate
some parameters on that.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.558
And so first I'm gonna calculate
it using the spreadsheet,

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.735
and then we're gonna think about

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.359
how those parameters change
as we do things to the data.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.074
If we were to shift the data up or down

00:00:31.074 --> 00:00:33.202
or if we were to multiply
all the points by some value,

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:36.026
what does that do to
the actual parameters?

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:38.274
So the first parameter I'm
gonna calculate as the mean.

00:00:38.274 --> 00:00:41.788
Then I'm gonna calculate
the standard deviation.

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:44.179
Then I'm gonna calculate the median,

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.050
and then I wanna calculate,

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.073
let's say, the inter quartile range.

00:00:49.073 --> 00:00:51.073
Inter, I'll call it IQR.

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:55.025
So let's do this.

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:57.512
Let's first look at the
measures of central tendencies.

00:00:57.512 --> 00:00:59.932
So the mean, the function
on most spreadsheets

00:00:59.932 --> 00:01:01.342
is the average function,

00:01:01.342 --> 00:01:03.624
and then I cold use my mouse
and select all of these,

00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:05.862
or I could press Shift
with my arrow button

00:01:05.862 --> 00:01:07.249
and select all those.

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:10.054
Okay, that's the mean of that data.

00:01:10.054 --> 00:01:12.008
Now let's think about what happens

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:13.967
if I take all of that data

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:16.061
and if I were to add a fixed amount to it.

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:17.374
So if I took all the data

00:01:17.374 --> 00:01:18.914
and if I were to add five to it.

00:01:18.914 --> 00:01:20.839
So an easy way to do that in a spreadsheet

00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:23.242
is you select that, you add five,

00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:25.428
and then I can scroll down.

00:01:25.428 --> 00:01:27.511
And notice for every
data point I have before,

00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:29.408
I now have five more than that.

00:01:29.408 --> 00:01:30.885
So this is my new dataset,

00:01:30.885 --> 00:01:32.551
or as I'm calling Data+5.

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.299
Let's see what the mean of that is.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.181
So the mean of that, notice,

00:01:37.181 --> 00:01:39.405
is exactly five more,

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:41.004
and the same would have been true

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:43.039
if I added or subtracted any number.

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.659
The mean would change by the
amount that I add or subtract.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.570
That shouldn't surprise you,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.052
because when you're calculating the mean,

00:01:52.052 --> 00:01:53.708
you're adding all the numbers up

00:01:53.708 --> 00:01:56.081
and you're dividing by
the numbers you have.

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:58.235
If all the numbers are five more,

00:01:58.235 --> 00:01:59.890
you're gonna add five.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.487
In this case, how many numbers are there?

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:04.249
One, two, three, four,
five, fix, seven, eight,

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.352
nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:02:06.352 --> 00:02:09.001
You're gonna add 12 more fives
and then you're gonna divide

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.168
by 12, and so it makes sense
that your mean goes up by five

00:02:14.063 --> 00:02:17.670
let's think about how the
mean changes if you multiply.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.585
So if you take your data

00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:23.464
and if I were to multiply
it times five, what happens?

00:02:23.464 --> 00:02:26.047
So this equals this times five.

00:02:28.352 --> 00:02:32.566
So now all the data points
are five times more.

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:35.210
Now what happens to my mean?

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.627
Notice my mean is now five times as much.

00:02:39.607 --> 00:02:41.784
So the measures of central tendency,

00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:43.550
if I add or subtract,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.832
well I'm gonna add or subtract
the mean by that amount,

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.472
and if I scale it up by five

00:02:48.472 --> 00:02:50.097
or if I scaled it down by five,

00:02:50.097 --> 00:02:53.131
well my mean would scale up
or down by that same amount,

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:56.170
and if you numerically looked
at how you calculate a mean,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.641
it would make sense that this
is happening mathematically.

00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:02.824
Let's look at the other typical measure

00:03:02.824 --> 00:03:05.285
of central tendency,
and that is the median.

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:07.728
To see if that has the same properties.

00:03:07.728 --> 00:03:09.982
So let's calculate the median here.

00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:12.117
So once again you order these numbers

00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:13.968
and just find the middle number.

00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:15.173
Which isn't too hard,

00:03:15.173 --> 00:03:16.806
but a computer can do it awfully fast.

00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:18.474
So that's the median for that dataset.

00:03:18.474 --> 00:03:20.213
What do you think the medians gonna be

00:03:20.213 --> 00:03:22.069
if you take all of the data plus five?

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.424
Well the middle number,

00:03:23.424 --> 00:03:25.187
if you ordered all of these numbers

00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:26.650
and made them all five more,

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.248
the orders, you could think of it

00:03:28.248 --> 00:03:29.631
as being the same order,

00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:31.641
but now the one in the
middle is gonna be five more.

00:03:31.641 --> 00:03:33.933
So this should be 10.5,

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:35.948
and yes, it is indeed 10.5,

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:38.612
and what would happen if you
multiply everything by five?

00:03:38.612 --> 00:03:42.103
Well once again, you still
have the same ordering.

00:03:42.103 --> 00:03:45.962
It should just multiply that by five.

00:03:45.962 --> 00:03:48.626
Yup, the middle number's now
gonna be five time larger.

00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:51.199
So both of these measures
of central tendency,

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.138
if you shift all the data points,

00:03:54.138 --> 00:03:55.542
or if you scale them up,

00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:58.577
you're going to similarly
shift or scale up

00:03:58.577 --> 00:04:00.809
these measures of central tendency.

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.350
Now let's think about
these measures of spread.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.159
See if that's the same with
these measures of spread.

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.099
So standard deviation.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.932
So STDEV.

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.892
I'm gonna take the population
standard deviation.

00:04:12.892 --> 00:04:15.528
I'm assuming that this
is my entire population.

00:04:15.528 --> 00:04:17.278
So let me analyze it.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.517
So let me make sure I'm doing,

00:04:20.517 --> 00:04:22.517
so standard deviation of

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.357
all of this

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.057
is going to be 2.99.

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:33.118
Let's see what happens when
I shift everything by five.

00:04:33.118 --> 00:04:34.551
Actually, pause the video.

00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:36.040
What do you think is going to happen?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.308
This is a measure of spread.

00:04:37.308 --> 00:04:38.905
So if you shift, I'll
tell you what I think.

00:04:38.905 --> 00:04:41.390
If I shift everything by the same amount,

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.529
the mean shifts but the distance
of everything from the mean

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:46.956
should not change.

00:04:46.956 --> 00:04:49.814
So the standard deviation
should not change,

00:04:49.814 --> 00:04:51.596
I don't think, in this example,

00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:53.357
and indeed, it does not change.

00:04:53.357 --> 00:04:54.864
So if we shift the datasets.

00:04:54.864 --> 00:04:56.516
In this case we shifted it up by five,

00:04:56.516 --> 00:04:58.042
or if we shifted it down by one.

00:04:58.042 --> 00:05:00.318
Your measure of spread, in
this case standard deviation

00:05:00.318 --> 00:05:01.473
should not change,

00:05:01.473 --> 00:05:03.836
or at least the standard
deviation measure of spread

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:04.851
does not change,

00:05:04.851 --> 00:05:07.580
but if we scale it, well
I think it should change,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.805
because you could imagine
a very simple dataset

00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:11.791
that things that were a
certain amount of distance

00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:14.477
from the mean are now going
to be five times further

00:05:14.477 --> 00:05:15.476
from the mean.

00:05:15.476 --> 00:05:17.222
So I think this actually should,

00:05:17.222 --> 00:05:18.939
we should multiply by five here,

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:20.571
and it does look like that is the case.

00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:22.172
If I multiplied this by five.

00:05:22.172 --> 00:05:26.104
So scaling the dataset will
scale the standard deviation

00:05:26.104 --> 00:05:28.158
is a similar way.

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:29.912
What about inter quartile range?

00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:32.446
Where essentially we're
taking the third quartile

00:05:32.446 --> 00:05:34.958
and subtracting from
that the first quartile

00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.861
to figure out kind of the
range of the middle 50%.

00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:39.200
Let's do that.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.298
We can have the quartile
function equals quartile

00:05:43.298 --> 00:05:46.632
and then we want to look at our data,

00:05:46.632 --> 00:05:49.215
and we want the third quartile.

00:05:50.388 --> 00:05:52.842
So that's gonna calculate
the third quartile.

00:05:52.842 --> 00:05:55.342
Minus quartile, same data set.

00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:00.187
So now we wanna select it again.

00:06:00.187 --> 00:06:03.011
So same dataset, but
this is now going to be

00:06:03.011 --> 00:06:04.106
the first quartile.

00:06:04.106 --> 00:06:05.949
So this is gonna give us
our inter quartile range.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.659
This calculates the third
quartile in that dataset

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.652
and this calculates the first
quartile in that dataset.

00:06:11.652 --> 00:06:12.985
And we get 2.75.

00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:17.378
Now let's think about whether
the inter quartile range

00:06:17.378 --> 00:06:18.466
should change.

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:19.662
And I don't think it will.

00:06:19.662 --> 00:06:21.248
Because remember, everything shifts,

00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:24.084
and even though the first
quartile is gonna be five more,

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:26.170
but the third quartile is
gonna be five more as well.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.020
So the difference shouldn't change.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.309
And indeed look, the
distance does not change,

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:31.952
or the difference does not change.

00:06:31.952 --> 00:06:34.753
But similarly, if we scale everything up,

00:06:34.753 --> 00:06:37.120
if we were to scale up the first quartile

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.750
and the third quartile by five,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.422
well then their difference
should scale up by five,

00:06:41.422 --> 00:06:43.387
and we see that right over there.

00:06:43.387 --> 00:06:45.005
So the big takeaway here.

00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:46.939
I just use the example
of shifting up by five

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.420
and scaling up by five,

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.820
but you could subtract by any number,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.342
and you could divide by a number as well.

00:06:53.342 --> 00:06:56.291
The typical measures of central tendency

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.939
mean and median, they both shift and scale

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.162
as you shift and scale the data,

00:07:02.162 --> 00:07:04.605
but your typical measures of spread,

00:07:04.605 --> 00:07:08.236
standard deviation and
inter quartile range,

00:07:08.236 --> 00:07:11.206
they don't change if you shift the data,

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:15.373
but they do change and they
scale as you scale the data.
