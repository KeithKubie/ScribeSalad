00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.270
Let's say the United
States economy

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.440
is going into a
recession or maybe

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.090
even worse than a recession.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.400
And you are the Chairman
of the Federal Reserve

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.194
and you need to do
something about it.

00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:11.610
Well, the first
thing you would do

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.060
is that you would lower
the federal funds rate.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.199
And that's the rate that banks
lend to each other overnight.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.490
And the way that you lower
it, if the banks don't do it

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.190
on their own after you
say you want to lower it,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.410
is that you print money
as the Federal Reserve.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.160
And you use it to buy usually
short-term treasury securities.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.660
And then that money
gets deposited in banks.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.410
So the demand for
reserves, because that's

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.750
what these things are, the
demand for reserves goes down,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.620
supply goes up, and the federal
funds rate should go down.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.560
But what happens if
you keep doing this

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.160
and you keep lowering the
federal funds rate all the way

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.710
down so that the
overnight borrowing

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.080
rate is approximately 0%?

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.570
What do you do then
if the economy still

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.820
looks like it's in
a bit of a tailspin?

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.990
Well you could
still print money,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.504
but using that money
to buy short-term debt

00:01:03.504 --> 00:01:04.879
won't help any
because you're not

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.460
going to lower the short-term
overnight interbank interest

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.670
rate anymore.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.670
So you can go out
and buy other things.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.680
And those other things can
be longer term treasuries

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.790
or it could be other
types of securities.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.560
You could buy
mortgage-backed securities.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.620
You could buy commercial debt.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.540
And this idea of printing money,
not just for target interest

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.050
rate, but essentially, to get
that money into circulation

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.710
and maybe to affect other
parts of the market,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.765
this is called
quantitative easing.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.880
And in Bernanke's mind, although
that's exactly what he's doing,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.807
he's printing money
to buy other things

00:01:56.807 --> 00:01:58.890
than what the Fed traditionally
does when he cares

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.880
about the overnight
borrowing rate,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.390
he calls it, not necessary
quantitative easing,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.950
but credit easing.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.220
And in his mind, even
though mechanically they

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.729
are the same thing, in
his mind, he saying, look,

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.770
I'm printing this money not
just for the sake of printing

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.850
the money and putting
it into circulation,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.130
I'm printing money so that I
can buy particular assets where

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.210
it seems like there might be a
log jam in the credit markets.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.470
Because with just printing
money and buying government

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.130
securities, maybe the interest
rates on government debt

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.680
goes down, but maybe
because of panic or crisis,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.520
interest or the prices on these
things don't behave properly.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.390
So in order to fix that, credit
easing, in the Bernanke sense,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.800
would be to go out and
buy this type of asset.
