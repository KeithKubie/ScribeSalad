DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: So hi, and
welcome to the studio today.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.930
I'm David, and I'm here in
India for my very first visit.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.414
I'm really pleased to be here.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.830
It's a beautiful
country, and I've

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.090
enjoyed meeting with
all of the developers

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.390
and all the startups
over the last few days.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.240
We join you today from the
newest studio in the Google

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.980
Developers Live family, the
studio here in Hyderabad.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.870
Brand new, and this is the first
show to be recorded from it.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.920
I'm here today with Uttam,
the regional lead for India.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.107
Happy to have you on board.

00:00:34.107 --> 00:00:35.190
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Thank you.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.660
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN:
We're here today

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.710
to talk about the DevFests.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.400
DevFests are a great
series of events

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.190
that we're right in
the middle of now.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.260
So Uttam, a couple
of years ago, Google

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.060
used to run a series of
events in a handful of cities

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.140
around the world.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.139
What led to the
creation of DevFests?

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:52.180
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Yeah,
David, as you rightly said,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.846
a couple of years ago
Google was running

00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:55.980
events, Google Developers
[? Days ?] and DevFests.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.130
These events were across
multiple cities in the world.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.070
So one of the things
with these events

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.230
is we are only able to touch
those many places because we

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.320
have constraints on
Google [? Spot ?]

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.960
that we can reach out to.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.920
And around a couple of
months after I joined,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.030
one of the things that we saw
from the community coming up

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.530
is there was an interest of
Google Developer Groups going

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.230
out and running larger events.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.640
We saw pilots in India,
similar events in Japan,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.880
places in Europe.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.890
And these were
community-run large events.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.104
So when we saw these
kind of events coming up,

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:32.770
we did understand
that this is something

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.120
that community is interested
in, running larger events.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.650
Around Google I/O last year,
we had the big GDG summit

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.076
in Mountan View.

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.990
We shared this idea
with the community,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.440
in which Google Developer Groups
run events called DevFests.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.230
And the response that
we got was terrific,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.574
so this has been the idea.

00:01:49.574 --> 00:01:50.740
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: Very cool.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.531
Yeah, it's really
exciting that communities

00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:55.100
want to run their own
events, and put it together,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.650
and arrange for
all the speakers.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.730
Very exciting.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.260
So last year was the first year.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.927
It was the pilot year.

00:02:00.927 --> 00:02:02.760
And yet I would say
that the results from it

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.877
were much bigger than any
pilot that I ever anticipated.

00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:07.460
How many events did
we have last year?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.699
UTTAM TRIPATHI: So last year
we had close to 75 events.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:10.449
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: 75, yeah?

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.907
UTTAM TRIPATHI:
Yeah, which was way

00:02:11.907 --> 00:02:13.490
above the quota we anticipated.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.910
We were expecting maybe
a couple of dozen.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.130
Because that was the
number we had with the GDG

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.600
and DevFests back in the day.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.570
But as you rightly
said, the community

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.120
was really enthusiastic.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.570
And they wanted to take these
events to their chapters,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.445
and to their regions.

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:30.320
So that was a big
achievement in terms

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.860
of what the community achieved.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.260
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah,
no, that's really awesome.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.420
It was shocking to me
the first few times I

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.811
was talking to Uttam and
the registrations were just

00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:39.310
coming in.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.280
It was so exciting to see
all of our GDG communities

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.770
wanting to do their own events.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.395
And this year is even
bigger, isn't it?

00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:48.353
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Yeah,
this year is even bigger.

00:02:48.353 --> 00:02:51.220
So at Google I/O
this year, when we

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.140
had all of the Developer
Group organizers

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.480
from across the world
at the Mountain View,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.410
we talked about DevFests 2013.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.340
And we shared the
dates over the season,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.770
and the response was much,
much more than last year.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.530
So we have committed to
support more than 150 events

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.100
across the globe, which is
more than double than what

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.130
we had last year.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.460
And this year, we are
touching over 60 countries,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.440
touching close to
30,000 developers.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.940
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN:
30,000 developers.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.780
That is extremely impressive.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.820
That is a massive
community, and it's all

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.590
thanks to our wonderful
developers around the world.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.830
Just think, a program that,
a couple of years ago,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.170
was just a spark in
your imagination now

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.210
touches over 30,000 developers.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.270
Very impressive.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.500
So tell me about
this particular year.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.070
We've divided it
into two seasons?

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.980
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Yeah, so this
year, we have two seasons.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.505
Season one was mid of September
till the end of September,

00:03:41.505 --> 00:03:43.079
a couple of weeks there.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.870
And now we are in the
middle of season two.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.840
We've started on
13th of October,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.460
which will go until
10th of November.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.470
So season two will
probably see a lot

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.950
of events in Europe,
Africa, and a few of them

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.090
in the Middle East.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.050
There will be a handful of them
in Southeast Asia and India,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.305
but most of the Asia
events were in season one.

00:04:01.305 --> 00:04:02.930
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN:
Right, in season one.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.440
Now, I also know
that this year, we

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.220
piloted another type of DevFest.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.230
It was called DevFest
W. Can you tell me

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.230
a little bit about that?

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.960
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Yeah,
that's one, again,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.960
an interesting
experiment that we

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.780
did in partnership
with the community.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.358
So in February,
March this year, we

00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:18.899
had a series of
events called DevFest

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.480
W. It's for DevFest Women.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.960
These were primarily
events to which

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.120
we wanted to increase diversity
in our developer groups.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.280
And again, the idea
was to make sure

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.137
that we have strong and
solid developer content being

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:33.220
discussed at these events.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.040
At the same time, encouraging
more women to come up,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.870
more diversity at these events.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.390
And almost all of these events
had at least one lady organizer

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.810
managing the event, and
a lot of speaker sessions

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.890
were delivered by
ladies as well.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.950
So that was a big push in
terms of increasing diversity

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.742
in our user groups.

00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:54.450
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN:
That's really exciting.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.350
I know I was talking a couple
nights ago with some ladies who

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.680
had run DevFest W
events here in India.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.120
And just the level
of their skill,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.870
the level of their passion,
was just so refreshing to me.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.780
I really enjoyed
seeing all the women

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.120
around the world very
interested in joining up

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.010
in engineering and starting
really awesome projects.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.310
So let's talk about
one of these events.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.560
Tell me about the format.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.600
Typically, it's a
series of lectures

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.510
given by community members?

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.390
UTTAM TRIPATHI: So the format
is each GDG organizer decides

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.814
what's the best for their event.

00:05:23.814 --> 00:05:25.230
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN:
So they are very

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.100
custom to each
area of the world.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.100
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Exactly.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.924
That's the idea, because we
have understood that organizers

00:05:30.924 --> 00:05:32.590
understand what's
best for their region,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.610
and we let them do that.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.040
The most popular format
are speaker sessions,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.090
because this is traditionally
the way of sharing knowledge

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.960
with the developers.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.790
So of course, almost all of
the DevFests do have speaker

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.310
sessions as one of
the primary things,

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.715
in which they talk about
multiple Google technologies,

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:52.860
ranging from Android, App
Engine, cloud stuff, Google+,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.290
Chrome, HTML5, and a lot of
other open source technologies

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.340
are being discussed because
the communities are open and we

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.604
like that way.

00:06:00.604 --> 00:06:01.770
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: Very cool.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.340
In addition to
these talks, I know

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.260
I was talking to some
folks the other night--

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.210
again, here in India--
and they were excited

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.751
that there were
other parts of these,

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:10.740
too-- a bunch of hands-on
type of sessions?

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.560
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Yeah,
almost half of the DevFests

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.690
also have a hands-on
component to it,

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.300
which can be either a
code lab or a hackathon,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.820
in which you implement,
or you put to test,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.750
what you just learned
to the speaker sessions.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.040
So code labs is one
of the popular formats

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.750
in which there's an
instructor who leads a class.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.840
And they go through some
of the code examples.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.595
And then, some of
the other cases, you

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:36.720
have hackathons, which
culminates into pitches

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.077
by the developers on
what they have built.

00:06:39.077 --> 00:06:40.910
So these are the
components of these events.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.076
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: Very cool.

00:06:42.076 --> 00:06:44.550
And a lot of this content I
know was developed by Google,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.920
and distributed to the
various DevFest organizers.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.500
But a significant
percentage of it

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.340
was developed by the organizers
and by the speakers themselves.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.340
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Exactly.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.970
That's completely right.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.930
So as you said,
from Google side,

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.950
we did create some
of the content

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.850
and gave it to the
organizers, because almost 80%

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.720
of the speaker
sessions last year,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.410
DevFests, were by the community.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.600
So we understood that
community organizers

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.190
are coming up and speaking.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.970
At the same, we
wanted to help them

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.760
as much as possible through
content and stuff like that.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.570
But in a lot of other
cases, a lot of content

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.640
was being generated by the
community speakers themselves.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.100
So this again.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.480
The way DevFests
are being run is

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.140
a lot of community initiatives.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.850
Communities are
really owning it.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.480
And we are more
in a support role

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.710
in terms of what we can do.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.876
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: Very cool.

00:07:31.876 --> 00:07:34.060
So I was able to listen
to a number of sessions.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.000
And all of them were awesome.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.069
All of them had excellent
quality speakers.

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:39.610
The content was just
very compelling.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:40.900
I learned a tremendous amount.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.720
What excited me also was
the variety of content.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.599
There were deep
dives about products.

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:47.140
There were introductions
to products.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.320
They were topics on
marketing, on taking your idea

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.980
into a business, and pretty
much everything in between.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.260
What were some of the sessions
that stood out to you?

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.050
UTTAM TRIPATHI: So
some of the sessions

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.827
that are really
popular-- of course,

00:07:57.827 --> 00:07:59.160
Android is a popular technology.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.790
But some of the
sessions that we saw

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.620
happening across
multiple DevFests

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.010
is things like how do you
improve your app quality.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.174
With so many apps now on
Play Store, what really makes

00:08:08.174 --> 00:08:09.840
a difference is the
quality of your app,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.770
and the kind of ratings
that you can generate.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.330
So some of the sessions around
following best practices,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.060
both in terms of the UI, and
getting high quality reviews

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.650
for your app was one of
the popular sessions.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.240
The other thing that was
discussed multiple times

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.970
is using more than
one Google technology

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.000
in a particular product.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.900
For example, you
build an Android app,

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:34.110
with a backend on App Engine,
and you put in Google+ sign

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:39.489
in to it, which enables
you to get more installs,

00:08:39.489 --> 00:08:41.030
more downloads, and
things like that.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.349
So these were some of
the popular sessions

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:45.164
that were at DevFests.

00:08:45.164 --> 00:08:46.330
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: Very cool.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.200
And so a lot of the communities
have taped their sessions.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.740
And over the next few months,
we'll be making as many

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.990
of these as we can
available online

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.900
so that any of you who
weren't able to attend

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.820
a DevFest in person
will still be

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.360
able to enjoy some
of the great content.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.250
So if someone wants
to participate

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.950
in one of the remaining DevFests
of the second season this year,

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:05.760
how can they do it?

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.250
UTTAM TRIPATHI: So all
the DevFest information

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.830
is at developers.google.com.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.720
As soon as you go
to the page, you'll

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.660
see a campaign link
there which encourages

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.444
you to join a DevFest near you.

00:09:16.444 --> 00:09:17.860
You either click
on that campaign,

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.340
or you can directly
go to the URL

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.620
developers.google.com/events/devfest.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.250
That's where the whole calendar
of this year's DevFest season

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.062
is put up.

00:09:27.062 --> 00:09:28.020
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: Cool.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.152
So next year we hope there
are even more events.

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:32.610
Let's say somebody wants to
start their own event next year

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.300
in a city that we didn't
have it at this year.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.550
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Yeah,
so DevFest, in the way

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.690
that it's running
right now is being

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.150
run by Google Developer Groups.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.056
So if you cannot find
a DevFest near you,

00:09:46.056 --> 00:09:47.430
and you're interested
to run one,

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.430
I think the best bet is just
get involved with the Google

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.130
Developer Group program and
start a chapter in your region.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.607
The way to do that is go to
developers.google.com/groups,

00:09:57.607 --> 00:09:59.190
which has all the
program information.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.340
It has a form, a
very short form.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.560
Just fill in that and send it.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.350
Someone from our team
will get back to you

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.659
and will set you up
for starting a chapter.

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:10.200
That would be the first step
for running a DevFest next year.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.491
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: Sounds great.

00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:13.790
So we have GDGs
all over the world.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.110
We have DevFests
all over the world.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.480
There's probably one near
you, but like Uttam said,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.050
if there's not, we
encourage you to start one.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.140
We'd love to have Google
Developer Groups everywhere

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.710
and to have as much
involvement as possible.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.140
So the DevFest season so
far has been incredible.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.400
It's been inspiring to me to
watch the community talks,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.560
to watch the level of
passion and engagement.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.170
I'm looking forward to the rest
of the events in season two.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.130
I'm looking forward to
an even better 2014.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.260
So I appreciate all the help of
the communities that run this.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.500
And I want to thank
Uttam for his time today.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.030
UTTAM TRIPATHI:
Thanks, thanks David.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.340
Thanks to all the GDG
organizers for running

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.310
this awesome series
of DevFests this year.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.672
And I'm sure next year
will be even grand.

00:10:52.672 --> 00:10:53.630
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: Cool.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.220
Thank you.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.770
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Thank a lot.
