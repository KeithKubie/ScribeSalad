00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.510
Can you imagine a world where one day if you
need a new heart you could just order one

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.850
made just for you?

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.850
Sound like science fiction?

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.180
Well we’re not so far off.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.889
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.170
Dudes, so something pretty cool just happened
in the wonderful world of science.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.670
Researchers grew BEATING HEARTS FROM HUMAN
STEM CELLS.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.220
Okay fine hyperbole, it’s not the whole
heart just a few beating cells.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.420
BUT IT’S SO COOL.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.410
In a study published in the journal Nature,
the researchers used human skin cells, turned

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.649
them into pluripotent cells and used physical
and chemical signals to coax the cells into

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.149
forming little cardiac microchambers.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.300
Which could be important for studying how
the heart grows in an embryo or how drugs

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.930
might affect a fetus’s heart.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.969
Or… looking way into the future, for growing
hearts in a dish.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.420
It could be a great way to replace organs.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.600
No more waiting for a donor and since it would
be perfect match to your body, no more terrible

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.359
drugs to prevent rejection.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.470
So far smaller organs like tracheas and bladders
have been grown in a lab using a person’s

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.910
own stem cells, but a heart is a little more
complicated.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.280
So let’s take a little look into how we
got here.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.360
First off, what are stem cells?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.110
Stem cells are pluripotent, meaning they are
undifferentiated cells that can develop into

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.540
any kind of cell.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.270
Skin, heart, liver etc.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.570
So alright, but what’s the big deal?

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.900
Why do researchers love to study stem cells?

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.660
Even from the earliest inklings of stem cells,
there have been big dreams.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.490
Researchers have hoped that one day they could
be able to grow entire new organs from stem

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.000
cells that would be a perfect match for the
recipient.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.080
We’ve come a long way from the early days
of stem cell research.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.330
Human stem cells were first isolated in 1998
by two independent research teams led by James

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.810
A. Thomson of the University of Wisconsin
and another by John D. Gearhart of Johns Hopkins

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.190
University School of Medicine.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.630
These early stem cell lines were derived from
early embryos, which are destroyed in the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.310
process and thus stirred a little controversy.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.200
Okay a lot of controversy.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.170
Because of the debate that raged in the US
surrounding embryonic stem cell research,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.640
scientists looked to find stem cells in other
adult tissues.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.030
So a few years later in 2001 adult stem cells
were found in fat tissue.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.610
Now adult stem cells can be found from almost
any tissue.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.490
But they are tricky, they take a while to
coax into growing in a dish.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.750
So they’re not ideal.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.970
But in 2007, in a paper published in the journal
Nature Biotechnology, Dr. Anthony Alata discovered

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.810
that amniotic fluid also contains stem cells.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.130
Which of course added more fuel to the debate.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.950
And the same year, two independent teams of
researchers pioneered a process to turn adult

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.720
somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells,
naturally called induced pluripotent stem

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.720
cells.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.530
The process involves introducing 4 different
genes into the cells using a virus as a carrier.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.800
The team from Japan led Shinya Yamanaka, published
their work in the journal Cell and the team

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.450
from by James Thomson at University of Wisconsin–Madison
published their work in the journal Nature.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.200
And it was such a huge deal that, Yamanaka
actually won the 2012 Nobel Prize for discovering

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200
iPS cells.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.640
Which of course this discovery held a lot
of promise, it would sidestep some of the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.100
controversy with embryonic stem cells.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.550
But there are more than a few issues with
their technique, like low efficiency, it’s

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.990
difficult to do and when done, only a few
cells are reprogrammed.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.170
Plus there’s weird problems with rejection
and also a problem with tumors developing.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.010
But problems aside, tons of studies have been
and are being done with this technology.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.700
With lofty goals, like attempting to cure
blindness and diabetes.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.610
The Federation of American Societies for Experimental
Biology says that IPS cells will also “allow

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.790
scientists to study complex human diseases
in Petri dishes, a step toward analyzing the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.819
conditions and developing therapies.”

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.880
Some researchers like Dr. Alata don’t care
where the cells come from, just that they

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.950
work well.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.760
No matter where stem cells come from, it’s
clear that we’re on the road to organs grown

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.760
in a dish.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.230
Well I certainly hope so.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.700
But it’s also clear that more research is
needed.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.930
And really, lab grown organs can’t come
soon enough!

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.820
If you wanna know the challenges of living
with an organ transplant &amp; why they fail,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:52.930
