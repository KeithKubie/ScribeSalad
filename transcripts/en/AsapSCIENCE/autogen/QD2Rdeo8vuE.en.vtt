00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.129
 We have all heard the hype about three-dimensional - some call it the Third Industrial Revolution or the three-dimensional industrial revolution. 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.660
 But what exactly is 3D printing? How much impact will it have in the future? 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.010
 The concept is very simple: just as your printer prints ink on the paper, the 3D printers blow out 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.730
 The materials - whether plastic, metal or cement - are three dimensional. 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.119
 But instead of printing one layer of ink as you would a regular printer, stack up several 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.910
 Layers overlapping each other to form complex 3D structures. Think of it as a process 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.309
 Chop bread, but in reverse! After placing the first layer, the others are placed above it 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.949
 And so on, until the whole loaf of bread is completely re-installed! Translation of AraSense _ 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.809
 Have you lost or broken something and you can not buy it anymore? Simply create the design or carry it 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.389
 From the Internet, and print it in 3D! Do you have a specific idea about a special gift or a personal holiday 

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:52.389
 Did not find it? Print it! In fact, GE's Templer 3Dprintmygift.tumblr.com does that precisely in the holiday season 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.280
 We'll link to the description below. If you need moving parts in your design, 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.209
 , Simply leave the printer gaps in the selected areas, or use a gel 

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:01.920
 Decomposable or washable later. 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.210
 In terms of design, 3D printing paves the way for incredible, manufactured products 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.060
 Customized to suit your needs. This is not limited to furniture, shoes and appliances 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.570
 Which are designed to fit your lifestyle, but things like artificial limbs can be designed entirely and customarily 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.289
 For the user, reverse general products with standardized measurement. 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.829
 Do you need something small and complex? Ideal 3D printers create layers 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.960
 Up to about 100 micrometers, and some advanced printers can print something as small as 16 micrometers. 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.820
 To understand this from another perspective, the width of the typical bacterial cell ranges from 1-10 micrometers. 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.130
 These doors have been opened to use particles as ink, and this has led to printing 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.780
 3-D drugs successfully, such as ibuprofen. Small atoms are well organized 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.869
 To obtain the desired drug effect. 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.509
 are you hungry? In the future, you may be able to order a "Seri" print a three-dimensional meal 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.229
 Match your wish. 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.090
 But perhaps the most important application is the creation of three-dimensional structures of living cells 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.539
 Or bio-ink. Instead of using plastic or metal, imagine a three-dimensional texture printed to replace 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.549
 Damaged skin, or to reproduce complete organs. Instead of needing a donor for a member, 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.970
 You only print it depending on your genes. Surprisingly, this technique is already being developed. 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.060
 With regard to burns and abrasions, a scanner is used on the patient's wound, forming a personal leather map. 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.900
 After that, the printer places the cells one layer at a time, even 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.690
 Cover the area. 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.610
 Members are more complex because of their large size, their vascular networks, and their interactions with the body. 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.050
 A scanner takes x-ray images of a patient's kidney, for example in the form of transverse sections 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.060
 With incredibly complex details. Like any other, these members are reproduced 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.540
 Layer layer, tailored to each individual. Although this needs many years 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.010
 To become practical, but it will inevitably have a significant impact in the medical community. 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.590
 So, although you'll need a while before you get a 3D printer in your home, be confident 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.470
 That when you get it, the world will be a different place. 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.950
 But if you can not wait too long, GE will give you three-dimensional printing on its vacation 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.880
 On the third of December - the third of December for the "trilogy" of dimensions! To celebrate. They will print personalized 3D gifts 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.890
 To their fans throughout the day. All you have to do is 3dprintmygift.tumblr.com and so to choose 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.390
 Twitter and Twitter form to get the chance to have it printed and shipped to your home in times of holidays! 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.570
