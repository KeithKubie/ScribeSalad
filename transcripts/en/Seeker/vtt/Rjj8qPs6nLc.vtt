00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.080
This episode was proudly made possible by
the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.689
It's not just a sedan, it's a Subaru.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.690
I am El Nino, all other tropical storms must
bow before me!!

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.960
We all remember that right?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.960
But other than Chris Farley, what is an el
nino?

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.880
What's up DNewsers, it's Trace and this is
DNews.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.880
Thanks for tuning in.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.710
If you can remember 1997 and 98, you probably
remember the media storm surrounding that

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.870
year's El Nino.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.230
People talked about it all the time, it was
HUGE weather news, mainly because it was the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.800
strongest El Nino in decades and there were
a bunch in a row, which is rare.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.050
You might’ve heard that 2014 is also an
El Nino year, though forecasters predict it’ll

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.469
be much weaker than the one in 97-98.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.379
The name El Nino traces back to the 1600s,
when fisherman off the coast of Peru who noticed

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.159
warmer water usually appeared around Christmas-time.

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.829
They named it El Nino which means Little Boy,
or Christ Child in Spanish.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.399
How that water GOT there, however, is crazy.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.890
In a normal year, the trade winds blow from
east to west blowing the warm surface water

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.670
with it.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.110
These winds create a kind-of hill of warm
water on Asian coasts.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.530
That leaves the deeper, colder water to backfill
on the west coast of the Americas.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.049
Basically, the temperatures of the ocean and
the atmosphere around the east-central equatorial

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.100
Pacific have a HUGE impact on weather patterns
around the world.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.920
But sometimes these temperatures fluctuate,
in a cycle known as the El Nino Southern Oscillation,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.380
or ENSO.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.000
In an El Nino year, for some reason, the trade
winds are super weak, so they're not pulling

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.950
warm water to Asia.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.789
Because of the warmer Americas, the trade
winds weaken even MORE causing the ocean to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.420
warm even MORE!

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.670
That oscillation continues causing wetter
winters over the southeastern United States,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.730
and dryer weather in Indonesia and Australia;
is also increases hurricanes in the eastern

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.369
Pacific while lessening those in the Caribbean.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.859
La Ninas, are the opposite of El Nino, the
trade winds get really strong so we get COLDER

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:05.859
waters around the equatorial Pacific.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:06.859
Which means warmer winters in the Southeast
US with fewer hurricanes in the Pacific and

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:07.859
more in the Caribbean, plus wetter summers
in Australia with more cyclones.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:08.859
Guys, this shiz is a lot.

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:09.859
It's a house of cards.

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.040
When one thing changes, the whole system goes
nutso.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.520
These ENSO events cause lots of problems with
flooding, cyclones, food production, snowfall,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.530
and so on.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.150
I mean, the water raining down on the Americas
has to come from somewhere.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.750
Thus, Australia will likely see a terrible
drought this year, and India will probably

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.420
have a lessened monsoon season; meaning less
food production for both countries.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.830
Not good, and these ENSO systems can go on
for more than a year!

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.790
The link between global warming and increased
ENSO events is still being checked out, but

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.420
a study in Nature Climate Change says that
global climate change is going to cause MORE

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.490
of these events, and they'll be stronger.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.161
I've seen questions on why we haven't invented
weather controlling technology yet… this

00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:53.161
is why!

00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:57.040
We JUST started to understand how this all
works 30 years ago.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.550
The events happen as part of the natural interaction
of water and wind in the Pacific ocean, and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.870
thus can be monitored and predicted so governments
can prepare.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.210
NOAA used to maintain 70 buoys strategically
placed across the oceans.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.690
I say used to, because thanks to recent budgetary
limitations they can't afford to maintain

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.690
them anymore.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.180
Therefore, NOAA's network of oceanographic
weather information is breaking down.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.250
So… there's that.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.320
It might not be long until El Nino catches
us by surprise, and that would be bad.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.910
And before you ask, no we can't just invent
something to control the weather.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.170
To do that, we'd need to control ocean temperatures.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.610
Due to the amount of water IN the ocean, we'd
need to harness ALL the energy created in

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.610
the exploding of 400,000 20-megaton Hydrogen
bombs.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.320
IF we could do that, we could heat the Pacific
by choice.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.610
Seriously, don't get your hopes up.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.330
So, what is an El Nino?

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.670
It's a cycle of warming and cooling that affects
the weather of the whole planet.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.670
It's nature, bro.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.670
Just nature.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.790
And when it comes to the extremes of nature,
we wanna thank Subaru for making this episode

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.790
possible.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.170
And especially the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.890
Every sedan has its benefits, but only one
combines them all.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.160
It’s not just a sedan.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160
It’s a Subaru.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.160
