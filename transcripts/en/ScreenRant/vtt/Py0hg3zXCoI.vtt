00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.250
A movie character can become a timeless fan
favourite with just a single memorable scene

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.250
or line of dialogue.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.990
But even the most well-known movie heroes
and villains still have some secrets to tell,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.480
proving they're one of a kind - for better
or worse.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.240
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Secret Hidden Details
Behind Popular Movie Characters.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.240
Hook

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.860
The modern reimagining of Peter Pan made a
ton of changes to the classic story, but the

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.240
movie's version of Captain Hook was unforgettable.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.150
Dustin Hoffman can take the credit for showing
the evil pirate to be seriously insecure,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.610
leaning on his trusty first mate Smee for
support.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.820
More support than fans realized, it turns
out.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.930
When Hoffman and Bob Hoskins were trying to
figure out how to approach the Smee/Hook dynamic,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.270
it finally clicked: the two weren't friends,
but lovers.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.239
It wasn't what the director intended, and
is never explicitly explored in the movie,

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.920
but for the actors on screen, they were playing
partners in more ways than one.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.769
Mad Max: Fury Road

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.199
You may not know his name, but everyone who
saw Mad Max: Fury Road knows Coma The Doof

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.760
Warrior, the pale-skinned guitar player leading
Immortan Joe's war boys into battle.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.949
His origin isn't explained in the movie, but
director George Miller and Australian guitarist

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.580
iOTA came up with one anyway.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.390
Apparently, the child music prodigy had to
watch his mother killed by bandits in front

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.390
of him.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.600
Joe found him sometime after, and recruited
him into his army.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.500
Coma wears his mother's face over his own,
which means a lack of real close ups is actually

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.450
a good thing for the squeamish.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.450
The Joker

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.600
In the decades since Batman's arch enemy first
appeared, his origin story has remained a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.270
mystery, with most agreeing that a villain
like The Joker is scarier without one - even

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.149
the more colourful version seen on the 1960s
TV show.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.829
Alan Moore's "Killing Joke" made the popular
case that The Joker was born from "one bad

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:35.829
day."

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.359
That idea didn't fly when Batman star Adam
West was asked his thoughts on Joker, claiming

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.200
nobody can go that crazy without prolonged
abuse.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.729
In his mind, The Joker was abducted as a child
and kept prisoner for years by an abusive

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.479
clown, resulting in the grinning killer fans
know and love.

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.119
Jerry Robinson, who co-created Joker was on
hand to agree, simply stating that "that would

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.119
do it."

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.479
If that's the origin for the campy version,
who KNOWS what caused the darker takes on

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.280
the clown prince of crime.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280
Snow White

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.119
She may have been Disney's very first princess,
but the voice of Snow White was harder to

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.899
pin down than even her famous costume or songs.

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.670
Walt Disney and his casting department heard
over 150 young women with none fitting the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.670
bill.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.239
When a casting director was complaining about
the lack of talented young singers to their

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.480
music teacher consultant, fate took over.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.230
The teacher's 20 year old daughter Adriana
overheard the complaints, and started singing

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.401
in the background to grab some attention.

00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:27.740
It worked, too: once Walt Disney heard her
voice, he cast her as Snow White immediately,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.489
guaranteeing that the movie would revolutionize
Hollywood, and make Disney a household name.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.489
James Bond

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.660
For entire generations, the wealth of actors
who've played 007 can't change the fact that

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.269
Sean Connery did it first - and did it best.

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.200
He's remembered for embodying the sexy charm
of the ultimate alpha male, but Connery didn't

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.010
quite live up to that standard off screen.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.989
Aside from the rumors that Connery would "tighten
up" his pecs by holding bags of ice water

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.160
to his chest before shirtless scenes, the
thick hair on the actor's chest was sold short

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.160
by his scalp.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.220
Connery wore a hairpiece on every single one
of his Bond adventures.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.280
We wonder what Bond would have to say about
the studio's first choice to play him?

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280
The Notebook
&nbsp;

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.989
Since movies began, there's been a place for
sappy romances.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.030
But The Notebook changed Hollywood love stories
forever, pairing the beautiful Rachel McAdams

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.520
and Ryan Gosling as two young lovers, skyrocketing
them to super stardom virtually overnight.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.100
Gosling's role as the lovesick Noah made him
an A-list heart throb, but that wasn't the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.100
director's plan.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.640
According to Gosling, he got the part because
he wasn't a leading man, with the director

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.880
saying "You're not handsome, you're not cool,
you're just a regular guy who looks a bit

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880
nuts."

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.330
We'll let his fans decide how accurate that
turned out to be.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.710
Saving Private Ryan&nbsp;

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.250
Director Steven Spielberg knew that the main
Squad of American soldiers in his World War

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.159
II epic needed to be convincing, so he sent
the core cast on a week-long boot camp so

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.370
intense, almost all of them wanted to quit
before it was over.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.810
The resulting camaraderie showed it was worth
it, but the boot camp served another purpose:

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.560
since Matt Damon didn't have to endure the
training, he was as much an outsider on set

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.180
as Private Ryan was in the movie.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.409
Ryan still won over the soldiers and audiences,
but the resentment and insecurity on screen

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.590
isn't faked, proving tough love can help create
a more sympathetic young soldier.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.560
Back to the Future

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.629
Every fan of time travelling teens knows Biff
Tannen, the high school bully who made life

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.189
a nightmare for both George McFly and his
son Marty - in multiple timelines.

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.530
But did you know the meathead is actually
taking a very real shot at a Hollywood executive?

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.230
It started when director Robert Zemeckis and
writer Bob Gale pitched their first film,

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.270
I Wanna Hold Your Hand, to Universal executive
Ned Tanen.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.820
The meeting ended with Tanen screaming at
the pair, accusing them of antisemitism, among

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.820
other things.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.650
They got the last laugh though, burying a
stand-in Tannen in manure - multiple times.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.050
Fast &amp; Furious

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.480
The entire cast of the Fast &amp; Furious series
has become more famous than anyone could have

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.380
guessed, but it didn't happen by accident.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.930
When Michelle Rodriguez was first brought
in to bring Letty to life, she had a problem

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.210
with her character's journey - specifically,
that Letty would wind up cheating on Dom with

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.570
Brian, the undercover cop.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.140
It was just another way Fast &amp; Furious took
cues from the original Point Break, but Rodriguez

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.850
refused, offering to quit if the script wasn't
changed.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.380
But she made a good argument, and the love
affair between her and Toretto wound up as

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.970
the backbone of the entire movie franchise.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:07.970
The Dark Knight

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.940
There's no denying what Christopher Nolan's
Batman did for comic book movies everywhere,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.570
but there's one part of Christian Bale's take
on the Dark Knight that draws more criticism

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.360
and mockery than any other: the Batvoice.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.530
But Bale's Bruce Wayne isn't really the problem,
since his raspy growl actually seemed an inspired

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.360
choice in the first movie, Batman Begins.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.900
But in The Dark Knight, Nolan decided to add
some new effects in post-production to make

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.210
the rasp a bit... stranger.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.180
Fans still have every right to mock the insane
Batvoice, but few realize that it wasn't the

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.940
starring actor to blame for it.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.651
Those are the awesome secret details behind
some of our favorite movie characters, but

00:05:43.651 --> 00:05:44.880
which ones do you think we missed?
