00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.120
We unexpectedly catch sight of ourselves in
a mirror and, in an instant, are thrown into

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.880
despair: the odd nose, the unsatisfactory
hair, the sickening skin tone, but most of

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:21.690
all, the only too familiar, deeply gormless
needy expression. It feels at such moments

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.570
as if every worst fear about us must be true.
All our efforts to run away from our monster-self

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.190
have failed. A hideous spectre is, for our
brief time on the planet, truly whom we are

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:42.050
fated to be. Crucially, feeling ugly is entirely
independent of what anyone actually looks

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.329
like. There are beauties who are sickened
by their looks and grizzled munchkins breezily

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.260
at ease with themselves. There are always
an infinite number of reasons to find oneself

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.379
pleasant or hideous, clever or idiotic: so
what decides the matter is never in the end

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:09.450
the judgement of our eyes, but the condition
of our souls. It is the inner mood that guides

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.560
our gaze in its assessment of the face in
the mirror and that projects the atmosphere

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.579
of selfishness, sleaziness and furtiveness
we locate in our features. Therefore, we don’t,

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.810
when we are sad, ever really need a new set
of clothes or a haircut. We require – to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.630
put it naively and grandly – to be looked
at through the eyes of love, by someone whose

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.319
generous assessment can rescue us from the
depredations of self-hatred. It is all the

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.959
more unfortunate that – precisely when we
feel disgusting – it can be so hard to ask

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:52.029
another for their help. We hate ourselves
too much to dare to hope that anyone else

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:58.409
might like us – and may, in response to
kind enquiries, simply attempt to prove our

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.479
dislikable nature through monosyllabic avoidant
grunts. We need – in our curdled state – for

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.319
someone else to explain our condition to the
world, to make the case that we are lost and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.660
ashamed, not monstrous or mean. We may need
(for a time at least) to let someone else’s

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.600
words do the work for us.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.400
