Well how does OOA work? First it takes a textual description of

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.570
a system to be built, such as a requirements document. And looks for

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.610
different kinds of words such as, nouns, verbs and adjectives.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.480
It's goal is to use the identified words to built up descriptions of classes and

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.790
their relationships. Nouns will correspond to classes.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.720
Action verbs to operations. Adjectives to attributes. And stative verbs to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.240
relationships. The resulting class model can be reviewed with a customer for

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.570
accuracy and completeness. Here is an overview of the steps involved
