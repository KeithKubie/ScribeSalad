00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.120
Throughout this lesson, we're going to
be highlighting different rules and

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.350
conventions, inspired by hiring
managers in the research we've done.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.029
These are the rules and

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.620
conventions you should follow when
writing or editing your resume.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.610
Please be aware that not all of
those rules apply worldwide.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.540
Our research is mostly focused in
Northern America, and we know that

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.730
there are different conventions in other
regions, like Germany where I'm from.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.340
In true Udacity fashion, you'll solidify
this knowledge with interactive

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.630
activities that will have you analyzing
and assessing yours and others' resumes.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.270
To let you focus on the concepts
in that note-taking,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.290
we've provided you with a checklist that
summarizes everything we'll be covering.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.550
There's a link to the digital and
PDF version in the instructor notes.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.390
The digital version links
back to videos in the class.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.200
Let's get started.
