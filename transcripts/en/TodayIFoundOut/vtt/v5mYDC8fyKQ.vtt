00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:09.710
Why is Iodine Added to Salt?

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.900
Iodine first began being added to salt commercially
in the United States in 1924 by the Morton

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.599
Salt Company at the request of the government.

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.880
This was done as a response to the fact that
there were certain regions in the U.S., such

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.980
as around the Great Lakes and in the Pacific
Northwest, where people weren’t getting

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.570
enough iodine in their diets due to it not
being prevalent in the soil in those regions.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.150
Among other problems, this caused many people
to develop goiters (swelling of the thyroid

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.450
gland, also sometimes spelled “goitre”).

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.040
About 90% of people who develop a goiter do
so because of a lack of iodine in their diets,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.930
so the simple solution was to add iodine to
something pretty much everyone consumes fairly

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.800
regularly, namely salt.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.800
This practiced was not thought up by the U.S.,
but was copied from the Swiss who were adding

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.390
iodine to salt at this time for the same reason.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.360
This resulted in researchers at the University
of Michigan testing this practice out with

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.000
good results and subsequently Morton Salt
Company adopting the practice on a national

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
level.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.050
This ultimately didn’t cost Morton and the
other salt companies that followed suit much

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.190
money, only a few cents per person per year
in iodine, but drastically cut the number

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.860
of people who developed goiters in the United
States and beyond as the practice gradually

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.830
became adopted throughout much of the developed
world.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.330
Today because most food in developed countries
like the United States often isn’t grown

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.940
locally, coming from all over the country
and world, depending on the food item, continuing

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.370
to add iodine to salt isn’t strictly necessary.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.229
People in regions where the soil is lacking
in iodine will likely consume plenty of food

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.550
from regions where it is not, thus getting
the iodine their bodies need, particularly

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.870
because our thyroids don’t need much to
function properly.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.580
For reference, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
recommends that you consume about 150 micrograms

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.610
of iodine per day and, on average, men in
the United States gets about double that amount

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.450
per day and women each consume about 210 micrograms
of iodine per day.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.520
Your thyroid itself only needs about 70 micrograms
per day to function properly.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.290
Even though most people get plenty of Iodine
in their diets, because Iodine is so critical

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.489
to our bodies functioning properly and the
Tolerable Upper Intake Level is so high (about

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.859
1100 micrograms per day, and you won’t take
a fatal dose unless you ingest about 2 million

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:20.010
micrograms, or 2 grams), adding it to salt
is still recommended by many government health

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.590
agencies the world over to stave off certain
health problems.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.430
Specifically, Iodine is a critical element
used by your thyroid in being able to synthesize

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.260
certain gland secretions which, among other
things, influences your heart, metabolism,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.900
nerve responses, etc.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.639
Further, a lack of iodine during pregnancy
and in the baby’s diet after being born

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:44.430
can cause a myriad of significant health and
developmental problems.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.359
Iodine deficiency has also been linked to
increased difficulty with information processing,

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.620
diminished fine motor skills, extreme fatigue,
depression, weight gain, and low basal body

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:13.329
temperatures, among other things.
