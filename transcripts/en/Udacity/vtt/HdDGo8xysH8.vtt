00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.970
Well, to get some
inspiration about this,

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.870
let's talk about what humans do, and
visual object categories in humans.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.640
And there was work in
what is referred to as

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.648
Basic Level Categories
in human categorization.

00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:14.060
It was st started by Eleanor Rosch,

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.370
series of seminal
papers back in the 70s.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.010
Continued on by Lakoff and
other cognitive scientists.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.170
And what they found is,
there are certain levels of description

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.790
that seem to have a preferred
place in human cognition.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.270
So for example, the basic level was
the highest level in the category,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.990
which you could say that objects have
the same, or similar, perceived shape.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.760
So if I ask you to think of the shape
of a German Shepherd you can, but

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.510
if i ask you to think of the shape of
a dog, you probably can do that too.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.150
If I ask you to think of
the shape of a mammal,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.850
what you're going to do is you're
going to think of the shape of a couple

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.930
of representative types of mammals.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.540
You don't actually have a shape for
mammal.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.350
Typically also,
you can make a mental image.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.480
If I say, you know,
make a mental image of a dog,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.280
you'll probably come up with something.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.970
If I say make a mental image
of an animal, you're going to

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.500
pick some animal and then if I were to
ask you what it was you wouldn't tell me

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.460
it's an animal you would tell me it
was a deer or something like that.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.820
By the way you can do
reaction time experiments,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.482
where, let's suppose you want to ask
people to push a button yes or no.

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:14.930
I'm going to show them a picture and

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.610
one task is you're supposed
to say is it an animal?

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.330
Another task you're supposed
to say whether it's a dog.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.676
It turns out you're faster at knowing
that it's a dog than you are at knowing

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:24.550
it's an animal.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.290
And that's a very robust finding and
you, you can, you can do that.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.390
And then there's this thing that

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.000
typically this is the level that
children understand earlier.

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:35.374
So they'll learn about dogs before
they'll learn about animals,

00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:36.760
they'll learn these words.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.330
And there's one written here about
having motor actions interact.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.930
You can imagine there's a set of things
you do with dogs that sort of span

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.100
dogs, right?

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.250
Right?
It's probably not the same set of things

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.490
you do with animals.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.000
Right?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.120
You probably pet dogs.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.410
You probably want to pet most dogs.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.432
Probably pet all dogs generically
if you're a dog person.

00:01:54.432 --> 00:01:56.340
The idea is that you have these,
these interactions.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.580
So there's this preferred
level within the human.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.870
And you might wonder why I'm spending so
much time talking to you about this.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.720
Well if you go to the MIT libraries and
you type in,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.240
you could actually find this called NOC,
natural object categorization,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.470
which by the way,
was my PhD thesis back in 1987.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.700
Please don't go and read it,
it's not so great, but

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.040
I was worried about this notion
of perceptual, organization and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.400
how you would organize your categories
to make them good for perception.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.460
The one thing I lucked out on is
that by the time I did my thesis,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.410
the AI tech reports were up to 1001, so
I got tech support 1001 as the number,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.730
and and that's great because it sounded
like it was an important one or first.
