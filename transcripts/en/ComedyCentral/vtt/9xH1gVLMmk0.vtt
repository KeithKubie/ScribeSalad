00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:02.461
- Okay so, let us know in the
comments

00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:04.922
which one of us should cheat
on our significant other,

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:06.757
then tune back in
to find out what happens.

00:00:06.757 --> 00:00:08.133
We'll see you then
on Every Damn Day.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.384
- Cut.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:11.094
Okay, great job, guys.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.473
Ryan, good work.
We'll cut around you.

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:17.434
So just a reminder, the office
luau is today at four.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:18.727
- Can we bring someone?

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.437
- To our office day party?

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.647
- Yeah.

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:22.940
- Sure.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.649
- This is going to be so fun.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:38.163
- Stop, stop, your fingers are
so sticky from those popsicles.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.332
- Oh, Hannah that's nice,
you brought your little brother.

00:00:40.332 --> 00:00:42.251
- Don't be an (bleep) Ryan.

00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:44.253
- It's chill. I'm going
to go take a piss.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.839
- Wait, what did I say?
Is that not your little brother?

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.758
- Are you dumb?
Spencer is my boyfriend.

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.260
- He looks like a young
elf.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.179
- No, he just seems young
because he's a series regular

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.514
on a Disney Channel show.

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:58.392
- He's Pop Collar Chaz.
Wait, he's like 14 though.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:02.020
- On the show. Disney stars
are like, 22, probably.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.480
- Maybe he's a clone.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.023
I heard everybody is
getting cloned in Hollywood.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.233
Cloning is hot right now.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:07.442
- I read that.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:08.694
- No, what a 14 year old
have enough money

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:09.945
to have his own driver?

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:11.446
- A 14 year old would 100%
have their own driver

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:12.864
because legally,
they can not drive.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:14.241
- No, people just do everything
for him

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.867
because he's a celebrity.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.619
- Or maybe he's incapable
of basic

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.664
tasks
because he's a child.

00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:23.083
- You bought your own beer
because you can do that, right?

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.794
- I got it for free and it's not
a beer,

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.504
it's a Mike's Hard Lemonade.

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:31.675
- So, Spence, where do you live?
With friends? Parents?

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:32.884
- My mother lives with me.

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:34.136
- So, you live with your mom.

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:36.388
- Whoa, okay, someone's
a little jealous of me.

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:37.764
My mom lives with me,

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.433
she couldn't afford
her own place in the city

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.143
and I had already bought
a three bedroom condo in cash.

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:42.352
- Cash?

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:46.648
- Baby, it's so amazing
that you can do that.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.567
- Okay, I'm sorry,
this is disgusting.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:49.985
- Excuse me bro?

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:52.154
- No, I just meant,
you two together-

00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:53.113
- Really, (bleep), you're going to body shame

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.489
my woman
right in front of me?

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:55.699
- Wait, what?

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.075
- Hannah's body has nothing
to do with this.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.702
- Oh, it's her teeth then?
- What? No.

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.037
- Oh, because she farts
in her sleep?

00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:01.288
It's not her fault.

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.581
She completely
lacks self control

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.832
when it comes to lactose.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.960
Okay, she loves cottage cheese, (bleep), she loves it!

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.174
Come on you (bleep), hit me.

00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:14.885
- Ah!

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.513
- Spencer, stop it!

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.308
- You're really going to side with this (bleep)

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:22.934
after he called you
disgusting?

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.644
- Get out.

00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:29.858
- Pop Collar Chaz
doesn't need this.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.906
- I just checked his
Wikipedia page, he's 34.

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:39.993
- Ugh. That is disgusting.
