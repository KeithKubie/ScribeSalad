that would have made a difference I

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960
that would have made a difference I

transparency the Fed providing more
information really would have made much

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680
information really would have made much
 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.800
information really would have made much
difference before the crisis most of

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810
difference before the crisis most of
 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.300
difference before the crisis most of
what people are upset about is not what

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310
what people are upset about is not what
 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.830
what people are upset about is not what
happened before the crisis but the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840
happened before the crisis but the
 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.510
happened before the crisis but the
lending that the Fed did during the

lending that the Fed did during the
 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.960
lending that the Fed did during the
crisis and so I think that's an issue

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970
crisis and so I think that's an issue
 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.340
crisis and so I think that's an issue

authority but I don't think acid bubbles

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840
authority but I don't think acid bubbles
 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.630
authority but I don't think acid bubbles
are a distraction I think acid bubbles

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:21.640
are a distraction I think acid bubbles
 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.070
are a distraction I think acid bubbles
are a key part of their mission

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080
 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.659
well Ben Bernanke has a really hard task

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:29.669
well Ben Bernanke has a really hard task
 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:31.820

now he has to decide when is the right

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:31.830
now he has to decide when is the right
 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.879
now he has to decide when is the right

moment to contract credit and raise
 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:36.820
moment to contract credit and raise
interest rates if he does it too soon

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:36.830
interest rates if he does it too soon
 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.170
interest rates if he does it too soon
we'll get a relapse into recession

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180
we'll get a relapse into recession
 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.080
we'll get a relapse into recession
that's what happened in 1937 when the

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.090
that's what happened in 1937 when the
 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.029
that's what happened in 1937 when the
depression was extended because the Fed

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039
depression was extended because the Fed
 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.249
depression was extended because the Fed
was too tight at the wrong time on the

other hand if he waits too long we'll
 

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:49.580
other hand if he waits too long we'll
get an outbreak of inflation greater

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:49.590
get an outbreak of inflation greater
 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.879
get an outbreak of inflation greater
than he thinks is prudent so I don't

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:52.889

think anybody thinks the moment is to

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:54.990
think anybody thinks the moment is to
 

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.980
think anybody thinks the moment is to

how soon should the Fed do that some of
that depends on how the economy performs

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:03.380
that depends on how the economy performs
 

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.649
that depends on how the economy performs
and I think that it's a tricky balance

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:06.659
and I think that it's a tricky balance
 

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:08.870
and I think that it's a tricky balance
it takes a great deal of technical skill

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880
it takes a great deal of technical skill
 

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.180
it takes a great deal of technical skill
this is not like any recession we've

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:11.190
this is not like any recession we've
 

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.670
this is not like any recession we've
seen in our lifetime and that means that

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680
seen in our lifetime and that means that
 

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.649
seen in our lifetime and that means that
we can't be sure the economy is going to

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:15.659
we can't be sure the economy is going to

deal of luck because you just got to get
 

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.339
deal of luck because you just got to get
it right and sometimes you'd have to

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:22.349
it right and sometimes you'd have to
 

00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:24.050
it right and sometimes you'd have to
make a guess you don't have the luxury

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060

you going to play in the third act and
finally it's going to take a lot of

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680
finally it's going to take a lot of
 

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.709
finally it's going to take a lot of
political courage on Bernanke's part the

political courage on Bernanke's part the
 

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:36.260
political courage on Bernanke's part the
Fed is under attack by the public by the

Fed is under attack by the public by the
 

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.290
Fed is under attack by the public by the
Congress and he is undoubtedly going to

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300
Congress and he is undoubtedly going to
 

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.819
Congress and he is undoubtedly going to
have to raise interest rates and drain

00:08:40.819 --> 00:08:40.829
have to raise interest rates and drain

thinks the economy's back to normal and
 

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.949
thinks the economy's back to normal and
he's going to have to do that at a

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959
he's going to have to do that at a
 

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:48.470
he's going to have to do that at a
moment when the Congress is looking at

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480
moment when the Congress is looking at
 

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.120
moment when the Congress is looking at
the powers of the Fed and the law that

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.130
the powers of the Fed and the law that
 

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.130
the powers of the Fed and the law that
governs it and so it's not going to be

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140
governs it and so it's not going to be
 

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.199
governs it and so it's not going to be
popular and it's going to be tricky and

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:54.209
popular and it's going to be tricky and
 

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:56.960
popular and it's going to be tricky and
so we all can only hope that he has the
