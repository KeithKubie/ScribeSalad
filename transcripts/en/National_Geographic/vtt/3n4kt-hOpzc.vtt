00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.970
( intro music )

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:10.810
<i> Parasites are not degenerates,</i>

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.147
<i>they're actually maybe the most
 successful life form on earth.</i>

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.917
<i> And they do all sorts of
 amazing things.</i>

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:20.286
<i> They were using their hosts</i>

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.255
<i> for all sorts of
 nefarious purposes</i>

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.190
<i> to get what they needed.</i>

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.794
<i> If you see a ladybug huddled
 over some little bit of fluff,</i>

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:31.331 line:0%
<i> you're looking at a
 zombie bodyguard.</i>

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:37.904
( applause )

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.040 line:0%
So originally when they were
organizing this talk,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.777 line:0%
they were trying to
convince us to,

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:48.014 line:0%
dress up and I wasn't quite
willing to do that.

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:52.718 line:0%
But, I did bring
my favorite T-shirt, so...

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:55.054 line:0%
If you can't tell,
that's a schistosome there.

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:56.990 line:0%
( audience laughing )

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.725
So, my goal in this

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:04.130
in photographing these
creatures was to...

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.535
get past this visceral aversion
we all have towards parasites,

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:15.341
and try to show how amazing
these creatures really are!

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:18.411
So, if I'm going to try to
convince you

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.612
that parasites are cool,

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.348 line:0%
I'm going to start with
the star of the show.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.051
<i> So this is a ladybug</i>

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:28.087
<i> standing guard over
 the cocoon of a wasp</i>

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:32.491
<i> and the way this works,
 is that wasp lays an egg,</i>

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:34.861
<i> it injects an egg
 into that ladybug</i>

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.230
and the egg hatches and
it grows inside the ladybug

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.500
and the larval wasp inside
actually knows

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.503
to avoid the vital organs
of that ladybug

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:47.172
because if it chews
on those vital organs

00:01:47.172 --> 00:01:49.809
it will kill the ladybug and
it will die too.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:53.746
So it avoids the vital organs
and when it's ready to come out,

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:57.183
it pushes its way out of the
abdomen of that ladybug

00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:00.853
and it spins its cocoon.
And the problem is

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:03.256
this cocoon is a
very vulnerable stage

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:06.426
in the lifecycle of this wasp.
It's just sitting there immobile

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:10.763
ready to be eaten by
any predator that walks by.

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:16.503
So, that's why it's gotten this
ladybug to stand guard over it.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.640
<i> And the amazing thing is
 this ladybug will sit there</i>

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.578
<i> twitching for days over this,
 this wasp</i>

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:30.583
and if it's able to survive
the seven days

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:34.053
that the wasp takes to
develop into an adult

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:37.055
the ladybug can
actually recover.

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:39.626
The mind control can wear off

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:43.629
and that ladybug can go to
re-grow its internal organs

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.331
and go on to reproduce.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.801
<i> This is the wasp
 that's responsible for that,</i>

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.337
<i> this is
 Dinocampus coccinellae,</i>

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:54.306
<i> it's, she's barely
 a centimeter long</i>

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:55.941
<i> and I can tell
 she's a female, both</i>

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:59.011
<i> because she's got this
 ovipositor at the end,
 the stinger</i>

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.913
<i> that she uses
 to inject the eggs</i>

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:06.519
and also because this species
is parthenogenetic, which means

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:10.256
it doesn't need to fertilize
its eggs to reproduce,

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.957
it can clone itself,

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:14.894
and so it injects an egg
into the ladybug,

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:17.330
It does not need to be
fertilized,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.066
and all of those eggs will
develop to be more females.

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:23.569
The entire species is female.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.338
Actually there has been
four or five males

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:29.175
that has been identified
over the course of

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:31.176
studying this creature and

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:33.078
frankly I don't know
how that really works,

00:03:33.078 --> 00:03:35.881
I don't know how
parthenogenesis works.
It's crazy.

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:39.385
and it will have to be the topic
of another discussion.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.621
Now ladybugs are
not the only ones

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.522
that get turned into
bodyguards.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.426
There's another wasp
in this family Braconidae

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:49.462
that infects caterpillars

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:53.399
<i> and in this case it injects
 several dozen eggs</i>

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.867
<i> at the same time.</i>

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:56.969
<i> Those eggs hatch
 inside the caterpillar</i>

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.071
<i> and just like the ladybug</i>

00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:01.174
<i> they know to avoid
 the internal organs</i>

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:05.845
<i> of the caterpillar,
 just like the ladybug</i>

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:07.713
they have a virus that
helps them.

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:09.182
It's a different kind of virus

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.751
but in this case the virus
tricks the immune system

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:17.790
of the caterpillar to protect,
to hide these invaders

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.693
and the virus actually
changes the metabolism

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:24.129
of the caterpillar
so that it gorges itself

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.032
and it prevents the caterpillar

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:27.800
from transforming
into an adult,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.203
so the virus turns
the caterpillar

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:34.140
into a feeding machine
for these wasp larva.

00:04:35.974 --> 00:04:39.445
<i> So this is a video of this
 process. It starts with the</i>

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.614
<i> adult wasp stinging and
 injecting those eggs</i>

00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:46.218
<i> into a newly hatched
caterpillar. Those caterpillars</i>

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:49.221
<i>then go about their normal life
 for the next week</i>

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:50.957
<i> feeding and growing</i>

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:54.894
<i> and waiting for those
 wasp larva to emerge.</i>

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:57.129
<i> When they are ready
 they chew their way</i>

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.600
<i> through the skin
 of the caterpillar.</i>

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:06.205
<i> And they come out
 by the dozens.</i>

00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:11.744
<i> So they actually
 spin their cocoon</i>

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:15.782
<i> as they are emerging
 from the caterpillar.</i>

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:22.521
<i> The amazing thing
 about this process is that</i>

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:25.391
<i> the caterpillar survives,
 it wakes up,</i>

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:29.962
<i>it crawls on the top of the pile
 of cocoons and it spins that</i>

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:33.700
<i> additional layer
 of protective silk.</i>

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.338
<i> And the reason for this,</i>

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:42.174
<i> the entire purpose
 of the protection</i>

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:44.810
<i> is to prevent this.</i>

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.346
<i> This is a hyperparasitoid wasp</i>

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:50.115
<i> injecting its egg
 into the parasitic wasp</i>

00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:52.618
<i> that just emerged
 from the caterpillar.</i>

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:56.189
<i> So an additional layer
 of parasitism</i>

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.824
above the
mind controlling one.

00:05:58.824 --> 00:06:00.126
It's pretty cool.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:04.697
So this theme of
trying to protect

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:09.835
that delicate larval stage...
that pupation,

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:11.136
that's a common theme.

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:14.673
And there's another wasp
in different group

00:06:14.673 --> 00:06:19.111
<i> that uses a different approach
 than the bodyguard style.</i>

00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:21.213
<i> What it does is,
 it catches the spider</i>

00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:24.950
<i> and lays an egg on its back.</i>

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.986
<i> So this is a spider
 that lives in the</i>

00:06:27.986 --> 00:06:31.857
<i> palm plantations of Costa Rica</i>

00:06:31.857 --> 00:06:34.626
<i> and it's got a wasp larva
 hanging on its back.</i>

00:06:34.626 --> 00:06:36.328
<i> This is one that
 has hatched out</i>

00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:39.698
<i> and it's feeding on hemolymph,
 the blood of that spider.</i>

00:06:39.698 --> 00:06:42.201
And what it does
when it's ready to pupate,

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:45.271
instead of turning that spider
into a bodyguard,

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:48.941
it gets the spider to build
a special kind of web.

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:51.811
And so normally webs are
designed to catch insects,

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:53.412
this web is designed

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.948
to support the weight
of the cocoon.

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:58.117
And so the wasp larva waits

00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:00.452
until the spider's done
building this web,

00:07:00.452 --> 00:07:03.422
it then kills it and
then hangs its cocoon

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:07.326
safely off the floor
of the forest.

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:08.827
<i> So this is the stage</i>

00:07:08.827 --> 00:07:12.130
<i> where the spider has just
 finished building that web</i>

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.233
<i> and the wasp returns the favor</i>

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:16.169
<i> by killing it
 and eating it.</i>

00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:19.204 line:0%
<i> And this is that
 specialized web.</i>

00:07:19.204 --> 00:07:21.106 line:0%
<i> And you can tell
 what the spiders built</i>

00:07:21.106 --> 00:07:23.642 line:0%
<i> because
 the spider silk is white</i>

00:07:23.642 --> 00:07:26.144 line:0%
<i> and wasp silk is yellow.</i>

00:07:26.778 --> 00:07:29.514
<i> So this is a video
 starting with,</i>

00:07:29.514 --> 00:07:32.118
<i> after the spider
 has been killed.</i>

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.253
<i> That wasp larva is feeding on
 every last drop</i>

00:07:35.253 --> 00:07:39.057
<i> of the spider's blood in order
 to store up enough energy</i>

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:42.428
<i> to transform into an adult.</i>

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:52.537
<i> And then when it's ready
 to transform,</i>

00:07:52.537 --> 00:07:54.540
<i> it's finished digesting
 that spider</i>

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.110
<i> it then drops its own silk
 off of the spider web</i>

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.682
<i> and spins its cocoon.</i>

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.917
<i> And you can actually see
 how it uses its head</i>

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:08.621
<i> to hollow out the cavity
 inside of that cocoon.</i>

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:14.326
These... these wasps
have figured out

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:15.961
this mind control thing
pretty well.

00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:20.398
And the, the queen of
all mind controlling wasps is

00:08:20.398 --> 00:08:23.502
<i> the emerald cockroach wasp.</i>

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:27.239
<i> So this is a wasp that hunts
 cockroaches to feed its young</i>

00:08:27.239 --> 00:08:29.876
<i> And it is more cunning
 and sophisticated</i>

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:33.512
than your typical predator like
a lion or a shark.

00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:37.482
So what it does is, it starts
by paralyzing the cockroach.

00:08:37.482 --> 00:08:40.452
<i> It stings it
 right behind its head,</i>

00:08:40.452 --> 00:08:42.855
<i> paralysis the cockroach
 and then it snakes</i>

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:46.858
<i> its stinger into the brain
 of the cockroach</i>

00:08:46.858 --> 00:08:49.027
<i> where it has special censors</i>

00:08:49.027 --> 00:08:50.963
<i> so that it can grope
 around the brain</i>

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:54.900
<i> and find exactly the part
 that is responsible</i>

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.904
<i> for generating the motivation
 for movement.</i>

00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:02.241
And it disables that part.
And what that means is

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:04.510
the cockroach is
fully functional,

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.011
all of its muscles work

00:09:06.011 --> 00:09:09.181
but it cannot generate
the will to move on its own.

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:12.651
Instead it takes its queues
from the wasp.

00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:14.586
So the wasp comes back,

00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:18.491
<i> it holds the antenna of that
 cockroach,</i>

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:21.126
<i> with its mouth
 and it leads it</i>

00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:24.630
<i> as if walking a dog
 to its burrow,</i>

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.598
where it lays an egg
on its belly

00:09:26.598 --> 00:09:31.069
and buries it to be
eaten alive by its babies.

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:33.338
And those wasp larva
just like the others

00:09:33.338 --> 00:09:35.574
they know how to avoid
the internal organs

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:37.943
they can keep it fresh
as long as possible

00:09:37.943 --> 00:09:39.211
and on top of that,

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:42.114
they actually smear this
disinfecting substance

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:45.851
on the inside of the cockroach
to keep it from rotting.

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:46.986
<i> This is a
 horsehair worm,</i>

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:49.855
<i> it's using its host as both</i>

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:53.325
<i> housing and transportation.
 So in this case,</i>

00:09:53.325 --> 00:09:56.628
<i> the worm grows up
 inside the cricket</i>

00:09:56.628 --> 00:09:59.431
<i> and once it gets
 a little cramped in there,</i>

00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:02.434
it wants to come out.
And really this worm

00:10:02.434 --> 00:10:04.303
has a free living part
of its life stage.

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:06.939
It doesn't live his whole life
in the cricket.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:09.040
But the problem is
where it comes out,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.876
it has to be wet,
it's an aquatic worm

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:11.977
when it comes out.

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:15.547
So if it came out in dry land
it would dry up and die.

00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:18.617
So it makes the cricket
go find water

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:21.854
so that it can jump in,
commit suicide

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:24.857
and that worm can go on
to continue its life cycle.

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:27.225
So, in that pond
or in that stream

00:10:27.225 --> 00:10:30.362
the worm will go find a mate,
it will lay a bunch of eggs,

00:10:30.362 --> 00:10:34.399
those eggs hatch and they
burrow into mosquito larva.

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:37.136
And they insist themselves
in a mosquito larva,

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:40.239
so when the mosquitoes emerge
and they fly out,

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:41.706
their cysts are still there

00:10:41.706 --> 00:10:44.043
and that mosquito lives
its normal life,

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:48.280
it dies on land and
it gets eaten by a cricket.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.382
And the worm cyst
actually knows

00:10:50.382 --> 00:10:52.585
when it's inside of a cricket
and that's when it knows,

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:56.621
it can start developing. That's
how the life cycle continues.

00:10:56.621 --> 00:10:59.258
<i> This is an ant
 that has been infected by</i>

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:00.959
<i> 'Ophiocordyceps'.</i>

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:03.728
<i> And this fungus,
 it gets the ant</i>

00:11:03.728 --> 00:11:06.298
<i> to crawl up
 the stalk of a plant</i>

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:09.968
<i> out till the end of a leaf
 and it kills the ant there</i>

00:11:09.968 --> 00:11:11.837
<i> so that when the fungus sends</i>

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:14.607
<i> its reproductive
 structures out</i>

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:17.309
<i> those spores are
 better able to disperse</i>

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:18.477
<i> onto the forest floor.</i>

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:21.647
This is actually a really
diverse group of fungi

00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:25.384
and each species of fungus
has its own host

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:27.787
and it gets its host
to clampdown

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.087
in different parts
of the plant.

00:11:29.087 --> 00:11:30.656
Some of them are
at the tip of the leaf,

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:32.190
some of them are
on the underside,

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.727
some of them are
at the base of a tree

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:37.563
and it's thought that they
are manipulating their host

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:42.701
to maximize the ability
to disperse on to more ants.

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:44.436
And so they've actually shown
there are places

00:11:44.436 --> 00:11:47.772
where the fungus is
getting the ant to die

00:11:47.772 --> 00:11:50.376
above the foraging lines
of its colony.

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.312
So that when those
spores come out,

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:55.748
they're more likely
to get in contact

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:57.249
with more ants.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.152
<i> And actually the white eye
 you see here,</i>

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:01.886
<i> that's fungus as well.</i>

00:12:01.886 --> 00:12:03.522
<i> So what the fungus does is,</i>

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:06.725
<i> it hollows out
 the entire inside of that ant</i>

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:08.660
<i> and it just so happens
 that the exoskeleton</i>

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.796
<i> right in front of eye,
 it's thin enough</i>

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:12.798
<i> that you can see
 the fungal tissue</i>

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:15.000
<i> through the eye membrane.</i>

00:12:16.534 --> 00:12:19.404
<i> So this is a video of an ant</i>

00:12:19.404 --> 00:12:20.906
<i> this is a
 different species of ant.</i>

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:22.507
<i> That's also been
 infected by this</i>

00:12:22.507 --> 00:12:24.743
<i> cordyceps fungus--
 Ophiocordyceps fungus.</i>

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:26.545
<i> It's in its last hour of life.</i>

00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:27.780
<i> It's just twitching there</i>

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.450
<i>and the fungus has forced it to
bite down on edge of this leaf.</i>

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.118
<i> And what happens is that
 first night</i>

00:12:33.118 --> 00:12:34.886
<i> after that fungus
 kills the ant</i>

00:12:34.886 --> 00:12:38.224
<i> it bursts through,
 the weaker joints</i>

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:41.159
<i> of the exoskeleton
 and spends the next week,</i>

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:43.295
<i> growing a reproductive stock</i>

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:45.931
<i> out of the back
 of the ant's head.</i>

00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:50.402
Now...

00:12:50.935 --> 00:12:54.573
my favorite parasite
that I photographed

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:57.475
is the Rhizocephala.

00:12:57.475 --> 00:13:02.614
<i> The Rhizocephala is a
 tiny little parasitic barnacle</i>

00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:06.018
<i> that infects sheep crabs.
 This is a sheep crab here.</i>

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:09.088
<i> And what it does is it
 gets into the sheep crab</i>

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:12.458
and if the sheep crab
started off as a male

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:17.362
it turns it into a female.
It feminizes the crab

00:13:17.362 --> 00:13:19.765
and that's because
only female crabs

00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:24.170
have this structure
that can house eggs.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.105
And so the parasite waits
for this feminized male

00:13:27.105 --> 00:13:30.542
to grow this egg chamber,
it lays its own eggs

00:13:30.542 --> 00:13:33.178
in that egg chamber
and then it activates

00:13:33.178 --> 00:13:36.148
the maternal care instinct
of this crab

00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:37.983
so that it thinks
it's pregnant

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:41.320
and it will care for
the eggs of the parasite.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.689
Then every two weeks,

00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:46.992
those eggs mature
and they hatch out

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:49.995
and they go on to infect
more crabs.

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:51.296
So what you see here is

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:53.498
<i> every little speck
 in this photo</i>

00:13:53.498 --> 00:13:56.735
<i> is a newly hatched
 parasitic barnacle</i>

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:59.771
<i> that is going out to infect
 a new crab.</i>

00:14:00.405 --> 00:14:02.774 line:0%
<i> So let me, let me back up
 and tell little more about</i>

00:14:02.774 --> 00:14:06.078 line:0%
<i> where the story came from,
 where the idea came from.</i>

00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:08.613
So I was working
with my editor Todd James

00:14:08.613 --> 00:14:11.817
and you know, he just said
look we got to figure out

00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:13.385
a fresh approach to this,

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.154
it's got to be
something different.

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:18.924
And you know, I agreed,
the pictures of parasites

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:22.927
I had seen to that point
were like jars of leeches or

00:14:22.927 --> 00:14:26.631
a worm getting pulled out of
somebody's eye and its like--

00:14:26.631 --> 00:14:28.834
They were very successful
in grossing you out,

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.503
but they really failed
in getting you to appreciate

00:14:31.503 --> 00:14:33.772
how incredible
these creatures are.

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:35.807
But then there's also
the sake of this,

00:14:35.807 --> 00:14:39.277
this problem of okay, what,
how do I light these creatures,

00:14:39.277 --> 00:14:41.380
these parasites in a new way.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.583
Because up until that point,
macro photography for me was

00:14:45.583 --> 00:14:47.886
find a cool bug,
shine some light on it,

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:49.053
take a picture.

00:14:49.053 --> 00:14:51.055
You know, you could make it
a sharp light,

00:14:51.055 --> 00:14:52.724
you could make it soft light,

00:14:52.724 --> 00:14:56.461
you could light if from
this way or that way,

00:14:56.461 --> 00:14:58.430
that's about it.
I mean how do I,

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.965
how do I take this
to a next level?

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:02.401
How I find a
more interesting way

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:04.169
to light these creatures?

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:07.305
And I had this idea
while I was sitting

00:15:07.305 --> 00:15:10.375
in my friend Stacy's apartment
in Oakland.

00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:13.044
And I don't remember
what we're talking about

00:15:13.044 --> 00:15:14.479
because I was distracted

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:16.614
by the quality of light
on her face.

00:15:16.614 --> 00:15:19.318
She was sitting
in front of a window.

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:24.155
<i> This is Stacy in front of
 her window in Oakland</i>

00:15:24.155 --> 00:15:27.192
<i> and the window light was
 coming around her head,</i>

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:29.995
<i> lighting the sides of her
 cheeks and her nose</i>

00:15:29.995 --> 00:15:32.264
<i> and showing
 the topography in a way,</i>

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:34.299
<i> that I never really
 thought about before.</i>

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:37.703
I thought how do
I scale this down

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:39.304
to a parasite level.

00:15:39.304 --> 00:15:42.841
Can I use this
to light parasites

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:46.078
and show the shape and
contours in a new way?

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:50.715
And so I had my Stacy light,
I had my volcano light

00:15:50.715 --> 00:15:54.986
I had this idea of how to
light backgrounds to emphasize

00:15:54.986 --> 00:15:57.155
the drama and action going on,

00:15:57.155 --> 00:15:58.991
but you know,
what does that really look like

00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:01.026
to implement in the field.

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:03.828
Well, let me show you.

00:16:03.828 --> 00:16:06.164
<i> Most of the work was done
 in hotel rooms.</i>

00:16:06.164 --> 00:16:08.900
<i> So this is a hotel room
 in Costa Rica,</i>

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.536
<i> where I'm trying to
 photograph this</i>

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.938
<i> spider being parasitized
 by a wasp</i>

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:14.606
<i> there's buckets of spiders
 everywhere</i>

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.474
<i> that I'm trying to hide from
 the housekeeping staff</i>

00:16:16.474 --> 00:16:18.110
<i> so they won't throw them out.</i>

00:16:21.246 --> 00:16:24.082
<i> And then, you know,</i>

00:16:24.082 --> 00:16:26.618
<i> hotel rooms really aren't
 well-designed for photography,</i>

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:29.488
<i> so there is a lot of
 moving furniture around</i>

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:32.157
<i> and in this case,
 what I'm trying to do is</i>

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.093
<i> I'm trying to set up
 a time lapse</i>

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:36.962
<i> of these fungus flowers
 in South Dakota, growing,</i>

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:39.631
<i> and I borrowed this light
 that had been confiscated</i>

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:42.667
<i> from an illegal marijuana
 growing operation in Spearfish</i>

00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:44.836
<i> ( laughter ) And had been
 donated to the University</i>

00:16:44.836 --> 00:16:48.106
<i> who then lent it to me.
 And after all this effort,
 it totally failed.</i>

00:16:48.106 --> 00:16:50.275
<i> It was not useful at all.</i>

00:16:50.275 --> 00:16:52.477
<i> And I ended up building
 a lot of my own contraptions,</i>

00:16:52.477 --> 00:16:53.812
<i> lighting contraptions
 in this case</i>

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:56.615
<i> I was trying to use this
 fiber-optic linelight</i>

00:16:56.615 --> 00:17:01.553
<i> to build a makeshift scanner,
 to scan this plant</i>

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:03.121
<i> because there's a
 beautiful quality of light</i>

00:17:03.121 --> 00:17:06.324
<i> that flatbed scanners
 produce on flowers</i>

00:17:06.324 --> 00:17:08.360
<i> and I wanted to try to
 make that and it</i>

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.028
<i> again totally failed.
 It was</i>

00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:13.532
<i> a pain in the butt to use,
 it didn't really workout.</i>

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.667
<i> This is the setup
 I used to photograph the cover</i>

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:17.368
<i> in a lab in Montréal.</i>

00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:20.205
<i> And so I was able to set up
 in some research labs,</i>

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:23.408
<i> which has some advantages
 and disadvantages.</i>

00:17:23.408 --> 00:17:24.809
<i> The main disadvantage
 is sometimes</i>

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:26.077
<i> you don't have a lot of space,</i>

00:17:26.077 --> 00:17:29.981
<i> this is in Boulder
 at P. Johnson's lab</i>

00:17:29.981 --> 00:17:34.686
<i> where I'm trying to photograph
 this deformed frog.</i>

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:37.222
Of all of these creatures,
though,

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:39.224
the most difficult
to photograph

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:40.725
was actually that cricket,

00:17:40.725 --> 00:17:44.096
and I visited this lab
in New Mexico,

00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:47.499
a couple of times
where Ben Hanelt had

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:49.868
these infected crickets
in his lab.

00:17:49.868 --> 00:17:51.470
And the first time
they all died

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.972
the night before I got there,
the second time

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:57.109
they weren't ready
the worms took too long to,

00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:58.610
to mature
so they weren't ready

00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:59.911
when I got there
and I just said

00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:01.980
you know what, forgot this
and I packed them into my bag

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.883
and I flew back with them
to California.

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:08.720
And so my housemates
at this point

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.655
are used to this
kind of nonsense

00:18:10.655 --> 00:18:12.124
and one of them is a
documentary film maker

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:13.925
and so he filmed me,

00:18:13.925 --> 00:18:16.494
photographing these
crickets, so...

00:18:16.494 --> 00:18:19.464
<i> I kept them in the,</i>

00:18:19.464 --> 00:18:21.132
<i> in the hot water
 heater room,</i>

00:18:21.132 --> 00:18:24.136
<i> where they would stay warm.
 This is my kitchen.</i>

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:27.538
<i> And the thing about these
 crickets and the worms</i>

00:18:27.538 --> 00:18:28.907
<i> is that you can actually tell</i>

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:32.276
<i> when the worms are
 ready to come out.</i>

00:18:32.276 --> 00:18:34.479
<i> They actually turn dark brown,</i>

00:18:34.479 --> 00:18:36.114
<i> and you can see them
 coiled up</i>

00:18:36.114 --> 00:18:38.683
<i> inside the belly
 of these crickets.</i>

00:18:38.683 --> 00:18:41.353
<i> And so I'm setting up
 my fiber-optic lights</i>

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:44.022
<i> and getting ready to
 photograph these things.</i>

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:45.457
<i> Not my best hair day.</i>

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.625
( laughter )

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:48.994
<i> Most of this stuff happens</i>

00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:50.462
<i> at 2 o'clock in
 the morning and so I</i>

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:53.665
<i> sort of didn't remember that
 he was filming me that day.</i>

00:18:57.402 --> 00:19:01.172
<i> And so, I'm actually putting
 a layer of Rain X
 down on the glass</i>

00:19:01.172 --> 00:19:04.242
<i> and so that
 beads up the water nicely.</i>

00:19:04.242 --> 00:19:05.777
<i> And then I put the crickets
 in the fridge,</i>

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:07.879
<i> for a few minutes
 to cool them down</i>

00:19:07.879 --> 00:19:10.315
<i> so they wouldn't hop
 all over the place.</i>

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:12.550
<i> And the liquid that I'm using
 is not actually water,</i>

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.388
<i> it's called cricket saline,
 it's a solution that mimics</i>

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:18.890
<i> the internal chemistry
 of the cricket.</i>

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.093
<i> So, that when the worms
 come out they don't freak out.</i>

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:22.928
<i> They think they're still
 inside the cricket.</i>

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:35.140
<i> So that picture took me about</i>

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.677
<i> twenty-three days
 to figure out.</i>

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:41.846
<i> Now, a lot of that I did at
 home and so it was not like</i>

00:19:41.846 --> 00:19:45.350
I was working on it,
24 hours a day,

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.352
some days it was only
a couple of hours, but

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:50.421
all the tricks with the Rain X,
with the fridge,

00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:51.823
with the cricket saline.
These are not things

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:52.991
that I knew about
ahead of time.

00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:54.960
There are things that
I just had to work out

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.297
on the fly, through one
iteration after the next.

00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:02.633
And you figure out a problem,
or, you come across a problem

00:20:02.633 --> 00:20:04.336
you just have to
figure out a solution.

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:07.372
The cricket's too jumpy,
the worm's freaking out,

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:09.908
the water
doesn't look right and

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:12.310
you just have to take what,
what you've solved

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.845
and build on that.

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:16.714
And so there was a point
early on in the story

00:20:16.714 --> 00:20:20.185
where my editor, Todd
wanted to see my...

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:23.555
my progress on
the story and...

00:20:24.523 --> 00:20:27.859
you know, he didn't really
have time to

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:29.761
look through all my pictures,
he wanted to send me--

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:32.830
he wanted me to send him
a small selection.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:36.601
And really I wanted him to see
all my pictures because

00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:39.204
I wanted to show him all the
different variations I did.

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:40.639
I assumed
he was going to tell me,

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:43.041
oh, go back and shoot that
from another angle

00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:44.977
and I wanted to be
able to tell him,

00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:48.279
'look man,
I tried all the angles.'

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:53.518
So, but he asked for,
he asked for a limited selection

00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:56.120
and so I was scanning
through these pictures,

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.956
it was late at night
I was listening to some

00:20:57.956 --> 00:21:00.659
electronic music
to keep me awake.

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:06.265
And all of a sudden this,
this images on my screen

00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:08.133
started to sync up

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:10.334
with the music
I was listening to

00:21:10.334 --> 00:21:11.903
and I had this idea that
'wait a minute!'

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:14.706
If I can just take
all of these images

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:16.707
and I can create
a stop motion

00:21:16.707 --> 00:21:19.110
by playing them all
at 15 frames a second.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.578
That way in five minutes

00:21:20.578 --> 00:21:23.347
Todd can see every image
I have taken

00:21:23.347 --> 00:21:25.417
and all the iterations
and variations

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:27.518
I did in between
and I just threw

00:21:27.518 --> 00:21:30.989
the layer of music on top
just for, for kicks.

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:33.592
By the end of the story
I had 33,000 pictures

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:35.526
and even at
15 frames a second,

00:21:35.526 --> 00:21:37.662
that's a very long video so

00:21:37.662 --> 00:21:40.232
I cut that down and
here is the edited version

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:42.533
of that original...

00:21:42.533 --> 00:21:45.570
Dubstep parasite music video.
( laughter )

00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:49.308
( dubstep music )

00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:05.884
( applause )

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:09.020
( outro music )
