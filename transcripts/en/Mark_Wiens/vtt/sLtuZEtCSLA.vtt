00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.273
- More, more.
- More.

00:00:01.273 --> 00:00:03.022
- Much more.
- Okay, much more.

00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:04.939
- [Neighbor] Much more.

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:08.163
It's okay.
- Okay, good amount?

00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:10.413
A little bit of everything.

00:00:12.655 --> 00:00:13.488
All right.

00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:17.071
(chattering in background)

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.543
(lively music)

00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.560
Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.513
with migrationology.com
in Lisbon, Portugal.

00:00:27.513 --> 00:00:30.335
This is my last full day in Lisbon,

00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:32.418
and I'm gonna do everything I can to eat

00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:36.110
as much Portuguese food today as possible.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.666
On the edge of this square there is

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.940
a legendary coffee shop that's known to be

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.873
the first cafe in all of Lisbon,

00:00:42.873 --> 00:00:45.019
and while some people
say it's a little bit

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.159
of a tourist trap these days,

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.958
they are known and locals have told me

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:54.653
that they serve, they still
serve the best cod pastry,

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:55.886
so I thought that would be a great way

00:00:55.886 --> 00:00:57.026
to start the day,

00:00:57.026 --> 00:01:00.091
and also with a cup of coffee.

00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:01.564
(speaks foreign language)

00:01:01.564 --> 00:01:04.230
This cafe and actually,
it's a restaurant as well,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.379
they serve full meals.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.856
It is called Martinho do Arcada, and

00:01:08.856 --> 00:01:11.119
this is a legendary place.

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.952
It dates back to 1782.

00:01:14.212 --> 00:01:15.709
They have an indoor section,

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:18.041
but this outdoor patio
section is really nice

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:20.151
under the arches of this old building,

00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:23.690
and you have a view of the
square, the plaza as well,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.042
and I came here mainly to have a coffee

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:27.860
at the beginning of the day, and also

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.943
to try their cod cutlets.

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.043
These are the pasteis de bacalhau,

00:01:33.043 --> 00:01:36.087
and I think they are a mixture of potato,

00:01:36.087 --> 00:01:38.274
as well as the codfish,

00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:41.652
and then also maybe cilantro
or parsley in there,

00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:43.375
and then deep fried and you can little see

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:47.061
the little, almost little
hairs of deep friedness

00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:48.374
coming off of them.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.075
This is one of those things
that's right at that size

00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:52.567
where you're not sure if you should eat it

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:56.135
in one bite, or just bite half of it.

00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:59.412
Actually, for sake of
wanting to see what's inside

00:01:59.412 --> 00:02:01.995
I'll bite half of it this time.

00:02:06.117 --> 00:02:06.950
Mmm.

00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:10.861
Wow, that's fantastic.

00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:14.028
That is like, I was expecting the fish

00:02:14.028 --> 00:02:16.134
to sort of be stuffed within the potato,

00:02:16.134 --> 00:02:18.475
but it's actually mixed all together, and

00:02:18.475 --> 00:02:21.959
due to cod being that,
having that kind of rubbery,

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.676
stringy texture to it,

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:28.039
they're like little,
it's like fibers of cod

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.422
that are mixed in,

00:02:29.422 --> 00:02:32.377
and it doesn't taste too potato-heavy.

00:02:32.377 --> 00:02:35.216
It's more like light and fluffy.

00:02:35.216 --> 00:02:39.797
Mmm, it's salty and just a
little bit crispy on the edges.

00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:40.880
It's awesome.

00:02:43.456 --> 00:02:44.289
Mmm, mmm.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.344
The mixture and combination,

00:02:49.344 --> 00:02:51.570
they have the ratio down perfectly.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.570
Follow that with coffee.

00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:57.734
Ahh, mmm.

00:02:59.251 --> 00:03:02.110
I've really been impressed
with the coffee in Portugal.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.346
They make really good coffee

00:03:03.346 --> 00:03:05.267
at every single coffee shop I've been to.

00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:09.017
The coffee is dark, it's
strong, it's smooth.

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:11.112
It's wonderful.

00:03:11.112 --> 00:03:14.305
And I'm down to my last
pasteis de bacalhau.

00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:16.638
I think I can one bite this.

00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:19.558
Mmm.

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.335
Yeah, those are really good.

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:25.284
And they go really well with coffee.

00:03:25.284 --> 00:03:27.682
I couldn't resist ordering
one more cup of coffee.

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:30.532
This is just such a
wonderful morning in Lisbon,

00:03:30.532 --> 00:03:32.261
such a wonderful patio,

00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:34.761
and such a legendary old cafe.

00:03:39.064 --> 00:03:40.125
Ahh.

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:43.625
(trolley rattling)

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.696
You've been to cafes and restaurants

00:03:45.696 --> 00:03:48.946
that say like since 1975 or since 1959,

00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:53.535
and those are really old restaurants,

00:03:53.535 --> 00:03:57.375
but this cafe just blows history away.

00:03:57.375 --> 00:03:58.292
Since 1782.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.228
I was just sitting there
thinking, drinking my coffee,

00:04:03.228 --> 00:04:06.082
thinking about how old that cafe is.

00:04:06.082 --> 00:04:09.259
That is just awesome,
and that was a great cup

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:10.984
or two cups of coffee,

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:13.151
and a very good cod pastry

00:04:14.962 --> 00:04:17.267
that is a classic.

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:19.850
(upbeat music)

00:04:27.902 --> 00:04:31.236
We have about an hour until
the lunch restaurant opens,

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:34.277
and so we are just slowly making our way,

00:04:34.277 --> 00:04:37.381
enjoying just the beauty of Lisbon,

00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:41.207
the old, narrow streets,
the cafes, the shops,

00:04:41.207 --> 00:04:43.714
and on our way to lunch, slowly.

00:04:43.714 --> 00:04:46.297
(upbeat music)

00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:58.191
I have some very unfortunate news.

00:04:58.191 --> 00:05:00.980
The restaurant, Ze da Mouraria,

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.553
they should be open right now

00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:05.525
but it looks like they are not gonna open.

00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:07.058
Oh, that's a little bit disappointing.

00:05:07.058 --> 00:05:09.243
This is the number one
Portuguese restaurant

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:11.597
I wanted to try here in Lisbon.

00:05:11.597 --> 00:05:14.994
Things are just not quite
working out so smoothly

00:05:14.994 --> 00:05:18.100
for food in Lisbon, but that's okay.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.369
Sometimes that's how travel goes.

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:22.895
There is another restaurant
just down the road here

00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:25.686
that serves Mozambique and a combination

00:05:25.686 --> 00:05:27.769
of Portuguese and
Mozambique and Indian food

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:30.441
that I would also like to try, so

00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:32.076
we're gonna check out that place next.

00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:34.659
(upbeat music)

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:44.079
This place is called Cantinho do Aziz,

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:47.401
and this is a lovely
restaurant on the sidewalk,

00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:51.011
up a flight of steps, so
it's a quiet neighborhood.

00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:54.664
Beautiful environment, and
it's a colorful restaurant.

00:05:54.664 --> 00:05:56.732
A yellow painted wall with art

00:05:56.732 --> 00:05:58.482
designed on the wall.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.145
The tablecloths are beautiful.

00:06:01.145 --> 00:06:04.554
This is fantastic, I
can smell the aroma of

00:06:04.554 --> 00:06:06.955
grilling meat, as well as

00:06:06.955 --> 00:06:10.359
maybe some like curry spices in the air,

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:12.097
which smells delicious.

00:06:12.097 --> 00:06:14.793
Most of the dishes are Mozambiquan,

00:06:14.793 --> 00:06:17.613
but then there's also some

00:06:17.613 --> 00:06:20.423
Indian influence and also
some Portuguese influence

00:06:20.423 --> 00:06:22.976
on the menu and what I
like is that each dish,

00:06:22.976 --> 00:06:24.508
all the dishes are listed on the menu

00:06:24.508 --> 00:06:27.097
and they each have a story about the chef

00:06:27.097 --> 00:06:29.629
and how the dish came about.

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.791
They just served the beef samosas

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.896
and they smell incredible.

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:35.442
And when he served them,

00:06:35.442 --> 00:06:37.910
he said this sauce is very spicy.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.509
That is exactly what I wanted to hear.

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.577
I'm gonna need a lot of this.

00:06:44.577 --> 00:06:46.102
That looks wonderful.

00:06:46.102 --> 00:06:47.495
(chattering in background)

00:06:47.495 --> 00:06:49.828
(crunching)

00:06:55.153 --> 00:06:57.103
Oh, that's incredibly delicious.

00:06:57.103 --> 00:07:00.317
It tastes like curry minced meat,

00:07:00.317 --> 00:07:02.226
and it's fried very, very fresh.

00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:05.143
The outside crust, the outside skin

00:07:06.214 --> 00:07:09.129
is completely crispy, and then,

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:10.388
I think there are onions in there,

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:12.951
and that sauce is actually quite spicy.

00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:14.106
That's fantastic.

00:07:14.106 --> 00:07:17.939
I think I want to soak
my entire samosa in it.

00:07:20.725 --> 00:07:23.058
(crunching)

00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:32.366
This is one of the best samosas I've had

00:07:32.366 --> 00:07:34.231
in a very long time.

00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:36.685
That is amazing, and that sauce,

00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:38.828
I think it's chilies, I'm not,
maybe some turmeric in there

00:07:38.828 --> 00:07:40.328
to make it orange.

00:07:41.723 --> 00:07:44.140
But it's just awesomely good.

00:07:47.328 --> 00:07:49.661
(crunching)

00:07:51.453 --> 00:07:52.703
Thank you, yes.

00:07:54.622 --> 00:07:56.114
You want more samosa, you want one more?

00:07:56.114 --> 00:07:56.947
- Up to you.

00:07:56.947 --> 00:08:00.169
- After that absolutely sensational samosa

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:02.829
there is nothing I could do
from ordering another one,

00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:05.169
so that's on its way, but in the meantime,

00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:08.385
my main plate of food has just arrived.

00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:10.532
This is unbelievable-looking.

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:11.930
I'm so happy right now.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.978
I got the lamb ribs, and
I think it's coconut rice

00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:18.511
and this, oh, this is
just looking sensational.

00:08:18.511 --> 00:08:22.735
I'm gonna dig right into
that lamb rib piece.

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:24.373
Oh, I need a spoon to eat this.

00:08:24.373 --> 00:08:26.320
Oh, they did serve a spoon in this.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.006
I'm gonna steal this spoon from the rice.

00:08:29.006 --> 00:08:32.339
I'm gonna go for that piece right there.

00:08:33.484 --> 00:08:35.718
Oh, yes, it is tender.

00:08:35.718 --> 00:08:39.051
Oh, yes, look at that meat and the rice.

00:08:51.693 --> 00:08:53.507
That's as good as it looks.

00:08:53.507 --> 00:08:54.340
So tender,

00:08:55.283 --> 00:08:57.341
you can taste the lamb flavor.

00:08:57.341 --> 00:09:01.087
It's like a salty, little bit spicy curry.

00:09:01.087 --> 00:09:03.807
You can taste that blend
of spices going there.

00:09:03.807 --> 00:09:06.991
It's a little bit oily, and
it goes incredibly well.

00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:08.760
I think that is coconut rice.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.891
It's a little bit sticky, and then has a

00:09:11.891 --> 00:09:14.186
wonderful fragrance to it.

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:16.998
Oh, this is my kind of food.

00:09:16.998 --> 00:09:18.415
Like a drumstick.

00:09:31.273 --> 00:09:33.325
Yes, fantastic.

00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:35.285
This chili sauce

00:09:35.285 --> 00:09:39.202
is one of the award
winners at this restaurant.

00:09:40.717 --> 00:09:44.045
Let me add on a little
bit of that chili sauce,

00:09:44.045 --> 00:09:45.712
get some of the lamb

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.190
with that chili sauce in rice.

00:10:04.138 --> 00:10:06.209
That bumps it up a notch.

00:10:06.209 --> 00:10:09.409
I had to get one more samosa.

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:12.576
It was impossible to resist, actually.

00:10:22.046 --> 00:10:23.958
If you come to this restaurant,

00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.127
just go ahead and order yourself

00:10:26.127 --> 00:10:29.708
two to five samosas for yourself.

00:10:29.708 --> 00:10:32.421
You're gonna want them, believe me.

00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:33.982
Just amazing.

00:10:33.982 --> 00:10:37.408
It turned out to be an
absolute stunner of a meal.

00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:39.622
Delicious food, the samosas were good,

00:10:39.622 --> 00:10:43.205
the chili sauce was
absolute award winning,

00:10:43.205 --> 00:10:45.035
and that lamb curry.

00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:47.090
They also have Peri Peri grilled chicken,

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.057
which also looks fantastic.

00:10:49.057 --> 00:10:53.249
Next time I come I will
be eating that, and

00:10:53.249 --> 00:10:56.328
just a nice place, very friendly,

00:10:56.328 --> 00:10:58.601
and nice ambiance, nice environment,

00:10:58.601 --> 00:11:02.517
tucked away in a little
like, stairway cul-de-sac.

00:11:02.517 --> 00:11:04.109
Thank you very much to Isabel

00:11:04.109 --> 00:11:06.359
for recommending this restaurant.

00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:08.192
That has really lifted my spirits.

00:11:08.192 --> 00:11:11.025
(inspiring music)

00:11:13.935 --> 00:11:16.048
Ying and I are walking
just a couple blocks over

00:11:16.048 --> 00:11:18.421
to go have lunch number two,

00:11:18.421 --> 00:11:20.921
and this time Portuguese food.

00:11:37.006 --> 00:11:39.810
And this is a restaurant
that's right in the heart

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.468
of Lisbon, right in the
major touristy district,

00:11:43.468 --> 00:11:45.697
but it is down a little side,

00:11:45.697 --> 00:11:47.864
kind of almost a cove, and

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:52.741
it's full right now, so Ying
and I are waiting to get in.

00:11:52.741 --> 00:11:56.092
- The dishes of the day
is octopus and pork ribs.

00:11:56.092 --> 00:11:57.425
Fried pork ribs.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.532
- [Ying] You're gonna need some of these.

00:11:59.532 --> 00:12:02.140
- [Mark] What I want to get is this one,

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.886
capped with this one.

00:12:03.886 --> 00:12:07.816
I think I want to try the
(speaks foreign language).

00:12:07.816 --> 00:12:09.400
- [Waiter] Well, the codfish?

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.233
- Codfish?

00:12:10.233 --> 00:12:11.066
- [Waiter] With the
chickpeas and potatoes.

00:12:11.066 --> 00:12:13.984
- And also the (speaks foreign language).

00:12:13.984 --> 00:12:15.421
We didn't get a table yet but

00:12:15.421 --> 00:12:17.934
we got a menu and we
looked through the menu but

00:12:17.934 --> 00:12:20.414
I already knew the exact two
dishes I wanted to order,

00:12:20.414 --> 00:12:21.788
so we just ordered with the waiter.

00:12:21.788 --> 00:12:22.775
He's gonna put our order in

00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:24.178
and then as soon as a table is ready

00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:26.615
we will sit down and eat lunch.

00:12:26.615 --> 00:12:29.450
(chattering)

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.211
This is a pretty small
and compact restaurant,

00:12:32.211 --> 00:12:34.824
but it's awesome that you
can see everything and

00:12:34.824 --> 00:12:36.623
you can see upstairs.

00:12:36.623 --> 00:12:38.124
Yeah, I don't know where the chef went but

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:40.682
you can see him cooking
upstairs on the upper level

00:12:40.682 --> 00:12:43.001
and then on the ground level

00:12:43.001 --> 00:12:45.168
there are communal tables.

00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:52.953
We got a table right in the
center of this communal table.

00:12:52.953 --> 00:12:56.313
This is a fantastic ambiance, and

00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:57.536
the food should be coming soon,

00:12:57.536 --> 00:12:59.869
since I already pre-ordered.

00:13:11.526 --> 00:13:12.725
Thank you.

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:13.967
Huge portions,

00:13:13.967 --> 00:13:17.098
and this is some real
classic Portuguese food.

00:13:17.098 --> 00:13:19.555
There are many different
seafoods to eat in Portugal,

00:13:19.555 --> 00:13:22.486
but one of the local
favorites is bacalhau,

00:13:22.486 --> 00:13:24.014
which is codfish,

00:13:24.014 --> 00:13:26.205
and this one is a real classic dish,

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:29.436
codfish with chickpeas,
there are potatoes on here,

00:13:29.436 --> 00:13:32.599
and it looks simple,
but it looks fantastic.

00:13:32.599 --> 00:13:36.155
I'm gonna take some of the codfish,

00:13:36.155 --> 00:13:38.938
put this over onto my plate.

00:13:38.938 --> 00:13:41.896
Oh yeah, you can smell that
preserved saltiness of the fish.

00:13:41.896 --> 00:13:44.813
Take some of the chickpeas as well,

00:13:47.337 --> 00:13:49.473
and then also I think this dish came with

00:13:49.473 --> 00:13:53.703
this plate of onions and
parsley to go on top.

00:13:53.703 --> 00:13:55.712
Add a little bit, oh and raw garlic.

00:13:55.712 --> 00:13:59.792
Oh I will be eating those
cloves of raw garlic as well.

00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:00.625
Okay.

00:14:03.651 --> 00:14:04.893
Okay.

00:14:04.893 --> 00:14:08.169
Now let me grab, let me change
my silverware to the fork

00:14:08.169 --> 00:14:10.252
and knife, piece of fish.

00:14:19.112 --> 00:14:20.829
Yeah, that's very salty.

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:25.107
Salted cod, but the
texture of cod is so good,

00:14:25.107 --> 00:14:28.077
and it's yeah, it's very flaky.

00:14:28.077 --> 00:14:32.336
It's actually quite juicy,
and then very salty.

00:14:32.336 --> 00:14:33.749
- [Neighbor] Add a little of vinegar

00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:35.832
to see whether you like or not.

00:14:35.832 --> 00:14:37.212
- Okay, thank you,

00:14:37.212 --> 00:14:38.426
thank you.
- It depends on your taste.

00:14:38.426 --> 00:14:40.274
I used to like both, now I prefer

00:14:40.274 --> 00:14:41.224
only the olive oil,

00:14:41.224 --> 00:14:43.432
but many people, they're trying it.

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:47.432
- This time I'm gonna
drizzle it with olive oil.

00:14:51.612 --> 00:14:53.197
Okay, I think that should be good.

00:14:53.197 --> 00:14:55.197
Little bit of olive oil.

00:14:56.899 --> 00:14:57.762
- [Neighbor] Put more.

00:14:57.762 --> 00:14:58.595
Is that good?

00:14:58.595 --> 00:14:59.428
- [Neighbor] More, more.

00:14:59.428 --> 00:15:00.326
Much more.
- More.

00:15:00.326 --> 00:15:01.359
Okay, much more.

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:02.592
- [Neighbor] Much more.

00:15:02.592 --> 00:15:05.509
- [Mark] Okay, much more olive oil.

00:15:07.258 --> 00:15:08.124
- [Neighbor] It's okay.

00:15:08.124 --> 00:15:09.493
- Okay? Good amount?

00:15:09.493 --> 00:15:12.133
(Mark chuckles)

00:15:12.133 --> 00:15:15.098
Okay, so you have to
drizzle it in olive oil.

00:15:15.098 --> 00:15:17.700
That's what makes it bacalhau.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.533
Okay.

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:21.527
And now this time I'm
just gonna use my spoon

00:15:21.527 --> 00:15:23.685
to grab up, oh, I want
to get some potatoes

00:15:23.685 --> 00:15:24.978
in this bite too,

00:15:24.978 --> 00:15:27.228
a little bit of everything.

00:15:29.311 --> 00:15:30.144
All right.

00:15:34.853 --> 00:15:35.686
Oh yeah.

00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:38.181
That does make it good.

00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:39.192
- [Neighbor] Completely different.

00:15:39.192 --> 00:15:40.025
- Mm-Hmm.

00:15:41.836 --> 00:15:45.910
Now it kinda like tones
down the fishy taste

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.610
of the cod,

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.615
and makes it more juicy of
course, because of that oil,

00:15:51.615 --> 00:15:55.461
or oily, but the oil is very fragrant.

00:15:55.461 --> 00:15:57.253
That does like wrap it all together.

00:15:57.253 --> 00:16:00.670
I'm gonna move into this clove of garlic.

00:16:02.142 --> 00:16:04.892
Try to chop that up a little bit.

00:16:06.954 --> 00:16:09.237
Take it with a piece of garlic,

00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:10.737
cod and chickpeas.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.073
Oh yeah.

00:16:19.294 --> 00:16:20.211
Raw garlic.

00:16:21.107 --> 00:16:22.770
Raw garlic improves everything.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.854
Next I'm gonna try some vinegar.

00:16:24.854 --> 00:16:27.903
- When you put together you should,

00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:30.263
you should join them, okay, you put there.

00:16:30.263 --> 00:16:31.096
- [Mark] What, in the side?

00:16:31.096 --> 00:16:33.041
- [Neighbor] And you try a
little olive oil in the mix.

00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:36.115
- [Mark] Okay, so I should
put a little bit of vinegar,

00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:37.299
and then put olive oil down?

00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:39.975
- [Neighbor] Yeah, little bit more.

00:16:39.975 --> 00:16:40.892
You mix it.

00:16:45.336 --> 00:16:47.215
And then a little of potato there.

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.132
It's a different taste.

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.979
- [Mark] Oh, and then mix it around.

00:16:49.979 --> 00:16:50.812
Okay.

00:16:50.812 --> 00:16:53.178
(Ying laughs)

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.437
Thank you.

00:16:54.437 --> 00:16:57.828
Okay, so that's a combination
of vinegar and olive oil

00:16:57.828 --> 00:17:00.328
at the bottom of my plate now.

00:17:01.436 --> 00:17:02.269
Mmm.

00:17:03.654 --> 00:17:06.584
It's good with the vinegar too, yeah.

00:17:06.584 --> 00:17:09.218
Yeah, the vinegar gives it
of course a sour flavor,

00:17:09.218 --> 00:17:13.472
but it's kinda refreshing
with the saltiness of the cod.

00:17:13.472 --> 00:17:17.055
And also got some tomato
salad with onions.

00:17:18.144 --> 00:17:19.782
Set this down.

00:17:19.782 --> 00:17:21.202
I think this is just pure tomatoes,

00:17:21.202 --> 00:17:23.952
maybe with some olive oil on top.

00:17:29.402 --> 00:17:31.132
Those are really juicy tomatoes,

00:17:31.132 --> 00:17:33.392
and the tomatoes are
also incredibly sweet.

00:17:33.392 --> 00:17:34.364
The next dish we got

00:17:34.364 --> 00:17:36.344
is also a very classic Portuguese dish,

00:17:36.344 --> 00:17:39.002
it is a pork stew with clams,

00:17:39.002 --> 00:17:41.140
and then it's also served with

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.592
some fried slices of potatoes on the side.

00:17:43.592 --> 00:17:44.832
I'm not totally sure what this is.

00:17:44.832 --> 00:17:46.528
It looks like, oh,

00:17:46.528 --> 00:17:48.452
it feels kind of like bread.
- It's bread.

00:17:48.452 --> 00:17:49.869
Bread with garlic

00:17:50.748 --> 00:17:51.728
on the oven.

00:17:51.728 --> 00:17:53.003
- [Mark] Oh, okay.

00:17:53.003 --> 00:17:56.517
It kind of has a pudding feel to it.

00:17:56.517 --> 00:17:58.322
- This is fried pork, not stewed,

00:17:58.322 --> 00:18:01.457
and then the sauce comes from that.

00:18:01.457 --> 00:18:02.419
That's fried.

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:04.326
- You're not supposed to eat
this dish with olive oil,

00:18:04.326 --> 00:18:06.644
so I'm gonna switch over to a clean plate,

00:18:06.644 --> 00:18:09.278
and then this, it feels almost like

00:18:09.278 --> 00:18:11.522
pudding in texture, it's a bread,

00:18:11.522 --> 00:18:14.399
and then the potatoes on,
and then a few clams on top,

00:18:14.399 --> 00:18:16.949
so I will take a little bit of everything

00:18:16.949 --> 00:18:18.616
onto my plate again.

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:23.630
Oh, and I got a clam
that came out already.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.797
Okay, and then some of those potatoes.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.433
Okay.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.342
All right.

00:18:34.342 --> 00:18:35.175
Pork.

00:18:39.542 --> 00:18:41.875
Pork and some of that bread.

00:18:44.052 --> 00:18:45.361
Mmm.

00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:46.194
Oh, yeah.

00:18:47.074 --> 00:18:49.587
The bread has like a,

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:51.337
a bacon flavor to it,

00:18:52.317 --> 00:18:54.900
a very smoky meat flavor to it,

00:18:55.933 --> 00:18:59.507
and then the pork, those
are big nuggets of pork.

00:18:59.507 --> 00:19:02.424
It has like a roasted chili flavor.

00:19:06.313 --> 00:19:08.730
It tastes like, like paprika.

00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:10.997
Maybe that's paprika.

00:19:10.997 --> 00:19:12.867
- Most always cooked on the same way,

00:19:12.867 --> 00:19:15.064
so we know that we will like it

00:19:15.064 --> 00:19:17.431
because it will taste the same thing as

00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:19.576
this one and that one, and yes.

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:20.769
- Okay, but these are very--

00:19:20.769 --> 00:19:21.644
- Depends.

00:19:21.644 --> 00:19:23.747
- Very common dishes, classic dishes.

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:24.850
- This is the most common dish.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:25.814
- The most common.

00:19:25.814 --> 00:19:27.537
- This is a common dish also.

00:19:27.537 --> 00:19:28.699
- Try one of these potatoes,

00:19:28.699 --> 00:19:32.616
and I may as well add
that piece of pork to it.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.013
Mmm.

00:19:37.572 --> 00:19:39.321
I like that potato.

00:19:39.321 --> 00:19:41.738
It's sliced just thin enough,

00:19:42.782 --> 00:19:44.696
so it's not like a chip,

00:19:44.696 --> 00:19:47.503
but it is crispy almost
all the way through,

00:19:47.503 --> 00:19:50.959
but then just a little center that is

00:19:50.959 --> 00:19:52.319
starchy potato.

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:54.378
I have just, for the last 15 minutes

00:19:54.378 --> 00:19:56.875
I was just talking with the
man who was sitting next to me.

00:19:56.875 --> 00:19:59.184
He was very friendly, a very nice man

00:19:59.184 --> 00:20:02.689
and he kind of explained
about all of the food to me,

00:20:02.689 --> 00:20:06.112
which I didn't know, I don't
know much about Portuguese food

00:20:06.112 --> 00:20:08.363
so it was awesome to talk with him.

00:20:08.363 --> 00:20:11.481
What's very interesting
about the codfish dish,

00:20:11.481 --> 00:20:12.680
or about codfish in general,

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.847
the salty codfish that's very
popular in Portugal is that

00:20:17.854 --> 00:20:21.251
Portugal is blessed to have an amazing

00:20:21.251 --> 00:20:25.000
seafood abundance in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.841
They have so many seafoods available,

00:20:26.841 --> 00:20:29.346
and there are so many
delicious seafoods available.

00:20:29.346 --> 00:20:32.573
However, the codfish is not from Portugal.

00:20:32.573 --> 00:20:34.717
It's not from the seas of Portugal.

00:20:34.717 --> 00:20:39.351
It's from around the north
Atlantic near around Norway,

00:20:39.351 --> 00:20:43.862
and so even though it's
one of the local favorites,

00:20:43.862 --> 00:20:45.418
it's not actually from Portugal,

00:20:45.418 --> 00:20:48.254
and so that's just a demonstration of

00:20:48.254 --> 00:20:51.352
Portugal and its history and its culture,

00:20:51.352 --> 00:20:54.646
and its influence in trade and

00:20:54.646 --> 00:20:56.979
yeah, it's very interesting.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.963
Mmm.

00:21:00.963 --> 00:21:02.115
Finished with that meal,

00:21:02.115 --> 00:21:04.389
some classic Portuguese food.

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:08.592
That was delicious, but
it's extremely hearty food,

00:21:08.592 --> 00:21:11.918
extremely filling, and these
are some huge portions.

00:21:11.918 --> 00:21:14.147
We're now walking over to the metro,

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.433
and we are gonna take the metro.

00:21:15.433 --> 00:21:17.704
Our next place that we're visiting today

00:21:17.704 --> 00:21:21.819
is the Lisbon Oceanarium,
which is an aquarium.

00:21:21.819 --> 00:21:25.408
It's world-renowned, and I wanted to

00:21:25.408 --> 00:21:27.386
go to the aquarium to complete the top 10

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:29.287
things to do in Lisbon,

00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:31.645
and that is the final number 10,

00:21:31.645 --> 00:21:34.545
so we are on our way there now.

00:21:34.545 --> 00:21:35.759
Wow.

00:21:35.759 --> 00:21:37.729
My stomach is just bulging right now.

00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:39.096
(Ying laughs)

00:21:39.096 --> 00:21:40.283
(train rumbling)

00:21:40.283 --> 00:21:42.700
This is our train, all right.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.841
(chattering)

00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:52.642
We just got off the metro at Cabo Ruivo,

00:21:52.642 --> 00:21:54.868
and this is the closest metro station

00:21:54.868 --> 00:21:58.669
to the Lisbon Aquarium, Lisbon Oceanarium.

00:21:58.669 --> 00:22:01.416
I think it's about a
15-minute walk from here,

00:22:01.416 --> 00:22:02.629
but I need that walk.

00:22:02.629 --> 00:22:05.462
(inspiring music)

00:22:21.964 --> 00:22:25.879
Immediately it smells like
a fish market in here.

00:22:25.879 --> 00:22:27.883
Oh, that's because the first exhibition is

00:22:27.883 --> 00:22:31.056
like an outdoor exhibition of,

00:22:31.056 --> 00:22:33.139
of penguins or something.

00:22:36.942 --> 00:22:40.022
They're not penguins,
but they are puffins.

00:22:40.022 --> 00:22:42.439
(chattering)

00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:46.574
(gentle music)

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.280
The sunfish.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.113
Oh.

00:22:56.872 --> 00:22:59.789
Whoa, here comes the giant sunfish.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.455
It looks kind of like a turtle,

00:23:09.455 --> 00:23:11.372
but turned on its side.

00:23:20.643 --> 00:23:24.077
We are in the tropical
rain forest section now.

00:23:24.077 --> 00:23:25.827
Oh, back to Thailand.

00:23:27.351 --> 00:23:30.460
And I think they also have an
Indian Ocean section below.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.293
(inspiring music)

00:23:34.743 --> 00:23:37.262
I honestly was not
gonna mention food again

00:23:37.262 --> 00:23:38.977
in this aquarium,

00:23:38.977 --> 00:23:43.060
but I just walked into,
you gotta check this out,

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.773
there's a whole exhibition
and a whole poster

00:23:45.773 --> 00:23:49.630
dedicated to bacalhau, which is codfish,

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.621
and that's what I just ate for lunch.

00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:53.453
Finished walking around the aquarium.

00:23:53.453 --> 00:23:56.768
That's an amazing place with
so many different sea creatures

00:23:56.768 --> 00:24:00.506
all in one aquarium, and then
in different exhibitions.

00:24:00.506 --> 00:24:02.365
It's a great place especially for kids

00:24:02.365 --> 00:24:04.528
when you visit Lisbon, but also

00:24:04.528 --> 00:24:08.932
if you love marine
life, nature or animals.

00:24:08.932 --> 00:24:10.958
It's a great place to visit
when you come to Lisbon.

00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:13.791
(inspiring music)

00:24:23.136 --> 00:24:25.005
We took the metro back to Avenida,

00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:28.313
and this is one of the most
beautiful streets in Lisbon.

00:24:28.313 --> 00:24:32.367
The trees, and I love how the sidewalks

00:24:32.367 --> 00:24:34.732
are huge and wide and
they have a lot of cafes

00:24:34.732 --> 00:24:36.483
along this street as well, so

00:24:36.483 --> 00:24:39.412
we are actually right
outside of our hotel,

00:24:39.412 --> 00:24:41.568
and there are a number of different cafes,

00:24:41.568 --> 00:24:44.405
local, neighborhood
cafes along the street,

00:24:44.405 --> 00:24:45.833
underneath the trees.

00:24:45.833 --> 00:24:49.181
I'm just soaking up these
last few hours in Lisbon,

00:24:49.181 --> 00:24:51.848
and I also really needed coffee.

00:24:54.277 --> 00:24:55.110
Ahh.

00:24:56.163 --> 00:24:58.259
This is fantastic.

00:24:58.259 --> 00:25:00.483
Sitting here under the
trees with the breeze.

00:25:00.483 --> 00:25:03.456
Good cup of coffee, and great atmosphere.

00:25:03.456 --> 00:25:05.350
There is a restaurant
right around the corner

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.720
that we're heading to now,

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.881
and it's gonna be our
final meal in Lisbon.

00:25:09.881 --> 00:25:12.714
(inspiring music)

00:25:17.462 --> 00:25:19.289
I'm looking at the menu out here,

00:25:19.289 --> 00:25:23.055
and it is quite an
expensive restaurant, but

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:26.032
they are known to have
the best jamon here,

00:25:26.032 --> 00:25:27.542
and also really good seafood,

00:25:27.542 --> 00:25:31.677
so I think we're gonna go
for it for our last meal.

00:25:31.677 --> 00:25:34.370
Ying and I went to the
aquarium this afternoon,

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.912
but look at this aquarium.

00:25:36.912 --> 00:25:38.776
This might be the most impressive aquarium

00:25:38.776 --> 00:25:40.752
in all of Lisbon.

00:25:40.752 --> 00:25:42.736
- Can you see?

00:25:42.736 --> 00:25:43.569
- Yeah.

00:25:44.439 --> 00:25:46.899
Look at the size of these lobsters,

00:25:46.899 --> 00:25:49.346
and the clearness of this tank.

00:25:49.346 --> 00:25:52.474
These must be like, three
or four kilo lobsters.

00:25:52.474 --> 00:25:53.891
Look at this one.

00:25:56.748 --> 00:25:58.627
Cristiano Ronaldo.

00:25:58.627 --> 00:26:01.692
This restaurant is called
Solar dos Presuntos,

00:26:01.692 --> 00:26:03.687
and it's a really big restaurant.

00:26:03.687 --> 00:26:05.618
It's a legendary restaurant,

00:26:05.618 --> 00:26:08.871
especially for its high-end seafood,

00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:10.870
but actually along with the seafood

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.848
they are really famous, and what I was

00:26:12.848 --> 00:26:16.845
really interested to come
in here to eat is the ham.

00:26:16.845 --> 00:26:18.432
When you see the
restaurant from the outside

00:26:18.432 --> 00:26:20.391
you can see the tank, seafood

00:26:20.391 --> 00:26:22.870
and all of the fresh
seafood in the cabinet,

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.762
and then if you look
to the right-hand side,

00:26:24.762 --> 00:26:27.334
you can actually see them slicing the ham,

00:26:27.334 --> 00:26:29.316
and this is pata negra ham.

00:26:29.316 --> 00:26:31.413
They immediately tempt you because

00:26:31.413 --> 00:26:33.793
they have the plates of ham and cheese,

00:26:33.793 --> 00:26:36.771
as well as small little
starters already on your table,

00:26:36.771 --> 00:26:39.793
and when you sit down it's
already right in front of you.

00:26:39.793 --> 00:26:41.091
You don't even need to wait,

00:26:41.091 --> 00:26:43.138
so it's right in front of me right now.

00:26:43.138 --> 00:26:46.299
This is some kind of a sausage, a chorizo,

00:26:46.299 --> 00:26:48.359
and then there's cheese on this plate,

00:26:48.359 --> 00:26:50.442
and then this is the ham.

00:26:51.503 --> 00:26:55.333
I just gotta have one piece immediately.

00:26:55.333 --> 00:26:57.382
Look at those beautiful streaks.

00:26:57.382 --> 00:27:00.965
(chattering in background)

00:27:05.527 --> 00:27:07.277
That is unbelievable.

00:27:08.637 --> 00:27:10.387
It has such a smooth,

00:27:11.246 --> 00:27:15.964
and just completely pure
and smooth texture to it.

00:27:15.964 --> 00:27:17.513
It's a little bit chewy.

00:27:17.513 --> 00:27:20.090
It's perfectly salty,

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:24.546
and it has this rich depth
of salty preservation.

00:27:24.546 --> 00:27:26.461
And what's amazing is that that flavor,

00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:28.297
it lingers in your mouth.

00:27:28.297 --> 00:27:31.797
Oh, I can still taste it after swallowing.

00:27:33.483 --> 00:27:36.242
I did not want to leave
this region of the world

00:27:36.242 --> 00:27:39.242
without having one more dose of ham.

00:27:44.108 --> 00:27:45.440
And this is fresh bread.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.023
(chattering in background)

00:27:52.932 --> 00:27:55.849
I'll take another piece of the ham,

00:27:57.655 --> 00:27:59.572
maybe with some cheese.

00:28:02.463 --> 00:28:04.880
Whoa, that's a lot of cheese.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:13.872
Mmm.

00:28:13.872 --> 00:28:15.751
The cheese is very mild,

00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:17.394
and not too salty.

00:28:17.394 --> 00:28:19.477
That complements the ham.

00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:23.642
The main dishes have just arrived,

00:28:23.642 --> 00:28:25.416
and Ying and I ordered two dishes

00:28:25.416 --> 00:28:26.793
that we're gonna share together.

00:28:26.793 --> 00:28:28.896
I got the grilled octopus,

00:28:28.896 --> 00:28:33.063
and this presentation is
also awesomely beautiful.

00:28:34.586 --> 00:28:37.491
The pieces of octopus are so big

00:28:37.491 --> 00:28:40.302
they almost look like sausages.

00:28:40.302 --> 00:28:42.486
Oh, and I can feel how tender they are,

00:28:42.486 --> 00:28:44.545
and there are two pieces
of octopus in here,

00:28:44.545 --> 00:28:46.172
there's some onions on the top.

00:28:46.172 --> 00:28:47.811
I think that's olive oil on the bottom

00:28:47.811 --> 00:28:50.280
and you can smell the
aroma of garlic just,

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.643
just fuming off of this.

00:28:52.643 --> 00:28:55.179
There's some vegetables on
the side and some potatoes,

00:28:55.179 --> 00:28:57.578
and then onions on the top,
and I love how they have

00:28:57.578 --> 00:28:59.691
poked the octopus with
a couple of toothpicks

00:28:59.691 --> 00:29:01.086
with some olives on top.

00:29:01.086 --> 00:29:04.997
I think I will go in for
this piece of octopus.

00:29:04.997 --> 00:29:08.308
Oh, the fork literally
just sinks in (chuckles)

00:29:08.308 --> 00:29:11.585
without even, like effortlessly.

00:29:11.585 --> 00:29:14.796
I'll slice off a piece, oh wow.

00:29:14.796 --> 00:29:16.903
Okay guys, I haven't even taken a bite

00:29:16.903 --> 00:29:19.633
but I can already predict
how tender this is gonna be,

00:29:19.633 --> 00:29:23.777
and I'm gonna scoop up
some of that garlic.

00:29:23.777 --> 00:29:26.194
Okay, now let me switch over.

00:29:36.709 --> 00:29:38.209
That is so tender.

00:29:39.556 --> 00:29:42.160
It's almost like cheese.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.177
I don't know if I've ever
had more tender octopus

00:29:44.177 --> 00:29:45.470
in my entire life.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.976
And I decided to order a
glass of house white wine

00:29:47.976 --> 00:29:49.309
to go with this.

00:29:53.393 --> 00:29:54.226
Mmm.

00:29:55.512 --> 00:29:57.429
Wow, very, very smooth.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.433
Mmm, that combination.

00:30:01.844 --> 00:30:03.030
That's insane.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:06.613
I gotta take one more
bite of this octopus.

00:30:08.183 --> 00:30:10.405
You literally could slice
this piece of octopus

00:30:10.405 --> 00:30:11.405
with a fork.

00:30:12.321 --> 00:30:14.439
I'm just using the knife
because it's handy but

00:30:14.439 --> 00:30:15.994
you wouldn't need it at all.

00:30:15.994 --> 00:30:17.162
Now let me try to get some of this spinach

00:30:17.162 --> 00:30:18.579
on top this time.

00:30:20.935 --> 00:30:25.450
That is the softest octopus
I've ever had in my life.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:27.390
It's a little bit on the salty side,

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:30.089
but that tenderness and that garlicy-ness

00:30:30.089 --> 00:30:32.057
is what will blow you away.

00:30:32.057 --> 00:30:34.248
We also got the grilled sea bream.

00:30:34.248 --> 00:30:37.394
Let's take a look at its face.

00:30:37.394 --> 00:30:39.964
This is what he looks like,

00:30:39.964 --> 00:30:42.033
but it came with

00:30:42.033 --> 00:30:44.293
a slice of lemon and a slice of orange,

00:30:44.293 --> 00:30:46.359
as well as some creamed spinach,

00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:48.095
and some potatoes on the side.

00:30:48.095 --> 00:30:50.224
And you can actually
see the freshness of it

00:30:50.224 --> 00:30:53.706
and how glistening with
all those fats it is.

00:30:53.706 --> 00:30:57.873
Just let me take a little
bite before I do anything.

00:31:01.097 --> 00:31:02.570
Mmm.

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.070
Oh, a little bone.

00:31:09.497 --> 00:31:12.413
That is fantastic as well.

00:31:12.413 --> 00:31:16.580
Not fishy, a little bit dry
texture of a fish, and then

00:31:18.573 --> 00:31:21.990
you can really taste that grilled flavor.

00:31:24.147 --> 00:31:27.564
And follow that with some creamy spinach.

00:31:30.277 --> 00:31:31.859
Wow.

00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:34.739
That is really, it has a really like,

00:31:34.739 --> 00:31:36.927
sticky mashed potato texture to it.

00:31:36.927 --> 00:31:39.258
Ying and I just finished with that meal.

00:31:39.258 --> 00:31:42.702
That was a little bit more
high end than I had expected,

00:31:42.702 --> 00:31:45.824
but it was really good,
great quality food,

00:31:45.824 --> 00:31:48.769
and I'm standing here just admiring the,

00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:51.973
the ham in the window
as well as the seafood.

00:31:51.973 --> 00:31:53.759
We've come to the end
of our trip to Lisbon.

00:31:53.759 --> 00:31:56.405
Tomorrow we fly out, so

00:31:56.405 --> 00:31:58.814
our hotel is literally
right around the corner

00:31:58.814 --> 00:32:01.262
and that's a good thing, because I am like

00:32:01.262 --> 00:32:04.878
half in a slumber already
from all of the food today.

00:32:04.878 --> 00:32:07.078
So I'm gonna end the
vlog for today right now.

00:32:07.078 --> 00:32:09.059
Thank you all very much for watching.

00:32:09.059 --> 00:32:10.716

00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:19.443
(beeping)

00:32:19.443 --> 00:32:21.289
So this is a,

00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:22.622
a good place to,

00:32:25.315 --> 00:32:27.244
oh, a couple burps there too,

00:32:27.244 --> 00:32:28.346
a codfish burp.
- Yucky.

00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:30.513
- That was a codfish burp.
