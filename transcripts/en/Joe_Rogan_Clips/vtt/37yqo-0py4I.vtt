Still looks great.
He told me he,

17
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.160

He's um,
a lot of cardio eats really well.

18
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.790
Matter of fact,
uh,
he,
he's got this trail we wants me to,

19
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.290
he challenged me to try out hiking up a hill and I'm not ready for it too,

20
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.640
but Dr Dre is really listening.
I'm gonna make it up there.
Fucking trail.

21
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.330
I might have to roll down,
but I'm going to let you know
he's in great shape,

22
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:38.190
but he's a great human being.
He's a very good human being.

23
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.910
That's awesome to hear.
I love hearing.
