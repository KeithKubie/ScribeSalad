00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.200
My name is Neil Shubin.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.820
I'm from the University of
Chicago where I'm a professor

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.620
in the faculty of the anatomy
department there.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.820
I also hold an appointment at
the Field Museum of Natural

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.310
History, also in Chicago.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.560
So you have to understand
the setting.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.130
The setting of the day we found
it was, this was our

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.670
last expedition to the
Canadian Arctic.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.030
We were running out of
money, and I'm not

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.080
saying this for drama.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.710
It's really expensive
to work there.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.580
We had worked there for a number
of years already with

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.870
very little success.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.320
We had not much to show
for ourselves.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.840
We decided to sort of spend
the lot and have one last

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.150
season working at that layer.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.560
So Steve's cracking rocks.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.165
Steve is up about seven feet
from me and he says, hey Neil,

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:48.650
what's this?

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.010
And I remember looking at the
thing and saying, OK, we have

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.970
a flat-headed fish.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.730
I looked at Ted and Farish who
were the co-leaders of the

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.590
expedition.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.610
We were like, oh, my god.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610
I mean, there were two feelings,
one was just

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.910
incredible joy, but the other
was incredible relief.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.379
This was our last
chance at this.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.620
And as soon as I saw what this
object was, I knew we had

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.917
found what we had spent six
years and I'd spent 20 years

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:15.167
before looking for.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.770
Well, since I was a graduate
student, I was interested in

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.260
one of the great evolutionary
events in earth history, which

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.505
is the transition from life
in water to life on land.

00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:32.210
And you think about that.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.450
It's a remarkable transition,
because so much in the animals

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.700
have to change.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.510
So I got interested early on in
this transition and my goal

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.880
was to find new evidence to tell
us about how it happened.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.690
So what I did starting in the
early '90s was to try to find

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.100
rocks in the world that had the
right properties to hold

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.320
the fossils that would tell us
about this transition, from a

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.070
fish that has like a conical
head and fins to a land-living

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.800
animal of the time, in the
Devonian, which has a flat

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.890
head with limbs.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.020
So we looked around the world
and it eventually became clear

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.199
through a moment of serendipity
that one of the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.290
best places and most unexplored
places to look for

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.510
such a fossil was in the
Canadian Arctic.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.840
We discovered it from a
geological textbook, not the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.565
scientific literature.

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:21.670
It was completely accidental.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.700
But it turns out these were the
perfect rocks of the right

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.470
age and exposed to the surface
to produce such an

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.720
intermediate.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.250
And what it looks like is you
have a flat head with eyes on

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.210
top, and then you essentially
have the body of what looks

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.960
like a fish, a stubby fish,
because it has scales and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.860
stubby fins.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.630
Now, what's great about
Tiktaalik it's a great melange

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.920
of characteristics of fish
and land-living creature.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.800
The shape of the head, the
proportions of the head, the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.680
bones, and so forth are very
much like a land-living animal

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.410
and then other parts
are fish-like.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.210
What's remarkable about the fin
is when you take out the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.790
fin webbing, it has bones that
correspond to the upper arm, a

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.580
humerus, forearm, a radius ulna,
and even portions of the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.690
risk, the so-called proximal
carpel, so a real remarkable

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.610
transitional creature.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.140
It had both lungs and gills.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.410
And what's exceptional about
this is just how ordinary it

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.600
is in the sense that it's
exactly the intermediate that

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.350
you would likely predict.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.260
So what this does, is it tells
us a lot about the shift from

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.150
water to land along with the
other creatures that's up

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.450
there, hundreds of other fossils
that colleagues around

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.880
the world have found.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.920
It tells us a lot
about how this

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.730
great transition happened.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.410
When Tiktaalik was announced in
the pages of Nature, we had

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.890
two articles which was nice
because it gives us a chance

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.500
to do a lot of basic description
of the creature.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.950
Well, it hit a lot of news
headlines in April of 2006

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.100
when it came out.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.930
So much so I was dropping my
son of at school the day it

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.180
was announced, and his teacher
said, hey, bring in the fish.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.860
So I brought the cast
of fossil, which we

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.740
made at that point.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.365
I remember showing if the kids,
and I said, hey, guys,

00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:56.930
what do you think it is?

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.190
One kid said, oh, it looks
like a crocodile.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.450
And you can see why he said it's
like a crocodile because

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.290
it has flat eyes on top
and you can even see

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.460
teeth on the side.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.590
Another kid corrected him and
said, no, no, it's a fish.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.760
It's got scales, and
it has fins.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.770
And I said, hey, you're both
right, because they got the

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.520
concept right immediately.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.645
And so you know, if only adults
in Louisiana would get

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:20.350
what kids got really quickly
in preschool.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.740
What inspires me is this
transition from life in water

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.420
to life on land is not just
some esoteric twig on the

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.040
evolutionary tree.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.640
It's very important for us.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.490
It's very important because this
event is part of our own

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.120
evolutionary history when our
common ancestor was a fish.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.580
So that this proto wrist we
see for the first time in

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.110
Tiktaalik and its evolution
cousins, it's something that

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.660
became our own wrists.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.337
This neck that we see for the
first time in Tiktaalik and

00:04:49.337 --> 00:04:51.260
its evolutionary cousins is
something that was to become

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.100
our own necks.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.230
Inside our organs, inside our
genes, inside our cells carry

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.710
artefacts of the history of
life, carry events like this

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.900
of which is one of countless
events in the last three

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.150
billion years.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.140
The basis for the name, we had
a naming project with the

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.380
Inuit elders.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.760
And we have all the
pieces together.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.875
It takes the right geological
conditions.

00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:35.280
It takes the right geological
conditions to find it, and

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.030
then it takes almost the right
geological conditions--
