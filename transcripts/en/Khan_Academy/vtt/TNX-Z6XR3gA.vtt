00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.550
Welcome back.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.670
In the last couple of videos,
actually the very first video

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.080
on centripetal acceleration, I
told you that the necessary

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.580
centripetal acceleration, and
we're just talking about the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.630
magnitude, and actually the c
tells you the direction, it's

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.430
centripetal so its inward
acceleration, it equals the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.610
velocity squared over
the radius.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.170
I told you that the real
rigorous proof has to be done

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.620
with calculus.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.130
But I looked on Wikipedia and
there's actually a pretty neat

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.230
proof, although when you read
Wikipedia, it's not so obvious

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.150
on what they're saying.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.810
So I thought I would do a video
on it, because this is

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.990
cool and you don't need calculus
to understand it.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.430
So let's just do something.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.285
Let's just plot the distance
vector, the velocity vectors

00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:41.890
and the acceleration vectors
as something

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.920
goes around a circle.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.770
Let me draw two circles.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.340
So let's say this is
my first circle.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.190
Let me draw another circle,
another color just for fun.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.170
OK.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.420
This is my other circle.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.770
This is the center
of the circle.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.410
And this is the center
of the circle.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.340
And so what's the position
vector in any point in time?

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.450
Well, the position vector,
you could just

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.190
draw it as a radius.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.940
So the position vector at
any given time looks

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.710
something like this.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.600
So let's say initially this
is the position vector.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.200
That's the initial
position vector.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.680
Its magnitude is the radius
of the circle.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.360
And this direction is right
here in the positive

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.480
x-direction.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.380
And at that point, what is
the velocity vector?

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.870
Well, the velocity-- let's
assume we're going

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.880
counterclockwise.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.740
I don't know why
I assumed that.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.720
It could go the other way.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.346
Let's say that this is the
velocity vector at that point.

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:56.830
The velocity vector is going to
look something like that.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.580
That is the velocity vector.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.440
That's v.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.510
It's going tangent
to the circle.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.940
Let's plot the velocity vector
as a function of

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.919
time on this circle.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.870
So if that's the velocity vector
of that time, I can

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.100
draw the velocity vector here.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.880
This the the same vector.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.570
Remember, I'm just saying, at
a particular time, what does

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.710
the distance vector look like
and what does the velocity

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.400
vector look like?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.660
So at that time, the velocity
vector looks like this.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.570
I'm trying to make it the
same size to show you

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.190
it's the same vector.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.650
And I'm doing it in the same
color to show you it's the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.560
same vector.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.300
This is the exact same vector.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.360
This is the actual circle.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.500
Like if you were to draw it,
this is the path of the dot or

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.990
whatever is moving around
the circle.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.510
And this, you can just view it
as I'm plotting the velocity

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.790
over time, the velocity
vector over time.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.470
So let's say a few seconds
later, or a few moments later,

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.460
what does the radius
vector look like?

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.030
Well, then the radius vector
looks like this.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:07.620
I'm trying to write as
neatly as possible.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.150
And what does the velocity
vector look like?

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.700
Go back to the purple.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.850
The velocity vector once again
is tangent to the circle.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.160
And it'll look something
like that.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.160
It's going to have the
same magnitude,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.410
just different direction.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.870
Actually, let me do it in a
different color, just to show

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.590
you what I'm doing.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.250
So let me do it in brown.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.020
So the velocity vector
is going to look

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.190
something like this.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.040
It's brown, supposed
to be a brown.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.770
That's the velocity vector.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.260
So after a few seconds, or a
few moments, where is the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.270
velocity vector here?

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.300
Well, it's going to
look like this.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.850
Remember, this vector
I'm just plotting

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.840
here after a few seconds.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.320
Let me use that line tool.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.630
So it's the same magnitude and
now the velocity is just at a

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.290
different angle.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.615
It should be the exact same
angle as what I just drew in

00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:02.865
the other circle.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.660
So that's this velocity
vector.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.460
So when we start here, the
velocity is going to change at

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.370
the circle.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.019
After a few moments, the
object's rotating around the

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.390
circle, so now the velocity
is the same magnitude.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.380
It's just switched directions.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.250
And so what's happening here?

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.370
When we plot the velocity vector
over time, it has the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.750
same magnitude, so it'll draw
out a circle, but its

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.680
direction changes.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.110
Just as in this case, what takes
us from this point to

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.910
this point?

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.960
This was the velocity vector
and the velocity vector's

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.690
always changing.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.300
But, in general, this is
the change in position.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.680
And what causes the change
in position?

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.940
Well, the velocity, or at least
the speed, because the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.720
vector's always changing.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.390
So in this case, what's
changing the velocity?

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.270
Well, just like velocity changes
radius, acceleration

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.670
changes velocity.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.910
Let me draw an acceleration
vector, and acceleration is

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.690
going to be in this direction.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.930
Because if the velocity is
changing from here to here,

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.410
the acceleration is going along
the direction of the

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.950
change in velocity.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.380
So the acceleration
vector might look

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.010
something like that.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.200
It's going to be tangent
to this velocity path.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.940
And that's interesting, too,
because if this is the

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.000
acceleration vector when the
velocity is here, so when the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.100
velocity is here, the
acceleration vector's going

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.010
directly to the left, so that
means that acceleration

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.890
vector's going directly to left,
and so this is also the

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.120
acceleration vector, which
coincides with what we learned

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.610
about centripetal
acceleration.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.610
The acceleration has to
be going inwards.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.300
And we see that when
we actually plot

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.720
the velocity vector.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.430
And if we plot acceleration
vector here, once again it's

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.700
going to be going tangent
to this plot of

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.920
the velocity vector.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.880
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.602
I've already used that color.

00:05:54.602 --> 00:05:56.280
I'll do it in yellow.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.870
So then the acceleration
vector is going to look

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.460
something like this.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.530
Remember, acceleration
is nothing

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.930
but change in velocity.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.915
So at this point, when this is
the velocity vector, the

00:06:03.915 --> 00:06:06.130
acceleration vector
will just be this.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.540
Once again, it's just the
opposite direction of the

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.500
position vector.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.720
So why am I doing all this?

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.240
Well, I'm doing all of
this to set up the

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.700
analogy to show you.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.210
As this object completes one
entire path, what's happening

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.960
on this circle?

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.890
Well, this circle, the velocity
is completing one

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.480
entire path, right?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.220
However long it takes to go
around this circle is the same

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.840
amount of time it takes to go
from this velocity back to

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.630
this velocity.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.950
The magnitude is the same the
whole time, but the direction

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.990
is changing.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.010
So if this takes 10 seconds to
go around the circle in real

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.910
position, then it takes 10
seconds for the acceleration

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.210
to change the direction of this
velocity enough that it

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.910
goes back to the original
velocity direction.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.950
So why am I doing all of that?

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:01.110
Well, how long does it take
for the object to do one

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.660
rotation around this path?

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.650
Well, it's just the distance
divided by the velocity.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.740
So the time to do one revolution
around this path is

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.190
the distance-- well,
that's just the

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.420
circumference of the circle.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:21.920
Well, that's 2 pi r divided
by your speed, which is v.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.190
And how much time does it take
to go around this path?

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:31.080
Well, we know it's going be the
same time, and now we're

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.400
going to say the time's
going to be the change

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.770
in velocity, right?

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.435
In this circle, this is the
change in distance, but it's

00:07:37.435 --> 00:07:40.170
the change in velocity.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.530
So here we had this much
change in velocity.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.450
I know this might be a
little non-intuitive.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.330
Then we have a little bit more
change in velocity, a little

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.260
bit more change in velocity,
a little bit

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.810
more change in velocity.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.790
So the total change in velocity
is just going to be

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.740
the circumference
of this circle.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.720
And what's the circumference
of this circle?

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.870
The radius of the circle is the
magnitude of the velocity.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.140
So it's 2 pi times the velocity
of the circle.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.570
And so, what is the amount
of time it takes a do one

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.170
revolution?

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.280
Well, it's the total
change in velocity.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.010
And that's 2 pi times the
magnitude of the velocity

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.110
divided by acceleration.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.490
And if this doesn't make
complete sense, just remember,

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.980
acceleration is change in
velocity over change in time.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.520
I'm glossing over it a little
bit, because you might say,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.299
oh, well, the net change
in velocity is zero.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:38.059
But we're actually more
concerned about what's the

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.100
total change in the velocity?

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.559
So it changes a lot, then it
goes back to its original, so

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.420
that the net is still zero.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.200
But this should hopefully give
you a little intuition.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.250
So think about what I said.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.760
But the bottom line is we know
that this expression and this

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.080
expression have to be equal,
because in the same amount of

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.050
time it takes the object to do
one complete revolution on

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.730
this circle, its velocity,
direction, has also done one

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.560
complete revolution.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.070
So we can set these two
equal to each other.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:16.440
So we could say 2 pi r over v
is equal to 2 pi v over a.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.750
Let me switch colors.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.490
We can cross the 2 pi
out on both sides.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.530
And then we could multiply
both sides times v.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.970
You get r is equal to
v squared over a.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.440
Multiply both sides times a,
I'm doing this little bit

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.120
circuitously, and you get ar
is equal to v squared.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.940
Divide both sides by r, and
you get a is equal to v

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.850
squared over r.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.010
So hopefully, that gives you a
little bit of intuition about

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.650
why this works.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.240
And I got this from Wikipedia,
so I want to

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.210
give them proper credit.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.550
And hopefully, my explanation
helps clarify what the people

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.940
on Wikipedia are talking
about a little bit.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.880
Anyway, I'll also do the
calculus proof, because that's

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.720
more just straight up math.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.070
And I'll see you in
the next video.
