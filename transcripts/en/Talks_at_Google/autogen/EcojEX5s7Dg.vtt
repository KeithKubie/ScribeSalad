00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.710
SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.530
Today's our great honor to
have Her Eminence Dagyum Chenmo

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.390
Kusho, also known as Dagmola,
visiting Google and giving us

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.810
a talk on women's social role.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.480
Dagmola was born
in eastern Tibet.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.810
She fled to India in
1959 with her family

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.460
and moved to the United
States a year later,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.115
where she helped
her husband found

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:34.410
the Sakya Monastery of
Tibet Buddhism in Seattle

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.360
in the 1980s.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.250
In addition to taking
a full-time job

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.640
and raising five sons, she
took all necessary trainings

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.310
to become a qualified
spiritual teacher.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.690
She is also actively engaged in
educating younger generations

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.260
on spiritual development
and has founded a few Dharma

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.010
centers in North America.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.020
As featured in the
book "Dakini Power,"

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.440
Dagmola is considered one
of the most influential

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.269
female Buddhist
masters in the world.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.050
So it's a great honor for us to
have Dagmola here and give us

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.560
a talk.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.950
DAGMOLA SAKYA: In
the Tibetan language,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.990
it means auspicious greetings.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.850
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.220
Greetings from Seattle.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.740
Well, I would like to start by
thanking all of the organizers

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.070
and especially my friend
Jessica [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.810
for inviting me here, come
here to talk about social role

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.750
of the Tibetan woman.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.560
I must say that I am
honored and humbled

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.990
to be at the presence of such
brilliant and innovative young

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.750
minds.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.300
I am Tibetan old woman
practitioner, was born in East

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.960
Tibet, and a strong
background in Buddhism.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.020
And later I married Sakya
Dagchen Rinpoche in Sakya.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.160
And as many of you
know, we have in Tibet,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.190
there's four centers
for Tibetan Buddhism,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.050
and Sakya is one of them, which
we call Nyingmapa, Kagyupa,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.660
Sakyapa, and Gelugpa.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.330
And Sakya Dagchen
Rinpoche's father

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.600
was the 40th throne holder
in the Sakya in Tibet.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.540
So I married, lived in the
palace with many servants

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.690
around.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.820
And then in 1959, we were
forced to out-- to exile

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.890
from Tibet, like
all other Tibetans.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.320
So then we lived in India
a short period, but then

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.540
the University of Washington
brought us to research--

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.870
teach and research to my
husband, Dagchen [INAUDIBLE],,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.520
as well as my uncle for
the three years' grant.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.240
So since we cannot go back
to Tibet because the--

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.980
still the Tibetans
are under the Chinese,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:38.780
so we emigrate to a state
in the United States.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.030
So then I was working like
any of you, like working hard,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.400
raising, like he mentioned,
[INAUDIBLE] mentioned,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.340
five children to put
in school, so forth.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.340
So I try to keep
up with the growing

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.310
change in the modern world
and all its modern gadgets

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.160
and many cities.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.860
I have seen much,
experienced much,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.110
in over 80 years
that I have lived.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.000
Today I speak to you
through my experience

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.860
as a woman and especially as
a wife, mother, grandmother,

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.860
and great-grandmother and a
Tibetan woman and a Tibetan

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.340
Buddhist practitioner.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.290
So very little was knowing to
the worlds of Tibetan women,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.960
and then we lost to
our country in 1959.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.090
Since then, large
number of us lived--

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.590
have lived in exile,
various countries.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.490
We have learned to
adapt to the culture

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.930
and language of whatever country
we found ourselves living in.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.240
However, no matter where
we are and no matter

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.140
what challenge life
threw at us, we

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.940
are strong as people and gender.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.650
Tibetan culture is filled
with strong feminine roles

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.880
and model.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:39.330
So especially like Tibetans
always decided major things

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.220
and from mother.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.950
As we are deeply
spiritual people,

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.960
very often our role models
are the female deities.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.370
We have Arya Tara,
the mother goddess who

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.410
regarded us all her children
and guiding and protecting

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.990
us and taking care
of, which Tibetan,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.390
we call Dolma, which is savior.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.970
She made a vow to save
all sentient beings

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:24.930
from their suffering and be
reborn in female form in life--

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.390
all the lifetime.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.570
We have Ushnishavijaya,
who is also goddess

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.010
who give us a long life.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.420
One of the most powerful
protective deity

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.270
is the female deity which
we call Palden Lhamo, who

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:53.610
is also protected as wrathful
form and created and fear all.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:00.270
Names like Machig Lapdron,
a famous female protector

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.870
of the 11th century,
who initiated

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.460
several practices of the
spiritual development

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:19.320
and [INAUDIBLE],, who help us
to spread Buddhism in Tibet,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.840
helped us the great reverence.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.920
Women were not very active
in the political field

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.300
before we lost our country.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.120
There have been
many Tibetan women

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.490
who were involved
in the politics

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:47.510
of the regional governance,
but such a prominent

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.160
was not so invisible in
the central administrator.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:02.710
But for example, what I recall--

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:11.070
for example, I recall if the
leaders, kings, the husband

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.460
died, women take over.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:21.110
For example, like Queen of
Dege, a region in East Tibet,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:28.020
ruled a region until her
young son attended majority.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.500
Queen [INAUDIBLE],, who
was very popular leader

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.460
and did much that promoted
literacy and learning

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.470
during her regent.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.880
There was other
Tibetan women who

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:48.120
played prominent roles
in tribes, especially

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.330
in East Tibet.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:58.050
Tibetan women have always
had strong roles of family.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:03.570
All the family, if they have
some big decisions, and always

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.150
made by mother.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:12.000
Many household are
ruled by matriarchs.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.425
An old Tibetan woman were--

00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:17.570
let's see.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.240
Matriarchs.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.620
OK.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.030
And then old Tibetan women are
mothers and business owners,

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.550
nomads, and farmers.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:32.970
In fact, it was not uncommon
for the Tibetan woman

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:39.870
to be married with two husband
or three husbands at same time,

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:45.840
and most are their brothers,
living in harmonious

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.410
in the same household.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:54.780
Of course, it was for
the particular purpose

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.310
of keeping the land undivided.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:05.520
In such a household, women were
always one who rules the roost.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:18.720
A large number of Tibetan
women, 4% become nuns.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.040
And also Buddhist nuns.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.880
The nunneries were
places of learning,

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:34.410
and women could pursue an
education, which was not really

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.500
available for the young girls.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:44.460
In fact, both men
and women turned

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.290
to monasteries and
nunneries for education,

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.840
as these instructions were the
sole providers of education

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.860
in the old days.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:04.140
Secular education was not
widespread at the same time,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.310
like my time.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.960
This is kind of a silly problem.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.970
Silly-- I tell you
something I remember.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.870
When my aunt-- my aunt was in
a nunnery, lived in nunnery.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.360
I visited the
nunnery quite often.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.030
I enjoyed very
much with the nuns.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:31.010
They have beautiful voice with
the chanting and the singing.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.154
And I try to make the--

00:11:35.154 --> 00:11:40.220
like wear the nun clothes and
cover my hair with a towel.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:46.130
And I enjoyed very much,
I'd go visit in the nunnery.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.210
But I never wanted to be a nun.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.630
The reason why, as you
know, in the Tibetan,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:58.250
no matter what part of
Tibet, east, west, central,

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.640
all over, Tibetan
girls or women,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:07.010
they wear all kind of jewelries
covered with their hair

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.230
and the headdresses.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.580
So I always see they are
so beautiful, you know.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.520
Because Tibet, in my
time, at that time,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.820
we don't have banking
system, and the jewels

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.190
was the asset in the family.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:27.880
And the man may have
horses or rifles or swords.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.390
That's what we have.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.610
So it's just like
silly, I said, you know,

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:37.060
I never wanted to be nun
because I cannot wear jewelries.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.410
That was-- and today, when
I think back, it was silly.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:47.120
So losing our country
and living in exile,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.900
Tibetan women have played
a very crucial role

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:57.300
in preserving our culture and
tradition in the foreign lands,

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:57.925
like myself.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.910
Now in exile, Tibetan
women are well

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.780
represented in the
political fields and members

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:14.880
of parliament, ministers,
and hold positions

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:21.525
of power of decisionmaking
in the various administrative

00:13:21.525 --> 00:13:22.025
offices.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.750
Today, Tibetan women are
doctors, nurses, teachers,

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:34.800
lawyers, business owners,
authors, and other occupations.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.350
Like I was talking to
the girls in the Google.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.520
I'm sure you have
thousands, maybe 10,000.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.070
There two Tibetan
women are working here.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:49.510
So that was-- I was
really happy to know that.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:56.100
So this is what Tibetan
women today can do.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.810
So Tibetan people are generally
known as peaceful people

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:06.360
due to our spiritual practice
of generating loving kindness

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.770
and compassion for all beings.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.550
We strive to feel great
compassion for others

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:19.140
as it does for ourselves.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:24.150
In order to help to motivate
us in this practice,

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.200
we are taught at the
early age regarding

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.240
all the sentient beings
as the one's own mother.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.130
A mother is regarded
as a compassionate one

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:45.690
who for nine months carries
the child within her womb

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:51.990
and who continue
to love and nurture

00:14:51.990 --> 00:15:00.650
her children well into
becoming adult. So this is--

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.990
we have to thank them all.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:10.330
A mother is the [INAUDIBLE] of
loving kindness and compassion.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:17.220
So in our culture, the mother
is regarded with great reverence

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.400
as life force and nurturer.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.170
So we also think,
mother protects a child

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.320
until the child gets
eight, eight years old,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.820
even protects--

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.530
the mother's shadow
protects the child.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:43.160
So therefore, women are
treated with great respect

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:49.505
and are equal partner
in their homes.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.180
And the Tibetan
also now the exile--

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.480
before exile, you know,
Tibetan is like, you know,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.350
all the culture, like
we have heard of--

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.310
Tibetan women exile and lived
in many countries, especially

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.140
the United States.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.730
Many thousands.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:30.140
And first when we came, we
don't have education background

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.490
as well as a language problem.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:37.120
So many Tibetan women
worked in nannies,

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.650
housekeeping, and so forth.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:44.890
So I have heard that Tibetan
women are very much demanded

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:51.850
as nannies and caregivers for
both young and old people,

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.940
because they have compassion
and talk to them when

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.830
they are young.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.610
It is their kindness
and compassion

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:06.460
that makes them provide
the best to carry and love,

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:15.160
even for those that are not
their own blood or race.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:23.950
Today working mothers are truly
superhuman in their abilities

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:31.810
to multitask between their
work environment and their home

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.590
front.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.700
However, women are
still women and bring

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.960
warmth and a
softness in whatever

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:47.230
and whenever they are doing.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:53.820
Now in Tibet-- now in
the Tibetan families,

00:17:53.820 --> 00:18:02.170
in before, many parts
of Asia and Tibet,

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:07.620
it's always when the
family have a child,

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.675
they always like to have boy.

00:18:09.675 --> 00:18:14.500
It's like many parts
in the world before.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.550
Now, in the Tibetan family,
when the girls was born,

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:24.240
the parents expressed
great joy, and they

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:31.780
will have someone who will look
after them after they get old.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.165
So the-- you know, times change.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.310
So Tibetan women, like the
women around the world,

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:46.010
have faced a challenge
due to the gender bias.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:51.080
However, we have very
compassionate spiritual leader,

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.260
His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.340
Through his many
initiatives, His Holiness

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:03.500
has encouraged Tibetan women
to be part of governance

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:11.540
and social economic
growth in exile.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:20.540
Even recently, in
2016, last year,

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:27.020
His Holiness confirmed a
Geshema degree on 20 nuns

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:33.590
in South India, which is the
first in the history of Tibet

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.630
and the Tibetan people.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:41.390
The Geshema degree
is Geshe, a man

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.740
compatible to the doctrine
and the philosophy.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.500
And the degree is
confirmed after 21 years

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:02.760
of rigorous study of
five main Buddhist texts.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.860
This is the step forward in the
[INAUDIBLE] in Tibetan women

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:16.050
as education is the key to
changing and development.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.140
I would like to
envision to future

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:27.060
where women are equal partner
in all the field of life.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.970
In the workforce,
I would like to see

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:39.220
women be equally compensated
for her time and effort.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.040
I hope this, that they
will come to a time

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.450
when women are not afraid
to go where they want

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.010
and what they want to do.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:21:00.165
At home, a woman is the
daughter, sister, mother, wife.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:08.570
Home should be safe,
even from all trial

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:12.470
and challenge of
the outside world

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.100
if they are around in the home.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:22.250
Unfortunately, the world
is not perfect place,

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:29.810
and women will continue to
face discrimination at work,

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:37.280
abuse at home, and a disparity
due to the whole gender.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:43.670
It is true that
even today, there

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.700
are countries where
the women are treated

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.150
little better than cattle.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:55.840
However, we can still strive
to change the plight of women

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:03.330
all over if women are
united in the common cause.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.760
If they are afraid--

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.770
if they are afraid,
tell other woman.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.910
We need to speak openly.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.600
If you are abused,
tell other woman.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:26.620
If you are happy,
increase it by sharing--

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.170
sharing your happiness.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:35.230
If you are sad, lighten
it by sharing your story

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.330
with someone.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:42.070
We live in the age of
social media, which is

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:48.310
powerful tools, all of you now.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.610
So resolve yourself
to being a woman,

00:22:51.610 --> 00:23:00.400
embrace other women to form
a strong circle of support.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.800
Women can be a great pain.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.000
Like woman is the one
who brings the child.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.250
Women have to go through
all the pains, not men.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.220
But men have to realize
how to share what pain

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.420
is going through the woman.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:25.300
And come out-- but if
even it is painful,

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.620
come out shining in the end.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:35.590
We are a mother, wife,
daughter, and we are strong.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:40.330
If we should have more
female leaders in the world,

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.140
we would be more
peaceful place, and women

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:51.010
have the innate quality
of patience and compassion

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.640
and no war in the world.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.190
Like Arya Tara, we
should feel honored

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.550
and proud to be born
in a woman, and we

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:10.990
can do much as women of the
knowledge and compassion.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:14.270
Tibetan women are
always strong, and we

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:20.660
remain strong since our
exposure to the outside world.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:26.750
We are inspired by women in
the West, who stand shoulder

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:31.670
to shoulder with men
while still holding down

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.860
in the fort at home.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.870
I am inspired to African women--

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:53.110
African-American women
who made sure their voice

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:58.840
were heard in their
movement in the civil right.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:05.540
I pay homage to all the great
women who have come before us

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:13.000
and struggled with the
restraint of time and prejudice

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.950
and who have made the path
easier for us now to follow.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:25.300
So this is part of
our Tibetan women,

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.610
how went through,
we still how are.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.535
So if you have any question.

00:25:35.631 --> 00:25:37.630
SPEAKER: I thank you,
Dagmola, for your thoughts

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.580
during this inspiring talk.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.300
So I will take this chance
to ask the first question.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.960
So just imagine that
you think that women

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.390
should take a more
leadership role in the world,

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.340
in the modern world.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.130
So I wonder what kind
of Buddhist teachings

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.950
can help women to become
more confident and more

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.690
capable for taking
the leadership role.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.570
DAGMOLA SAKYA: Well,
Lord Buddha Shakyamuni

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:04.330
teaches us no gender.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:08.500
Women, men, any
age, any race, it's

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.420
equally we can be enlightened.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.760
Equally.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:19.600
But the world is a little bit
crazy and misunderstanding

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.540
and things.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.930
It is getting
better, but I still

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:28.600
think women should be
strong, and they should be--

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.430
how do you say it--

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:37.060
have own courage
and think that we

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.320
are happy to be born
with this, and we want

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.270
to help with whatever we can.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:52.200
And make yourself-- don't
try to lower down, to make

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.490
think we are all equal and the
teaching says all are equal.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:05.855
It's like that lay practitioner
or Tibetan monks, lamas, are

00:27:05.855 --> 00:27:10.360
all practitioners and
equally enlightened when they

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.190
do the right path, right route.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.800
It's most important,
is motivation.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.700
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.120
And also I'm particularly
interested in Sakya lineage,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.380
because I know that so far, all
the foreign holders of Sakya

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.200
lineage have been male
members of a Sakya family.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.830
I wonder if in the future
maybe a female member

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.110
can also be a leader.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.960
Do you think that's possible?

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.870
DAGMOLA SAKYA: Very
good, good question.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.320
Just like I mentioned earlier,
in the Tibetan Buddhism,

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.340
there is four sects in Buddhism.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:47.020
And like those, all
four sects, many

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.430
have reincarnations, which is
just like you already know,

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:55.270
it's like Dalai Lama is
like 14th reincarnated.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.770
And so is Karmapa,
17th reincarnated.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.310
And that's unlike Sakyapa.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:08.440
Sakyapa originally descended
from celestial realm, a person

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.540
from celestial realm,
and married with a human

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.680
and produced children.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.140
And that's why lineage carry
on, there is no reincarnation--

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.680
father to son.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.320
So this is-- it's different
than reincarnation.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.540
And so other lamas still
recognize reincarnation.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.070
Like we all-- we all are
somebody's reincarnation

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.000
anyway.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.730
So that, unlike the
Sakyapa lineage.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:42.400
And like [INAUDIBLE]
mentioned, yes, it's true.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:48.020
Up to my time, it is
always the male system.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.500
And I heard a lot
of Sakya history

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.810
when the lama married
and don't have a son,

00:28:55.810 --> 00:29:00.520
and then maybe have to marry
second or third wife until it

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.050
brings son.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:07.540
And so I remember myself, when
I got married with my husband,

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.360
my father-in-law gave a
blessing with name change

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.550
like also says bring son.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:19.210
So likewise that, but
today's different.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.790
But they have-- if
they have a daughter,

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.800
daughter is equally teach Sakya.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.810
Any teaching.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:30.890
But daughter, son, is not be
the Sakya current lineage.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.830
They are the current lineage,
but it's not the same.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.190
It's male.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.530
So that is different.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.260
But it's just the
Sakya is always

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.270
the lineage, father to son.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.680
When they passed
away, they will pray

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.850
to be born the same family.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:54.779
This is up to over 1,000,
maybe close to 1,000 years.

00:29:54.779 --> 00:29:55.570
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.702
I understand this is
a tradition, and--

00:29:58.702 --> 00:30:03.310
but I think there are a
lot of good female members

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.670
of the family, and they are
very good practitioners,

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.130
Probably even though they
are not the throne holder,

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.320
maybe they can also
take on leadership roles

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.280
to help grow the Dharma teaching
and also help the family,

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.840
help the community.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.360
Thank you.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:17.860
OK.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:22.120
So let's take some
questions from the audience.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.250
AUDIENCE: As a Buddhist,
my husband always

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:31.360
say, you do chanting and
reciting, mantra, sutra,

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.700
and you also make
lots of donation.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.920
And how would,
oh, the things you

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.100
did benefit me and our family?

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.960
This is my first question.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.530
DAGMOLA SAKYA: That is good.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.340
Yes.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:51.190
If we are connected, for
example, myself, for example.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.070
I have lots of
friends and students

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:59.200
who kind of relied
on me and ask me,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.900
and I will do this
sincerely to [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:09.290
to help whatever their needs
and heal their suffering.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.690
And this is the--

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:11.590
yes, you can.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.655
Like I mentioned
yesterday, there

00:31:13.655 --> 00:31:17.781
is teaching what to donate
and the giving and the taking.

00:31:17.781 --> 00:31:18.280
That's why.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:23.470
If you pray, your
husband will help, yes.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.750
Even he doesn't
believe in Buddhism,

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:29.430
there is always
some blessing there.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.050
AUDIENCE: And my second
question is, would you

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:35.590
please share your
wisdom about emptiness,

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.817
so that way I can
share with him?

00:31:38.817 --> 00:31:40.400
DAGMOLA SAKYA: That
is a big question.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:40.446
Yes, I know it is.

00:31:40.446 --> 00:31:41.196
Yes, I know it is.

00:31:41.196 --> 00:31:42.482
DAGMOLA SAKYA: Emptiness.

00:31:42.482 --> 00:31:46.270
Emptiness, we talk
a lot emptiness.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.660
But it is always
the essence there.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.390
Is everything phenomena,
it's like emptiness.

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:54.395
Never the same.

00:31:54.395 --> 00:31:55.930
It's changing.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:57.730
Changing a lot.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:03.285
But essence is there
to what you call--

00:32:03.285 --> 00:32:09.160
it would be like reborn, and
everything is never the same.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.190
It's just implemented.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:16.180
But at same time,
there is essence there.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.100
So that's the big question.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:24.040
But if you practice
Buddhism, you will learn.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:28.150
Each of us has some
wisdom leading us.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:32.170
If you really follow
that, to concentrate,

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:36.910
do some meditation, then will
show that what to do next.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.920
But to just start
talking emptiness,

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.760
emptiness means
everything [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.070
It is everything, emptiness.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:48.160
But there is essence in there.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.830
AUDIENCE: And my third question
is, as a lay practitioner,

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:58.510
especially for a woman, how
to balance their family life

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:04.270
and also practice buddhadharma?

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:09.590
DAGMOLA SAKYA: I usually
call Dharma is daily life.

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.580
Those are the lamas,
monks, and nuns.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.600
They have nunnery, monastery.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.100
They stay.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.160
They're supported, and
they do all the praying.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.000
But lay practitioners
are like husband, wife.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.380
We have to raise children,
go to school, work, so forth.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:30.140
Every day your life, just to--

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:37.060
you know, Tibetan Buddhism also
says human life is precious.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:41.980
Most precious in the life,
which means we have opportunity.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.660
We can do things.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.940
We have physically.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.920
We have everything
around, especially us

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.250
and all the teachers and
teachings and living,

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:56.300
everything, freedom.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.880
So since you get up in the
morning, you should be happy.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.620
Oh, I'm happy.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.170
I'm still alive.

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.980
I want to do something for
good myself and my family

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:09.620
and extended for my
neighbors, whole world.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.820
And this is thinking, that's
the positive thinking,

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.710
positive attitude.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:19.070
And that helps lead
through the day is happy.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:23.679
And that is part of your Dharma
practice for lay practitioner.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:29.790
But everything you do, you think
something do right and helping

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.710
others with from sincerely.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:36.900
That's why I always say,
it has to come from heart.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.260
You want to help
somebody and give--

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.230
maybe get something back.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:42.699
Don't think that.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:48.280
You have to do unconditional
work, unconditional love,

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:53.050
unconditional how you
do your own children.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.860
So this is-- will help.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:03.760
So you can never say, you
know, any lay people were--

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.930
can be enlightened if
they have that right path.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:08.747
Yes.

00:35:08.747 --> 00:35:10.205
AUDIENCE: Always
good to know this.

00:35:10.205 --> 00:35:12.579
DAGMOLA SAKYA: For every woman
it doesn't matter anyways.

00:35:12.579 --> 00:35:13.450
It doesn't matter.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.214
Had to have good heart.

00:35:16.214 --> 00:35:17.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.235
Thank you.

00:35:20.235 --> 00:35:22.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.125
I have one question.

00:35:24.125 --> 00:35:27.180
If I may ask is, what's
the most challenge

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:33.440
you're facing you think
when you fled from Tibet?

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.650
That is my first question.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.830
I mean, the most challenging
thing you think you had.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.149
Do you have challenges think?

00:35:41.149 --> 00:35:42.190
DAGMOLA SAKYA: Do myself?

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.720
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:49.150
DAGMOLA SAKYA: I don't recall
I've done tremendous things,

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.550
but I feel I'm good.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.970
I have done something
in this life

00:35:54.970 --> 00:36:02.350
so benefit others, try to teach
something positive, and raised

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:07.220
my family, and try to go
to teaching wherever I can,

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.780
whatever I can do.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.040
And I lived this.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.780
I'm 84 years old.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.440
I still maybe a few
more years, who knows.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:19.210
And so I always thinking
in myself, I'm very happy

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.110
and can do this.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.170
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:28.060
Thank you, Dagmola, very much
for come and give the talk.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:34.090
One question I have is, you
mentioned 4% of Tibetan women

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:39.820
become nuns and that there
are nunneries in Tibet.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.620
Is that still the case now?

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.440
There are still quite
some nunneries in Tibet,

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.060
or this is in the old age
before you left Tibet?

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:49.990
DAGMOLA SAKYA: Yes.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:54.040
I just recently visited
in Tibet last month,

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:59.500
and I was offered support
at many nunneries.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.560
And those nuns there,
some are nunneries.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.670
Only problem there is limit.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.930
You can have so
many, each nunnery.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.230
Before, anybody who wish to go.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:14.560
But nowadays, each nunnery
has allowed so many nuns.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:20.440
We have around Sakya, there
is two nunneries I visited.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.900
One is, like, 250 almost.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:28.050
One is, like, last time I
visited, only 25, now it's 37.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.260
But they have limited.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.280
They have to get pass-- kind
of passport from government

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.800
to get in certain things.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.890
Otherwise, yes, there
are are nunneries,

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:41.600
and these nuns are very
good practitioners.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.390
And of course, nuns
in India and Tibet.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:50.950
And they have debate like
monks, and they do very--

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:55.540
and I also heard
some people, patrons

00:37:55.540 --> 00:38:00.070
who want to ask pray for
monastery or nunneries,

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:03.680
and they like to do nunneries
because nuns sit still there,

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.800
and they do until pray done.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.920
Monks maybe not do it, some
might get up and walk out.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.120
So anyway, these are very good.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.910
And then old nuns, like
my time before, there

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:22.280
are still nuns, I heard,
still in the cave do

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.730
practicing all of their life.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:30.330
But like I said, before the
Tibetan came out in exile,

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:35.980
women are not out, because man
is lamas, monks, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.840
so many of-- so the women are
not really even practitioners.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.700
They do the retreat.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.180
They do their own practice,
not so much go around

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.470
and teachings.

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.950
But now they are, yes.

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:54.670
AUDIENCE: So the teachers
at the nunneries are nuns,

00:38:54.670 --> 00:39:00.770
so there's no, like, male lama
teachers at the nunneries?

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:03.640
DAGMOLA SAKYA: I will
say, most nunneries

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:10.550
have just nun, [INAUDIBLE],,
but some lamas who

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:16.930
are qualified lamas,
[INAUDIBLE] or [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.620
can go give a teaching,
certain Mahayana teaching,

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.220
so they can practice.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.850
But like Mahayana
practice, we have

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.220
to have received
certain teachings.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.490
Without receiving
transmission and teachings,

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:32.170
we cannot practice.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:38.439
So yes, the male lamas go there,
teach, and not live with nuns.

00:39:38.439 --> 00:39:38.980
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.360
So in general, the Buddhism
teachings in the nunnery,

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:49.240
are they very similar to the
Buddhist Institute or monastery

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:55.600
for monks or anything
special for nunneries?

00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:00.262
Or maybe not as
stringent as the monks?

00:40:00.262 --> 00:40:01.470
DAGMOLA SAKYA: Oh, you mean--

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:02.945
AUDIENCE: The teachings.

00:40:02.945 --> 00:40:06.105
DAGMOLA SAKYA: --Tibet and
India and those places?

00:40:06.105 --> 00:40:06.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.810
I mean, just compare the
nunneries and the monastery

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.420
for monks.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.584
Are these very similar?

00:40:13.584 --> 00:40:14.750
DAGMOLA SAKYA: Very similar.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:15.250
Yes.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.910
They are very similar.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:22.150
And even now, nuns have
more, like I just mentioned,

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.670
His Holiness gave
a Geshema degree,

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:29.600
which is equally is, you know,
Geshe, which means doctrine,

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.460
degree.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:35.950
And this is just first time
happen in Tibet history.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:39.640
So nuns do debates,
and nuns do all

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.630
of what the monks are doing.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:44.110
Teaching, yes, equally.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:46.420
AUDIENCE: Yesterday, you
mentioned about your exile

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.020
from Tibet and
climbed the Himalayas.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:54.130
Just imagine that it is still
very difficult for nowadays.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.900
So would you please
share your insight?

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.440
How come you can be so strong?

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.880
DAGMOLA SAKYA: I think leading
by [INAUDIBLE] and Arya Tara

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:09.500
guide me and help me, like
all other people who are

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.430
to guiding from [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.650
But it's true.

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:18.340
When I came out from
Tibet with three children,

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:23.890
the youngest one is just about
a year old and still diaper on,

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.170
crossing the Himalayas.

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:28.760
And it wasn't easy.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:36.720
But we left country because we
don't want to give up Dharma.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.990
That's why we left.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:43.540
And then like I said, some time
in my life, I lived in a palace

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.330
in Sakya.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:49.650
I raised by my wonderful
family in East Tibet

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:54.720
and lived in Sakya, married
with head of Sakya [INAUDIBLE],,

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.470
and lived in palace.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:01.810
And then crossed the mountain
and the refugee camps,

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:06.640
and then came here [INAUDIBLE]
from the Rockefeller Foundation

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.720
for three years' grant.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.780
Ever since, we cannot go back.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.700
So here, I had to do--

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.910
I wrote this book, first book.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:17.490
I think I see--

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:22.390
and I give the first book
to His Holiness Dalai Lama.

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:25.390
And he was very
happy, and he was

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:29.510
saying that this is very
good because it gives courage

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:31.690
for the other Tibetan women.

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:34.870
Because you were in Tibet,
you were first lady,

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:38.275
and here you're American
servant, which is true.

00:42:38.275 --> 00:42:39.820
I worked.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:44.950
Mother, grandma, everything,
I [INAUDIBLE] working for.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:46.710
Tibetan, now American.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.010
Yes.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.640
So that's why now
since after I retired,

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:58.810
I try to do as much as practice
myself and help the others

00:42:58.810 --> 00:42:59.660
teaching.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:00.571
Not just women.

00:43:00.571 --> 00:43:01.070
Men.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:05.510
Anybody who needs in my
own experience, my sharing.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:10.100
I also grateful, lots
of men who supports us.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:10.990
Thank you.

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:15.170
I'm only talking to the women,
but men are wonderful helper.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.420
Lot of things.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.860
Yes.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.140
Without, like, Arya
Tara even said,

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:24.040
there's no men if
there's no women.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.510
It's equally.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:28.210
But she wanted to remain--

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:32.170
reborn with a woman to
come help all the beings.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:33.010
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:35.950
And my last question
is, there is-- recently

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:37.960
there is a movie called
"Wonder Woman" here.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.580
I feel the--

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:43.840
I was so touched by the
Wonder Woman's compassion.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:47.470
And so when I saw yesterday's
topic, "Dakini Power,"

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:51.430
is there any special
training for us to,

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:55.750
female, first female, to receive
some kind of special training

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.150
to become more powerful
to have the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:59.950
Because that is so beautiful.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.460
DAGMOLA SAKYA:
What kind of power?

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:01.820
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:02.320
I just--

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:09.550
DAGMOLA SAKYA: I only just
would called it the spiritual.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:10.870
And you have to--

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:16.270
in Tibetan Buddhism, you cannot
just pick up a book, read.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:20.820
All you can say, lots
of my Western students

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.560
will sometimes say I'm
Buddhist, many years.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.780
I've read so many books.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.430
I went to lots of classes.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:30.230
But that doesn't
mean you're Buddhist.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:34.630
In Buddhism, it's
necessary, you have

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:38.110
to receive the
refugee vow, which

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:41.230
is some commandment there.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:46.770
And after you receive that,
then if the teacher and student

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:50.750
have commandment,
teacher [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.080
would protect you, guide you.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.020
And the students
follow that guidance.

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:59.690
But finding teacher
is very hard.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:06.600
Today, I would say there's so
many young teachers, lamas,

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.990
and all kind of--

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:10.900
I don't even know lots of them.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:15.310
But you have to really
find right teacher,

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:22.430
not just follow their ranking or
their look or they dress good.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:28.970
Only look what their background,
carry the transmission,

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:30.490
lineage.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:32.110
Who are their teacher?

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:33.940
Then you go for it.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.640
Once you have it, you
don't need many teachers.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.110
And you'll follow that.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.160
That's Mahayana Buddhism.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.980
There is many teachers.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.320
Some are good.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.690
Doesn't matter, man,
woman, nun, or monk.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:47.680
Doesn't matter.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.240
It's just something that
answers your question.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.080
Something you're connected.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.810
Usually we can tell once
first we meet for talk,

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:58.920
you kind of tell that.

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:04.780
And most times, people goes
just look, all written so much

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.850
about background.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:08.140
His Holiness.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.310
All those.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.520
That doesn't mean anything.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.440
You have a connection.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.940
AUDIENCE: And from what you're
saying about this connection,

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.820
I told my husband, if
I saw, like a formal--

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.020
I feel connection.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.110
But my husband will
say, that's not--

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:23.919
it's not logic.

00:46:23.919 --> 00:46:24.960
DAGMOLA SAKYA: That's OK.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.543
AUDIENCE: So what
should I answer him?

00:46:26.543 --> 00:46:27.660
DAGMOLA SAKYA: That's OK.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.290
AUDIENCE: That's OK?

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:28.790
All right.

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:30.640
Leave it at that.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.030
AUDIENCE: So I have a question
about our software engineering

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.630
profession.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:39.590
So in this profession, there is
actually a misbalance of our--

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:40.110
the genders.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.990
There's a lot more
guys than girls.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:50.870
So what do you think could
help to balance the genders?

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:56.710
Because to me, it seems
very good for a woman

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:58.840
to work for a company
in the software industry

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.560
because it's possible
to work from home.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.710
She can take care of her
family when she needs to.

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:06.790
But what do you see are the
obstacles, and how can we help

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:10.474
attract more women to help
balance this industry?

00:47:10.474 --> 00:47:11.890
DAGMOLA SAKYA: I
think that we all

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:19.930
know be nice, listen, and listen
what they want, how they talk.

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:26.080
You may have-- you may can
help, she may can help you.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.160
You may can help her.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.800
So this is just--

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.940
gender is really
not much difference.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:39.190
Only the connection
with your thinking

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:42.520
or your wisdom or your related--

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.460
or most in Tibet
we'll call it karma.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.350
We always related.

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:52.780
And mostly I would always
say to best things have

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.570
to be nice with your parents.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:58.390
And the parents, if you take
care of parents, especially

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.520
mother, you will be happy life.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:04.510
And this is the only--

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.730
when we pray, we
always-- every prayer,

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.790
we say all mother and
all sentient beings.

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:13.710
Because we considered that
some time, I was your mother.

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:14.210
Maybe yes.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:15.610
Who knows who we are?

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:18.780
There's something like
we are here today,

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.580
just there is some connected.

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:22.270
I believe.

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:27.570
Every time I believe that I have
somebody to closer and talking

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:30.790
or feel, and is
there some lifetime

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:34.340
we had some connection.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.380
So it's most important, patient.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:43.060
And especially
women need patient.

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.370
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:46.890
DAGMOLA SAKYA: Be
very sensitive.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:50.830
Women are more sensitive,
so you be patient,

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:54.100
then you'll always find the
right path through your wisdom.

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:57.130
SPEAKER: OK.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:00.280
I want to ask the last question.

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.720
So because you are now
living in the Western world

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.550
and especially like in
companies like Google,

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:10.079
we have very diverse
background, people

00:49:10.079 --> 00:49:11.870
come from different
countries in the world.

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:16.470
They have different religions
and maybe a lot of atheists.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:18.379
They have different
belief systems.

00:49:18.379 --> 00:49:20.170
So what do you think
is the best way for us

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:24.930
to promote Dharma teachings
or to help more people

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:28.060
in Google or in the society?

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.880
DAGMOLA SAKYA: All
religion, I respect.

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.040
All the religion,
spiritual, they

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:38.470
are helping all the beings,
whatever they need, always.

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:44.260
But what we need is
everything in today's life,

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.240
we just too fast.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.340
Everything new all, you'll
have to have that new.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.510
You don't need it.

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:58.600
So slow down, think,
do I really need this?

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.170
Things, materials, too much.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:06.340
And also when you
have something,

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.080
somebody said
something you didn't

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.400
like to hear, be just patient.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:11.950
Listen.

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:14.590
Not answer right away.

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:20.770
So this kind of helping for
calmness and communication

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:22.970
and peace for the world.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:26.100
So this is because, like
I mentioned yesterday,

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:31.180
some people have one you
need again another one.

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.490
If you have the one
car, I need better car.

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.640
Just like iPhones.

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.790
Everything.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:39.210
It's too much things.

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:41.970
If you know how to work,
that might be helpful.

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:43.600
World needs lots of things.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.190
For example, I have an iPhone.

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:48.375
I only know how to
[INAUDIBLE] or to call.

00:50:48.375 --> 00:50:50.560
It has fancy things,
but I don't know.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.630
So why I need that?

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:56.470
So somethings you do need,
sometimes you don't need.

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:59.620
If you have one car,
you need second car.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:02.890
You cannot drive
two cars same time.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:07.240
So it's just slow down and
do a little meditation.

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.790
Doesn't have to be Buddhist.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:13.540
Just little bit down, with the
patient, talking, anything.

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:16.580
Just think more than do more.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:21.650
I think this leads to easier
and peace for everyone.

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:22.960
SPEAKER: Thank you so much.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.830
Thank you again for your
inspiring talk and your wise.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:28.480
And also thank you
for the hosting team

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.260
and all the audience
for your time.

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.550
Thank you.

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:33.210
DAGMOLA SAKYA: Thank you.
