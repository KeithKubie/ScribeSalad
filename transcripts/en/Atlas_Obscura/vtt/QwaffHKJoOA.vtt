00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.220
Like, from the moment I had consciousness they were always appealing to me.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.800
The way they look, the way they eat, the way they move.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.720
The way that their exoskeletons shine in the light.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.600
When you sort of dispel the hatred we have towards insects,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.360
you actually have a better shot at dispelling xenophobia towards different people.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.760
I have hundreds of different animals,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.000
mostly insects. 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.440
I do live animal shows, where I like to showcase

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.920
different animals that are very different from us.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.320
Hi, everyone. Thanks for coming. 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.720
My name is Aaron Rodriques and these are all my pets.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.160
A lot of what we think are very dangerous animals are actually very,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.360
very peaceful.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.360
There are actually a very limited number of insects that can do you harm.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.760
The treatment that people give insects

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.480
is sort of what prompts me into studying and liking them more.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.680
Because I do feel that way in a way.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.480
- He's seeing you right now. 
- Yeah, wow. 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.440
He's very shy.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.880
I didn't have many friends growing up as a child.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.120
I felt like I was different from a lot of children.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.960
I couldn't really understand them, and they couldn't really understand me. 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.440
[Whistling]

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
I've only had one friend visit my room ever.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.040
Over here, I have my

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.680
African twig mantis. 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.360
Baby rose-haired tarantula. 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.680
These are quail eggs.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.960
Green caterpillars that you can normally find in New York. They're a pest.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.400
Black solider fly larvae. 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.640
And in addition to live animals, I also have a few dead ones. 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.280
It's very crowded, as you can tell, but it's also, 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.600
I think, very cozy and comfortable. 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.120
I keep this place at a very steady temperature,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.040
around eighty degrees or so.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.640
I think I had a show-and-tell at some point when I was eight years old, where 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.360
I had beetle larvae and I wanted to show them off,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.280
and everyone was just really uninterested.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.360
So I thought, “Alright, no one likes insects. 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.520
I guess. I'm just the only person who does.”

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.160
As a child growing up I became sort of obsessed with them.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.120
My parents nurtured that passion.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.160
I first started going to the library when I was very young.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.200
For me it was just amazing because

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.520
they had an entire section devoted to insects.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.440
There was just, like, so much violence and stealing in my school. 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.120
There were a lot of people I just didn't want to be friends with.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.320
Weekend after weekend, I would just stay in my room 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.040
and just do something aside from socializing with people.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.560
In a lot of cases, insects were a crutch. 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.200
It wasn't until

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.360
maybe last year that I started doing shows

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.320
and really telling people how much I like it.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.280
It started with a Facebook comment.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.880
The name of the band was called Moth Eggs.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.600
I commented on the page, I said, 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.320
“I breed moths, so I feel like should go to this show.” 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.600
And then some woman saw my comment and liked it.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.120
It was all her idea.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.800
It feels like

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.120
I sort of have an identity now that I'm

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.920
open about what I like.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.280
It's sort of like a coming of age story.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.680
I never really felt like I had something.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.800
I started this show and I realized that this is my thing.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.240
You can't really love something if you're afraid of it.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.400
You can't really love something if you don't

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.600
really understand it.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.480
The fear and the hatred of insects is just the fear of the unknown.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.520
I definitely don't regret being more open about

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.200
who I am as a person.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.680
It's just something that I'm really glad I did.
