well generally in the wild you'll find

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:00.129
well generally in the wild you'll find
 

00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:02.189
well generally in the wild you'll find
that hippos will live to about 30 years

00:11:02.189 --> 00:11:02.199
that hippos will live to about 30 years
 

00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:04.050
that hippos will live to about 30 years
they can't go a little bit older than

they can't go a little bit older than
 

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.439
they can't go a little bit older than
that but it's you know in wild given

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:07.449
that but it's you know in wild given
 

00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:09.119
that but it's you know in wild given
that they fight with one another these

00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:09.129

the lifespan is a little bit shorter but
 

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:13.530
the lifespan is a little bit shorter but
look at that I expect you see arts

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:13.540
look at that I expect you see arts
 

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.910

it actually drink the blood and get that
so it's not actually looking for any

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720
so it's not actually looking for any

worries about predation and so they can

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:44.649
worries about predation and so they can
 

00:11:44.649 --> 00:11:47.249
worries about predation and so they can
go to about thirty five in captivity but

00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:47.259
go to about thirty five in captivity but
 

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:49.230
go to about thirty five in captivity but
thirty generally in the wild would be

scary job because the fire can jump
 

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.980

little sort of areas with is light and
 

00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:50.470
little sort of areas with is light and
dark and it helps the critter to

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480
dark and it helps the critter to
 

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.810
dark and it helps the critter to
camouflage more which means it hides

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:52.820
camouflage more which means it hides
 

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.720
camouflage more which means it hides
away better from predators and it makes

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:55.730
away better from predators and it makes
 

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.940
away better from predators and it makes
it easier for these guys to then kind of

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:57.950
it easier for these guys to then kind of
 

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.730
it easier for these guys to then kind of

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.620
flies naturally dung beetles are there
in order to control the balance when it

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:43.630
in order to control the balance when it
 

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.380
in order to control the balance when it
comes to the population of flies so this

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:46.390
comes to the population of flies so this
 

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.360
comes to the population of flies so this
is very much interesting after this

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:48.370
is very much interesting after this
 

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:50.190
is very much interesting after this
there some of them are going deep this

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200
there some of them are going deep this
 

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.620
there some of them are going deep this
side some are going down on this road so

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:52.630
side some are going down on this road so
 

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.300
side some are going down on this road so
they are going to find a nice port and

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:54.310
they are going to find a nice port and
 

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.980
they are going to find a nice port and
bury these kind of balls

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:55.990
bury these kind of balls
 

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.680
bury these kind of balls
so dung beetles when talking in terms of

00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:58.690
so dung beetles when talking in terms of
 

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:01.710
so dung beetles when talking in terms of
the strength the dung beetles they are

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720
the strength the dung beetles they are
 

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.530
the strength the dung beetles they are
very much strong yes the strongest

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:04.540
very much strong yes the strongest
 

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.120
very much strong yes the strongest
animal in the whole world is the

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:06.130
animal in the whole world is the
 

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.310
animal in the whole world is the
elephant but when talking in terms of

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320
elephant but when talking in terms of
 

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.100
elephant but when talking in terms of
the strength to weight ratio dung beetle

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:11.110
the strength to weight ratio dung beetle
 

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:13.860
the strength to weight ratio dung beetle
is the best so they are all looking very

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:13.870
is the best so they are all looking very
 

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.560
is the best so they are all looking very
much dirty and oh this even a kennel

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:16.570
much dirty and oh this even a kennel
 

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:18.990
much dirty and oh this even a kennel
here look at this oh here we might see a

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000
here look at this oh here we might see a
 

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.250
here look at this oh here we might see a
fighter there because I can see it's

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:20.260
fighter there because I can see it's
 

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:23.580
fighter there because I can see it's
tree you see it's going back again look

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:23.590
tree you see it's going back again look
 

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.530
tree you see it's going back again look
at that look at that look at that now

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:25.540
at that look at that look at that now
 

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.990
at that look at that look at that now
now it's a fight look at that this is

now it's a fight look at that this is
 

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.170
now it's a fight look at that this is
amazing when you see that is three you

amazing when you see that is three you
 

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.330
amazing when you see that is three you
must know that that what is lost is what

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:33.340
must know that that what is lost is what
 

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.340
must know that that what is lost is what
is running away now with with the drug

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:35.350
is running away now with with the drug

that one with a ball you can see so

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:45.070
that one with a ball you can see so
 

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.590
that one with a ball you can see so
let's see maybe he's gonna manage to

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:46.600
let's see maybe he's gonna manage to
 

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.320
let's see maybe he's gonna manage to
find this one with a ball here then we

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:49.330
find this one with a ball here then we
 

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.240
find this one with a ball here then we
might see another look it's coming

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:51.250
might see another look it's coming
 

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.490
might see another look it's coming
towards that direction look at that the

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:53.500
towards that direction look at that the
 

00:36:53.500 --> 00:37:04.020
towards that direction look at that the
fire disk is going to carry on something

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:04.030
fire disk is going to carry on something
 

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.450
fire disk is going to carry on something
interesting so this one is driving over

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:06.460
interesting so this one is driving over
 

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.980

holding so it okay now only wants to get
the ball and the wife away Tim is

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:15.670
the ball and the wife away Tim is
 

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.910
the ball and the wife away Tim is
rolling drive over the wife this does

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920
rolling drive over the wife this does
 

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.810

look at that this is amazing now he's
 

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:31.140
look at that this is amazing now he's
driving the ball much more decide maybe

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.150
driving the ball much more decide maybe
 

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.400
driving the ball much more decide maybe
there was just a little bit of

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:32.410
there was just a little bit of
 

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:34.800
there was just a little bit of
disagreements between the husband and

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:34.810
disagreements between the husband and
 

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:36.600
disagreements between the husband and
wife because the husband is the one

normal who pushes the wife is having a
 

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.940
normal who pushes the wife is having a
lift so after this you will see the

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:41.950
lift so after this you will see the
 

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.040
lift so after this you will see the
little ones inside they're going to be

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.050
little ones inside they're going to be
 

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.170
little ones inside they're going to be
able to eat because when they are hiding

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:46.180
able to eat because when they are hiding
 

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.870
able to eat because when they are hiding
when the XH is dung beetles they've got

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880
when the XH is dung beetles they've got
 

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.150
when the XH is dung beetles they've got
a complete lifecycle so when they hatch

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160
a complete lifecycle so when they hatch
 

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.730
a complete lifecycle so when they hatch
the eggs little ones they have to be

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:53.740
the eggs little ones they have to be
 

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.920
the eggs little ones they have to be
able to lava must be able to eat by the

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:55.930
able to lava must be able to eat by the
 

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:58.530
able to lava must be able to eat by the
fresh path of these droppings and this

00:37:58.530 --> 00:37:58.540
fresh path of these droppings and this
 

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.090
fresh path of these droppings and this
novice when they are still going through

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:00.100
novice when they are still going through
 

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.310
novice when they are still going through
the lava stage they also experience

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:02.320
the lava stage they also experience
 

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.550
the lava stage they also experience
problems because some of the animals

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.560
problems because some of the animals
 

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.680
problems because some of the animals
such as the honey badgers they like to

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:07.690
such as the honey badgers they like to
 

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:12.060
such as the honey badgers they like to
dig they they like to dig this dung ball

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:12.070
dig they they like to dig this dung ball
 

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:14.490
dig they they like to dig this dung ball
balls and collect them in order to eat

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:14.500
balls and collect them in order to eat
 

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.620
balls and collect them in order to eat
the larvae so that is something which is

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:16.630
the larvae so that is something which is
 

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.260
the larvae so that is something which is
also controls the population of dung

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:19.270
also controls the population of dung
 

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:22.830
also controls the population of dung
beetles so you can see now this sort of

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:22.840
beetles so you can see now this sort of
 

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.750
beetles so you can see now this sort of
big balls coming out again look at that

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760
big balls coming out again look at that
 

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.780
big balls coming out again look at that
I can see another one is is coming out

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:27.790
I can see another one is is coming out
 

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:32.670
I can see another one is is coming out
now is taken through that side so that

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680
now is taken through that side so that
 

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:38.880
now is taken through that side so that
is quite a very big ball

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:38.890
 

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:41.440
well they can't be able to hate each

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:41.450
well they can't be able to hate each
 

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:41.800
well they can't be able to hate each
other

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:41.810
other
 

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.660
other
I have seen some of the dung beetles

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:43.670
I have seen some of the dung beetles
 

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.849
I have seen some of the dung beetles
they have got short limbs some of them

00:38:45.849 --> 00:38:45.859
they have got short limbs some of them
 

00:38:45.859 --> 00:38:48.570
they have got short limbs some of them
has got broken legs here because of

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:48.580
has got broken legs here because of
 

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.190
has got broken legs here because of
involving themselves in this kind of

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200
involving themselves in this kind of
 

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.650
involving themselves in this kind of
thighs and apart from this there are

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:53.660
thighs and apart from this there are
 

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.780
thighs and apart from this there are
some of also other animals who predate

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:55.790
some of also other animals who predate
 

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.820
some of also other animals who predate
the dung beetles these bears who eat

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:57.830
the dung beetles these bears who eat
 

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.550
the dung beetles these bears who eat
them are they've got a very strong

00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560
them are they've got a very strong
 

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.460
them are they've got a very strong
chitinous cover which is very hard some

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:03.470
chitinous cover which is very hard some
 

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.140
chitinous cover which is very hard some
of them they learned on their back when

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:05.150
of them they learned on their back when
 

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:07.060
of them they learned on their back when
they come to these droppings so they

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:07.070
they come to these droppings so they
 

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:14.589
they come to these droppings so they
their skin is very much hard so you can

00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599
their skin is very much hard so you can
 

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:16.750
their skin is very much hard so you can
see the elephants the reason why they

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760
see the elephants the reason why they
 

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.760
see the elephants the reason why they
look another one is landing oh we just

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:18.770
look another one is landing oh we just
 

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:26.320
look another one is landing oh we just
landed no colonel from what I have seen

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:26.330
landed no colonel from what I have seen
 

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:30.160
landed no colonel from what I have seen
here today I have noticed that is a

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:30.170
here today I have noticed that is a
 

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:34.089
here today I have noticed that is a
difference because all these climbing

00:39:34.089 --> 00:39:34.099
difference because all these climbing
 

00:39:34.099 --> 00:39:37.000
difference because all these climbing
they are very much clean and the ones

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.010
they are very much clean and the ones
 

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.920
they are very much clean and the ones
who are pushing are looking very dirty

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:38.930
who are pushing are looking very dirty
 

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:40.960
who are pushing are looking very dirty
all the time if you can check here the

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:40.970
all the time if you can check here the
 

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:42.849
all the time if you can check here the
females are not doing anything so the

00:39:42.849 --> 00:39:42.859
females are not doing anything so the
 

00:39:42.859 --> 00:39:44.620
females are not doing anything so the
easiest way for me to distinguish

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:44.630
easiest way for me to distinguish
 

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.660
easiest way for me to distinguish
between the male and female is to check

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:46.670
between the male and female is to check
 

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:48.940
between the male and female is to check
the one who's got dirty wings is the

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:48.950
the one who's got dirty wings is the
 

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:51.099
the one who's got dirty wings is the
male I'm seeing here and the females

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:51.109
male I'm seeing here and the females
 

00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:53.560
male I'm seeing here and the females
their bodies are looking very shiny so

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:53.570
their bodies are looking very shiny so
 

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:55.329
their bodies are looking very shiny so
the female's body are shining and the

00:39:55.329 --> 00:39:55.339
the female's body are shining and the
 

00:39:55.339 --> 00:39:57.220
the female's body are shining and the
male's bodies they are looking much more

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:57.230
male's bodies they are looking much more
 

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:04.650
male's bodies they are looking much more
duty and much more Brown

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:04.660
 

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:11.070
and this is one of the best sightings so

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:11.080
and this is one of the best sightings so
 

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.960
and this is one of the best sightings so
the elephants are the ones who are

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:12.970
the elephants are the ones who are
 

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:14.790
the elephants are the ones who are
giving this dung beetles quite a lot of

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800
giving this dung beetles quite a lot of
 

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.460
giving this dung beetles quite a lot of
nutritious food at the moment so let's

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:17.470
nutritious food at the moment so let's
 

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.560
nutritious food at the moment so let's
pick clickers over to James and see if

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:19.570
pick clickers over to James and see if
 

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:21.900
pick clickers over to James and see if
those elephants are not excreting food

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:21.910
those elephants are not excreting food
 

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:26.490
those elephants are not excreting food
for the dung beetles right everybody

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:26.500
for the dung beetles right everybody
 

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.050
for the dung beetles right everybody

can be able to eat about 400 kilograms
of food a day and after that they're

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400
of food a day and after that they're
 

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.490
of food a day and after that they're
only going to digest only 48 percent

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:17.500
only going to digest only 48 percent
 

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.010
only going to digest only 48 percent
that is why in here is still quite a lot

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:20.020
that is why in here is still quite a lot
 

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.980
that is why in here is still quite a lot
of nutrients available there's even

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:22.990
of nutrients available there's even
 

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:25.170
of nutrients available there's even
quite a lot of water I can see here so

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:25.180
quite a lot of water I can see here so

now that my stick is showing that this
 

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:33.570
now that my stick is showing that this
elephant defecated here and urinated as

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:33.580
elephant defecated here and urinated as
 

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.690
elephant defecated here and urinated as
well somewhere in here so I can see that

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:36.700
well somewhere in here so I can see that
 

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.820
well somewhere in here so I can see that
here the droppings are having quite a

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:38.830
here the droppings are having quite a
 

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:46.050
here the droppings are having quite a
lot of moisture so here I can see this

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:46.060
lot of moisture so here I can see this

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:34.170
distance and kind of graze around
I suspect that we're actually

01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:34.180
I suspect that we're actually
 

01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:36.240
I suspect that we're actually
inadvertently protecting the lands from

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:36.250
inadvertently protecting the lands from
 

01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:39.000
inadvertently protecting the lands from
the elephants because we're parked

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:39.010
the elephants because we're parked
 

01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:41.430
the elephants because we're parked
directly behind them I don't think

01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440
directly behind them I don't think
 

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.930
directly behind them I don't think
that's going to affect the outcome

01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:42.940
that's going to affect the outcome
 

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:45.300
that's going to affect the outcome
tremendously except that it might allow

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:45.310
tremendously except that it might allow
 

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:47.190
tremendously except that it might allow
the Lions to lie here for a bit longer

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:47.200
the Lions to lie here for a bit longer
 

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.870
the Lions to lie here for a bit longer
does the elephants are going to avoid

01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880
does the elephants are going to avoid
 

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:55.410
does the elephants are going to avoid
walking straight at us but other than

01:18:55.410 --> 01:18:55.420
walking straight at us but other than
 

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.540
walking straight at us but other than
that everything is very calm and

01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:57.550
that everything is very calm and
 

01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:59.280
that everything is very calm and
peaceful here and in fact you can see

01:18:59.280 --> 01:18:59.290
peaceful here and in fact you can see
 

01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:06.339
peaceful here and in fact you can see
the Lions settling in again

01:19:06.339 --> 01:19:06.349
 

01:19:06.349 --> 01:19:08.140
there won't be particularly worried

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:08.150
there won't be particularly worried
 

01:19:08.150 --> 01:19:09.609
there won't be particularly worried
about the situation because of course

01:19:09.609 --> 01:19:09.619
about the situation because of course
 

01:19:09.619 --> 01:19:11.169
about the situation because of course
they know there are much faster than

01:19:11.169 --> 01:19:11.179
they know there are much faster than
 

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:15.280
they know there are much faster than
elephants and I suspect also they

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:15.290
elephants and I suspect also they
 

01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:16.660
elephants and I suspect also they
realize that despite the fact that I

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:16.670
realize that despite the fact that I
 

01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:19.330
realize that despite the fact that I
don't an outright sprint and that alt

01:19:19.330 --> 01:19:19.340
don't an outright sprint and that alt
 

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:21.520
don't an outright sprint and that alt
elephant could probably outrun one of

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:21.530
elephant could probably outrun one of
 

01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:24.040
elephant could probably outrun one of
these cubs they know that the elephants

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:24.050
these cubs they know that the elephants
 

01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:26.410
these cubs they know that the elephants
will probably not push home and attack

01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:26.420
will probably not push home and attack
 

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:31.510
will probably not push home and attack
if they back off fast enough there's the

01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520
if they back off fast enough there's the
 

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.550
if they back off fast enough there's the
same probably wouldn't be said for her

01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560
same probably wouldn't be said for her
 

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:45.939
same probably wouldn't be said for her
to Buffalo coming this way

01:19:45.939 --> 01:19:45.949
 

01:19:45.949 --> 01:19:48.310
so just starting now to make their

01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320
so just starting now to make their
 

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:51.720
so just starting now to make their
evening calls down on the brook bellows

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:51.730
evening calls down on the brook bellows
 

01:19:51.730 --> 01:20:03.089
evening calls down on the brook bellows
and the thick trees

01:20:03.089 --> 01:20:03.099
 

01:20:03.099 --> 01:20:05.850
I'm car sorry miss dad was at how far

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:05.860
I'm car sorry miss dad was at how far
 

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:09.930
I'm car sorry miss dad was at how far
can elephants feed in a day in an area

01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:09.940
can elephants feed in a day in an area
 

01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:11.550
can elephants feed in a day in an area
like this I don't think they're moved

01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:11.560
like this I don't think they're moved
 

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.040
like this I don't think they're moved
tremendously far but it's probably a

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:14.050
tremendously far but it's probably a
 

01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:17.430
tremendously far but it's probably a
good 5 or 6 kilometers I suppose how far

01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440
good 5 or 6 kilometers I suppose how far
 

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:20.609
good 5 or 6 kilometers I suppose how far
can they see well there we go that like

01:20:20.609 --> 01:20:20.619
can they see well there we go that like
 

01:20:20.619 --> 01:20:23.580
can they see well there we go that like
that elephants now spotted a lot there

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:23.590
that elephants now spotted a lot there
 

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:25.379
that elephants now spotted a lot there
we go and that's at a distance of about

01:20:25.379 --> 01:20:25.389
we go and that's at a distance of about
 

01:20:25.389 --> 01:20:29.160
we go and that's at a distance of about
50 meters look at them she's she's told

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:29.170
50 meters look at them she's she's told
 

01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:29.819
50 meters look at them she's she's told
all the rest

01:20:29.819 --> 01:20:29.829
all the rest
 

01:20:29.829 --> 01:20:32.069
all the rest
she's infrasonic li told all the others

01:20:32.069 --> 01:20:32.079
she's infrasonic li told all the others
 

01:20:32.079 --> 01:20:33.270
she's infrasonic li told all the others
that they were proud of that there's a

01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280
that they were proud of that there's a
 

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.770
that they were proud of that there's a
pride of lions yeah they're now all

01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:34.780
pride of lions yeah they're now all
 

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:39.020
pride of lions yeah they're now all
completely alert look at that

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:39.030
 

01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:41.459
only one elephant saw these cats and

01:20:41.459 --> 01:20:41.469
only one elephant saw these cats and
 

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:44.040
only one elephant saw these cats and
they all reacted straight away the

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:44.050
they all reacted straight away the
 

01:20:44.050 --> 01:20:51.740
they all reacted straight away the
elephants did and they're moving away

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:51.750
 

01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:56.310
that's really very interesting I've seen

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320
that's really very interesting I've seen
 

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.930
that's really very interesting I've seen
elephants do exactly the opposite of

01:20:57.930 --> 01:20:57.940
elephants do exactly the opposite of
 

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:00.330
elephants do exactly the opposite of
this and chase the Lions away but maybe

01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:00.340
this and chase the Lions away but maybe
 

01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:02.339
this and chase the Lions away but maybe
because we hear they decided not to do

01:21:02.339 --> 01:21:02.349
because we hear they decided not to do
 

01:21:02.349 --> 01:21:08.490
because we hear they decided not to do
that so um car I don't know I mean look

01:21:08.490 --> 01:21:08.500
that so um car I don't know I mean look
 

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:09.930
that so um car I don't know I mean look
I don't know what distance they're able

01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:09.940
I don't know what distance they're able
 

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:12.200
I don't know what distance they're able
to see accurately at but you know I

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:12.210
to see accurately at but you know I
 

01:21:12.210 --> 01:21:16.169
to see accurately at but you know I
think it depends on what sort of terrain

01:21:16.169 --> 01:21:16.179
think it depends on what sort of terrain
 

01:21:16.179 --> 01:21:19.050
think it depends on what sort of terrain
they're in so could they see me walking

01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:19.060
they're in so could they see me walking
 

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:21.569
they're in so could they see me walking
across an open plain at a hundred metres

01:21:21.569 --> 01:21:21.579
across an open plain at a hundred metres
 

01:21:21.579 --> 01:21:23.339
across an open plain at a hundred metres
yes definitely they could absolutely

01:21:23.339 --> 01:21:23.349
yes definitely they could absolutely
 

01:21:23.349 --> 01:21:27.300
yes definitely they could absolutely
that's at 330 feet could they see me or

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:27.310
that's at 330 feet could they see me or
 

01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:30.030
that's at 330 feet could they see me or
could I successfully walk through some

01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040
could I successfully walk through some
 

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.459
could I successfully walk through some
thick bush in front of them at 100

01:21:32.459 --> 01:21:32.469
thick bush in front of them at 100
 

01:21:32.469 --> 01:21:34.050
thick bush in front of them at 100
metres if I didn't make a noise yes I

01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:34.060
metres if I didn't make a noise yes I
 

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:35.250
metres if I didn't make a noise yes I
probably could there probably wouldn't

01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:35.260
probably could there probably wouldn't
 

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:40.649
probably could there probably wouldn't
pick me up then

01:21:40.649 --> 01:21:40.659
 

01:21:40.659 --> 01:21:42.970
they do apparently also have a blind

01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:42.980
they do apparently also have a blind
 

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:45.879
they do apparently also have a blind
spot and if you approach them straight

01:21:45.879 --> 01:21:45.889
spot and if you approach them straight
 

01:21:45.889 --> 01:21:48.760
spot and if you approach them straight
side on and they're feeding they won't

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:48.770
side on and they're feeding they won't
 

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:52.330
side on and they're feeding they won't
see you I've never tried that myself

01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:52.340
see you I've never tried that myself
 

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:55.629
see you I've never tried that myself
I've read about it from a very reliable

01:21:55.629 --> 01:21:55.639
I've read about it from a very reliable
 

01:21:55.639 --> 01:21:57.720
I've read about it from a very reliable
source

01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:57.730
source
 

01:21:57.730 --> 01:22:01.660
source
I wouldn't try that now they're running

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:01.670
I wouldn't try that now they're running
 

01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:06.660
I wouldn't try that now they're running
I mean that bunch is totally taking off

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:06.670
 

01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:09.669
that's why I think that what frightened

01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679
that's why I think that what frightened
 

01:22:09.679 --> 01:22:11.529
that's why I think that what frightened
those elephants yesterday morning

01:22:11.529 --> 01:22:11.539
those elephants yesterday morning
 

01:22:11.539 --> 01:22:12.819
those elephants yesterday morning
remember we had that long line of

01:22:12.819 --> 01:22:12.829
remember we had that long line of
 

01:22:12.829 --> 01:22:15.520
remember we had that long line of
elephants running with the matriarch

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:15.530
elephants running with the matriarch
 

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.020
elephants running with the matriarch
standing at the back shimmying them

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:17.030
standing at the back shimmying them
 

01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:19.060
standing at the back shimmying them
along I think that they must have seen a

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:19.070
along I think that they must have seen a
 

01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:25.029
along I think that they must have seen a
predator now they've stopped look they

01:22:25.029 --> 01:22:25.039
predator now they've stopped look they
 

01:22:25.039 --> 01:22:29.410
predator now they've stopped look they
will stopped at the same time someone's

01:22:29.410 --> 01:22:29.420
will stopped at the same time someone's
 

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:30.970
will stopped at the same time someone's
told them to stop somebody said hang on

01:22:30.970 --> 01:22:30.980
told them to stop somebody said hang on
 

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:39.800
told them to stop somebody said hang on
wait

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:39.810
 

01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:42.300
now probably all start moving as one

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:42.310
now probably all start moving as one
 

01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:49.560
now probably all start moving as one
again go all of that is being

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:49.570
again go all of that is being
 

01:22:49.570 --> 01:22:50.729
again go all of that is being
communicated

01:22:50.729 --> 01:22:50.739
communicated
 

01:22:50.739 --> 01:22:57.500
communicated
most likely with infrasound

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:57.510
 

01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:59.960
brings up two questions here the first

01:22:59.960 --> 01:22:59.970
brings up two questions here the first
 

01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:03.530
brings up two questions here the first
one is why is it that they should be

01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:03.540
one is why is it that they should be
 

01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:06.590
one is why is it that they should be
afraid of these lions there is no real

01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600
afraid of these lions there is no real
 

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.480
afraid of these lions there is no real
reason for them to be afraid yes they

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:08.490
reason for them to be afraid yes they
 

01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:09.650
reason for them to be afraid yes they
are trying to protect their youngsters

01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:09.660
are trying to protect their youngsters
 

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:13.310
are trying to protect their youngsters
and in theory I suppose three lionesses

01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320
and in theory I suppose three lionesses
 

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.900
and in theory I suppose three lionesses
they don't know how many lionesses there

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:14.910
they don't know how many lionesses there
 

01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:16.850
they don't know how many lionesses there
are here could take down a very small

01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:16.860
are here could take down a very small
 

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:19.310
are here could take down a very small
one but they should know by now that

01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320
one but they should know by now that
 

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.870
one but they should know by now that
they're not going to try and take down a

small one in amongst a group big group
of adults and it must have something to

01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920
of adults and it must have something to
 

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:32.600
of adults and it must have something to
do with their ancient past there's

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:32.610
do with their ancient past there's
 

01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:35.000
do with their ancient past there's
something in their biology or something

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:35.010
something in their biology or something
 

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:38.360
something in their biology or something
in prehistory that has made them this

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:38.370
in prehistory that has made them this
 

01:23:38.370 --> 01:23:40.640
in prehistory that has made them this
reactive to predators and I can only

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:40.650
reactive to predators and I can only
 

01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:43.720
reactive to predators and I can only
think it must have been an experience or

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:43.730
think it must have been an experience or
 

01:23:43.730 --> 01:23:47.180

you know a millennia of experience with
 

01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:49.010
you know a millennia of experience with
big saber-toothed cats much bigger

01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:49.020
big saber-toothed cats much bigger
 

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:51.080
big saber-toothed cats much bigger
predators than in these lions who posed

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:51.090
predators than in these lions who posed
 

01:23:51.090 --> 01:23:54.290
predators than in these lions who posed
a genuine threat to elephants and their

01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:54.300
a genuine threat to elephants and their
 

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.210
a genuine threat to elephants and their
babies who were able to spook the herd

babies who were able to spook the herd
 

01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:03.090
babies who were able to spook the herd
make them run and then take one up

01:24:03.090 --> 01:24:03.100
 

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.980
because they reacted much as I might

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:04.990
because they reacted much as I might
 

01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:06.810

more towards the chitwa chitwa to go and
 

01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:25.770
more towards the chitwa chitwa to go and
see if we cannot find any of the

01:25:25.770 --> 01:25:25.780
see if we cannot find any of the
 

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:33.299
see if we cannot find any of the
interesting animals that side so there's

just elephant tracks every way so those

01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:36.099
just elephant tracks every way so those
 

01:25:36.099 --> 01:25:37.049
just elephant tracks every way so those
are the tracks

01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:37.059
are the tracks

are the tracks
I have seen here see I okay our game

01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:40.780
I have seen here see I okay our game

our editing the much more towards the

01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679
our editing the much more towards the
 

01:25:44.679 --> 01:25:46.770
our editing the much more towards the
very same direction maybe we might be

01:25:46.770 --> 01:25:46.780
very same direction maybe we might be
 

01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:49.199
very same direction maybe we might be
lucky much smaller side and see the

01:25:49.199 --> 01:25:49.209
lucky much smaller side and see the
 

01:25:49.209 --> 01:25:59.339
lucky much smaller side and see the
biggest animal

01:25:59.339 --> 01:25:59.349
 

01:25:59.349 --> 01:26:03.040
so this area here we are this is the

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:03.050
so this area here we are this is the
 

01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:11.620
so this area here we are this is the
fire break is the area we saw they

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:11.630
fire break is the area we saw they
 

01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:14.020
fire break is the area we saw they
attack while being in the bush I haven't

01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:14.030
attack while being in the bush I haven't
 

01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:16.089
attack while being in the bush I haven't
been attacked but I have been charged

01:26:16.089 --> 01:26:16.099
been attacked but I have been charged
 

01:26:16.099 --> 01:26:18.569
been attacked but I have been charged
I've been charged not once not twice

01:26:18.569 --> 01:26:18.579
I've been charged not once not twice
 

01:26:18.579 --> 01:26:21.729
I've been charged not once not twice
something very important about working

01:26:21.729 --> 01:26:21.739
something very important about working
 

01:26:21.739 --> 01:26:23.500
something very important about working
in the bush is that you must always

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:23.510
in the bush is that you must always
 

01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:26.709
in the bush is that you must always
expect unexpected because animals can

01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719
expect unexpected because animals can
 

01:26:26.719 --> 01:26:29.350
expect unexpected because animals can
easily hide behind the bushes and before

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360
easily hide behind the bushes and before
 

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.989
easily hide behind the bushes and before
you see them they see you so which means

01:26:31.989 --> 01:26:31.999
you see them they see you so which means
 

01:26:31.999 --> 01:26:34.509
you see them they see you so which means
I can be walking now trying to approach

01:26:34.509 --> 01:26:34.519
I can be walking now trying to approach
 

01:26:34.519 --> 01:26:36.669
I can be walking now trying to approach
an animal which is there while not

01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:36.679
an animal which is there while not
 

01:26:36.679 --> 01:26:38.259
an animal which is there while not
seeing another animal which is somewhere

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:38.269
seeing another animal which is somewhere
 

01:26:38.269 --> 01:26:40.779
seeing another animal which is somewhere
much closer so those kind of challenges

01:26:40.779 --> 01:26:40.789
much closer so those kind of challenges
 

01:26:40.789 --> 01:26:43.540
much closer so those kind of challenges
they do happen while we are doing some

01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:43.550
they do happen while we are doing some
 

01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:45.549
they do happen while we are doing some
operations here in the wild so I just

01:26:45.549 --> 01:26:45.559
operations here in the wild so I just
 

01:26:45.559 --> 01:26:47.350
operations here in the wild so I just
want to show you the area we have been

01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360
want to show you the area we have been
 

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.229
want to show you the area we have been
seeing a lot earlier by the end of last

01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239
seeing a lot earlier by the end of last
 

01:26:50.239 --> 01:26:52.659
seeing a lot earlier by the end of last
year this was the fire break the fire

01:26:52.659 --> 01:26:52.669
year this was the fire break the fire
 

01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:54.609
year this was the fire break the fire
brick which was open now look at the

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:54.619
brick which was open now look at the
 

01:26:54.619 --> 01:26:56.859
brick which was open now look at the
recovery this bush is recovering there's

01:26:56.859 --> 01:26:56.869
recovery this bush is recovering there's
 

01:26:56.869 --> 01:26:59.259
recovery this bush is recovering there's
only a little bit of a bare pages at the

01:26:59.259 --> 01:26:59.269
only a little bit of a bare pages at the
 

01:26:59.269 --> 01:27:02.259
only a little bit of a bare pages at the
moment you can see that the grasses are

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:02.269
moment you can see that the grasses are
 

01:27:02.269 --> 01:27:04.839
moment you can see that the grasses are
coming back heavily and when the grasses

01:27:04.839 --> 01:27:04.849
coming back heavily and when the grasses
 

01:27:04.849 --> 01:27:06.819
coming back heavily and when the grasses
are starting to get excited like this it

01:27:06.819 --> 01:27:06.829
are starting to get excited like this it
 

01:27:06.829 --> 01:27:09.279
are starting to get excited like this it
gives us a scone the fist a big sign

01:27:09.279 --> 01:27:09.289
gives us a scone the fist a big sign
 

01:27:09.289 --> 01:27:12.159
gives us a scone the fist a big sign
that this year possibilities of having

01:27:12.159 --> 01:27:12.169
that this year possibilities of having
 

01:27:12.169 --> 01:27:14.709
that this year possibilities of having
heavy fires in different areas are high

01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719
heavy fires in different areas are high
 

01:27:14.719 --> 01:27:17.319
heavy fires in different areas are high
because too much red grouse grasses and

01:27:17.319 --> 01:27:17.329
because too much red grouse grasses and
 

01:27:17.329 --> 01:27:20.229
because too much red grouse grasses and
too much grasses then becomes a lot of

01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239
too much grasses then becomes a lot of
 

01:27:20.239 --> 01:27:23.500
too much grasses then becomes a lot of
fuel which will then facilitate a lot of

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:23.510
fuel which will then facilitate a lot of
 

01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:27.159
fuel which will then facilitate a lot of
fires during the fire season so it's

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:27.169
fires during the fire season so it's
 

01:27:27.169 --> 01:27:29.560
fires during the fire season so it's
good to have raised but rains at the

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:29.570
good to have raised but rains at the
 

01:27:29.570 --> 01:27:31.540
good to have raised but rains at the
same time they do bring us a lot of

01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:31.550
same time they do bring us a lot of
 

01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:34.179
same time they do bring us a lot of
grasses and fires can only get excited

01:27:34.179 --> 01:27:34.189
grasses and fires can only get excited
 

01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:40.640
grasses and fires can only get excited
by the heavy fuel

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:40.650
 

01:27:40.650 --> 01:27:45.090
so it means in in order to predict the

01:27:45.090 --> 01:27:45.100
so it means in in order to predict the
 

01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:47.670
so it means in in order to predict the
amount of oil you're going to have by

01:27:47.670 --> 01:27:47.680
amount of oil you're going to have by
 

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.540

now when the rain is still growing and
 

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:52.710
now when the rain is still growing and
the recovery is happening is when you

01:27:52.710 --> 01:27:52.720
the recovery is happening is when you
 

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.340
the recovery is happening is when you
can tell
