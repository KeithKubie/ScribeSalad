the brewmaster is essentially the chef
 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.410
the brewmaster is essentially the chef
of the brewery so I'm responsible for

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
of the brewery so I'm responsible for
 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.539
of the brewery so I'm responsible for
everything that has to do with the beer

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
everything that has to do with the beer
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.970
everything that has to do with the beer
from the concept the original concept of

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
from the concept the original concept of
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.840
from the concept the original concept of
the beer to the all the raw materials

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
the beer to the all the raw materials
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.349
the beer to the all the raw materials
all of the recipes all of the procedures

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359
all of the recipes all of the procedures
 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.460
all of the recipes all of the procedures
everything that has to do with having

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
everything that has to do with having
 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.070
everything that has to do with having
the beer turn out the way that it's

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
the beer turn out the way that it's
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.589
the beer turn out the way that it's
supposed to and my job essentially ends

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
supposed to and my job essentially ends
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.970
supposed to and my job essentially ends
when your glass is empty and you

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
when your glass is empty and you
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.120
when your glass is empty and you
hopefully order another one so it really

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
hopefully order another one so it really
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160
hopefully order another one so it really
is absolutely everything and you know

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
is absolutely everything and you know
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.830
is absolutely everything and you know
designing the brewery everything to do

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
designing the brewery everything to do
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.869
designing the brewery everything to do
with the EO with equipment etc so you

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
with the EO with equipment etc so you
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.340
with the EO with equipment etc so you
can think of it as being similar to the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
can think of it as being similar to the
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.069
can think of it as being similar to the
chef who will conceive everything that

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
chef who will conceive everything that
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.380
chef who will conceive everything that
has to do with the food but also is

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
has to do with the food but also is
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.750
has to do with the food but also is
looking at things like you know does the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
looking at things like you know does the
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.400
looking at things like you know does the
equipment the kitchen run properly house

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
equipment the kitchen run properly house
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.740
equipment the kitchen run properly house
the kitchen designed running the staff

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
the kitchen designed running the staff
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.510
the kitchen designed running the staff
in the kitchen all those sorts of things

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520
in the kitchen all those sorts of things
 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.330
in the kitchen all those sorts of things
are basically what the brewmaster does

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340
 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.490
well then when you look to build a

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500
well then when you look to build a
 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.160
well then when you look to build a
brewery your buildings if you're

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170
brewery your buildings if you're
 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.530
brewery your buildings if you're
building something from the ground up

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
building something from the ground up
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.730
building something from the ground up
it's different than if you're building

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740
it's different than if you're building
 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.130
it's different than if you're building
inside of an existing building you know

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140
inside of an existing building you know
 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.650
inside of an existing building you know
like it is for building a kitchen you

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660
like it is for building a kitchen you
 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.420
like it is for building a kitchen you
have to have conditions that can be made

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430
have to have conditions that can be made
 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.650
have to have conditions that can be made
sanitary you have to have obviously you

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660
sanitary you have to have obviously you
 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.090
sanitary you have to have obviously you
know the the right amount electricity

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100
know the the right amount electricity
 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.140
know the the right amount electricity
and water and everything else and you

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150
and water and everything else and you
 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.580
and water and everything else and you
have to have enough space for people to

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590
have to have enough space for people to
 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.730
have to have enough space for people to
work in you know space obviously to put

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740
work in you know space obviously to put
 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.350
work in you know space obviously to put
you know your tank at your equipment etc

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360
you know your tank at your equipment etc
 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.740
you know your tank at your equipment etc
and if you expect to be successful you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750
and if you expect to be successful you
 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.510
and if you expect to be successful you
also have to have some space to expand

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520
also have to have some space to expand
 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.650
also have to have some space to expand
which makes it different than the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660
which makes it different than the
 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.540
which makes it different than the
kitchen because usually when someone

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550
kitchen because usually when someone
 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.609
kitchen because usually when someone
goes to to start a restaurant they don't

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619
goes to to start a restaurant they don't
 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.580
goes to to start a restaurant they don't
say well suppose we do really well we'll

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590
say well suppose we do really well we'll
 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.590
say well suppose we do really well we'll
need a bigger kitchen and we'll have to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600
need a bigger kitchen and we'll have to
 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.810
need a bigger kitchen and we'll have to
add more seats normally you're within a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820
add more seats normally you're within a
 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.999
add more seats normally you're within a
confined space you have a kitchen that

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009
confined space you have a kitchen that
 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.490
confined space you have a kitchen that
can serve say these 200 seats and that's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500
can serve say these 200 seats and that's
 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.010
can serve say these 200 seats and that's
what you have a brewery tends to be a

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020
what you have a brewery tends to be a
 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.380
what you have a brewery tends to be a
bit different most people will prefer a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390
bit different most people will prefer a
 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.210
bit different most people will prefer a
space where they can expand a bit well a

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220
space where they can expand a bit well a
 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.210
space where they can expand a bit well a
good brewer has the idea in their head

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220
good brewer has the idea in their head
 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.490
good brewer has the idea in their head
of what of everything about the beer

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500
of what of everything about the beer
 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.860
of what of everything about the beer
before they started brewing it you can

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870
before they started brewing it you can
 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.559
before they started brewing it you can
see it smell it taste it everything

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569
see it smell it taste it everything
 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.110
see it smell it taste it everything
before you get started it's not supposed

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120
before you get started it's not supposed
 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.980
before you get started it's not supposed
to be an experiment yeah it's supposed

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990
to be an experiment yeah it's supposed
 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.110
to be an experiment yeah it's supposed
to come in the other direction where you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120
to come in the other direction where you
 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.140
to come in the other direction where you
have a concept an idea you've been

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
have a concept an idea you've been
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.880
have a concept an idea you've been
inspired by these several things you

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890
inspired by these several things you
 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.940
inspired by these several things you
want to combine this with that whatever

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950
want to combine this with that whatever
 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.610
want to combine this with that whatever
it is and then you are figuring out

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620
it is and then you are figuring out
 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.370
it is and then you are figuring out
almost backwards engineering okay how do

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380
almost backwards engineering okay how do
 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.589
almost backwards engineering okay how do
i achieve this concept that i have and

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599
i achieve this concept that i have and
 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.589
i achieve this concept that i have and
that in a way is the art because you

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599
that in a way is the art because you
 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.460
that in a way is the art because you
know there is a blend of art and science

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
know there is a blend of art and science
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.400
know there is a blend of art and science
in in brewing or i should say in craft

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410
in in brewing or i should say in craft
 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.680
in in brewing or i should say in craft
brewing versus industrial brewing is

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690
brewing versus industrial brewing is
 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.920
brewing versus industrial brewing is
almost all science there is no art

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930
almost all science there is no art
 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.089
almost all science there is no art
however if you're doing craft brewing

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099
however if you're doing craft brewing
 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.580
however if you're doing craft brewing
which is brewing traditional beer for

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590
which is brewing traditional beer for
 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.430
which is brewing traditional beer for
flavor that's a whole different thing so

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440
flavor that's a whole different thing so
 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.949
flavor that's a whole different thing so
you know I have a concept first of what

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959
you know I have a concept first of what
 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.900
you know I have a concept first of what
the beer is going to be and then I work

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910
the beer is going to be and then I work
 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.420
the beer is going to be and then I work
backwards to see okay what do I need to

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430
backwards to see okay what do I need to
 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.000
backwards to see okay what do I need to
create this what ye strains what malts

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010
create this what ye strains what malts
 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.950
create this what ye strains what malts
what hop varieties you

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960
what hop varieties you
 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.840
what hop varieties you
what what temperatures at different

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850
what what temperatures at different
 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.900
what what temperatures at different
parts of the process and the thing about

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910
parts of the process and the thing about
 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.880
parts of the process and the thing about
brewing is that there is absolutely

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890
brewing is that there is absolutely
 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.440
brewing is that there is absolutely
nothing about it that doesn't count

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450
nothing about it that doesn't count
 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.560
nothing about it that doesn't count
every single last thing matters if you

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
every single last thing matters if you
 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.110
every single last thing matters if you
do the math 155 degrees you will get a

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120
do the math 155 degrees you will get a
 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.060
do the math 155 degrees you will get a
different beer than if you do it at 158

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070
different beer than if you do it at 158
 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.200
different beer than if you do it at 158
degrees so it's it's it's all the little

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210
degrees so it's it's it's all the little
 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.380
degrees so it's it's it's all the little
minutia put together into one into one

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390
minutia put together into one into one
 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.880
minutia put together into one into one
thing there there certainly are ways to

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890
thing there there certainly are ways to
 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.770
thing there there certainly are ways to
do test brewing we don't do it i I've

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780
do test brewing we don't do it i I've
 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.690
do test brewing we don't do it i I've
been brewing professionally for 18 years

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700
been brewing professionally for 18 years
 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.010
been brewing professionally for 18 years
now and if I don't have a pretty good

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020
now and if I don't have a pretty good
 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.960
now and if I don't have a pretty good
idea of how it's going to turn out by

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970
idea of how it's going to turn out by
 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.820
idea of how it's going to turn out by
now it's probably time to pack the bags

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830
now it's probably time to pack the bags
 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.700
now it's probably time to pack the bags
and go home I'm not a big believer in

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710
and go home I'm not a big believer in
 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.560
and go home I'm not a big believer in
