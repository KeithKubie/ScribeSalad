I went to look at
the oceanic diet

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.711 line:0%
people that live off the ocean.
And for this

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.414
<i> I ended up going to Borneo.</i>

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.749
<i> Borneo is split into
 three countries</i>

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:20.319
<i> Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia.
 I went to the Malaysian part.</i>

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:22.655
<i> This part here in
 Bodgaya Island.</i>

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.623 line:0%
<i> So, I went and
 met with the Bajau.</i>

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.191 line:0%
<i> About one million Bajau</i>

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:28.394 line:0%
<i> split over all these
 countries I mentioned.</i>

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.131 line:0%
<i> And they really live</i> off
<i> what they find in the ocean.</i>

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:37.237
<i> Bit of refreshment to
 get you in the mood</i> .

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:42.742
This is Tarumpit, you know,
on his way to the office.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:45.077
( audience laughter )

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.513
<i> And, so they live on
 stilt houses mostly.</i>

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.016
<i> And it's quite an
 incredible experience</i>

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.417
<i> walking into one
 of these house.</i>

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.552
<i> There's the lapping, you
 know, sound of the water.</i>

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.422
<i> People sometime fish straight
 through the planks like this.</i>

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.191
<i> There's water
 right below</i> .

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:00.126
But the real hardcore Bajau.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:02.328
They are called the "Bajau
laut", from the ocean.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.330
<i> They live in boats,
 handmade boats called lepa.</i>

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.965
<i> Lepa-lepa or lepa.</i>

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.534
<i> And this is their life. This
 is where they give birth,</i>

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.636
<i> this is where they cook,</i>

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:10.803
<i> this is where they
 do everything.</i>

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.238
<i> This is it.</i>

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.739
<i> They live inside there,
 they sleep in there,</i>

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.541
<i> they spend all their
 life in this.</i>

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.577
<i> Moving around, yeah,
 semi-nomadic, kind of.</i>

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:20.012
They go around
islands finding spot

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.148
where they hunt, they
fish, they gather food.

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:25.918
<i> And they cook in the back of
 the boat in this metal thing.</i>

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.921
Fire straight on the boat,
I wouldn't do that.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.889
But you know, it works.

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:33.025
<i> They sometime cut
 out seaweed in small pieces</i>

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.060
<i> boil it in salty
 water and eat it.</i>

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:36.496
<i> There is a lot of
 collagen in it.</i>

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:37.864
<i> It's really good for
 skin apparently.</i>

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.634
<i> And then when the tide gets
 low in the full moon period</i>

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.337
<i> they go and gather
 seashells etcetera.</i>

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:47.206
<i> They even find these
 little guys here.</i>

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.375
<i> Urchins. They collect
 a lot of urchins</i> .

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.510
<i> And eat the roe inside.</i>

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:53.479
<i> I love these kind of stories,
 of this kind of destination</i>

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:55.648
nothing can be pre-arranged.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.417
There's no way to reach
out to these people,

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.752
you just have to be lucky.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.254
<i> And so you are on the
lookout all the time for stuff.</i>

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.958
<i> And so I am going around
 in the boat in the morning</i>

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.325
<i> and we see this guy.</i>

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.493
<i> Let me show you
 what he is doing.</i>

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:09.862
<i> With his hand he is going
 forward like this.</i>

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.531
<i> He's got one foot out
 with just one fin.</i>

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:14.900
<i> And he's scanning the bottom
 of the ocean looking for food.</i>

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:18.003
<i> And then soon enough
 he got an octopus.</i>

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.939
And then you know, later
on, he got stingrays and

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.707
a lot of effort is
put into that again

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:23.509
four-five-six
hours at sea

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:24.978
trying to get some
food to bring back.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.846
There's a connection
between the body

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.248
and the food that feeds
it and fed the body.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.783
<i> And here again
 you see that.</i>

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.719
<i> You see the octopus
 is clinging onto him</i>

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.188
<i> and he's got that close
 to him like that.</i>

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:36.389
I was trying this was<i> ...</i>

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:38.224
one thing I kept in
mind on that story.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.759
To really get that connection,
that intimacy with food.

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:42.628
Food is something you eat
that gets in your body

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.697
that makes you live, I
mean it's just incredibly

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:46.699
powerful thing when
you think about it.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.135
<i> So, I meet with
 the brother from</i>

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.736
<i> the guy that was
 hunting with...</i>

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.338
<i> Put on his skinny jeans and
 he's just so at ease in there.</i>

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:54.640
- ( audience laughter )
<i> - It's just amazing.</i>

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:59.279
<i> And he got this little fish,
 this little bat fish there.</i>

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.927
( speaking in Malay )

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:35.114
( speaking in Malay )
