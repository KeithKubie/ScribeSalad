00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:10.680
Amit is asking a question.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.000
After or
when having the idea in my mind, what

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.620
is the best practice tool to apply the
idea, and implement it, and execute it?

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.410
Do you just start a company right away?

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.060
Do you ask your parents?

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.875
&gt;&gt; No, when we did,
don't ask your parents.

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:26.680
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Your parents are always going to

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.430
validate you.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.550
That's a great idea.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.717
Never ask your parents if
it's a good idea or not.

00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:31.560
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Ask your spouse.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.509
&gt;&gt; You have great parents.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.630
&gt;&gt; Ask your spouse.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.640
I have great parents,
but don't ask them.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.280
Because they're always going to say,
that's wonderful honey, it's great.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.500
They love you unconditionally,
whether it's a good idea or

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.720
a bad idea,
they're going to say it's great.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.080
&gt;&gt; You're saying a spouse
is the opposite.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.340
&gt;&gt; Spouse is the opposite.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.977
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; They should be,

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:45.869
they should be truthful.

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:47.940
That's what you want
is the great partner.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.865
So now it's start with the idea,
and in Nest,

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:54.990
it took almost a whole year
before we started the company.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.068
The way that it first started was,

00:00:57.068 --> 00:01:01.308
how might I think I could solve
this problem technically.

00:01:01.308 --> 00:01:05.160
So is it, do I have enough the pieces,
do I know enough of the things.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.160
And I said, yeah I know that.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Because I had enough

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.830
experience of that.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.480
So you first had to research enough
about what you think would be built in.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.150
Then after that,
you start researching the market.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.910
So you have to remember when
you're disrupting an industry.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.770
And if you have something
dramatically different,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.360
if you have disruptive technology,
then you can change a stagnated market.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.870
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.010
&gt;&gt; The way that I've seen it is that,
you have to start with the idea,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.950
what are you changing, and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.010
you have to take bold steps in terms
of making something and trying it.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.400
Now you have to test.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.710
Lots of testing.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.380
So, you would make something and
then you would go to a,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.920
some of the industry leaders, or
some of the people you really trust.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.916
Who are knowledgable about a given area.

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:51.041
And, you'd say what do you think,
what do you think?

00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:54.736
And, then you would start to set
your risk level based on how big

00:01:54.736 --> 00:01:56.070
the market is.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.720
I think the way the world changes,
is not by people being safe, but

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.690
by challenging expectations.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.710
Challenging the conventional wisdom.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.202
And if you want to change the world, you
need to get out the area of safeness.

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:17.149
