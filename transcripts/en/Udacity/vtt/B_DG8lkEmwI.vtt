00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is it's relying on the third property

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that decrypting with the private key is the inverse of encrypting with the public key.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The second property turns out to be one that's also very useful

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's not necessary for this use of asymmetric cryptosystems,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but it is necessary for other uses.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Many asymmetric cryptosystems, including RSA

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
also provide this property.
