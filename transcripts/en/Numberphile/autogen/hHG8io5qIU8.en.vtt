00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 align:start position:0%

and<00:00:40.980><c> twenty</c><00:00:41.219><c> grams</c><00:00:41.510><c> okay</c><00:00:42.510><c> and</c><00:00:42.719><c> then</c><00:00:42.840><c> your</c>

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 align:start position:0%
and twenty grams okay and then your
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.830 align:start position:0%
and twenty grams okay and then your
other<00:00:43.079><c> hand</c><00:00:43.350><c> you</c><00:00:43.530><c> have</c><00:00:43.950><c> a</c><00:00:44.340><c> hundred</c><00:00:44.730><c> grams</c><00:00:44.910><c> okay</c>

other hand you have a hundred grams okay
okay<00:00:46.289><c> now</c><00:00:46.590><c> I'm</c><00:00:47.039><c> gonna</c><00:00:47.190><c> make</c><00:00:47.340><c> it</c><00:00:47.460><c> slightly</c>

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay now I'm gonna make it slightly
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.490 align:start position:0%
okay now I'm gonna make it slightly
harder<00:00:48.300><c> you</c><00:00:48.899><c> could</c><00:00:49.170><c> tell</c><00:00:49.379><c> the</c><00:00:49.469><c> difference</c>

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
harder you could tell the difference
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500 align:start position:0%
harder you could tell the difference
between<00:00:50.390><c> 120</c><00:00:51.390><c> and</c><00:00:51.600><c> 100</c><00:00:52.379><c> so</c><00:00:52.530><c> you</c><00:00:52.920><c> can</c><00:00:53.160><c> sense</c><00:00:53.510><c> 20</c>

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 align:start position:0%
between 120 and 100 so you can sense 20
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.890 align:start position:0%
between 120 and 100 so you can sense 20
gram<00:00:54.719><c> difference</c><00:00:55.110><c> then</c>

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 align:start position:0%
gram difference then
 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.460 align:start position:0%
gram difference then

is<00:01:04.280><c> what</c><00:01:04.489><c> you're</c><00:01:04.640><c> shooting</c><00:01:04.820><c> vaguely</c><00:01:05.390><c> usable</c>

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 align:start position:0%
is what you're shooting vaguely usable
 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
is what you're shooting vaguely usable
type<00:01:06.170><c> thing</c><00:01:09.190><c> okay</c><00:01:10.190><c> and</c><00:01:10.940><c> now</c><00:01:11.630><c> okay</c><00:01:12.050><c> now</c><00:01:12.230><c> I</c><00:01:14.170><c> feel</c>

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 align:start position:0%
type thing okay and now okay now I feel
 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.940 align:start position:0%
type thing okay and now okay now I feel
like<00:01:15.260><c> that's</c><00:01:15.470><c> heavier</c><00:01:16.000><c> incorrect</c><00:01:17.470><c> so</c><00:01:18.470><c> that</c><00:01:18.770><c> is</c>

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 align:start position:0%
like that's heavier incorrect so that is
 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.140 align:start position:0%
like that's heavier incorrect so that is
200<00:01:19.640><c> grams</c><00:01:19.910><c> and</c><00:01:20.320><c> 220</c><00:01:21.320><c> and</c><00:01:21.680><c> you</c><00:01:22.520><c> can't</c><00:01:22.790><c> tell</c><00:01:23.030><c> the</c>

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 align:start position:0%
200 grams and 220 and you can't tell the
 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.660 align:start position:0%
200 grams and 220 and you can't tell the
difference<00:01:23.180><c> and</c><00:01:23.930><c> there</c><00:01:24.620><c> is</c><00:01:24.740><c> a</c><00:01:24.770><c> reason</c><00:01:25.160><c> for</c>

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 align:start position:0%
difference and there is a reason for
 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
difference and there is a reason for
that<00:01:25.970><c> okay</c><00:01:26.750><c> okay</c><00:01:27.410><c> so</c><00:01:27.560><c> what</c><00:01:27.830><c> was</c><00:01:27.920><c> going</c><00:01:28.160><c> on</c>

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 align:start position:0%
that okay okay so what was going on
 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
that okay okay so what was going on
there<00:01:28.460><c> is</c><00:01:28.670><c> something</c><00:01:29.420><c> that</c><00:01:30.200><c> Ernest</c><00:01:31.040><c> Weber</c>

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 align:start position:0%
there is something that Ernest Weber
 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.330 align:start position:0%
there is something that Ernest Weber

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.449 align:start position:0%

so<00:03:21.600><c> this</c><00:03:21.750><c> here</c><00:03:21.959><c> is</c><00:03:21.989><c> Weber's</c><00:03:22.500><c> law</c><00:03:22.650><c> but</c><00:03:23.160><c> what</c><00:03:23.340><c> it</c>

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 align:start position:0%
so this here is Weber's law but what it
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.970 align:start position:0%
so this here is Weber's law but what it
means<00:03:23.730><c> is</c><00:03:24.239><c> that</c><00:03:24.300><c> the</c><00:03:25.050><c> way</c><00:03:25.140><c> that</c><00:03:25.170><c> we</c><00:03:25.410><c> experience</c>

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
means is that the way that we experience
 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.690 align:start position:0%
means is that the way that we experience
things<00:03:26.220><c> in</c><00:03:26.700><c> in</c><00:03:27.510><c> life</c><00:03:27.840><c> actually</c><00:03:28.650><c> follows</c><00:03:29.400><c> a</c>

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
things in in life actually follows a
 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.420 align:start position:0%
things in in life actually follows a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 align:start position:0%
logarithm so if you think about how
 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.130 align:start position:0%
logarithm so if you think about how
something<00:03:32.760><c> feels</c><00:03:33.180><c> your</c><00:03:33.570><c> response</c><00:03:33.959><c> to</c>

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
something feels your response to

you're<00:03:38.459><c> feeling</c><00:03:38.489><c> so</c><00:03:38.850><c> this</c><00:03:38.970><c> could</c><00:03:39.120><c> be</c><00:03:39.150><c> light</c>

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
you're feeling so this could be light
 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.420 align:start position:0%
you're feeling so this could be light
can<00:03:39.810><c> be</c><00:03:39.900><c> sound</c><00:03:40.140><c> it</c><00:03:40.290><c> could</c><00:03:40.380><c> be</c><00:03:40.470><c> weights</c><00:03:40.739><c> the</c><00:03:41.220><c> way</c>

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 align:start position:0%
can be sound it could be weights the way
 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.820 align:start position:0%
can be sound it could be weights the way
that<00:03:41.730><c> this</c><00:03:41.880><c> changes</c><00:03:42.480><c> it</c><00:03:42.870><c> takes</c><00:03:43.230><c> sort</c><00:03:43.470><c> of</c><00:03:43.560><c> this</c>

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 align:start position:0%
that this changes it takes sort of this
 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.430 align:start position:0%
that this changes it takes sort of this
shape<00:03:44.459><c> here</c><00:03:44.850><c> it's</c><00:03:45.660><c> kind</c><00:03:45.870><c> of</c><00:03:45.900><c> a</c><00:03:46.019><c> logarithmic</c>

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
shape here it's kind of a logarithmic
 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.830 align:start position:0%
shape here it's kind of a logarithmic
shape<00:03:46.830><c> so</c><00:03:47.670><c> what</c><00:03:47.819><c> that</c><00:03:47.910><c> means</c><00:03:48.090><c> is</c><00:03:48.239><c> if</c><00:03:48.450><c> you</c><00:03:48.569><c> start</c>

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
shape so what that means is if you start
 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.470 align:start position:0%
shape so what that means is if you start
off<00:03:49.080><c> down</c><00:03:49.319><c> here</c><00:03:49.400><c> and</c><00:03:50.400><c> you're</c><00:03:50.550><c> a</c><00:03:50.580><c> very</c><00:03:50.819><c> low</c>

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
off down here and you're a very low
 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.809 align:start position:0%
off down here and you're a very low
weight<00:03:51.810><c> okay</c><00:03:52.500><c> and</c><00:03:52.890><c> then</c><00:03:53.190><c> you</c><00:03:53.280><c> take</c><00:03:53.489><c> a</c><00:03:53.519><c> really</c>

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
weight okay and then you take a really
 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.699 align:start position:0%
weight okay and then you take a really
tiny<00:03:54.150><c> change</c><00:03:54.600><c> in</c><00:03:54.750><c> the</c><00:03:54.840><c> weight</c><00:03:54.989><c> so</c><00:03:55.200><c> this</c><00:03:55.350><c> 20</c>

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 align:start position:0%
tiny change in the weight so this 20
 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.309 align:start position:0%
tiny change in the weight so this 20
gram<00:03:55.920><c> change</c><00:03:56.489><c> so</c><00:03:57.330><c> this</c><00:03:57.450><c> is</c><00:03:57.540><c> gonna</c><00:03:57.660><c> be</c><00:03:57.810><c> I</c><00:03:57.989><c> this</c>

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
gram change so this is gonna be I this
 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.850 align:start position:0%
gram change so this is gonna be I this
would<00:03:58.440><c> be</c><00:03:58.530><c> I</c><00:03:58.739><c> plus</c><00:03:59.330><c> Delta</c><00:04:00.330><c> I</c><00:04:00.360><c> the</c><00:04:01.350><c> difference</c>

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
would be I plus Delta I the difference
 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.000 align:start position:0%

how<00:04:02.430><c> that</c><00:04:02.640><c> feels</c><00:04:03.000><c> is</c><00:04:03.959><c> gonna</c><00:04:04.140><c> be</c><00:04:04.260><c> quite</c><00:04:04.500><c> big</c><00:04:04.739><c> but</c>

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 align:start position:0%
how that feels is gonna be quite big but

how that feels is gonna be quite big but
then<00:04:05.610><c> if</c><00:04:05.730><c> you're</c><00:04:05.850><c> over</c><00:04:06.150><c> here</c><00:04:06.329><c> so</c><00:04:06.750><c> now</c><00:04:06.900><c> this</c><00:04:07.230><c> one</c>
