00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Hello my friends we're back in the lab today and we are here for this experiment because of Nishit Dua

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.200
who posted a comment asking what would happen if we added food coloring to liquid nitrogen

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.320
would it actually color the liquid or would the pigment just freeze?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.980
and this is a comment thats been gaining quite a bit of popularity in the comments lately and thats why we are doing it today.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.060
So here's the setup we've got guys, I've got a Styrofoam cup filled with liquid nitrogen

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.620
you can see that's getting frosty, and I've got a fairly dirty drinking glass.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.920
and this experiment really is as simple as it sounds

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.400
we're going to pour liquid nitrogen into the glass, squirt in some food coloring and observe what happens.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.260
This is the glass we used from the firecracker, you can tell from the battle wounds right there

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.200
its like spewing off like fireworks look at the top here can you see that?

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.680
oh I can hear the glass cracking

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.880
right here

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.800
It's cracking right there but I think we're still going to get it to work.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.520
Now I went down to the grocery store and picked up a variety of food colorings

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.460
I got the regular kind and I also got the neon kind which theoretically should fluoresce under UV light.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.920
Now you already know that  if we squirt food coloring into a glass of water the food coloring mixes with the water disperses and makes a very spectacular show

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.440
and from that point it's very very difficult to get the color out of the liquid.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.240
it is possible, but very tricky.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.080
So here we are guys we've got our liquid nitrogen successfully transferred into our cup

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.260
The cup has had a chance to cool down, and it has cracked but it looks like its holding together.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.860
So we're gonna go ahead and try the experiment anyway.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.140
and I think I'm going to use red because its a little bit more stark contrast and should show up a little more visibly.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.800
So here's your chance to make your prediction down in the comments below

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.440
when I squirt the red food coloring into the liquid nitrogen will the nitrogen change color or will the food coloring just freeze

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.560
You've got five seconds to leave your comment and then we begin.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.440
Rather than just dripping it in, I think I'm going to start off with a large squirt. Here we go.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.460
Oh and it still comes out in little beads.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.540
okay lets quickly stir that around. Stir it, stir it, stir it.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.100
and what is happening? It's stuck to my popsicle stick.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.460
It actually looks like a popsicle. and what we've got here are little beads of food coloring dye.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.700
They've cooled down completely. Interesting.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.640
Our glass is still holding up, that's a good sign.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.500
Alright so maybe I need to start stirring it up faster because even with only a second the food coloring froze solid

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.820
and you can see that nitrogen hasn't changed color at all, so I'm going to do another big squirt and this time we'll do it as I'm stirring

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.600
Here we go, in 3,2,1

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.800
Oooh a cloud of mysterious smoke, can't see anything

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.500
just gonna put tons, we're gonna put it all in there.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.880
and would you look at that.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.400
everything's settling down now and even stirring as quickly as I could we've just made giant frozen globs of food coloring.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.960
The nitrogen itself hasn't changed color at all, it still looks like crystal clear water, very very cold water

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.800
now we have cryogenic food coloring

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.040
Okay so even with stirring the nitrogen as quickly as I could and dumping an entire bottle of red food coloring in it, we still were not able to color liquid nitrogen.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.260
All that really happened was I think the food coloring was sucked into the middle and froze to itself and now we've got giant red globs of cryogenic coloring.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.060
interesting

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.740
My thermos is creaking

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.580
So we can already see here that the nitrogen is not going to be affected by the food coloring

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.440
So were you right? if you were give yourself a pat on the back.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.340
In the meantime I'm going to grab three more of these containers of food coloring and dump them all at once.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.160
Here comes the big squirt in 3,2,1

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.960
Aww nice

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.620
Get em all get em all

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.680
its like milking a cow

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.920
so we can get that top one

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.540
Moooo

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.220
Alright greens down, yellows next, there goes yellow

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.460
Blue

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.280
Lets see what kind of colorful mess we've got here.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.120
Almost out of nitrogen

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.200
So thats crazy,  the food coloring was actually so hot compared to the liquid nitrogen that it boiled off most of the nitrogen

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.120
and now we're just left with this really crazy looking glob that kinda looks like melted wax crayons that just congealed together

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.000
very cold and very crispy even a little bit shiny look at that.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.020
That right there is frozen food coloring if you ever wanted to know.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.140
It's very interesting

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.120
It all kind of globed together then froze, didn't it?

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.980
Wonder if I tap that if I can break it.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.240
Oh yep there it goes.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.880
Inside, we've got different layers of colours...

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.340
And little caves. Looks like there are air bubbles or air pockets inside there.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.900
You know that would be really cool?

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.200
If we filled up a glass with really really hot water and dumped this all in at once.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.300
Let's try that next.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.300
So here we are guys, nice big, hot glass of water,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.200
big chunk of frozen food colouring. Let's make the drop.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.300
Look how fast it sinks! Like, the colour drops to the bottom of the glass.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.520
And it started off individual colours. I saw red, green, a little bit of yellow, some blue in there.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.300
And then it just dropped. And now the whole thing has turned black.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.600
Look at that. Looks like we've still got a big chunk of food colouring.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.480
It's kind of "globbier" on the sides. Although now its exposed to the air and its re-freezing.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.140
But it looks like there's some air bubbles in there

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.560
preventing that from sinking, so it just floats on the top.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.780
Oh, and look in here! We've got little food colouring Dippin' Dots.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.380
An assortment of colors. Look at how quickly they frost over.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.300
Now you can't tell what colour they are.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.960
Let's go for a little dip.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.920
In and out.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.660
Very cool.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.300
Now just for fun and because we're feeling a little bit crazy, I'm going to take the rest of this

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.740
food colouring and nitrogen, and pour it into the glass.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.320
It's gonna be messy... So gonna do it kinda slowly here.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.320
That's cool.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.760
Gotta love liquid nitrogen, man.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.080
Oh, look at that on top! Looks beautiful. It almost looks drinkable.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.040
Like candy.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.220
That liquid is looking really syrupy right now.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.740
What would happen if we put our glass in there? You think we could thermally shock it?

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.260
Oh, it's gonna spill over...

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.840
Huh, it didn't crack. That's surprising.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.980
It just kinda coloured the edges a little bit.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.180
That's a little disappointing.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.180
We're gonna make it crack!

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.220
The King of Random freezie hoard.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.060
So guys, I think we successfully answered the question: What does food colouring do when you drop it in liquid

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.440
nitrogen? Does it colour the nitrogen? Or does it freeze solid? You now know the answer!

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.820
And a big thanks to Nishit Dua for posting this suggestion down in the comments.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.800
Nishit, you can go check your YouTube inbox: I'm sending you twenty-five bucks.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.800
Well that is it for this experiment, guys. I think our work here is done.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.560
Thanks for joining me for this video, and I'll be looking for you in the next one. Talk to you then.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.220
Gotta pick up all these little pieces before they melt and stain my workbench.
