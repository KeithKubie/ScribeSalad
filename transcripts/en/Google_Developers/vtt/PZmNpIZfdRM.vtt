00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.310
MALE SPEAKER 1: At that point
I will get out of the way

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.891
and let the talent
get on the stage.

00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:37.640
ED PARSONS: The map
is, perhaps, something

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.560
that is going to be
a service that you

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.110
use on an almost daily basis.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.104
ENOCH LAU: Keys are how you
identify your app to Google.

ED BOILING: A number of our
Code the Road attendees stay

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.819
on this afternoon
for a code lab.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.180
And they've all gone away
with their own working Android

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.285
application.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:10.940
MALE SPEAKER 2: Can everybody
get access to this file?

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.839
Put your hand up,
and one of me and Ed

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:13.880
will come along and help.

00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:22.580
MALE SPEAKER 3: I could
easily build an app.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.492
It was surprisingly easy.

00:01:26.492 --> 00:01:27.950
FEMALE SPEAKER 1:
I love the event.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.244
I think it's very down-to-earth.

00:01:31.244 --> 00:01:33.410
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I like
to come here to the campus.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.450
It fees like a second
home for entrepreneurs.
