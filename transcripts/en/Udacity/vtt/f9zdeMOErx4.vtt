00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.080
As a quick review what are some solutions

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.730
to the TCP incast problem? Having senders send smaller

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.210
packets. Using finer granularity TCP timeout timers. Having the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.360
clients send fewer ackowledgements or having fewer TCP senders?
