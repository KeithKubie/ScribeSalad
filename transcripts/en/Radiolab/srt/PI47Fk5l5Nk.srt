1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,020
I think,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,110
I think there's a lot of moments in
your life that you find yourself doing

3
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:09,370
something. Okay? There's anybody
in here. My name is Brittany.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,220
I'd love to be able to talk with you

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,420
and you take that moment
and step back from it.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,523
Are you here

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,550
and you realize come through to
us. What the fuck am I doing?

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,910
What just happened? Was this real? I
think that was one of those moments. Hey,

9
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:32,720
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich,
Radiolab and today on the podcast.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,133
Okay,

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,640
a ghost story. Really. We're going to
do a ghost story at Halloween, Dude.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,400
Well, you don't even know what, we're
just listen. All right, let's listen.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,410
Okay. Okay. This one comes from
our producer Matt Kielty yet.

14
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:52,080
So I first heard the story from a buddy
of mine. Do, do, do, do, do who do?

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,880
His name is Dennis Conroe. Dennis. Andy.
Hey, what's up dude? That's producer,

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,150
Ania Mills. You guys are all buddies.
[inaudible] total buds. Anyways,

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,970
the story. All right, well, Dennis,
yes, it's about a lot of things,

18
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:07,320
but in particular our house. So
let's, let's start with the house.

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,760
When did you move back in? Uh, well,
let's see. I was probably, I don't know,

20
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:15,600
age 20. Dennis had been going to
college. Yep. By the way, what did you,

21
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:19,430
what did you study? Uh, creative
writing. Okay. But, uh, yeah,

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,330
like just cut and just kinda got bored
there. Kinda stopped going to class.

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,890
I think once white
parents realize that, uh,

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,690
they weren't very happy and I would
assume so. And so, uh, so yeah,

25
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,760
I was kind of uh, asked to come back home,

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,620
back to a town just outside Kansas
City, a little town called Grandview.

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,710
Did you grow up in this house? I did. I
did. And the house was fairly old. Yeah,

28
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,500
it was about 105 years old at
the time. Two Story White House.

29
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,610
Nice little porch awning over it.
Typical Farmhouse Style and see you,

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,420
you were at your parents' home in
your, in your old bedroom. Yup.

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,770
And my old childhood bedroom. Yeah.
So there was always a sense of like,

32
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:06,771
I need to get out of this house that's
holding me back somehow from things.

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,113
So we got a job,

34
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,450
worked a job and got laid off and one
year turned into two and then three,

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,580
then four, and then five. It was not, not
a great time to be there. In what way?

36
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,700
Just that I felt like I was still 16
he says he'd overhear his mom telling

37
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:30,690
people on the phone. Oh, well yeah,
he's never gonna move out. Is He?

38
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,670
And then she started circling
classifieds, jobs for typists,

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,260
creating press sales rep type setter. I
Dunno. I think everything in my whole,

40
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,573
my life,

41
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,790
however I mean for it not to sort
of moves at my own snail's pace

42
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,680
eventually. Well it was fairly old,
like 27 maybe. Actually he was,

43
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,580
he was 28 after eight years in this
house, Dennis gets a steady job,

44
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,820
finds this cheap apartment,
this ratty six plex apartment,

45
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,380
packing up his things. But right when he
said to move out to finally leave home,

46
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,280
my mom got really sick. Dennis,

47
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,920
his mom had been remission from
breast cancer for like nine years,

48
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:16,921
but that summer her doctors told her that
it had returned and had spread quite a

49
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:22,270
bit. So I said to her
like, uh, you know, do you,

50
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,310
do you want me to be here or do you
want me to go? And she was like,

51
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,750
well, you know, if this is my time, uh,

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,520
she wants to go knowing that her
kids can take care of themselves.

53
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,970
So Dennis moved out about five
months later. His mom died.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,350
Yeah, she went pretty fast.

55
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,190
About about a month or
so after my mom died,

56
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:50,191
my dad found out he had stage
four prostate cancer and
he was really too sick to

57
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:53,830
take care of the house and just being
the guy by himself at that point.

58
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,610
Now Dennis pretty much had to come
home. I'd take care of him three,

59
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:02,560
four times a week. And as he got
worse, he had said to me like,

60
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:02,920
Hey,

61
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,610
let's try to find you a house to buy so
that I can teach you how to like do all

62
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,570
of the kind of stuff that
one has to do. You know,

63
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:14,470
that men know how to do things like change
out plumbing, all this kind of stuff.

64
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,810
And so we put an offer on a house,

65
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,470
but that fell through and before
they could find something else,

66
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,440
the cancer from his prostate spread
to his brain. And uh, you know,

67
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,430
the last week of his life,
he was really not there.

68
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:31,610
Hmm.

69
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,810
I can remember one day. Yeah. Like maybe,

70
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,670
maybe a week or so after he had died,

71
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,500
Dennis was walking through the empty
kitchen and uh, there was so much stuff,

72
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,290
there was so much stuff,
papers all over the place,

73
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,800
junk mail all over the kitchen
floor, down in the basement,

74
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:53,450
tools all over the place. You
know, I had this moment of yeah,

75
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,030
here are his tools and I add,

76
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,180
now I have them in my hands and you know,

77
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:04,181
I just remember picking up this claw
hammer and just crying because this is now

78
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,090
my hammer. This is now my house.

79
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,580
This is now my problem.

80
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,310
But few days pass and you start
thinking, okay, I can handle this. Yeah,

81
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,100
just gotta get in there, clean
it out, sell it clean and flip.

82
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,240
That was the plan. So at
the age of 32 moose back in,

83
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,670
there was all this junk in the basement,

84
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,430
put that stuff on the curb
sale after sale after sale.

85
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,700
And one day he finds himself standing in
the downstairs bathroom looking at the

86
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:33,530
nasty for tile. It was just horrible.

87
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,220
His dad had meant to replace it before
he died, but you know, couldn't finish.

88
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:40,130
And my thought was like, oh,
we'll just do this one bathroom.

89
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:43,850
So it looks pretty good to
sell. Problem was steady,

90
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:45,650
never showed them how
to do any of that stuff.

91
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,680
That's that point that
I was like, oh, youtube,

92
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,170
all the tile in one hand firmly.
And then your sermon towel.

93
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,330
Never went online. Learn how
to tile, do some plumbing,

94
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,510
any redid the and turned out pretty
good. It was kind of fun. Uh,

95
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,130
and then the next thing I knew I was
taking wallpaper off of the kitchen flats.

96
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,000
Gotta go hardwood floors, insulation
in the attic, glass block,

97
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,390
windows in the basement. And pretty
soon that turned into the whole house.

98
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,090
And how long does that take? Uh,
five years. Actually it was six.

99
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,700
Wow. And he says the whole time he was
doing this renovation at night, uh,

100
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,760
I would have these dreams where, mm.

101
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,920
My parents just kind of came through
the back door and it was just like,

102
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,660
oh, what are you doing here? Oh,
that's right. You're your dad.

103
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,530
And then I would turn my back and then

104
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,280
they would have somehow undone
all of the things that I did. Oh,

105
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,890
they had brought the house back to where?

106
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,840
What state it was in when
they were alive. Yeah. Huh.

107
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,730
And I probably had this dream, I'm not
kidding, like at least a hundred times.

108
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,360
Wow. Night after night after night.

109
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,440
We just kept going on and on and
ultimately kind of drove me crazy.

110
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,440
And so one day after yet another one of
these streams, Dennis is finally like,

111
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,850
all right, I'm selling it, puts it up in
the market, starts waiting for a buyer.

112
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,000
And then something strange happens. Well,

113
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,260
something kind of strange.

114
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:22,970
I had made this friend and she
came over for the first time,

115
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,620
like a date lady friend. Yeah. It was
a lady friend. You'd got on a date,

116
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,390
you'd taken her back to your house.
And so just giving her a tour,

117
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,390
showing her all the improvements until
she was in the kitchen right by the

118
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:37,930
basement door in the kitchen
when she was like, oh,

119
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,770
there's some kind of weird presence
here. And I was just like, ah, okay.

120
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,350
Well that was kind of a sign
that it was not going to last.

121
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,920
Fast forward a few years,

122
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,070
it didn't really think too much about
it until one day dentist is really there

123
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,870
is having an open house, no one shows.

124
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,530
So she was in the house by herself and
Dennis starts getting these text messages

125
00:07:57,531 --> 00:08:01,640
from her like, dude,
your house is haunted.

126
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,730
Like I can hear people walking around.

127
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,200
And she texted that there was definitely
something weird going on right by the

128
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:13,790
basement door. Oh wait, that's the
same spot. I was like, ah, that's,

129
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,890
that's kind of weird. But then
here's the crazy thing, uh,

130
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,790
not too long after this, Dennis bumped
into an old friend of his and he's like,

131
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,130
Hey, funny thing, two different people,

132
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,270
two separate occasions had come over to
the house and they said they felt this

133
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:31,010
weird presence and she was like, wait,
right by the basement door, get out.

134
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,630
Yeah. I was like, okay. So I've got
Heather, I've got Stacy, I've got Carla,

135
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:39,260
all three who say they
feel this weird presence.

136
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,840
Would you consider yourself a bit
of a skeptic about such things?

137
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,130
I would say so. Rationally. I'm
just, I'm just going to say no.

138
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,700
So you don't believe in ghosts? No.
All right. What happened next? Well,

139
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,210
this also happened to be right at
the time that I sold the house,

140
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,920
Dennis had finally put some pen
to paper, signed a contract,

141
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,180
packed up all stuff. And so Carla,
the girl that first felt this thing,

142
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,390
the girl he went on a day with me, they
stayed friends, uh, said to me like,

143
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,730
you know, I'm really
curious about this. Uh,

144
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,760
would you mind if I call like these ghost
people to come and like check out this

145
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,260
place? I was like, well
sure. I don't care. Yeah.

146
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,680
It's like why not? I mean,

147
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:26,681
so very shortly in a few minutes
actually we are bringing paranormal

148
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:32,970
investigators to find out what's
in the basement. You know,

149
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,530
I'm just kinda walking through the house.

150
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,130
I think I got this on tape of just
me walking through the house. Like,

151
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:40,890
well yeah, this is
probably a waste of time,

152
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:45,140
but I'm still kind of curious about it
Friday night. What else you got to do?

153
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,020
Right. It's a Friday night, mid November,

154
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,070
around six o'clock I can see
some cars parking on the street.

155
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:54,060
So I go downstairs,

156
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,510
people start filing in maybe 10
people all have different specialties.

157
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,190
Larry's our tech guy bought for
techies, two sets of clairvoyants.

158
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,440
Sean tells the psychic she's very gifted.

159
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,170
Who are all these people to just say
your name. My name is Brittany. Well,

160
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,160
they're part of the Kansas City paranormal
investigators club or some kind of

161
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:14,994
thing.

162
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,330
And pretty much right off the bat when
you guys came in and you were saying like

163
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,630
you could talk to, but
when we first got here,

164
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,020
we both saw a woman
looking out the window.

165
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,320
She looked like I didn't really see
what she looked like. She had hair,

166
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,510
it was like gray and she was wearing
one of those weird old tiny dresses.

167
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,640
Dennis was like whatever.

168
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,660
They set up cameras in the basement
and in the kitchen and the clairvoyants

169
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:46,710
decided they wanted to try to talk to
this woman or maybe any other spirit in

170
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:50,100
the house. And so Brittany
even explain to you what we do,

171
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,020
who was like the ringleader of the night.

172
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,770
She sort of explained how she does
things, you know, she was like,

173
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,740
the best way that she could get them
to talk to to to them was through a

174
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,230
flashlights, Huh? Yes. So what they
do is they take a few flashlights,

175
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,453
turn them on,

176
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,490
and then they unscrew the tops of them
just enough so that they turn off and

177
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:14,850
then they just kind of set the flashlights
that are now off in the room by

178
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:15,684
themselves.

179
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,860
And the idea is that if the ghost
or the spirit wants to communicate,

180
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,880
they can just sort of touch the top of
one in the flashlights with their gusty

181
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:26,040
finger and that'll turn it back on.

182
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm just like, okay.

183
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,870
So she took three flashlights and we all
sat in this dark room in a circle and a

184
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,330
Brittany sets the flashlights in the
middle of the circle by themselves.

185
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,830
No one's touching them. And
she says, my name is Brittany.

186
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,560
I love to be able to talk with you.

187
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,250
Can you turn one of those lights on?

188
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,450
And we sit there and you
sit there, are you here?

189
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,810
Then all of a sudden this light
whoa kind of barely blinks on.

190
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,450
And then she said, okay,
thank you. Please turn it off.

191
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,260
And then it goes off. What we can do
with these lights here is if I can ask,

192
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,890
and then she says, we have three lights
here. The one you just turned on,

193
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,460
we'll call. Yes, please turn on
one more. And that will be, no,

194
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,560
you could do that for us.
That will be wonderful.

195
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,210
And then a second light comes on. No Way.

196
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,560
He likes scanning the room,

197
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,200
like looking for somebody who has like
a little switch or something. Yeah.

198
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,610
But like we didn't pay these people
so they have no reason to fake this I

199
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:51,610
suppose. But you know, I just
keep thinking, well, you know,

200
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:55,960
the counselors really close to the
train tracks and maybe maybe the train

201
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:58,690
vibrations of the train.
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

202
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,390
But

203
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,370
all of a sudden they were like,

204
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,610
can you hear that

205
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,000
footsteps? Sounds like that's okay mom.

206
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,623
Okay.

207
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,490
And they're going towards
the kitchen and I could hear

208
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,670
dishes rattling on the
countertop in the kitchen.

209
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,160
No one's in the kitchen.
No one's in the kitchen.

210
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,270
If you're in the kitchen right now,
can you turn one of these lights on?

211
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,750
And so they sit and stare
at these three flashlights

212
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,333
and then

213
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,090
I didn't miss, remember leaving the room.

214
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,343
What happened?

215
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,660
Um, well, uh, actually everyone,

216
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,150
everyone in that room, um,

217
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,360
died except for Dennis.

218
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,290
Yeah.

219
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,990
I have no idea why I even
invited you into this building.

220
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,220
They did not die. What happened to them?

221
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,660
Actually, they're fine.
It turns out that, uh,

222
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,970
there was a guy downstairs
in the basement,

223
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:26,530
one of the techies walking around pitch
black down there and he just like bangs

224
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:30,010
his head into like an air duct and the
sound just reverberated throughout the

225
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:33,070
whole house. Scared him a little bit.

226
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,540
It was very Blair witchy. Yeah. Anyhow,

227
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,520
the techies decide that they want to get
the three psychics down in the basement

228
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:46,300
by themselves. And so, you know,

229
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:48,970
these three lumen go down in
the basement by themselves.

230
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,010
We kind of hear them downstairs talking,

231
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,250
but we don't really know what's going on.

232
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,300
Was interesting. Yeah.
They come back upstairs

233
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,230
and they said, uh, the girl
was downstairs with the,

234
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,750
she was definitely down there.

235
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,380
The old woman that they first saw when
they got to the house and they said that

236
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:11,190
she was standing down in the basement
next to where the old furnace used to be.

237
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,400
And they told Dennis that she said that
she'd lived here for a long time and

238
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:18,300
Dennis was like, wait a second. He knew
that back in the thirties or something,

239
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:22,980
a woman had lived in this house
who was kind of not all there,

240
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,790
and one day she had gone down into the
basement and thought she was picking

241
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,620
Weiss off of chickens and throwing
them into this big furnace that was

242
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:33,480
downstairs in the basement at the time.

243
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,910
She got a little too close
to the furnace story, goes,

244
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,970
caught herself on fire and then
died there I guess in the basement.

245
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,573
Oh.

246
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,730
But then there was another man
downstairs. He showed himself to me,

247
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,680
but he won't talk and just completely
disappeared. What did he look like?

248
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,590
He was bald. He was about Rick
site, but it wasn't right.

249
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,100
Um, yeah,

250
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,250
a lot like that. Not a lot,
but similar. Definitely.

251
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,980
If I were to show you
a picture of my father,

252
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,340
would you have any sense of this
was him? If I saw a picture of him?

253
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,903
Yeah.

254
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,680
Dennis goes and gets his photo of his dad
that he had that was leftover from his

255
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:24,520
memorial service.

256
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,070
Yep. That's man I saw. Really? Wow.

257
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,180
That's just, just a second. Like here,
she's very hesitant at the beginning.

258
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,190
Just like, well, you know,

259
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,820
jump in here really quick and just tell
you that this was actually the first

260
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:44,480
time that Dennis had ever listened
to this tape. Really? Yeah.

261
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:48,260
And the reason is because for a long
time he didn't want to listen to it. Why?

262
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,591
Well,

263
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,400
I think part of it had to do with this
moment because this was the point where

264
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:57,401
my skepticism kind of kicked off and part
of it had to do with what happens next

265
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,310
that's coming up when we return.

delusional teams in sports history.

292
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,140
We knew that we could
beat anybody in the world.

293
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,670
I'm doing everything I should be doing
and it's still not working sucks.

294
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,250
What do you guys complain about?

295
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,560
You guys are the ones that fricking
cause this whole thing. American fiasco.

296
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,491
One teams.

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,420
This is radio lab.

301
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,630
Let's get back to Matt Kielty's ghost
story and we're pick up with our main guy,

302
00:19:16,631 --> 00:19:17,670
Dennis Conroe,

303
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,140
having just heard from the ghost hunters
that they encountered a spirit in the

304
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:27,141
basement of his home who looks
remarkably like his dead father.

305
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,340
Yeah, that's man. I saw you.
Yep. So He's here. He's here.

306
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,840
Can we, can we try to talk to him?

307
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,140
We can try to talk to him at the
basements or here or all over.

308
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,480
He went upstairs. Not
In the basement anymore.

309
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,060
Can we go upstairs and
just talk to him? Yeah.

310
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,400
So no,

311
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,510
I hadn't really told them a whole lot
about what the different rooms in the

312
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:58,080
house were, but they led me
upstairs to what was his room

313
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,820
and to the corner of the
room where his bed was.

314
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,870
And they had no idea that that
used to be, they had no idea. And

315
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,990
I said to them, okay, well if he's
going to talk, he'll just talk to me.

316
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,670
[inaudible] are you here?

317
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,760
Did you turn on a lights?
If you are. Thank you.

318
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,170
Thank you ma'am. Uh,
we're gonna call that yes.

319
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,690
If you can turn that one off
now and turn on the no light.

320
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,613
Any other light?

321
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,400
I need to know that you're here.

322
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,333
Thanks God.

323
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,090
Do you want us to leave? Um, Dad, what?

324
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:57,060
Do you like these people to
leave and just talk to me?

325
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,913
Yes. Okay.

326
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,100
Uh, Damn. I'd want to know,

327
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:18,900
are you in a good spot? Are you okay?

328
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:27,110
Are you okay? Are you okay with that?

329
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,940
Yes. All right, good.
I'm glad to hear that.

330
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,150
Okay. Everything off.

331
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,890
Think so off. Almost. Almost.

332
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,840
All right, thanks. Yep.

333
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,440
And it asks you is, you
know, is mark here too?

334
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:05,070
This mom here too and okay.

335
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,990
The other of the three
flashlights lights up, huh?

336
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,040
Yes, she is.

337
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,333
Oh,

338
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,720
she goes here and I miss you.

339
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,430
I have so many questions for you.

340
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:39,870
I can't ask them all and
just yes or no questions.

341
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,300
But I said, well,

342
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,000
have you been able to see the
things that I've done to the house?

343
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,950
And both of the lights
lit up very brightly. Yes.

344
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,210
And then, so I've lived
here for six years.

345
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,480
Three of things, you know, I said, what
do you think? Are you happy with this?

346
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,430
Are you happy with the things
I've done with the house?

347
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:04,590
And they both lit up very brightly. Yes.

348
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:12,130
And, uh, I said, are you proud of me?

349
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,800
Are you proud of what I've done?

350
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,090
It's very funny. Yes.

351
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,430
So in a few days, uh,

352
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:40,010
I would probably never stepped foot in
this house and I don't want you to like

353
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,790
stay here and feel like
you belong here to free.

354
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,110
Can you look blue? Cool. This house

355
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,573
willing to fight.

356
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,210
[inaudible] yeah.

357
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,720
I'm going to brief you guys

358
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,950
that you hadn't haunting
my dreams on this house.

359
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,910
I know it's very important
to you. Important to me.

360
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,670
This is the time we leave.

361
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,453
Okay.

362
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,633
Yeah.

363
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,790
[inaudible] so that's where it ends.

364
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,020
Yeah. Uh,

365
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,150
that's how I recall it
being exactly like that.

366
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,530
And yeah, I kind of teared up and pen.

367
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:52,890
Um,

368
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,250
and keep in mind that this was the first
time that Dennis had heard this tape

369
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:01,310
and so we played it back to him cause
we just wanted to see like how he

370
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:04,910
remembered that experience.
Yeah. I guess part of, part of,

371
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:10,030
part of my fear of listening to it was
that it would change it and that it would

372
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,160
be a different experience.

373
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:17,780
It would be a little more hokey and it
would be a little more unclear what was

374
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:21,460
happening. But, uh, listen
to it again. I, you know,

375
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,770
it was as I recalled it being [inaudible]

376
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,760
so in the end, does he believe he was
actually talking to his dead parents?

377
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,510
Well, um, no, no. Uh, I,

378
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:38,030
I ended up actually calling this guy
who explained to me how this whole

379
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:43,031
flashlight thing works and that there is
a perfectly non paranormal explanation

380
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,900
as to what's going on with the flashlight.

381
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,250
It almost feels bad manners at this
point to have a practice later.

382
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,580
But I'm very curious to hear it.
Sure. Well, what's going on is, um,

383
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,210
you turn the flashlight on. Yeah.
And when you turn the flashlight on,

384
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:58,940
the bulb gets really hot, right?

385
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,850
And then you take the top
of the flashlight and you
unscrew it just like enough

386
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:07,560
that the flashlight flickers off.
So the flashlights off and um,

387
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,730
the bulb, it got really hot.

388
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:11,370
So the inside of the flashlight also
got really hot and there's this little

389
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:15,330
piece of plastic inside the flashlight.
And when it got hot, it expanded.

390
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,900
And now as the flat sends the
flashlights off, that piece of plastic,

391
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:21,570
it starts to cool down and starts
to contract. And when it contracts,

392
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,560
it pushes these two tiny
bits of metal together.

393
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,800
These two little bits of metal come
into contact and that's your circuit.

394
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,810
So the circuit opens the light bulb,
it goes back on, then it warms again,

395
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:36,330
and then it gets hot. Yeah. And
so the little piece of plastic,

396
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:39,450
it starts to expand. It
pushes the two pieces apart.

397
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,320
People chose this flashlight because
it had that particular property. Yeah.

398
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:46,170
Do you think it's like a con or
something? No, I don't think so. No,

399
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:48,930
I don't think so. I mean, I even
talked to Dennis about this. He's like,

400
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:52,110
I think they're just trying to make sense
of, of randomness. I mean they don't,

401
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,710
I don't think they necessarily know
that this flashlight does this thing and

402
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:57,030
therefore they can manipulate people.

403
00:27:57,031 --> 00:28:00,660
Here's why I don't think it's a con
because in this case it's such a,

404
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:05,661
it's such a strange coincidence that
whenever he wants his mom and dad,

405
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:11,781
his ghostly mother and father to approve
of him and congratulate him and honor

406
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:17,580
him with a yes. I mean it's
random. He could get to know,

407
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:22,560
but he gets a yes. It's just chance.
And you told Dennis all this?

408
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,890
Yeah, I told Dennis, cause you told me
to tell Dennis [inaudible] I forced him.

409
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,900
Okay. So when you told him, what
did he say? Um, well, on one level,

410
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,920
like it, it didn't phase him. Dennis
basically said like, look, I know,

411
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,950
I know that the way that the world
works is the way the world works.

412
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,080
People don't come back from the dead.

413
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,390
People don't talk to you through
flashlights. But he also said that like,

414
00:28:51,391 --> 00:28:55,080
he's not gonna let go of that experience.

415
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,040
He wants to have it both ways. I guess.
So I guess I guess I want to have both.

416
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:03,390
Yes. This didn't happen and yes, this
absolutely happened. I understand that.

417
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,500
Yeah. Because even if you are
the world's biggest skeptic,

418
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,550
if you don't believe in ghosts,

419
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,580
like there really aren't that many ways
to talk about these sorts of things,

420
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,510
these sorts of things that we
all feel, you know, guilt for,

421
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:21,060
for the things that we've done in
our past. The loss of those who,

422
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,110
who we've loved,

423
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,130
that like ghost stories kind of seem
to stick around because they are an

424
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,010
experience. I'll be at like
a metaphorical experience,

425
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:34,011
but an experience that lets us talk about
these things that we can't adequately

426
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:38,520
talk about. Um, you know, that
feeling of, of being haunted.

427
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,320
[inaudible]

428
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,930
anticipate. Did he eventually sell
the house? Move out? Yeah. Yeah.

429
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,110
Sold the house, moved out. No more
dreams of his parents haunting in.

430
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,441
Oh,

431
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:54,441
well it's been odd in the time that I've
sold the house now I thought the dreams

432
00:29:55,681 --> 00:30:00,681
would stop and now the dreams are that
I am the one haunting the house of the

433
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:06,540
new people where I will just walk in.
Really? Yeah. And just be like, Hey,

434
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:11,280
I'm here. That, yeah. And Are you like
going around repairing things? Nope.

435
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:15,300
I'm just like being somewhat
shocked at what they've done to it.

436
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,040
