00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And even though I don't think Winston Churchill invented it,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in the course of World War II the Germans tried to associate this quote

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with him to make him less credible.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Be it as it is, the key lesson here is

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
statistics is deep and often manipulated.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
One of the tricks I'd like to teach you is to be skeptical of statistics,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of your own results, of other people's results,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and really understand how to turn raw data

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
into decisions or conclusions.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I hope that this simple example made up think.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Stay tuned when we dive into the basics of statistics,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which is probability theory, in the next number of units.
