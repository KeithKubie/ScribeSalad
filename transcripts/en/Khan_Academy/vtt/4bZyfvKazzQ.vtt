00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.190
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.070
find the area of the region
in the first quadrant

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.555
right over here that's
below the graph of y

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:11.870
is equals to square root of
x, but above the graph of y

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.990
is equal to x squared.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.835
So we're talking about this
region right over here.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:19.460
And we know what the
two endpoints are.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.750
The two endpoints are when these
two functions equal each other.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.250
So x squared is
equal to square root

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.240
of x at x is equal to 0
and at x is equal to 1.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.350
So how do we think about this?

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.270
Well, one way to do it
is just to think about,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.120
well, what's the
area between y is

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.960
equal to square root
of x and the x-axis?

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.930
So that's going to be, and
we're going from 0 to 1,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.550
so this is the area under
square root of x from 0 to 1 dx.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.300
So this is literally denoting
this entire region, right

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.440
over here, all the way up
to this boundary point.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.910
And then from that,
subtract out this region.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.680
The area underneath
y is equal to x

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.500
squared, but above the x-axis.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.610
So from that, we could
subtract from 0 to 1.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.290
That's the interval
we care about.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.140
The area under x squared dx.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.197
And this would be
completely legitimate.

00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:21.530
And you might say, hey, look,
I have the same boundaries

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.470
of integration, I have
dx right over here.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.960
Couldn't I have also written
this as the definite integral

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:40.874
from 0 to 1 dx of square
root of x minus x squared?

00:01:40.874 --> 00:01:42.790
And if you asked that,
I would say absolutely.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.410
And this is actually a different
way of conceptualizing it.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.000
Here, you're taking the area.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.050
And instead of, if
you conceptualize dx

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.000
as the width of each
of your rectangles,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.750
now the height of the
rectangle isn't just

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.270
a function between the x-axis
and the function itself.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.940
The height is the difference
between the two functions.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.442
So in this case, this would
be the width of a rectangle,

00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:06.900
and then the height would be
the difference between the two

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.810
functions.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.600
And then you would have another
rectangle right over there.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.090
All of them have width
dx, and then the height

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.900
is the difference
between the functions.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.660
And then as you take the
limit as you have super thin,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.030
as these rectangles get thinner
and thinner and thinner,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.738
and you have more and
more and more them,

00:02:22.738 --> 00:02:24.670
you are essentially
approximating the area.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.510
So this is one way of
conceptualizing it.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.010
Or just using, I guess
the tools we already

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.780
had, the area under the
curve of square root of x.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.580
Subtracting from that the area
under the curve of x squared.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.380
These are completely legitimate
ways of conceptualizing it.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.680
But now let's evaluate it.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.440
So what's the antiderivative?

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.250
We know from the second
fundamental theorem

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.710
of calculus, we can say that
this is right over here is just

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.814
going to be the antiderivative
of the square root of x.

00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:53.480
Well, square root of
x is the same thing

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.490
as x to the 1/2 power,
so we just increment it.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.330
So we say x to the 3/2 power,
and then divide by 3/2.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.010
So that's the same thing
as multiplying by 2/3.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.200
And we're going to
evaluate that from 0 to 1.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.150
And from that, we subtract the
antiderivative of x squared,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.700
is x to the third over 3.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.090
And we're going to evaluate
that from 0 to 1 as well.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.440
Now this first expression,
if we evaluated it at 1.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.860
2/3 times 1 and 3/2.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.850
That's just going to be 2/3.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.680
And then from that,
we're going to subtract

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.640
this thing evaluated
at 0, which is just 0.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.782
So we're just left with 2/3.

00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:34.990
And then we're going to
subtract this thing evaluated

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.520
at 1, minus 1/3 third.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.702
And then, also, we're going
to subtract this thing.

00:03:41.702 --> 00:03:43.160
Well, just to be
clear, we're going

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.490
to subtract this thing evaluated
at 1, and then from that,

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.520
it evaluated at 0,
which is just 0.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.484
But this whole thing simplifies
to just subtracting 1/3.

00:03:55.484 --> 00:03:56.400
And there you have it.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.190
We get our answer.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.770
2/3 minus 1/3 is equal to 1/3.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.590
So this area right over here.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.630
Whatever units we're using
is 1/3 square units of area.
