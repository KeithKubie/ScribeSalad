00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.869
&gt;&gt;Male #1: All right, welcome to another Author
at Google presentation.

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.680
We're lucky to have Rob Reid with us today.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.140
Rob is a writer and technology entrepreneur
based in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.080
Rob is the founder, CEO and chairman of Listen.com,
the online music company that developed the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.110
Rhapsody music service.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.300
Rhapsody has since been spun into an independent
company

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.650
and has over a million paying subscribers.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.970
Notably, Listen was the first online company
to secure full catalog licenses

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.100
from ALL the major labels.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.559
Rob joins us today as the author of the novel,
Year Zero.

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.039
It's a novel about aliens with a mad passion
for human music.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:56.820
However, unlike Listen.com, the aliens did
not secure licenses for the music they love,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.550
and the novel chronicles the ensuing intergalactic
copyright standoff.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.570
Rob's other writings have included a cover
story for Wired magazine,

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.810
as well as prominent features in publications,
including The Wall Street Journal,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.820
Business 2.0, and The Glider Technology Report.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.479
He's also written for countless websites,
including Ars Technica,

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.759
Wired.com and TED.com

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.140
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: Thank you kindly.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.220
[Applause]

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.170
Uh, so as mentioned today I want to talk about
two topics

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.619
that go together as naturally as peanut butter
and jelly,

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.120
vodka and caviar for you Russians, chocolate
and mayonnaise for you weirdos,[laughter]

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.690
and of course it's aliens and copyright law.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.360
And also about my book, which is about aliens
and copyright law.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.429
I want to start by showing you a quick video
that at the very last few seconds brings those

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.000
two topics together
as well as I could possibly do it for you

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.440
today at this moment.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.340
And while it does seem probably unoriginal
and even perhaps plagiaristic

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.200
to start with a video instead of speaking
one's self,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.840
in this case, maybe not because the video
is of me.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.150
It's just better edited than anything I'm
going to do right now.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.819
It's a very brief TED talk that I gave at
the most recent TED conference in Long Beach,

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.480
which incidentally feels like it's populated
entirely by Google employees at this point.[laughter]

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.930
It's a quick intro to my perspective on copyright
law

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.349
and how, at the very tail end of this video,
it relates to aliens

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.209
and here it is and I will chitter chatter
a little bit afterward.

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.219
Hopefully this will go right up.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:55.249
[video plays, whooshing noise and music starts]
[applause]

00:02:55.249 --> 00:03:01.870
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: The recent debate over copyright
laws, like SOPA in the United States

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.109
and the ACTA agreement in Europe has been
very emotional.

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.440
And I think some dispassionate quantitative
reasoning could really bring a great deal

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.740
to the debate.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.219
I therefore would like to propose that we
employ, that we enlist the cutting edge field

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.689
of copyright math whenever we approach this
subject.

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.769
For instance, just recently the Motion Picture
Association revealed that our economy

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.799
loses fifty-eight billion dollars a year to
copyright theft.

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.499
Now rather than just argue about this number,
a copyright mathematician will analyze it.

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.590
And he'll soon discover that this money could
stretch from this auditorium

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.670
all the way across Ocean Boulevard to the
Westin and then to Mars--

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.819
[laughter] if we use pennies.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:48.819
[laughter]

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.560
Now this is a powerful, some might say dangerously
powerful insight.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.450
But it's also a morally important one.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.489
Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail
value of some pirated movies that we're talking

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.379
about,
but this is actual economic losses.

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.919
This is equivalent to the entire American
corn crop failing along with all of our fruit

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.060
crops
as well as wheat, tobacco, rice, sorghum--whatever

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.750
sorghum is-- [laughter] losing sorghum [laughter].

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.650
But identifying the actual losses to the economy
is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.650
math.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.370
Now, music revenues are down about eight billion
a year since Napster first came on the scene.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.730
So that's a chunk of what we are looking for.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.840
But total movie revenue across theaters, home
videos and pay per view are up, and T.V. and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.370
satellite
and cable revenues are WAY up.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.700
Other content markets like book publishing
and radio are also up,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.440
so this small missing chunk here is puzzling.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.240
[Laughter]

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.520
Since the big content markets have grown in
line with historic norms

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.700
it's not additional growth that piracy has
prevented.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.220
Copyright math tells us that it must be foregone
growth in a market that has no historic norms.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.610
One that didn't exist in the '90's.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.830
What we are looking at here is the insidious
cost of ringtone piracy.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.460
[laughter]

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.530
Fifty billion dollars of it a year, which
is enough at thirty seconds a ring tone that

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.220
could stretch from here to Neanderthal times.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.220
[Laughter]
[applause]

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.920
It's true.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.120
I have Excel.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.510
[Laughter]

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:43.780
The movie folks also tell us that our economy
loses over 370,000 jobs to content theft

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.090
which is quite a lot when you consider back
in '98, the Bureau of Labor statistics

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.880
indicated that the motion picture and video
industries were employing 270,000 people.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.960
[laughter]

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.220
Other data has the music industry at about
45,000 people,

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.590
and so the job losses that came with the Internet
and all that content theft

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.750
had therefore left us with negative employment
in our content industries.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.750
[laughter]

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.930
This is just one of the many mind blowing
statistics

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.000
that copyright mathematicians have to deal
with everyday

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.700
and some people think the String Theory is
tough.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.790
[laughter]

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.040
Now this is a key number from the copyright
mathematicianâ€™s tool kit,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.430
it's the precise amount of harm that comes
to media companies

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.900
whenever a single copyrighted song or movie
gets pirated.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.290
Hollywood and Congress derived this number
mathematically

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.540
back when they last sat down to improve copyright
damages and

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.500
and made this law.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.440
Some people think this number's a little bit
large

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.590
but copyright mathematicians who are media
lobby experts

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.080
are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded
for inflation every year.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080
[laughter]

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.740
Now when this law first passed, the world's
hottest mp3 players could hold just ten songs.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.400
It was a big Christmas hit because what little
hoodlum wouldn't want

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.610
a million and half bucks worth of stolen goods
in his pocket.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.740
[laughter]

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.880
[applause]

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.390
These days, an iPod classic can hold 40,000
songs,

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.160
which is to say eight billion dollars worth
of stolen media--

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.220
[laughter]
[applause]

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.000
-- or about 75,000 jobs.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.220
[Laughter]
[applause]

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.670
Now you might find copyright math strange,
but that's because it's a field

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.240
best left to experts.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.640
So that's it for now, I hope you'll join me
next time when I will be making

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.120
an equally scientific and fact based inquiry
into the cost of alien music piracy

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.470
to the American economy.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.540
Thank you very much.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.850
[Applause and cheers]

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.380
Thank you.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.380
[applause]

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.690
[video ends]

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.220
[music sounds]

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.530
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: [inaudible]

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.830
[coughing in audience]

00:07:53.830 --> 00:08:02.280
God it was so easy when it was shown to me,
I go to detect displays--what do I go to?

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.180
Open display preferences right?

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.810
We come here, we stop mirroring, oh this is
sweet.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:14.710
And then I pull up my power point presentation
and I do that.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.830
That was easy.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.070
Did that work?

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.110
All right.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:24.180
so I know that with Google translate and all
the local edition things that you guys do,

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.210
all your local initiatives, Google is a real
master of localization

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:34.890
and I wanted to honor that tradition when
I came here by basically localizing a little

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.649
bit
of what you just saw to put it in Google terms.

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:41.090
Now the first thing is I'm sure you remember
this very meaningful

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.480
and powerful info graphic from the TED talk.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.220
I stayed up until the wee hours last night
writing some very very precise astro-physical

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.880
calculations
and I can confirm to you that 58 billion dollars

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.019
in pennies is just enough to connect this
building

00:08:57.019 --> 00:08:58.699
to Mars as well.

00:08:58.699 --> 00:08:59.839
[Laughter]

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:06.899
It helps quite a bit if Mars is at perihelion,
but still this is equally relevant to you

00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:09.480
as it was to the TED crowd.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.130
Another thing, obviously, I made this observations
based on the iPod Classic.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.300
I know how you guys feel about Apple around
here--

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.300
[laughter]

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:24.339
--so I just decided to translate this into
Google terms, with the Nexus 7.

00:09:24.339 --> 00:09:30.390
Now the Nexus 7 only has sixteen gigs max
storage instead of a hundred and sixty,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:35.220
so it can merely carry eight hundred million
dollars of stolen merchandise

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.180
and rob us of seventy-five hundred jobs BUT
if we give one of these things,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:45.389
and I'm sure that will happen to every employee
of Google and Motorola,

00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:49.670
we're looking at seventy-two trillion dollars
worth of economic losses

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:54.499
and to put that into perspective that's enough
money to go to the nearby

00:09:54.499 --> 00:10:00.519
Maritime Hotel, expanded slightly admittedly,
and we could check in

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:05.480
the entire populations of Burlington, VT with
this money;

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.520
Fresno, CA, and still have room for everybody
in Asia.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:18.459
[laughter]
And for slightly more than two months, and

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:23.059
if we throw in the breakfast buffet
a little bit less than two months.

00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:25.700
So that's my little localization effort.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.420
I hope that was helpful.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.459
[laughter]

00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:31.040
And now I'm just going to talk a little bit
Year Zero.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.170
A couple of things were previously mentioned,
but just to go over them.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:41.350
Year Zero is the story of vast alien civilization
that is so into human pop music

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.449
that they inadvertently commit the biggest
copyright infringements

00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:49.069
since the Big Bang, thereby bankrupting the
entire universe.

00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:53.410
All the wealth in our universe is owed to
us and to our record labels

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:58.939
and we humans don't quite know it just yet
at the beginning of the book.

00:10:58.939 --> 00:11:04.009
You will all be delighted to know, I hope,
that the book is about two-thirds set in present

00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:08.399
day New York,
the rest is rambling across many galaxies

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:12.149
and so forth in the way that we like to do
in science fiction.

00:11:12.149 --> 00:11:16.740
Now the aliens are in trouble because for
reasons that are baked deep

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.921
into the storyline--and we'll all just save
a ton of time

00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:23.300
by suspending our disbelief on this point
for one moment--

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.399
but for reasons that are baked deep into the
storyline,

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:31.500
they are obligated to honor our copyright
laws.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.779
And they're also obligated to pay the fines
and penalties

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:41.759
that are associated with our copyright laws
which they have violated in an unbelievably

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:43.649
big way.

00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:47.910
And this is a problem because to quote
the most authoritative source on this subject

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:55.490
that exists, which is my own book:
American copyright laws are, quote "the most

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.249
cynical, predatory,
lopsided, and shameless money grubbing copyright

00:11:59.249 --> 00:12:03.010
laws written by any society
anywhere in the universe since the dawn of

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.010
Time itself."

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:08.889
Now that's not my opinion, that's the opinion
of one of the aliens in my book.

00:12:08.889 --> 00:12:12.020
[laughter]
And it may sound like a strangely emphatic

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:17.480
statement to you until you consider
the statistic which was cited in the TED talk

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.100
that the maximum fine for pirating a single
copy of a single song

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:29.290
is $150,000, which to put that into perspective,
in this state of New York,

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:35.170
the maximum fine for drunk driving is 1/300th
of that amount.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:39.699
Which makes sense if, and only if, you believe
that while drunk driving does indeed have

00:12:39.699 --> 00:12:45.399
terrible consequences, music piracy--again
quoting my authoritative source--

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:50.499
leads quickly to meth addiction, cannibalism,
and societal collapse.

00:12:50.499 --> 00:12:55.470
Which is presumably what Congress was thinking
when they passed that rather crazy law.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:02.240
So, what happens in the book is that a self-appointed
alien delegation comes to earth

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.450
to try to fix this terrible situation and
they quickly establish that the only way

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:16.490
they can do this is to reverse this complex
thicket of laws and international treaties

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.209
that literally go back centuries.

00:13:19.209 --> 00:13:22.470
And they quickly determine that the only way
they can do this

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:29.610
is to recruit a very very powerful human ally
to help them navigate human society

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.959
and help them achieve this almost impossible
task.

00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:35.050
And so they're thinking, "Who do we get?"

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:40.119
And they decide, "We gotta get somebody
who has two very rare but important attributes."

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:46.850
First of all, it has to be someone
who has unbelievable artistic credibility

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.350
because they presume that we revere
our musicians as much as they do.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.279
We don't, but they're aliens
and they don't understand us very well, so

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:58.509
that's the first thing they're thinking:
"Ideally one of the greatest musicians who

00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:03.499
ever lived--'A'--
and 'B' -- we need someone who has incredible

00:14:03.499 --> 00:14:08.350
political might
who through sheer force of will can hopefully

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:12.240
reverse this entire legislative mess that
we have."

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.110
And so they think, you know, "Bono?"

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.540
That's kind of where they start,
and they're like, "Maybe we can do better

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.079
than that,"
and they dig a little bit further, they get

00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:24.910
onto Google you'll be happy to know,
and they discover the most powerful media

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:30.029
law firm, on the entire earth is called
Carter, Geller, and Marks.

00:14:30.029 --> 00:14:35.199
And at Carter--I made it up by the way--
and at Carter, Geller and Marks there is this

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:39.910
young attorney named Nick Carter,
and they're like "Bingo!

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.790
We got ourselves a Backstreet Boy!"

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:46.449
Because there was a Backstreet Boy named Nick
Carter--and they know this because they're

00:14:46.449 --> 00:14:50.660
into our music--
So they come to earth and they present themselves

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.660
to Nick Carter.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:57.059
They realize to their horror, he's not the
Backstreet Boy--he hates the Backstreet Boys

00:14:57.059 --> 00:15:03.689
because the man has taste-- and he is not
the powerful partner who founded Carter, Geller

00:15:03.689 --> 00:15:06.720
and Marks,
he just happens to have the same very common

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.190
last name as the powerful partner who founded
Carter, Geller and Marks.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:17.910
He himself is merely a very low ranking copyright
attorney but it's too late--the Rubicon has

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.930
been crossed,
the die has been cast, the horse is out of

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.339
the barn, the low hand is into the Smirnoff.

00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:30.889
It's over, pick your cliche, they are now
allied with Nick Carter, low ranking copyright

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:31.889
attorney.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:36.759
He has forty-eight hours to reverse this whole
insane situation

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:40.829
or something very very bad is going to happen
to the earth.

00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:47.379
And so, I've just summarized the first four
pages of the book [laughter]

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:52.740
and the next three hundred and fifty-three
pages can be summarized with three simple

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.869
words:
hilarity hopefully ensues.

00:15:56.869 --> 00:16:02.029
So that's a little bit about Year Zero; it's
a little bit about copyright law.

00:16:02.029 --> 00:16:05.949
I'd love to just have sort of a conversation
and take some questions

00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:12.290
and I want to point out that this is technically
what they call, in the book promoting trade,

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:17.220
--oh actually I just want to kind of remind
you of one little thing--

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.439
I'm an expert in copyright math myself because
of the whole thing that I did

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:25.809
with Rhapsody and so I know you have a big
music initiative under way, there's actually

00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:30.970
a lot of alumni from the company that I started,
Listen.com, who are working in music,

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:36.110
mainly in Mountainview--folks like Tim Quirk,
Zahavah Levine, and so forth,

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:42.869
so I know of what I speak when I talk about
copyright law so that's --both an entrepreneur

00:16:42.869 --> 00:16:46.509
and an writer--and--more of an entrepreneur
than a writer, this is my first novel

00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:51.129
and as I got into this, you know, and I started
talking to the folks at Random House

00:16:51.129 --> 00:16:55.989
about what we do when the book comes out,
they said, â€œYou should do a bunch of readings."

00:16:55.989 --> 00:16:57.559
And I said, "That sounds great.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.329
I can read."

00:16:59.329 --> 00:17:06.449
And they said, "We want to tell you one important
thing, the last thing you should ever do at

00:17:06.449 --> 00:17:09.440
a reading
is actually read from your book.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.800
It's just a terrible mistake."

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:19.949
And so I'm going to ignore that advice just
very briefly, not because I believe life should

00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:22.780
be about
taking risks, but because I think it's always

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.130
interesting to avoid excellent advice.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.260
[laughter]
And Iâ€™m just going to do it briefly because

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:33.340
there's a couple passages here that I think
as fellow technology people you guys might

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.640
enjoy, so I'm actually going to violate all
rules,

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.800
read for a couple of minutes, and then we
can talk and do questions and that kind of

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.110
thing.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:49.899
so I picked this passage because it's about
New York City, I grew up in Connecticut, I

00:17:49.899 --> 00:17:52.010
spent some time
here in the city as well and I love it and

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:57.279
I feel like I kind of know it
and it's also about social media.

00:17:57.279 --> 00:18:01.210
So what's happened here is that our hero Nick
Carter

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:06.460
has been visited by the alien delegation and
now he has been summoned

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:11.730
by somebody--he does not know who-- and it
turns out to be a bad guy alien who's wondering

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.260
who the hell this Nick Carter guy is and has
also come to earth,

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.870
and he's been summoned to some mysterious
restaurant in the meat packing district.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.240
So he's left his office, it's about five o'clock,
and he says:

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.240
[Begins reading from Year Zero]

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.750
"Soon I was down on the icy bustling streets.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.320
New York in February is New York at its worst,
unless you count those

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.440
hundred-degree August weekends when everybody's
off at the Hamptons but you."--there's a lot

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.550
of footnotes
in here.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:38.700
He says, â€œWhich I suppose you should count,
so let's call February New York at its almost

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.409
worst."--
He's a lawyer so he's always doing footnotes--"The

00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:46.659
cheery buzz of the holidays is long gone
and the spring thaw is too distant to provide

00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:47.929
any solace.

00:18:47.929 --> 00:18:52.210
Add a three inch layer of blackened slush,
and it can feel like Moscow with out the twelve-cent

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.210
vodka.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.740
I started walking toward the Meatpacking District.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.320
Eight block on, I found a cab.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.840
The crosstown traffic turned out to be so
bad that walking may have been faster.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.750
But it was nice to get my stricken sinuses
out of the freezing rush-hour air."--he has

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.809
a cold, that turns out to be
really important to the plot, okay?

00:19:10.809 --> 00:19:15.309
"As I settled into the backseat,
my phone started humming from a flurry of

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:16.970
inbound texts.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.159
"OMG.

00:19:18.159 --> 00:19:19.340
Eatiary?

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.990
I'm soooooo jealous.""--Eatiary is the restaurant
he's going to--

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.440
"That came from a girl I faintly remembered
from college.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.890
Next in the queue was this from the cousin
of a long-ago roommate:

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:33.750
"You must must must have the Stuffed Marrow
Rings with Adzuki Bean reduction!!!"

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.880
And on it went--fifteen texts from distant
acquaintance, as well as an actual friend

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.880
or two.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.590
After wondering if
everyone I knew was in on some ingenious belated

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:46.150
birthday prank, I figured out what was happening.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:53.720
Flutter"--Flutter is spelled P-h-l-u-t-t-r--Phluttr.com--I
have the URL by the way--it cost me millions.--

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.450
[laughter]
"Phluttr is smartphone app that lets you trumpet

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.770
your every thought and action to an enraptured
world by pushing out

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:05.539
mini press releases via Facebook, Twitter,Google+,
SMS, email, and, for all I know, telegrams

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:07.040
and carrier pigeons.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.980
Being this fascinating can be taxing, even
for clinical narcissists.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.980
So Phluttr makes it easy
by infiltrating your phone and automatically

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.139
publishing whatever it learns.

00:20:16.139 --> 00:20:19.780
In my first twenty minutes
of experimenting with the service, every classmate

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.649
and co-worker that I'd ever known was told
that

00:20:22.649 --> 00:20:27.420
"Nick just arrived at 200 Park Avenue!" and,
"Nick just called United Airlines!' and, most

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.130
embarrassing,
"Nick is listening to 'Bye Bye Bye' by 'N

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.049
Sync!"" [laughter]--and this footnote--
"For the record, I was in a goofy mood, and

00:20:35.049 --> 00:20:37.500
listened to it strictly for its kitsch value--but
good luck explaining the

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.159
concept of irony to a smartphone."

00:20:39.159 --> 00:20:42.610
[laughter]
"However awful this sounds, the reality is

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.679
far worse, and I soon quit the service.

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:49.500
I'd since uninstalled its
diabolical software a dozen times, but somehow

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.139
it kept reappearing.

00:20:51.139 --> 00:20:56.220
This time I thought I'd finally foiled it--by
quite literally buying a new phone.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.289
But after a month's sulk, Phluttr was back.

00:20:58.289 --> 00:21:01.590
It had apparently matched the
address that I'd looked up on my phone to

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.820
Eatiary (a faddish restaurant it seemed).

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.540
And once my GPS signal indicated
that I was actually heading there, it had

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.679
informed my breathless public."

00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:12.029
[stops reading from book]

00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:16.870
So what's funny about that passage is I wrote
it about two years ago because in the physical

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:22.179
publishing world, it
still takes like a year to get from the point

00:21:22.179 --> 00:21:25.690
where everything's done, they've bought your
book, they're excited to

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:30.289
release it, the book is, you know, written,
and it actually gets out so, I wrote this

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:32.880
over eighteen months, I sold it
a year ago.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.270
And when I wrote this, this was so completely
surreal and impossible that my wife and I

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.799
just giggled
every time we read it and, and it just seems

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:44.450
to be like six months off now, Phluttr.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:50.929
So anyway that was--that's basically the main
passage that I wanted to read to you guys.

00:21:50.929 --> 00:21:57.840
I am very happy to take questions and chit
chat or let you thunder off to lunch or whatever

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.880
it is.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.130
There's two microphones, please ask questions
if there are any.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.450
Here we go.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.450
Yes sir.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.450
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Thanks for having me here.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.450
I'm Patrick.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.389
You know, I worked
with you guys back in early 2000, and it's

00:22:11.389 --> 00:22:16.820
so--back there where licensing, music copyrights
at Listen at the time, do

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.470
you feel anything's changed in the last ten
years since then?

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.510
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: Yeah.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:26.590
What's changed is the labels are now--and
it's a big change--the labels are now willing

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.800
to license.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:34.710
And I think that the original sin, in a sense,
of the music labels in the world of internet

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:40.510
based music
was essentially a five year embargo that they

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.480
put on the market, a five year boycott on
their music from the

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.580
Internet.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.929
And I think that is more to blame for the
piracy phenomena that followed than anything

00:22:50.929 --> 00:22:55.490
else
and so essentially what happened was in late

00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:00.360
1998, the first mass market mp3 player, the
Diamond Multimedia Rio,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.010
was announced.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:07.490
At that point, I was just in the initial phases
of starting the company and started going

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.380
around on
bended knee to the music labels , hoping to

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.769
get licenses.

00:23:11.769 --> 00:23:15.290
And I knew it was going to be bad when, within
thirty days

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:21.700
of the release of this device, the music industry
sued Diamond Multimedia in an attempt to make

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.940
mp3 players illegal
in this country.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.299
Had they succeeded, it would have been one
of those things: automatic weapons, yes; mp3

00:23:29.299 --> 00:23:32.080
players, no,
in terms of legal devices.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:39.690
And for the subsequent five years, the labels
not only sued everything that moved in the

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:44.960
broader market, but they refused to license
their content to anybody who came along and

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.210
said, "We want to create, you
know, a legal substitute that people can buy

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.980
as opposed to steal."

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.320
Now the problem with that was many-fold.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.529
It was basically April of '03 I think, before
the iTunes music store

00:23:58.529 --> 00:23:59.870
launched.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:05.000
We launched before that with an unlimited
streaming service, but the world was maniacally

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.440
focuses on
downloads at that point, what the world wanted

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.820
was downloads.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:14.880
And so you had this almost five year period
when this radically useful and fabulous and

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.919
fascinating and flexible format came out and
the labels were simply not

00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:25.940
selling that . During that interim, it basically
amounted to a training period, which lasted

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.639
about five years,
where people were being trained in being very

00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:32.529
technically adept at piracy and they were
frankly trained at frankly

00:24:32.529 --> 00:24:37.880
being very morally comfortable with it--"I
want this thing, it's not for sale.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.669
I'd sure buy it if it were, but it
ain't.

00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:43.290
I'm gonna grab it and I'm gonna learn how
to get music in this manner."

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:52.159
So that is when the piracy phenomena got very
very deeply baked I think into social norms,

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:55.259
social norm practices,
and the music industry is still paying the

00:24:55.259 --> 00:24:56.679
price for that.

00:24:56.679 --> 00:25:02.639
What's very different today is that the labels
are willing to license, so there is much more

00:25:02.639 --> 00:25:06.250
a proliferation
of services that are out there.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:12.549
I think that a lot of pretty inventive services
that really could

00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:17.580
trigger a lot more music sales, trigger a
lot more discovery, are still not being licensed.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:22.520
I mean my favorite example, there's a great
service called Tiny Song which is a lot like

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.399
Bitly or Tiny URL, but
for music.

00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:29.610
What happens is, you got to Tiny Song, you
type in a song that you'd like to Tweet out

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.480
or email or
broadcast in some other manner to a lot of

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.480
people.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.150
It kicks back this tiny URL, you put that
in your Twitter or other

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:43.670
feed, and anybody who sees it clicks it, it
goes immediately to a Groove shark page, and

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.429
that song starts playing
immediately.

00:25:45.429 --> 00:25:49.159
That's a really cool way to say, "Hey everybody,
check out this song."

00:25:49.159 --> 00:25:50.159
They're being sued.

00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:51.159
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yeah.

00:25:51.159 --> 00:25:56.159
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: And so it's not perfect in the
licensing area, but at least they are licensing.

00:25:56.159 --> 00:26:01.140
There are a lot of
wonderful companies, yourselves included,

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.610
that are able to do at least some things with
music

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:07.740
and that's the huge huge huge change, but
it came five years too late.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.570
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yeah, it was interesting times.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:13.310
I worked at the NMPA at Harry Fox, that was
supportive of the suit

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:17.389
back with the Rio Diamond, and I had it at
work and people looked at me like "Oh my God,

00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:18.690
he just brought in the
devil."

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:20.460
[Rob laughs] And I had to hide it.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.659
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: It was like you had brought in
a handgun or something.

00:26:22.659 --> 00:26:24.130
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yeah yeah yeah, and worse.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:25.130
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: Or heroin.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:29.889
&gt;&gt;Male speaker 2: Yeah worse they framed it
that way but you know it's interesting today

00:26:29.889 --> 00:26:35.590
in Google, our business
within Google supports Google Play and YouTube

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:39.600
and other clients outside, but we manage about
forty million sound

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.620
recordings that come through the systems,
from various--and about seventy-seven thousand

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.360
publishing companies that we
license and you know you got that one publisher

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.049
and they just look at you like--they're looking
at you

00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:55.360
like you're an alien so you know, listening
to this story and about your book is incredible,

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.809
but we live it everyday
but it's--the world's still light years away

00:26:59.809 --> 00:27:00.809
from changing.

00:27:00.809 --> 00:27:01.809
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: It's still a mess yeah.

00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:02.809
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yeah.

00:27:02.809 --> 00:27:03.809
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: Yeah, it is still a mess.

00:27:03.809 --> 00:27:04.809
Yes sir?

00:27:04.809 --> 00:27:08.410
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I was wondering, it seems like
very since iTunes came out, the labels were

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.090
pretty comfortable
with downloads.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:15.210
You know, like you said, not at first, but
eventually they came around, but what about

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.019
streaming,
I mean, you've got services today like Spotify,

00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:20.799
and they're still missing a lot of "A list"
artists

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:24.940
and do you think that the labels will ever
really be on board with streaming or is that

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.350
just--what are your thoughts
on the labels and streaming?

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:31.160
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: Ironically, the labels were okay
with streaming believe it or not before they

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:36.490
were okay with downloads,
so we were--Rhapsody launched as an 'all you

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.200
can eat' streaming service.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.679
We're kind of--when the history of downloadable
music is eventually written, we may be viewed

00:27:43.679 --> 00:27:47.129
as the kind
of VisiCalc of the 'all you can eat' streaming

00:27:47.129 --> 00:27:48.129
service.

00:27:48.129 --> 00:27:50.179
We're still out there, I think we're still
number three

00:27:50.179 --> 00:27:55.320
in the market, but Spotify has definitely
leapfrogged us, or leaptfrogged us, or whatever,

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.530
however you would say that
grammatically flawlessly.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:05.680
So they did actually license to us before
they got there, quite a while before it was

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.450
the better part of a year
after we got all five of the major label licenses,

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.100
before the iTunes store was licensed.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:18.169
And that story about how Steve Jobs had a
brawl and so forth to get that done is very

00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:22.330
well documented in the
Isaacson book and elsewhere.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:27.679
The holes in our catalog and everybody else's
catalog--when I say our, I sold

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:33.379
Rhapsody a long long time ago to Real Networks,
they sold half of it to MTV--I'll say our

00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:34.379
forever.

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:38.940
It's not like an affectation, I just can't
stop myself, I feel very allied to Rhapsody.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:45.691
But the holes in our catalog and Spotify's
catalogs usually, believe it or not, have

00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:50.330
more to do with things that are
at the artist or the publisher level.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:54.491
At this point, the labels are pretty much,
are very much on board like "We want

00:28:54.491 --> 00:29:01.390
to get everything in there" but there are
weird glitches in certain contracts that prevent

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.390
that.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:08.620
So I think that it's more just--and the holes
diminish, asymptotically approaching zero,

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.889
but asymptotically, it's
never going to be zero.

00:29:10.889 --> 00:29:13.490
It's always going to be closer and closer
and closer.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:17.159
The holes were just gaping five or six years
ago.

00:29:17.159 --> 00:29:21.529
They're more--they're almost weird when you
come across them now

00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:25.690
in the streaming catalogs, and there's a few
holes in the download catalogs as well.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:29.450
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I think until you have names like
The Beatles in there, everyone will perceive

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:30.460
there still being
holes.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.460
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: Yeah Yeah.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.470
And The Beatles were also the last people
to get on CD's as well.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:39.840
And the last people, very famously
the last people to get on Apple.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.820
I believe they'll grudgingly come over at
some point.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:50.809
And my personal belief is that the streaming
model is finally entering the steep part of

00:29:50.809 --> 00:29:51.809
its curve.

00:29:51.809 --> 00:29:59.970
If you go on campuses now streaming has become
so wide spread because of the friction free

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:03.040
exploration
that it enables and I think that the key thing

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.260
was that the streaming services, like Spotify
and Rhapsody

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:12.779
and others have finally kind of got portability
more or less nailed, with sort of caching

00:30:12.779 --> 00:30:15.460
to the device and
people want to get the music off of the Internet

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.730
and into their lives.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:19.490
And so fixing that was a key thing.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:24.070
My belief is that about, you know, in the
five-ish year standpoint, I bet that streaming

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:28.980
dollar share
is very close and maybe even exceeds downloadable,

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.380
but, man, were we ten years too early.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.419
Yes sir?

00:30:33.419 --> 00:30:40.030
&gt;&gt;male #4: So it seems to me there's a bit
of fundamental distinction between the music

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.450
and the video
situation.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:47.039
In particular, I'm thinking about Netflix,
where they have the streaming service and

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:49.320
they have physical
DVD service.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:56.740
And the CEO for some reason wants to get rid
of the physical DVD service in favor of the

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.639
streaming
service, even though the streaming service

00:31:00.639 --> 00:31:04.639
in the long run cannot make any money because
the companies will just

00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:07.340
keep raising what they charge Netflix.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.659
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: Yeah.

00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:17.190
&gt;&gt;male #4: Is there a distinction there, in
that the music streaming business can make

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:21.620
money,
where as the video streaming business can't?

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.820
Is there a reason for that, or--and is there
a reason why the music

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:33.889
download business can make money where as
maybe music streaming or video streaming can't?

00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:39.059
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: They're all really really tough
businesses from a margin standpoint for the

00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:44.309
simple reason that
you need the permission of the majors to be

00:31:44.309 --> 00:31:45.809
in business.

00:31:45.809 --> 00:31:49.649
If you're missing even a single major label,
of which there

00:31:49.649 --> 00:31:55.360
are now three, there used to be five, the
gaps in your catalog are so vast

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.919
there's just a great deal of leverage that's
on the studio or the label's side

00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:01.280
when you're negotiating your terms.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:06.490
Particularly if the whole point of your service
is "We've got everything,

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:09.729
and you can explore in a friction free way.

00:32:09.729 --> 00:32:12.399
"
And generally speaking, almost without exception,

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:16.110
and indeed probably without exception, these
deals are cut for

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:24.309
twelve or twenty-four month basis, the tendency
will be, I believe, it has been in the past

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:29.139
that as certain of these services manage to
make a little bit of money,

00:32:29.139 --> 00:32:33.460
the labels and the studios are going to see
that, for--because they've actually have reporting

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.529
requirements that they cook into
their deals.

00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:40.629
And they're going to claw back that margin,
and claw back that margin, and claw back that

00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:42.870
margin,
and so I think that the margin dynamics are

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:48.080
similarly grim in both sides of the business.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:55.279
The area in which they're not so bad--and
each business has it's little way of still

00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:59.200
kind of surviving--for us
in streaming it's what they call breakage,

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.890
breakage is kind of weird usage; it's a weird
choice of a word,

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:06.980
for a concept that basically says, "You are
going to have that person.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:12.100
God bless him or her, who pays for your
service and really never uses it."

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.450
And that's by the way, the way that like health
clubs

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:19.100
stay in business, and airline frequent flier
programs, and a whole bunch of other places.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.340
So that's the advantage that the streaming
service has.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.340
The advantage that download services have
is there's

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:32.450
some margin baked in, it's not bad, it's probably
like twenty-five to thirty percent gross points

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:37.279
which a lot of people make a living off of
that so there's something built in there.

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:42.399
The place that actually I think that has the
best margin dynamics is Pandora, because there

00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:48.879
are essentially government set rates on what
can be charged

00:33:48.879 --> 00:33:54.850
for non-interactive services, basically this
goes way back to the '20's when there was

00:33:54.850 --> 00:34:01.019
the brawl between the earliest music broadcasters--AM
radio in those days--and the record labels

00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:05.640
and the government basically came in and said
"Okay, we're going to determine what those

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.220
payment rates are," and that tradition has
continued,

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:15.260
and so Pandora, by being a non-interactive
service, isn't, isn't nearly as much at the

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.290
mercy of the labels.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:20.649
So there's little bit higher margins there,
but margins are kind of lousy, throughout

00:34:20.649 --> 00:34:21.649
the business.

00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:27.929
Because you do, the labels are in a position
to "Oh man, they've gotten bandwidth is a

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:30.450
lot cheaper and they've done this that and
the other thing.

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:31.790
Let's up our rates a little bit."

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.619
I don't think these are ever going to be wildly
profitable businesses.

00:34:34.619 --> 00:34:41.619
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Well Netflix, the physical DVD
side of the business, I don't think that the

00:34:41.619 --> 00:34:47.550
labels can actually--
I think they have baked in that into the deals--

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:48.550
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: Yeah.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:53.870
&gt;&gt;Male #4: But fundamentally I don't think--you
can correct me if I'm wrong--I don't think

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:58.630
that they can legally restrict them from selling
some set--

00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:59.630
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: From selling some [unintelligible]

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.630
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Some set.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.530
&gt;&gt;Rob Reid: That's a less regulated market
and that's an area where there is more wiggle

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:10.760
room, but I think there's also a general sense
that in --over the five to ten year period

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.260
the DVD is going to go the way of the CD.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:19.330
And so that's, you know, to the extent that
there is a differential there it's temporary,

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.540
not temporary in the short term but in the
intermediate term, and then, man, that whole

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:29.069
business of Netflix separating its DVD's from
its streaming business was really a catastrophic

00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:30.069
error.

00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:33.730
It was a very very strange move at the corporate
level that their

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.990
stock price got hammered for.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:42.630
And that's like a whole 'nother topic, but
it was clearly a weird move, as you indicated

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:48.670
for them to try to split the two and they
learned very quickly that that was a bad idea.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.619
Any other questions?

00:35:50.619 --> 00:35:52.290
No?

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.130
Well thank you very much for coming.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:58.920
There are books back there, I'll sign them
or anything else you bring,

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.589
I'll linger and I'm happy to ask--to answer
questions one on one or whatever.

00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:04.670
And thank you very much for coming out.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.770
[Applause]
