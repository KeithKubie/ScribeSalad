[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.020
JOYCE BAZ: By welcoming
a very special guest.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.880
Here today, Mina Al
Oriabi, the Editor

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.200
In Chief of "The National."

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.200
Mina, you've been a
political journalist

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.570
for a very, very,
very long time.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.300
How did it all begin
and what was the genesis

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.014
of your career, if you will?

00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:23.930
MINA AL ORIABI: Right.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.013
So first of all, thank you
so much for being here.

00:00:26.013 --> 00:00:28.020
And thank you, Joyce,
for not only hosting me,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.610
but Google has been really kind
to "The National," since we

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.900
relaunched last July.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.490
So it's very nice to
continue our relationship.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.710
I'm Iraqi-British, and I
think for many people who

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.310
are from countries that either
suffer war or dictatorship

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.790
or whatever, it really dominates
your life in different ways.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.430
Unfortunately, I
count myself as lucky

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.060
because we left
when I was a child.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.460
We left Iraq when I was a child.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.090
But still politics kind
of has shaped who I am

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.440
and where I came to.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.079
And in a way, I think
that's what determined my

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.620
getting involved in journalism
and wanting to understand more

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.360
but also cast a light
on certain issues.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.340
So really, I think it has to do
with the fact that I am Iraqi,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.510
and I also love storytelling--
so combine the two together.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.662
JOYCE BAZ: So
political journalism--

00:01:16.662 --> 00:01:18.120
I don't think there
was ever a time

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.610
when it was easy or risk-free.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.400
Would you say that being a
political journalist today

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.190
comes with an even higher
set of risks and challenges

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.527
than in the past, or was
there never an easy time?

00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:31.860
MINA AL ORIABI: I don't think
there's ever an easy time.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.235
But again, I think if we're
talking about the Middle East

00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:37.870
and North Africa, at the
moment, unfortunately, half

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.120
the time that people are
thinking you're a journalist,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.240
you have to be a
war correspondent.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.920
And that's really difficult. I
remember the first journalism

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.970
story I ever wrote in political
journalism was in 2002,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.670
and it was the one million
person march in London

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.790
against the upcoming
war in Iraq.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.290
And I remember at
the time thinking,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.939
I really should be going
to Iraq to cover this.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:01.980
But I'll be really frank.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.896
My parents were like,
there is no way on Earth

00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:05.020
you're getting to Iraq.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.710
And you're staying here, and
you're safer here and so forth.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.930
And to be fair, I
remember thinking,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.380
I'm a lesser journalist
for not being out

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.580
there on the front line.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.860
And I had a great mentor,
who's still a friend,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.087
and who actually now writes
for "The National," which

00:02:19.087 --> 00:02:19.920
I'm really proud of.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.050
But he was this big journalist,
and I had a word with him.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.090
And he said to me, Mina,
not every journalist

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.929
has to be a war correspondent.

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.470
War correspondents do incredible
work and incredible stories,

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.494
but you can still do the
other types of stories.

00:02:31.494 --> 00:02:32.910
And I said, well,
what I really am

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.490
interested in is the policy
side and the thematic side.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.350
And sometimes,
fortunately, especially

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.020
with what we're seeing at
the moment with UN failures

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.062
and other problems with the
international community,

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:44.520
you still want to
write about those

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.490
and explain those and also have
the context and the sourcing

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.020
of piecing together a story.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.850
So that's the field I went into.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.722
And I studied
history at university

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:54.180
partly because I
wanted to know how

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.490
did we get here in order
to frame anything that I'm

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.770
going to be writing about.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.370
And so that's the
difficulty of one.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.020
If you're a war
correspondent, I think

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.690
the dangers are so much
more today than they

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.190
were 15, 20, 30 years ago.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.100
It's incredible, and I
think that journalism

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.170
is poorer for it,
especially as we're

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.440
trying to understand what's
happening in different conflict

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.820
zones around the world.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.300
And that suddenly having a
flak jacket that says "press,"

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.550
you're almost the target
whereas before, that

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.510
would be your safety.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.360
So I think that's one concern.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.860
Political journalists
of course also

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.151
carry different types of risks.

00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:33.154
So where do you cross a
line that can get you--

00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:35.070
the only trouble you can
get your organization

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.510
in trouble and so forth.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.630
And of course, now, it's
funny because before censors,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.190
if you're working
in the newspaper,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.648
you just have to
skim the newspaper

00:03:42.648 --> 00:03:44.790
and things can pass
whereas now with one

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.410
keyword alert search can
unravel a whole host of things.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.380
So it's changed for sure.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.920
JOYCE BAZ: And do you feel that
being a political journalist

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.710
in the Middle East and
also being a woman poses

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.040
an extra set of challenges?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.077
MINA AL ORIABI: I think every
job has its own challenges.

00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:05.410
And I think in journalism,
you have different challenge,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.250
especially as we see
disruption that's

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.650
happening in the media industry
and trying to figure out

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.270
how do you get the right story.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.980
The pressure now to
get the story out,

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.210
even if you haven't
double-sourced or triple

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.510
sourced for confirmation.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.269
Being a woman, yes, of course,
has its own set of challenges.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.320
And I also think, especially
in the Middle East,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.900
there's certain conceptions
about women in media.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.900
And I remember when I first said
I wanted to go into journalism,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.027
my mother was quite disapproving
and not because of me.

00:04:35.027 --> 00:04:36.860
But she said, you'll
find so many challenges

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.920
in how you'll be perceived
as a woman and so forth.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.099
She quickly changed her
mind, which was good

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:42.890
and my father too--

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.480
they were really encouraging.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.010
But they were
concerned because they

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.680
felt that in our
societies, there

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.687
is a certain element of
prejudice against women

00:04:51.687 --> 00:04:52.520
in the media sector.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.520
I think that's changed.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.080
I do think opening up of
everything from the variety

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.430
of outlets we now have.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.950
Television has changed.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.444
But it's a bit of that
perception remains.

00:05:02.444 --> 00:05:03.860
JOYCE BAZ: And do
you feel there's

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.145
good representation in media
and journalism today of women?

00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:10.620
MINA AL ORIABI: I'm very proud
of "The National," there is.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.630
But I think across the board,
no, we still face challenges.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.880
I think there are
still issues primarily

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.399
to do with gender gaps
in pay for sure that I

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:22.190
think that's one of
the biggest challenges.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.560
And compensation
is really important

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.477
because that's got to
do with confidence.

00:05:26.477 --> 00:05:28.310
It's got to do with how
you feel that you're

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.950
being valued as a
journalist, regardless

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.750
of your gender or your sex.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.950
So it's still a huge issue
and across the board,

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.280
across the world.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.050
JOYCE BAZ: OK.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.370
So if we were to dig in a
bit more into your career,

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.308
what was the hardest interview
you've ever had to do and why?

00:05:46.308 --> 00:05:48.524
MINA AL ORIABI: So I
was thinking about this

00:05:48.524 --> 00:05:50.690
because you said to me you
may ask about the hardest

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.060
interview.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.560
So I was really
thinking about this,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.200
and there are so
many different ones.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.490
One that was really
difficult for me--

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.890
but then I was really proud of
was interviewing the daughters

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.680
of the lady who was
killed in Nassau Square

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.730
that famous Blackwater
incident in Baghdad

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.476
when you had suddenly these
young girls were orphans.

00:06:12.476 --> 00:06:13.850
Their father had
died previously.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.470
Their mother had
worked as a driver

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.050
to try to get some sort
of income to come in,

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.020
and she was shot, with several
other civilians, by Blackwater.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.770
And so I went to
interview them in Jordan.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.390
It was really difficult because
their story had to be told,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.750
but they were so emotional.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.160
And I was also
getting emotional,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
and I was trying not to
because I felt like--

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.660
but I also wanted to show
them empathy, and I felt it.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.815
It was really difficult
to interview them.

00:06:36.815 --> 00:06:38.690
It took a long time,
and I went to visit them

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.550
several times before I could
even write something or have

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.020
them open up.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.478
And it's always difficult with
these human interest stories

00:06:43.478 --> 00:06:45.290
because you want to
tell their story,

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.330
but you also don't want to pry.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.800
And there is a
sense of what right

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.600
do I have-- a complete stranger
they've just met-- to say, how

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.850
do you feel about your mother?

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.250
How do you feel about
what's happened in Iraq?

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.333
Where's your future going?

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:57.922
So that, for me, was
emotionally really difficult.

00:06:57.922 --> 00:06:59.380
And then there are
difficult people

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.640
like officials that you
end up having to interview.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.300
They're not really interested
in giving interviews.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.819
So it's like you
ask them a question

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:06.110
and give you a one-word answer.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.940
And you're like why
am I doing this?

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.890
But they're part of the job.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.070
But the ones that are difficult
are emotional ones, actually.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.150
JOYCE BAZ: And if you were to
do one more interview again

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.690
with a person you've
interviewed, who would it be?

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.870
MINA AL ORIABI: With somebody
I've already interviewed?

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.330
Good question.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.735
Nouri al-Maliki, former
prime minister of Iraq.

00:07:26.735 --> 00:07:28.610
I interviewed him when
he was prime minister,

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.430
and I'd be quite tempted to
interview him again and see

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.295
where we were.

00:07:32.295 --> 00:07:35.240
I think that would
be quite interesting.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.500
JOYCE BAZ: Great, so there
are Gallup polls in the US

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:45.410
that show a significant drop in
trust in mass media in America.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:50.494
But many would argue that this
does not apply in the Middle

00:07:50.494 --> 00:07:52.910
East, and a lot of research
shows that trust in mass media

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.570
is still very high.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.820
What would you say about that?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.080
What are your thoughts on it?

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.270
Is there a continuous
trust in mass media

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.084
in our part of the world?

00:08:02.084 --> 00:08:04.490
MINA AL ORIABI: I think
there is more trust

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.920
because the alternatives in,
especially the Arabic language,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.040
have been so weak and
are so untrustworthy.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.280
So I think that's when
actually more legacy

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.010
media, traditional
media, mass media trust

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.530
is there because
the alternatives.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:26.570
And we've seen the amount
of really shoddy fake news.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.441
Like it's so obvious
that this is fake

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:30.440
that people don't catch
on to it in the same way

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.960
that you've had in other
places that more sophisticated.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.590
I also think there's more
trust because, in some way,

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.825
we almost know the biases of
different or editorial lines

00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:40.950
of different organizations.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.010
So people know that when
they're coming to it kind

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.509
of what they're receiving, and
then they make their judgment

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:47.150
call whereas
especially in the US,

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.970
I find it fascinating when they
speak of American journalists.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.310
There's this thing
of we're objective,

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.690
and I genuinely don't believe.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.250
I think everything
is subjective.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.440
The headline we
choose is subjective.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.549
The photo we choose to
be on the front page

00:08:59.549 --> 00:09:01.340
or the top of your home
page is subjective.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.690
Everything is subjective
whereas in the US,

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.190
for the longest
time, it was always,

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.530
no, everything is objective,
and it's a level playing field.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.140
And it's not and
doesn't necessarily

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.277
have to mean that you have
a bias with ill intent,

00:09:11.277 --> 00:09:13.610
but I think you do have bias
is based on your knowledge,

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.151
on your personal
experience, on who's

00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:17.340
actually in the newsroom,
who's making the shot.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.410
And so I think in
the US, there's

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.360
less trust now because
people bought into this idea

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.440
that everything's objective.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.690
And suddenly, they're like,
oh, no, it's actually not.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.030
JOYCE BAZ: It's hard to be.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.020
So Mina, you are British-Iraqi.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.990
You grew up in Sweden, and you
lived in Australia and the UK.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.690
What should we know about
Mina that we won't find

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.070
in a quick search on Google?

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.660
MINA AL ORIABI: I
think one of the things

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.970
that when I first speak,
people are always like, oh,

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.190
where did the accent come from?

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.860
And I first learned to
speak English in Australia.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.200
So I had a proper Aussie
accent that I lost.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.240
But I was a child, we
lived in Australia.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.870
And then I left Australia,
and I lost my Aussie accent.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.360
So I guess that's one thing
most people don't know about me.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.370
JOYCE BAZ: Well, you
can always get it again

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.510
after living in the UAW with
such a mixed expat community.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.790
MINA AL ORIABI: Well, it's
funny because this accent

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.860
is from years of
living in Saudi Arabia.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.690
And then I moved to
the UK when I was 15,

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.272
and I never picked
up a British accent

00:10:14.272 --> 00:10:16.730
whereas my sister, who's older,
picked up a British accent.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.271
I don't know.

00:10:17.271 --> 00:10:18.957
Maybe I watch too
much Hollywood.

00:10:18.957 --> 00:10:22.160
It's never changed.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.500
JOYCE BAZ: So you were appointed
editor in chief last year

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.800
for "The National."

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.450
And one of the things
you said were you

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.420
want to take a new and
fresh approach to news.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.837
What did you mean by that?

00:10:33.837 --> 00:10:35.420
MINA AL ORIABI: Well,
several things--

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.390
I think the most important
part of any news organization

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.790
newsroom is the team and
how you're putting together

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.540
different teams.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.769
And what capabilities and
how you're equipping them--

00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:48.810
and this is a challenge
we still haven't cracked.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.726
At "The National," we
continue to work on it--

00:10:50.726 --> 00:10:54.200
is how we make sure that you
give each journalist the chance

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:54.874
to--

00:10:54.874 --> 00:10:57.290
whether they're editing, whether
they're using multimedia,

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.331
whether they're writing--

00:10:58.331 --> 00:11:00.500
chance to develop
different ideas

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.330
because you need
expertise, but you also

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.050
need them to breakout of it.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.207
So for example, we
try to make sure

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.790
that everybody has
the chance to write

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.620
about either their
favorite books--

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.770
or they could be genuinely
writing usually or just

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.044
a subeditor every day.

00:11:14.044 --> 00:11:16.710
But then they have the chance to
write about sports or so forth.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.091
So giving them a more rounded
approach to telling stories,

00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:22.090
and that's what we hope
to do at "The National."

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.110
So that's one element of it.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.900
The second element also of
it is getting that balance

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.030
between yes, we have
to be up to date,

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.880
but we're never going
to be a newswire.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.350
So there's that.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.452
For many newspapers,
there's that tension now

00:11:35.452 --> 00:11:37.910
because you want to be the
first person to break something,

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.285
but that's not really
our raison d'etre.

00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:41.660
Our raison d'etre
is to make sure

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.270
that we're giving
you an analysis.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.500
Why do you care about this?

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.240
Why is the story important?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.969
And so getting
that balance right.

00:11:49.969 --> 00:11:51.260
We have an integrated newsroom.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.240
So people are working towards
our digital outlets but also

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.220
the actual physical
print newspaper.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.010
So taking that approach of
one, it's integrated, and two,

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.570
how are we understanding
reader behavior and therefore,

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.070
making sure that our stories
are being updated and developed

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.350
in a way that suits the
reader to come back and have

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.980
fresh stories.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.020
But also not getting
into this rat race of we

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.844
have to update every two
minutes or five minutes.

00:12:14.844 --> 00:12:17.010
JOYCE BAZ: And I must say
I'm not being biased here.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.676
But "The National's"
website is probably

00:12:18.676 --> 00:12:21.350
one of the greatest
news sites out there

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.130
today covering the region.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.670
And if you haven't listened
to "The National's" podcast,

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.170
you should definitely
try it out.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.836
It's really good, and
it's a good chance

00:12:28.836 --> 00:12:31.420
to go deep and have
long-form conversations.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.170
MINA AL ORIABI: Thank
you for saying that.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.720
I mean, the thing with the
podcast and other things--

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.005
we relaunched July 2017.

00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:41.130
And we had a very short
time to turn things around.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.505
But one of the things is, for
example, on the podcasting,

00:12:43.505 --> 00:12:46.570
there were people who never
sat behind a microphone before,

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.270
and so we're really
nervous about it.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.210
And we gave them basic training.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.880
It wasn't something
long over months.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.050
We didn't have the time--

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.972
a few days of it.

00:12:54.972 --> 00:12:56.930
But giving them and
equipping them with skills.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.490
And then seeing
who wants to do it.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.320
So rather than assign people
and say, you have to do this.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.030
You have to that, It was people
coming forward and saying,

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.560
actually, yes, I
think I could do that

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.030
and seeing that they
have the skills.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.350
So that's been actually
one of the things

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.060
that I'm really proud
of "The National."

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.768
That we've tried these
things, and people

00:13:09.768 --> 00:13:11.320
have been great
journalists, want

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.736
to tell stories
in different ways,

00:13:12.736 --> 00:13:14.150
and they've been
able to do that.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.160
JOYCE BAZ: So news
consumption is

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:23.330
becoming more fragmented and
more digital than ever before.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.820
How are you guys receiving
this at "The National,"

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.270
and what are you
doing to change it

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.309
and to transform into digital?

00:13:31.309 --> 00:13:33.350
MINA AL ORIABI: That's
the big question, I think,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.890
for all newspapers.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.880
And so part of it, like
I said, is understanding

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.420
what our readers actually want.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.920
And you all know this.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.020
There is your core
loyal group of readers,

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.650
who will always come
to "The National,"

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.170
and they've downloaded our app.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.130
When they wake up
in the morning,

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.300
they have to look at it,
or they go to the website.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.300
And they're, at the moment,
comprising about 50%

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.160
of our readership.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.570
And a little over 50%
are coming through search

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.270
and of course, Google being
the primary resource for that.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.970
But also coming through
social media and sharing.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.510
And so you all notice all
these changes happening

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.400
to what makes you read a story?

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.870
Is it because
someone you trust--

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.220
again, it goes back to
the element of trust--

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.803
has sent it to you,
and therefore, you

00:14:14.803 --> 00:14:15.930
think it's worth your time?

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.250
So we're trying to develop way
that we have our core readers,

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.360
and we grow our base of the
loyal readers that will always

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:23.870
come back.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.430
And then also catering
for those people

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.388
that are finding us,
because of a certain topic

00:14:27.388 --> 00:14:29.894
we've written about through
search or social media.

00:14:29.894 --> 00:14:31.310
So that's something
that you never

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.460
had to worry about in
a newspaper before.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:39.830
And just 15 years ago, you
would be what's the front page?

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.980
How are we making sure that
we've got a good spread of news

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.660
over 40 pages?

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.060
And you're kind of that was it.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.800
And now it's completely changed
in terms of prioritization.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.540
And also, you can't
control how you're

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.990
going to have that
experience with a reader

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.719
if they're coming to you only
through search or social.

00:14:56.719 --> 00:14:58.260
But you want to keep
them on the page

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.724
in order to stay engaged
and actually think, hey,

00:15:00.724 --> 00:15:02.390
yes, "The National"
has more to offer me

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.410
than this immediate
story that I'm going to.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.080
So that's really
part of our everyday

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.360
in terms of we're
curating the home page

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.955
and the website,
how we're curating

00:15:10.955 --> 00:15:13.580
the app, what we're putting out
through our social media feeds.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.379
And I always say we have five
outlets now at "The National."

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:18.170
We have the paper,
which I'm very proud of,

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.310
but it's only in the UAE.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.320
So you only see it
if you're in the UAE.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:26.120
You've got the website, which
again, is the main source

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.380
of our readership now.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.261
You've got the app, and
we have the e-reader,

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:31.010
which is just the basic
kind of readership

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.635
and that's what a
lot of people go for.

00:15:32.635 --> 00:15:34.610
But we have the more
sophisticated app

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.130
that actually is more
curated, and then we've

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.750
got our social media feeds.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.310
And then we've got
the fifth element,

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.497
which is our very specific
products like our newsletter,

00:15:43.497 --> 00:15:45.830
that lands in your inbox every
morning, and our podcast.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.549
And sometimes, we have
videos that are purely video.

00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:50.840
There's no other story to go
with it because we're also

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.480
expanding our multimedia.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.720
So working across those five
every day is very challenging.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.552
It's not easy, but
it's also keeping

00:15:58.552 --> 00:16:01.010
that priority of seeing that's
how we're reaching a greater

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:01.832
readership now.

00:16:01.832 --> 00:16:04.040
JOYCE BAZ: Do you envision
a day where you will start

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.982
distributing your print paper?

00:16:05.982 --> 00:16:07.670
It's a tough question.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.620
MINA AL ORIABI:
Everybody asks that.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.910
I don't want to.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.190
I don't want to stop
distributing a print paper,

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.080
but I have to envision
that because if that's

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.690
where the market will go, then
you have to prepare for it.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.680
I don't think that's going to
happen for various reasons.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.470
One, I think there is
still something to be

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.690
said about reading a newspaper.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.650
My niece is three years old.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.340
And when I go visit my sister,
I always take the paper with me,

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.960
and I put in front of her so
she can play with it because I'm

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.335
thinking, if we can get children
to play with newspapers,

00:16:35.335 --> 00:16:36.751
they're going to
enjoy reading it,

00:16:36.751 --> 00:16:38.410
like we enjoy reading
newspapers now.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.690
What I worry about is that most
toddlers and young children now

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.490
are always just
holding a device.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.632
So they won't even know
what to do with the paper.

00:16:45.632 --> 00:16:47.590
So my niece and nephew
are being indoctrinated.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.010
My nephew's a year and
a half, so he's still

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.370
got a year or two to go.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.420
But my niece is
totally indoctrinated.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.800
And so I think that
experience, as long as people

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.140
find joy in having that.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.750
It's an experience-- having your
coffee and your morning paper

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:00.416
and all of that.

00:17:00.416 --> 00:17:02.067
So long as that
exists, then we'll

00:17:02.067 --> 00:17:04.400
stay good because I think
we're a competitive newspaper,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.710
and people want to read us.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.609
However, if with time,
people's behavior just

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.740
no longer includes
that little ritual,

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.910
then it's very hard to keep up

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.770
JOYCE BAZ: We have
our very own image

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.670
of newspapers at our reception.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.520
You'll go in, and you'll
see lots of print papers

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.795
decorating our section.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.300
We can start to warm up with
questions from the room.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.760
I will ask my last
question here,

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.860
and it's somewhat of
an existential one.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.590
With spread of
misinformation that we're

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.980
seeing around the
world today, how do you

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.900
see the future of journalism?

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.600
I know you wrote a piece
for the World Economic Forum

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.110
that the future is credibility.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.570
But how do you see that rolling
out-- the future of journalism

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:52.460
in an age where there's more
and more misinformation?

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.280
MINA AL ORIABI: I
think as awareness

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.330
is raised about this
issue of misinformation,

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.330
I do think people are
more aware today than they

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.200
were maybe two years ago.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.170
So I think as more and more
of that becomes a problem,

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.170
it actually works
better for journalism

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:09.020
because you go back to the
basics of journalism, which

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.150
is how do we get the story?

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.060
What's our source?

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.857
What's the credibility behind
tell all aspects of the story?

00:18:16.857 --> 00:18:19.190
If I've missed something about
the aspects of the story,

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.120
am I making my reader
aware and so forth?

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.250
So I think that stays true.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.040
And if you get that right, with
time, people come back to it.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.740
I say, as a newspaper, we
compete with everything

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.824
from Twitter to Google News
to "The Economist," which

00:18:34.824 --> 00:18:36.740
used to be-- if you're
a newspaper in the UAE,

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.880
who cares what "The
Economist" is writing?

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.350
But now, they're
distributing here,

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.660
and we're also trying to
reach an audience sitting

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.830
in the UK or the US.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:47.270
So that change
means that you have

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.220
to be strong in your
journalism in order

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.659
for people to come to you,
rather than fake news that's

00:18:51.659 --> 00:18:52.700
just being shared around.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.116
So I think there's
more awareness,

00:18:54.116 --> 00:18:55.910
and I do think it's
a challenge now.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.590
But with time, people
getting to know

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.750
if you take a screen
grab of a tweet

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.487
and you haven't sent
me the actual tweet,

00:19:01.487 --> 00:19:03.320
it means the screen
grab is something that's

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.794
photoshopped and fabricated.

00:19:04.794 --> 00:19:06.710
We're still not there,
but I think more people

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:07.910
are becoming aware of that.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.430
So it's also part of
our job, as journalists,

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:11.960
to raise awareness about that.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.000
And I do think that media
literacy, with time,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.250
will actually be part
of people's education.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.830
Like to be well-rounded, you're
going to have to understand.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.330
Just like we talk about
financial literacy,

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.163
I think we need to talk
about media literacy

00:19:22.163 --> 00:19:23.430
and understanding information.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.846
And if that really kicks in--
which I think it's beginning

00:19:25.846 --> 00:19:26.870
to in certain parts--

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.380
then it holds drills I
mean, and good stuff.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.760
JOYCE BAZ: Great, that's
great final words.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.565
Questions from the room?

00:19:35.565 --> 00:19:36.981
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for joining us

00:19:36.981 --> 00:19:42.338
at [INAUDIBLE] So you said
you studied [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:42.338 --> 00:19:45.260
heart of Mina for the past--
for all of your career.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.182
If your niece asks you
today, how did we get here?

00:19:48.182 --> 00:19:51.120
How would you answer that?

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.640
MINA AL ORIABI: Wow, I guess
it depends where here is.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.370
So I would probably
first talk about Iraq

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.864
because I'm a
single issue voter.

00:20:01.864 --> 00:20:03.780
If I was in the US, I'd
say I'm a single issue

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.571
voter because everything
goes back to Iraq,

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:07.410
which is rightly or wrongly.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.070
And I think with Iraq, it
was just failed leadership.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.050
And I think,
unfortunately, for Iraq,

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.880
I can say that with
absolute certainty,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.750
knowing the ins
and outs of it all.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.780
I think also, as you
said, I studied history.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.580
When you look at history,
the impact that leadership

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.190
can have at taking you on the
right course or the completely

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.130
wrong course, especially
when many of our societies

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.390
are top-down.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.300
So how the top goes
can really impact that.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.670
I'd say that's probably
my immediate answer.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.410
My second answer of
how did we get here

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.800
is also a lack of
vision, not knowing

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.660
where we want to
be in four years

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.930
time, five years time, 20
years time, rather everything

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.580
was so immediate
and reactionary.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.600
And I think that's been
one of our pitfalls.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.630
But I also I hope that
I can say to her, well,

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.900
we got to here as
women, as societies

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.330
that there are some progressive
elements that we don't

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.960
necessarily always see because
me, as a political journalist,

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.750
always thinks of the
current affair status, which

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.410
depresses me.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.330
But when you think about
also society and how

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.960
we've been able to either
build bridges or push back

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.810
against stereotypes, then that's
also the strength of people.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.021
And I think we've been really
lucky with immigration.

00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:16.020
Unfortunately, now we're
seeing a trend against.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.154
But I think with
immigration both ways--

00:21:18.154 --> 00:21:20.320
people coming to the region,
leaving from the region

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:20.950
so forth.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:26.580
We've seen some great dynamic,
I think, leaps in society.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.086
And so that I would say
is also people movement,

00:21:29.086 --> 00:21:30.960
and people's mobility
has been a good thing--

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.293
when it's not forced, of course.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.225
AUDIENCE: Hello, thank you.

00:21:36.225 --> 00:21:37.169
That was fascinating.

00:21:37.169 --> 00:21:39.514
As it's International
Women's Day,

00:21:39.514 --> 00:21:42.329
what's your take with your
international perspective

00:21:42.329 --> 00:21:47.654
on the current perspective
outside the current narrative

00:21:47.654 --> 00:21:49.841
about women [INAUDIBLE]
and how do you

00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:54.099
think it's evolving over time?

00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:56.640
MINA AL ORIABI: Again, I think
we talk about the Middle East,

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.090
and it's so different
from country to country.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.870
And so it is kind
of incredible here I

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.224
moved to [INAUDIBLE]
on the 1 of March 2017.

00:22:06.224 --> 00:22:08.640
It's the first time I live in
the Arab world, as an adult.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.830
So I've been going
back and forth.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.280
I've actually never
lived here as an adult.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.330
And so I had friends.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.830
I have colleagues,
contacts saying,

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.330
you're going to
struggle as a woman.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.919
I said, actually, it's been
amazing because I'm actually

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:19.960
in a country where I feel
comfortable as a woman.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.090
And I genuinely mean that.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.270
This is not because
the camera's rolling.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.910
I genuinely mean that,
and that's amazing.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.534
And I'm not sure how
many other places.

00:22:25.534 --> 00:22:26.790
I could say that about.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.400
And I go into a room, and
I find that most times,

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.800
people are gender-blind,
which is really rare anywhere

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.462
in the world.

00:22:32.462 --> 00:22:34.920
Having said that, we're talking
about Middle Eastern women.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.810
And there is that
stereotype of either

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:40.890
it's like this curious
mysterious veiled oriental

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.770
woman that still exists in
today's world, which is crazy

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.224
or the opposite that
they're all trailblazers.

00:22:46.224 --> 00:22:48.390
But then there are women
that are being left behind,

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.940
partly because of
our wider societal

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.050
and political problems,
especially, for example,

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.280
they always talk about the
impact of war on society.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.970
So in some ways, it forces
women to go out and perhaps take

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.590
jobs they wouldn't
have taken before.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.510
We saw that, of course, with
World War II and the impact

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.219
it had on Europe.

00:23:04.219 --> 00:23:05.468
And part of that is happening.

00:23:05.468 --> 00:23:07.020
But at the same
time, war is actually

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.630
making women's rights in
certain parts of the Middle East

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.770
really regress.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.450
So it's linked to
fear, intimidation,

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:16.830
how can you intimidate women?

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.820
And my father's family
is from Mosul in Iraq.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.050
And Mosul was subjected to
horrific reign of terror

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:29.130
under Daesh, and so
the only difference

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.870
between my cousins and I--

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.220
my father left, and their
father didn't, basically.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.400
And so the way that
it was actually women

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.740
and how they were forced to
get completely covered up.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.690
And their identity stripped from
them and they couldn't work,

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.315
and they couldn't do
all these things--

00:23:41.315 --> 00:23:43.516
that targeting of women,
as we were seeing,

00:23:43.516 --> 00:23:45.890
is actually making them progress
because even after Daesh

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.720
goes or different
extremist elements go,

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.670
it's still really hard
to break out of it.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.990
So it's really a mixed bag.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.448
But in terms of international
perceptions of Middle Eastern

00:23:54.448 --> 00:23:56.580
women, unfortunately, it's
still so stereotypical

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.330
and quite shallow.

00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:02.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for that.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:09.080
I have a question around the
edutainment value of media.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.410
And in order to get
the attention, in order

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.650
to capture the attention of the
audience, what we're seeing now

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.700
in my view is these
images and stories

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.580
that are really shock value.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.240
And I'm not talking
about fake news.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.935
I'm talking about things that
are really happening, but has

00:24:25.935 --> 00:24:29.730
really shocking images
What's your view of that?

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:33.308
Is this valid or what?

00:24:33.308 --> 00:24:38.150
MINA AL ORIABI: I think
probably the Syria story is one

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:40.970
that increasingly, we're
seeing shocking images,

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.860
partly because of
how horrifically

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.600
the situation is there.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.374
But partly-- and
this term really

00:24:46.374 --> 00:24:48.290
frustrates me as a
journalist-- you get people

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.846
saying we have reader fatigue.

00:24:49.846 --> 00:24:51.470
So we need to shock
people into caring.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.178
And I say, first of
all, I'm sorry you're

00:24:53.178 --> 00:24:55.250
tired that people are
dying, and their lives

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.240
are being destroyed.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.880
I find that really offense
as a term but anyway.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.710
And then the second
thing of actually,

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:01.850
those shocking images--

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.040
if you don't already
care, I honestly

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.020
don't think that's
going to make you care.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.745
It may make you stop and say,
OK, why do I make you stop?

00:25:08.745 --> 00:25:11.120
And I don't think it's going
to make you care or move you

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.174
to act because it's more
brutal or more shocking.

00:25:14.174 --> 00:25:16.715
So that's kind of the approach
we've taken at "The National."

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:18.740
At "The National,"
we have really,

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.120
really strict
guidelines in terms

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.760
of what we're actually
publishing, in terms of photos,

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.460
in terms of headlines.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.950
It's really difficult
because you see--

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.980
this image I think most of
you will conjure up now--

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.529
the bodies of children
wrapped in white shrouds.

00:25:34.529 --> 00:25:37.070
And it's been really hard for
us because people are like, oh,

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.000
well, it tells a story.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.680
Of course, Palestine
we have these images.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.810
For decades, we've seen them
coming out of Palestine.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:42.950
And it's always
been a thing of, OK,

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.390
but what is the dignity of
that child and their family?

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.180
This isn't their
choice to be published.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.637
And also the shock element
should be about the fact

00:25:49.637 --> 00:25:50.470
that it's happening.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.270
We can't be so graphic
that we desensitize.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.222
It's difficult because now
everybody can be a publisher

00:25:56.222 --> 00:25:58.430
because if I don't publish
it, somebody else is going

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.690
to put it on
whatever page it is,

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.330
whether it's a Facebook page or
their own website and so forth.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.430
So then do you lose out?

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.815
Should we take at
"The National?"

00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:07.940
It's fine, we can lose out.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:12.860
But I think we need to shake
people from complacency,

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.800
and it can't be done by
abusing actually the victims.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.560
So it's constantly
a conversation

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.530
that we have in our newsroom.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:30.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] how do
you compare it as an outside

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.290
and how does it affect
you as a journalist?

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.750
MINA AL ORIABI: Sure.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.630
So that's, of course, one
topic that comes up a lot.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:45.320
And I have to say, every
outlet that I've either

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.620
worked for or been a
guest of, a panel of

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.590
has its own guidelines and
own issues that come up,

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:52.740
and they're different.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.690
They're different--
whether it's commercial,

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.970
whether it's political, we
go back to the point of ISIS.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.010
Do you call them ISIS,
the Isha Islamic State?

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.422
I used to go on the BBC
many times to discuss it,

00:27:03.422 --> 00:27:05.630
and I'd be so angry because
they'd say Islamic state.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:06.680
I'm like it's not
the Islamic State,

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.880
and the anchor would
be looking at me,

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.860
like can you just like leave
that discussion to later?

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.484
Because we need to
get to where we are.

00:27:11.484 --> 00:27:13.379
So that's one thing.

00:27:13.379 --> 00:27:15.920
And then there is the issue of
freedom of expression as such.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.480
And I think freedom
of expression

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.720
as a concept is different
in different societies,

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.270
and it's really interesting
because recently, I

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.904
was speaking to an
American official.

00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:27.070
And the way she was speaking
about freedom of speech

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.060
is completely different from
how, for example, in the UK,

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.260
they speak about
freedom of expression

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.280
and the whole first
amendment and so forth.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.970
" then in our region, it's
much more about looking

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.730
at journalism as being
responsible journalism.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.410
And that has its
pluses and its minuses

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:40.970
because again, going
back to that point.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.219
I do actually think that
there are certain constraints

00:27:43.219 --> 00:27:45.260
that we place on
ourselves that we have to.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.390
And then there are
certain tricky topics

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.000
that it would be I think wrong
and disingenuous to say, yeah,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.894
it's absolutely the
same, whether you're

00:27:51.894 --> 00:27:53.060
in the Arab world or abroad.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:53.840
I think it's different.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.839
It's different in China.

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.090
It's different in Russia.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:57.330
It's a constant juggle.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.080
And one of the things that
you have to think about

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.410
is one, the safety of the
people who work for you,

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:07.530
two, what is the longevity
of your establishment?

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.779
So for example, again,
you'll have certain entities

00:28:10.779 --> 00:28:12.320
that are commercial
entities that you

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.832
want to stay on the right
side of one way or the other,

00:28:14.832 --> 00:28:16.290
to make sure that
you can continue.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:19.220
And that's not "The National"
but for other enterprises.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.720
And then there's
the politics, and I

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.965
think you have to be really
careful about what you do

00:28:22.965 --> 00:28:24.090
and how you write about it.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.754
But in all seriousness
and honesty,

00:28:25.754 --> 00:28:27.920
it's not a constraint for
us because actually, there

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.170
are clear editorial
guidelines that I adhere

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.290
to that I believe, and
the newsroom also adheres

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:36.170
to and is happy with it, in
terms of the battle of ideas.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.670
Where do we stand
in the Middle East

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.160
and especially in
the Arab world?

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.770
The situation where we're
in right now, in terms of,

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.930
do we believe in enforcing
religion into politics?

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.274
Do we believe in the use of
arms outside of state rule?

00:28:49.274 --> 00:28:50.190
And all of that stuff.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.400
And so we have, again,
clear lines on that.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.949
And that's where we stick to.

00:28:53.949 --> 00:28:55.490
So for us, that's
how we approach it.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.100
I think for others, it
comes down to what's

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.090
politically acceptable?

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.530
What's politically unacceptable?

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.700
And there are very
few-- people always

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.950
ask me what are the red lines?

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.350
I'm like, honestly, there
are no red lines and such,

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.390
but there is an understanding
of our societies

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.010
and where we're publishing.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.870
And this goes back to
the digital element

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.661
because sometimes,
you're writing something

00:29:13.661 --> 00:29:15.215
that will work for
a reader that's

00:29:15.215 --> 00:29:16.340
in your immediate vicinity.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.756
That would be
completely different

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.190
if they're Australian.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.162
And so we think about
who's our core audience,

00:29:21.162 --> 00:29:22.370
and who are our core readers.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:23.620
And we and we stick with that.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:28.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.381
MINA AL ORIABI: You choose
to ask the questions.

00:29:31.381 --> 00:29:34.303
You touched upon media
literacy now looking

00:29:34.303 --> 00:29:39.360
at the general Arabic-speaking
public in the Middle East.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.748
Obviously, I have my own
opinion about the quality

00:29:41.748 --> 00:29:42.748
of the literacy we have.

00:29:42.748 --> 00:29:44.914
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering,
what do you think about it?

00:29:44.914 --> 00:29:47.588
Do you think there is high media
literacy in the Middle East?

00:29:47.588 --> 00:29:51.440
Because we know that there
are many Arab journalists who

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.025
are doing excellent
work but there's also

00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:58.590
a lot of journalists who
are doing horrible work.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:00.701
So what do you think
about Arab media literacy?

00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:03.970
And if you can
improve it or if you

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.310
think it needs improvement,
what would you do?

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.812
MINA AL ORIABI: So when I
say media literacy, I mean--

00:30:09.812 --> 00:30:11.770
so I'm just making sure
we're on the same page.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.978
When I say media literacy,
it's basically all of us--

00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:16.240
how we understand news and
how we're consuming it.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.440
So it's for the reader or
the consumer or the viewer.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.670
Again, I think it's varied
from country to country,

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.160
but I don't think
there is a high level

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.230
of media illiteracy in the
Arab world or internationally.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.440
But if we're sticking to just
the Arab world, absolutely not.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.610
There isn't enough
understanding or awareness.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:34.450
You still get people saying,
I read it on the internet.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.580
And you're like,
OK, congratulations.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.290
Where on the internet?

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:41.620
And so that's partly
because technological change

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.910
has happened so quickly.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.270
But partly because it's not
part of our school ethos.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.340
This is not something
that you teach in schools.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.310
Again, if people have
strong history classes

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.339
and they understand
sourcing, then it

00:30:53.339 --> 00:30:54.380
gets ingrained with that.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.190
But most unfortunately,
in most of the Arab world,

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.912
history curricula is
not taught that way.

00:30:58.912 --> 00:31:01.120
It's not taught for critical
thinking or questioning.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.850
Did this actually happen the way
I'm being told it's happening?

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.330
So it's completely different.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:06.940
So we don't have
high media literacy.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.148
What would I change about it?

00:31:08.148 --> 00:31:10.840
I would honestly bring
in classes into schools.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.090
I would open up for more
journalists to go and speak.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.580
When I was living in the UK,
I would often go to schools.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.730
In the UK, and
actually, in the US,

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.520
I did this-- spoke at
schools and so forth.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.590
It's much more difficult here
to actually have the access

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.430
to go and speak about them.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.095
So I would do a program, where
I would have schools partner up

00:31:24.095 --> 00:31:25.970
with journalists to go
and speak about these.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.820
And again, just simple
things like sourcing.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.550
How do you see if a photo is
photoshopped or otherwise?

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.230
Because I think that's a life
skill that's really important.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.630
So I would start quite young.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.550
But then also older--
just simple things.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.120
Like you can't say, I
read that on the internet.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:38.740
What does that mean?

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.850
And sometimes,
don't even realize

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:40.780
but when you have
that conversation,

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.110
but when you have
that conversation,

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.193
they'll be like, oh, yeah.

00:31:42.193 --> 00:31:44.046
I wrote an article
for a [INAUDIBLE],,

00:31:44.046 --> 00:31:45.920
my former employers--
still people call them.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.580
But when I wrote an article that
was really popular a few weeks

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.890
ago, because I said,
you, the reader,

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.050
have a responsibility
for what you're sharing,

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.140
you get these WhatsApp
messages that says in Arabic

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.750
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
and it basically says,

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.160
as I received it, as I got it.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.409
And it's like what?

00:32:01.409 --> 00:32:03.700
And it's rubbish-- what
they're sending makes no sense.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.260
And you're like, how
can you send this

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.343
and then just write back
and say, just what I got.

00:32:07.343 --> 00:32:08.770
I held no responsibility.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:09.910
Because you actually do
hold the responsibility--

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:10.970
you're sharing it.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.330
So then to tell people
that they actually

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.730
have a responsibility
as publishers

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.920
but also distributors.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.960
JOYCE BAZ: Wow,
lots of questions.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.865
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:22.865 --> 00:32:26.562
AUDIENCE: Yes, I was just
interviewing Barack Obama.

00:32:26.562 --> 00:32:28.270
MINA AL ORIABI: Oh,
this was interesting.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:30.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.200
MINA AL ORIABI: Yeah,
oh, my god-- so many.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:32.920
OK.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.212
JOYCE BAZ: Which year was this?

00:32:34.212 --> 00:32:36.044
MINA AL ORIABI: Wow, I
should remember this.

00:32:36.044 --> 00:32:37.015
2011, I want to say.

00:32:37.015 --> 00:32:38.500
Yeah, 2011.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:43.300
OK, so I interviewed
American officials

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.060
during the Bush administration
times and the Obama times.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.410
The Bush administration people
were so much more accessible,

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.757
and they had no red lines.

00:32:52.757 --> 00:32:54.340
The only things they
would have is you

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.710
only have the time frame.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.450
I interviewed Obama
and Kerry, and they

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.730
were so difficult because
Obama-- they wouldn't even

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:01.970
let me go see him.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.620
So we did it actually by phone.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.560
And I said I'll fly.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.190
I'll come anytime they want.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:07.360
And they said no,
and they wanted

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.260
to control it completely.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.710
And the same was
true actually when

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.860
they-- although Kerry was
more fun because he actually

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.780
was like-- he was trying to be
like we've known each other.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.002
And I don't know him.

00:33:15.002 --> 00:33:16.710
But with Obama, it
was really controlled.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.010
It was absolutely controlled.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:19.940
The questions were controlled.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.570
And it was really
disappointing, to be honest.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.000
With the Bush
administration, I didn't

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.030
interview Bush or Cheney, but
I interviewed many others.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.610
And honestly, the only
constraint would be the time--

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:31.942
like you have half an hour.

00:33:31.942 --> 00:33:32.650
Do what you want.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:34.233
So they really
controlled the message,

00:33:34.233 --> 00:33:37.140
and they believed I worked
in Washington from beginning

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.030
of 2009 to end of 2011.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.610
They believed that
all we need to do

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:46.900
is tweet something out or send
you an SMS message saying,

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.920
we're going to send you a speech
that he gave, and that's it.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.984
I had only one background
briefing with the White House

00:33:54.984 --> 00:33:56.150
the entire time I was there.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:57.640
And then I had a couple
of other interviews,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.380
like with Ben Rhodes
and other people.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.340
But they really
controlled the message,

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.982
and I think it was to their
detriment internationally.

00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:10.624
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] what
your life would be like

00:34:10.624 --> 00:34:12.124
if your parents
hadn't [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:12.124 --> 00:34:15.800
What's the picture
that comes to mind?

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.554
MINA AL ORIABI:
Like I said, it's

00:34:17.554 --> 00:34:19.429
the only difference
between me and my cousins

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:23.600
is that my cousins
didn't leave, and I did.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.850
But it's also incredible
how resilient they are

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:27.409
and how much fun they are.

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:30.116
I saw them recently--
a few of them.

00:34:30.116 --> 00:34:32.699
For people from the Middle East,
like we say, I have a cousin,

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:34.580
and there's like 45 of them.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.310
Genuinely, I think I
have like 47 cousins.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.880
And so it's incredible
how similar we are,

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.040
and I think, again,
that's blood.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:43.940
It's incredible.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.830
Some of my cousins,
I hadn't seen--

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.549
my family was in exile
from 1919 to 2003.

00:34:48.549 --> 00:34:50.090
So I didn't see
family for that long.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:52.672
And we went back to
Baghdad at the end of 2003,

00:34:52.672 --> 00:34:55.130
and it was incredible like I'd
seen them just last weekend.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.046
So that's amazing how
like through inheritance

00:34:57.046 --> 00:34:59.780
and through your parents'
upbringing and so forth,

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.890
you're so similar.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.657
But life would have been
so much more difficult.

00:35:03.657 --> 00:35:05.990
I definitely wouldn't have
had most of the opportunities

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:11.450
I've had, but I would say
in terms of confidence,

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:12.560
I see that in my cousins.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.560
In terms of aspirations
and so forth,

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.630
it kind of hasn't
beat them down--

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.660
all the craziness
that's happened in Iraq.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.080
If you're from my
generation, you

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.400
were born in the time when
there's the Iran-Iraq war.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.857
You finished that, then you
had the Kuwait invasion.

00:35:26.857 --> 00:35:28.940
You finished that, you had
the years of sanctions.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.440
You finished the
years of sanctions,

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.940
you go into the 2003 war.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.270
You go into sectarian strife.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.230
You go into ISIS, and
here we are today.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.480
So people who are of that
generation-- and especially

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.850
actually, for many men
who are slightly older,

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.970
who actually had to be
drafted into the army,

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:45.710
it's heartbreaking
because the years

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.860
that they spent being drafted
into these senseless wars.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.260
So I think if I had stayed
in Iraq and if I was a man,

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.080
it would have been
actually that much worse.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.621
But at the same time, I
think I would probably

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:59.120
be very similar in character
because of what my parents have

00:35:59.120 --> 00:35:59.786
instilled in me.

00:36:05.105 --> 00:36:08.075
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:36:08.075 --> 00:36:12.777
I want to go back to a question
regarding [INAUDIBLE] freedom

00:36:12.777 --> 00:36:14.015
of speech.

00:36:14.015 --> 00:36:20.945
[INAUDIBLE] context of the
audiences, and audiences

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:30.230
[INAUDIBLE] journalists duty
to actually push the boundaries

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:36.575
[INAUDIBLE] are accustomed
to being exposed to?

00:36:36.575 --> 00:36:38.700
MINA AL ORIABI: Yeah and
we do want certain things.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:42.350
So again, it's a fine line,
and it's a negotiation.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.560
It's a negotiation with
yourself, with your editor.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.140
There's no external power
that comes and tells you, do,

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.589
do not.

00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:52.130
Definitely, in the Emirates, we
don't live in that landscape.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.410
I think it's different depending
on the country you're in.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:58.330
It's an appreciation
and understanding

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.500
of what would be acceptable,
what isn't acceptable.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.202
But I mean, to political
powers, not only to audiences.

00:37:05.202 --> 00:37:06.410
So it's your own [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:07.420
So it's also your
negotiation, and there

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.230
are things that you choose.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.400
And you say, no, I'm
going to push on this.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.230
And we have had
issues like that.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:15.100
And to be frank, I mean, touch
wood before I jinx myself.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.127
Since July 1 until now,
there's not been one thing that

00:37:18.127 --> 00:37:19.960
you've had somebody
turn around and say, no,

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.270
you cannot write that.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:23.355
Now does that mean
that we're careful,

00:37:23.355 --> 00:37:24.730
and therefore, we
haven't pushed?

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.439
I think we have pushed
on certain issues.

00:37:26.439 --> 00:37:28.604
I don't know how frequently
you read "The National."

00:37:28.604 --> 00:37:30.100
But we do try,
especially on issues

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.830
that we think are
of public interest,

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.110
and that is kind of
like our guiding force.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.320
But again, I don't
mean to belittle it,

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.780
but it really isn't that
big a constraint once you

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.721
know what you want to
be out there saying

00:37:42.721 --> 00:37:44.470
and why you're working
in the Middle East.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:46.617
I mean, there is a joy
to working from here

00:37:46.617 --> 00:37:48.700
to be able to say there's
a publication coming out

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:52.420
from the Arab world that
is able to tackle issues--

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.560
social issues but
also political issues,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.170
questions, certain things.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:58.990
Again, not easy-- we're not
going to do irresponsibly.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.090
But there is a joy in
being able to do that.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.715
JOYCE BAZ: Any more questions?

00:38:07.715 --> 00:38:08.200
AUDIENCE: I have one.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:08.850
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:09.966
JOYCE BAZ: Last question.

00:38:09.966 --> 00:38:11.400
AUDIENCE: This is
going to be a fun one.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.012
JOYCE BAZ: Oh?

00:38:12.012 --> 00:38:13.370
AUDIENCE: I know you've had
a lot of serious questions.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:14.262
JOYCE BAZ: Good to know.

00:38:14.262 --> 00:38:15.428
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Sorry?

00:38:15.428 --> 00:38:17.310
JOYCE BAZ: Good
positive note to end on.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:18.750
AUDIENCE: Good positive note.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.235
So you mentioned the
media [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:21.235 --> 00:38:24.983
how we accessed
[INAUDIBLE] before we

00:38:24.983 --> 00:38:27.335
had to wait till we buy
the newspaper and all that.

00:38:27.335 --> 00:38:31.414
So if you get to define one kind
of technological advancement

00:38:31.414 --> 00:38:34.630
'or like something in the
Internet of Things that

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:39.040
would basically either help
people to reach out to media

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.980
or to read the media,
to be more informed

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.920
and to get actual news,
instead of fake news,

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.350
what would be like your dream
new device or invention?

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:50.640
MINA AL ORIABI: OK,
so I have two answers

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.370
because my first answer
is, did you guys ever see

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:55.380
the movie "Minority Report?"

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.860
Right, so that
image of Tom Cruise?

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.860
Yeah, it was Tom Cruise.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.600
Tom Cruise was in the Emirates.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.550
Tom Cruise holding the
newspaper that gets

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.426
updated automatically,
which I guess it's

00:39:04.426 --> 00:39:05.550
like the modern-day tablet.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.777
But I wish it could be a
newspaper that gets updated.

00:39:07.777 --> 00:39:09.360
So that's like kind
of my crazy dream.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.160
If I could have
anything, my newspaper

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.340
would stay updating, while
still being a newspaper.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.260
But if I can't have
that, my second thing

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:19.180
is I guess is exactly the point
that you said about fake news.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:23.040
So if there is a way that we
can distinguish trusted news

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.620
sources and not trusted
or even if they're

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.480
trusted-- kind of like,
who's the ownership?

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.350
Like, let people know,
what's the ownership?

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:30.250
Where's it coming from?

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:30.791
What is that?

00:39:30.791 --> 00:39:32.310
But there's a way
that we can signal

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.830
that so people know what to
take and what not to take,

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:37.462
that would be the dream.

00:39:37.462 --> 00:39:39.250
AUDIENCE: Thanks, great.

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:41.230
JOYCE BAZ: Mina, on
behalf of all Googlers,

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:44.800
I thank you very much for
sharing such candid thoughts

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.410
and insights with us.

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:48.430
Thank you again.

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:52.030
And please do stay around
and have some great food.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.180
It's all healthy-- we promise.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.310
And thank you again.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:58.167
Thanks to [INAUDIBLE],,
Dena, and Miriam.

00:39:58.167 --> 00:39:59.250
MINA AL ORIABI: Thank you.

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.125
JOYCE BAZ: Thank you.

00:40:00.125 --> 00:40:05.000
[APPLAUSE]
