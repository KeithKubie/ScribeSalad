&gt;&gt; Sachs:
My name's Eric Sachs.

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:07.868
I'm gonna be speaking

00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:09.701
at the Google I/O conference
this year

00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:11.567
about some identity standards,

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:13.200
especially in the enterprise.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.734
What I'm gonna focus on

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:18.000
is that Web 2.0 mashups,
as they've gotten more popular--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
they've been fun,
but they mostly are designed

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.234
to mash up public data--

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:23.767
Google Maps, government data,
et cetera.

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:24.934
And in this session

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:26.100
we're gonna be talking about

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.167
security and identity standards

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:30.367
to enable secure mashups,

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:32.968
especially
in some enterprise settings.

00:00:32.968 --> 00:00:35.400
They're a whole mix of,
you know, different standards.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.434
Figuring out
what to use when is hard--

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:41.434
OpenID, SAML,
OAuth, OpenSocial,

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:43.467
strong auth,
portable contacts.

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.234
More all the time.

00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:47.801
So in the first section
of this talk,

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:50.234
we're gonna talk about
Federated Login

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:52.467
and some of the standards
in that space

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:55.334
such as SAML and OpenID.

00:00:55.334 --> 00:00:56.467
In particularly, though,

00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:57.701
we're gonna focus on

00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:00.701
how some of the Software
as a Service vendors

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:02.868
are leveraging this technology

00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:05.767
to improve the experience
they offer enterprises,

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:07.000
and in addition,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.400
we're also gonna focus
on some new trends

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.334
to make it easier
for small and medium businesses

00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:15.534
to use this type of
federation login technology

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:17.133
that in the past was

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.534
more really just
for the large enterprises

00:01:19.534 --> 00:01:22.200
who could afford
the complex deployments.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.701
Then, in the second
section of this talk,

00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:27.501
we're gonna move on
and talk about

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:30.534
how can you mash up
these applications

00:01:30.534 --> 00:01:33.701
running on different
Software as a Service vendors,

00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:35.834
or to make it even more complex,

00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:38.167
you know, what if there's
some code that you've written

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:40.534
that's running on top
of a platform

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:41.734
as a service vendor,

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.300
such as Amazon Web Services,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.667
Azure, Google App Engine,
et cetera?

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:50.834
You may even want to combine
something running on those

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:53.767
with a web service
running behind your firewall.

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:57.400
So this type of cross-platform
web service integration

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.267
is an area where we're seeing
a lot of consternation

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:02.367
and questions
about best practices.

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:04.234
Again, my name's Eric Sachs.

00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:06.868
I'm gonna be
at Google I/O 2009 in May,

00:02:06.868 --> 00:02:08.400
and I look forward
to seeing you there.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.567
Thanks.
