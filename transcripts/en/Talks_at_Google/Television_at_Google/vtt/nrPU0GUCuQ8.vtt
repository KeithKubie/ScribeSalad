00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.010
I'm Chelsey Kantor
from the Google+ team.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.600
And I'm here with three of
the amazing cast members

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.520
from the recently Critic
Choice-nominated for Best

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.525

is the New Black."

00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:09.396
Let's give it up.

00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:10.872
NATASHA LYONNE: Thank you.

00:03:10.872 --> 00:03:12.840
UZO ADOBA: Thank you.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.640
CHELSEY KANTOR:
Starting on the end,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.086
we have the lovely Miss Uzo
Adoba, Suzanne "Crazy Eyes"

00:03:18.086 --> 00:03:18.585
Warren.

00:03:22.612 --> 00:03:24.820
And in the middle, we have
Natasha Lyonne, Miss Nicky

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.320
Nichols.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.160
And to my right, the one and
only Yael Stone, Morello.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.482
So I'm going to kick it ff here
with a few questions for each

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:44.023
of you, and then a
few for the group.

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.500
And then we'll open
it up to people

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.958
in the room that have burning
questions they want answered.

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.340
But I'm going to start with you.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.750
And first congrats on your
nomination for the Critics

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.740
Choice Award for what?

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.130
Featured Comedic
Performer in a Series.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.810
UZO ADOBA: Yes.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.185
CHELSEY KANTOR: Did you know
you were in a comedy series?

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.580
UZO ADOBA: Good question.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.310
You know, no-- yeah, I think
there was this great balance

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.960
that Jenji-- Jenji Kohan
who created our show--

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.850
has managed to
keep with the show.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.029
And I personally feel that in
order for the world of comedy,

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.480
as I've heard Natasha say
and countless others say,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.380
that in order for that
world to really exist,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.320
you have to balance it
well with the drama.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.340
And the circumstance of
where we are, that in itself

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.360
helps to set the
tone of the drama.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.400
But you know, tampons
in a McMuffin are funny.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.125
And peeing on the
floor is funny.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:42.270
NATASHA LYONNE: And tragic.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.260
UZO ADOBA: And tragic.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.760
Exactly.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.220
It's a balance there.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.620
CHELSEY KANTOR:
Tragically funny.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.240
UZO ADOBA: That's right.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.156
It's tragically funny.

00:04:48.156 --> 00:04:49.480
That's exactly right.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.938
CHELSEY KANTOR: So the world
got to know you as Crazy Eyes,

00:04:51.938 --> 00:04:54.300
but I first knew you through
"Godspell" on Broadway .

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.690
And then because of that, on
"Project Runway All Stars."

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.680
So tell me about the
transition from Broadway

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.190
and fashion to prison.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.880
UZO ADOBA: Well, there is a
very clear fashion statement

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.390
in prison.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.490
And it is that there is none.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.080
No, but even in
the fashion though,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.860
Jenn Rogien, who's
our costume designer,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.970
does a really amazing
job with something

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.920
that's so uniform and singular
and finding unique touches

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.060
and nuances when you look
at everyone's costume,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.070
to display an individuality
and personality within that.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.300
But I think it's really
interesting whether it's

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.810
Poussey with the
sweatshirt, or if you

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.030
have my own costume
with the thumbs,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.400
or Nicky with the
rolled-up sleeves,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.300
everybody has a touch of
their outer self appearing

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.260
in their inner prison self,
which is kind of cool.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.900
But going from
theater to television,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.250
I thought it was going to be
this massive leap of a world

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.790
that I didn't
understand, just because

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.410
of the technical
elements of the medium.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.150
But what I really
learned doing the show

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.170
was that good stories
are good stories.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:09.010
If the story is good, my job as
the actor is made pretty easy.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.380
And thankfully, the
writers on our show

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.640
have made my job
easier with their words

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.260
and have just been so
phenomenally brilliant

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.930
at crafting a story that I
could understand whether it's

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.810
on a stage of a theater or
on a sound stage of a studio.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.290
CHELSEY KANTOR:
So I heard a story

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.480
that you went in to
audition for another part,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.670
but then they offered
you Crazy Eyes.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.890
So can you tell
us one, what part

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.860
that was, and what about your
audition, what they saw in you

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.150
made you perfect for
Miss Suzanne Warren?

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.340
UZO ADOBA: So sorry.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.870
That's a good question that I
too would like the answer for.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.100
I went in originally, I
went in and I auditioned

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.800
for the role of Janae,
who's played brilliantly

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.530
by Vicky Jeudy on our show.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.040
She's done a phenomenal job with
it, and it's completely right

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.500
and makes sense for it.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.370
I went and I read for that part,
and then I got a phone call

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.270
from my representation.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.170
And they said, we have
really great news for you.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.250
I said, OK, what?

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.980
What is it?

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.190
And they said, you
remember that audition

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.930
you went on for "Orange is
the New Black" this summer?

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.290
I said, yes, absolutely.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.755
Because I remember
reading that script

00:07:28.755 --> 00:07:30.270
and thinking to
myself of the things

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.236
that I had read that summer,
wow, that was really good.

00:07:33.236 --> 00:07:35.610
I would love if I could be a
part of something like that.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.740
That would be great.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.030
And then continued on.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.180
So when I got the
call, and they said,

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.626
you remember that audition
you went on for "Orange

00:07:42.626 --> 00:07:43.610
is the New Black" this summer?

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.236
I said, yes!

00:07:44.236 --> 00:07:44.352
Totally.

00:07:44.352 --> 00:07:45.268
I absolutely remember.

00:07:45.268 --> 00:07:46.980
They said, well,
you didn't get it.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.770
I said, OK, what's the
good news that you--

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.080
you said there was good news?

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.470
And they said, but they'd like
to offer you another part.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.800
And I said, amazing!

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.725
What's the other part?

00:07:56.725 --> 00:07:58.710
And they were like Crazy Eyes.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.177
And I was still like,
um, chicken and waffles,

00:08:03.177 --> 00:08:05.010
like I don't know what
that means, you know,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.600
like what is that?

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.150
But when I read the
script, it really

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.960
did feel like the right fit.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.499
That just felt right.

00:08:15.499 --> 00:08:17.915
CHELSEY KANTOR: So what about
her was already on the page,

00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:22.810
and what do you think you
brought to that character?

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.610
UZO ADOBA: What was
already on the page?

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:30.720
I think, definitely the
essence of her truest essence,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.270
which for me, I think,
is the innocence,

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.970
and her want and need
to give and get love

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.330
at it's fullest,
was certainly there.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.190
There's a line in the second
episode of the script when

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.370
they're introducing Crazy Eyes.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.300
Piper's coming into
the cafeteria in

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.850
and I'm paraphrasing it now, It
was written by Marco Ramirez,

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.665
but she's walking
into the cafeteria

00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:57.320
and she's looking
for a place to sit.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.570
And then she looks
right and there sitting

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.440
there is-- turn the
page-- Crazy Eyes.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.860
And he had described
her as someone

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.950
who is innocent like a child,
except children aren't scary.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.110
And I thought that
felt like the key

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.550
to the door that might
open this character,

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.670
because someone who is
innocent like a child,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.880
to me meant that
somebody who operates out

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.480
of impulse, who operates,
who acts and then thinks.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.970
Children don't have agendas.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.030
They're not calculating.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.330
They're not trying to
do something for gai.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.880
They're just doing it
for the purity of it.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.660
That animalistic survival
instinct of quality

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.890
within them.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.120
So that was something.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.390
But then whatever
it is that she's

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.640
doing though is not responded
to with the same affection

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.080
that it is when it is
a child is very clear.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.580
And so I just started
having this vision

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.810
of that sort of-- she's
a [INAUDIBLE] adult woman

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.620
with a sledgehammer
and a pacifier.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.190
That picture really came
to my brain, I said,

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.660
but that made sense to me.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.490
But somebody who's just
trying to give and get

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.870
love-- it felt
like a love story.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.830
That's all I could see
when I was reading it.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.840
I said, of this is
somebody in the deepest

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.939
and most honest pursuit of love.

00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:19.730
CHELSEY KANTOR: What
do you learn about her

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.120
in Season Two that you
didn't know is Season One.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.745
UZO ADOBA: Hmm.

00:10:23.745 --> 00:10:25.350
CHELSEY KANTOR:
And you can be as

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.310
specific or vague as you want.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.268
UZO ADOBA: I will
choose the vague route.

00:10:29.268 --> 00:10:30.642
No.

00:10:30.642 --> 00:10:33.616
What did I learned
about her in Season Two

00:10:33.616 --> 00:10:38.710
that I didn't know
about her in Season One?

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.120
How far she'll go for love.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.120
I think I asked the
question of myself,

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.230
because when we're
doing Season One,

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:52.830
I was really interested in
the experiment of answering

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.770
how far does
someone go for love.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.320
Would someone go for love.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.850
In Season Two, I have
a piece or certainly

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.912
a scope of that answer.

00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:02.745
CHELSEY KANTOR: Hmm.

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:04.440
Nice, little tease.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.420
So one of the many things that
makes this show so viral role

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.050
and shareable is
its quotable nature.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.790
And the one liners and
the scenes and memes

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.310
that they spawn
go across the web.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:24.730
So I'd love to know what your
favorite Crazy Eyes quotable

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.860
quote is from Season One.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.700
And if you can, one of your
favorites from Season Two.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.330
So I know my favorite
from Season One.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.490
UZO ADOBA: OK.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.100
Your favorite?

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.020
CHELSEY KANTOR: I
know my favorite,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.145
but I'd like to know yours.

00:11:35.145 --> 00:11:39.080
UZO ADOBA: OK, my favorite from
Season One, my favorite quote,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.810
I mean, how can you not love
"I threw my pie for you."

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.700
I just enjoy saying that.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.070
That's what Crazy
Eyes says, but I

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.440
have some pretty favorite lines.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.780
My personal favorite lines
are actually not the lines

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.575
that I say.

00:11:52.575 --> 00:11:57.440
I actually really love the line
that Sophia, played by Laverne

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.540
Cox, says "please is for
hoes and Oliver Twist."

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.290
I don't know why I
think that's hilarious.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.720
Every single time I hear
it, I think it's hilarious.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.366
I just think it's hilarious
every time I hear it.

00:12:07.366 --> 00:12:10.032
CHELSEY KANTOR: I think we'd all
like to hear a little (SINGING)

00:12:10.032 --> 00:12:11.104
"Chocolate and vanilla--

00:12:11.104 --> 00:12:12.270
CHELSEY &amp; UZO: Swirl, swirl.

00:12:15.307 --> 00:12:16.390
CHELSEY KANTOR: Thank you.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.110
UZO ADOBA: You're welcome.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.800
CHELSEY KANTOR: And from Season
Two, is there a favorite yet?

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.110
UZO ADOBA: From Season Two?

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.245
Do I have a favorite
line from Season Two?

00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:27.490
NATASHA LYONNE: Be careful now.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:28.240
UZO ADOBA: I know.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.420
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:41.120
I really like line
"Three, two, one, go."

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.890
With no tone put behind
it, so you don't know--

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.630
CHELSEY KANTOR: I have no idea.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.630
UZO ADOBA: I could be
like, three, two, one, go?

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:48.959
Three, two, one, go!

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:50.125
Like it could mean anything.

00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:50.625
Yeah.

00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:51.980
Three, two one, go.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.010
CHELSEY KANTOR: Thank
you for that, at least.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:53.460
UZO ADOBA: You're welcome.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.950
CHELSEY KANTOR:
This small piece.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.053
Natasha?

00:12:56.053 --> 00:12:56.886
NATASHA LYONNE: Yah.

00:12:56.886 --> 00:12:57.677
CHELSEY KANTOR: Hi.

00:12:57.677 --> 00:12:59.240
I would love to talk to you.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.050
So, lot of people here probably
know you from "American Pie."

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.090
But you've had an
incredible career

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.070
starting with "Pee
Wee's Playhouse."

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.310
NATASHA LYONNE: I'm going to
need something caffeinated.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.260
I can tell.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.985
CHELSEY KANTOR: And a major
role with Woody Allen.

00:13:13.985 --> 00:13:15.360
And where I fell
in love with you

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.970
which is "Slums
of Beverly Hills."

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.180
NATASHA LYONNE: Thank you.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.680
CHELSEY KANTOR:
Because it has quite

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.050
possibly two of my
favorite scenes in a film.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.190
One, can you tell us what
it's like to stab someone

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.705
with a fork?

00:13:27.952 --> 00:13:29.410
NATASHA LYONNE:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.250
I've never-- really done that.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.470
Who do I stab?

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.360
Carl Reiner?

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.920
I think it's Carl Reiner, right?

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.357
CHELSEY KANTOR: Yeah.

00:13:39.357 --> 00:13:39.794
Yeah.

00:13:39.794 --> 00:13:40.950
NATASHA LYONNE: Yeah, Yeah.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.340
That was an exciting day.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.880
Carl Reiner, and Rita
Moreno and Alan Arkin, that

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.800
was amazing, that day.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.900
CHELSEY KANTOR: And
then two, can you just

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.020
talk gibberish with
me for a second?

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.471
NATASHA LYONNE: Oh.

00:13:52.471 --> 00:13:52.971
Here we go.

00:13:52.971 --> 00:13:57.390
Says really, you know, I'm
not as young as I used to be.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.560
So it's like 20 years ago.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.479
Yes, go ahead.

00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:04.020
CHELSEY KANTOR: Hit a guy, hit
a guy, what a gar you to gyoo.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.980
NATASHA LYONNE: Et a
guy, I'm f'ta guine.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.090
Gibberish.

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:09.200
CHELSEY KANTOR: Gibberish.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.642
I can say, yit a goo,
ketagam fit a geet mitagee.

00:14:12.642 --> 00:14:14.100
NATASHA LYONNE:
Oh, I complete you.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.095
That's so kind of you.

00:14:15.095 --> 00:14:16.386
CHELSEY KANTOR: You're welcome.

00:14:16.386 --> 00:14:18.070
NATASHA LYONNE: I
have to say, I'm

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.580
almost teetering on concerned.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:26.235
But I'm also pleased to
hear it and grateful to you.

00:14:26.235 --> 00:14:27.134
Thank you.

00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:28.800
CHELSEY KANTOR: Because
one of my things

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.600
that I love about this show
are the little inside cultural

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.090
references that are made, like
with you and Kate Mulgrew,

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.430
when you say the line
about being her Spock

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.460
or with Jason Biggs,
making an American Pie

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.949
reference to webcam horror
in a shaving incident.

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:44.490
NATASHA LYONNE: Oh,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.410
CHELSEY KANTOR: Should we
expect more cultural references

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.080
in this show?

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.230
Is that part of what makes it--

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:56.790
NATASHA LYONNE: I don't recall,
is my honest answer for you.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.580
I know what you're
talking about.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.080
OK?

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.217
So I'm hearing you.

00:15:00.217 --> 00:15:00.716
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:07.970
I just honestly
don't remember which

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.620
ones were-- I'm sure--
there's another one.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:15.461
The one I remember is like
there is an exorcist bit, right?

00:15:15.461 --> 00:15:16.710
Is it your mother sucks cocks?

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.630
Can you say that?

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.510
I think right when
I'm talking to Mattie

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.505
on the-- about
kicking the-- right?

00:15:24.505 --> 00:15:28.500
There was something about the
drugs and the exorcist happens.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.480
And then I was also in "Scary
Movie 2," the Linda Blair part.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.830
So it's like the
inside within inside,

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.049
inside of a Russian doll.

00:15:37.049 --> 00:15:38.590
Deep, deep, inside
of a Russian doll.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:39.320
CHELSEY KANTOR: Deep inside.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.490
NATASHA LYONNE: Yes.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.120
But I don't remember
what happens.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.460
CHELSEY KANTOR: Tell
me a little bit more

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.160
about your relationship
with Kate Mulgrew.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.743
Because it's a great
part of the show.

00:15:46.743 --> 00:15:49.430
Nicky has such a troubled
relationship with her mom,

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.780
and Red serves as kind
of this surrogate mother.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.890
Will that relationship continue
to be important in Season Two?

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.860
And will we see it change?

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.360
NATASHA LYONNE:
Yeah, absolutely, it

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.430
continues to be important.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.010
And it changes.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.593
I like whatever's
happening over here.

00:16:02.593 --> 00:16:04.210
It's exciting.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.290
And I adore Kate Mulgrew.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.660
I mean she's got to be
one of my favorite people

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.580
I've ever worked with.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.140
She's so present and
forces you to kind

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.770
of like elevate the
quality of-- you

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.567
just can't lie to Kate Mulgrew.

00:16:20.567 --> 00:16:22.650
You feel like you would
be called out in a second,

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.910
like she'd almost
like stop the scene

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.785
and be like (RUSSIAN
ACCENT) this is nothing.

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:27.450
This is dirt.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.730
You can't give me
something better.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:30.510
Whatever.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.050
And obviously, I really
should have done that role,

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:37.550
as you can see by how excellent
that portrayal of Red was.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.680
And then, of course, when
she does break character,

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.470
I mean she is like a deeply
funny human being, Kate

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:50.980
Mulgrew, and just so talented,
but also like so filthy.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.250
And so like between
the sex and the fear,

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.330
it's really a joy
to work with her.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.032
She's really one of a kind.

00:17:00.032 --> 00:17:04.599
And certainly, yes, that
is true of Nicky Nichols

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:12.911
has deep mommy troubles, and
how great that in Kate, she

00:17:12.911 --> 00:17:15.369
really gets that figure and
doesn't want to disappoint her,

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.910
and yet, Kate's whole--
Red's whole trip

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.970
is kind of called into question
by the end of Season One.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.910
And obviously, there's a fall
out of that in Season Two.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.880
And so our
relationship continues

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.180
to be sort of like complicated
and grounded in a deeper love,

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:40.370
but also impacted by prison
politics, which is actually

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:45.213
the whole political
arena, prison politics.

00:17:45.213 --> 00:17:46.195
UZO ADOBA: Yes.

00:17:46.195 --> 00:17:49.130
NATASHA LYONNE: Yeah, you can
be like president or whatever.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.950
I'm sorry.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.220
I'm with you.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:51.937
You complete me.

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:53.270
CHELSEY KANTOR: You complete me.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.770
You made my life.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.470
Another kind of compelling
relationship for Nicky Nichols

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.460
is the one she has with Morello.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.550
There's an attraction there.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:06.710
What do you think it is about
her that intrigues her so much?

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.110
I think that--

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.110
YAEL STONE: Should I go?

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.950
NATASHA LYONNE: I
think that-- no, it's

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.450
just we're taking turns.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.332
You are next.

00:18:14.332 --> 00:18:15.540
CHELSEY KANTOR: You are next.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.555
NATASHA LYONNE: You just be
pati-- have some Diet Coke.

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:18.990
YAEL STONE: No, I just meant
if you wanted to be honest--

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.380
NATASHA LYONNE: No, no, no, oh!

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.246
Oh.

00:18:21.246 --> 00:18:21.860
Here you go.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.776
YAEL STONE: I should go,
so you can be honest.

00:18:23.776 --> 00:18:25.750
NATASHA LYONNE: So
here's what I think.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:32.370
I think that as far as my prison
wife goes, I'm in the room.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.220
OK, so as far as they
my prison wife goes,

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.530
I think that basically
Nicky is so cynical

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.560
and kind of like
been there seen,

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.760
that, gotten high,
seen the world,

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.440
comes from sort of like
this rich background

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.040
that she's kind of pretending
she doesn't in order to play

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.070
the tough guy in prison
and not get shanked.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.370
And I think that in
Lorna, she finds--

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.950
Lorna's so sweet and
pure and racist--

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:58.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:05.290
And I mean, in many
ways a very problematic,

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.340
morally problematic character.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:16.130
And yet, there's something
about her that feels so sweet.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:22.570
And part of what's insane about
her sort of casual racism in

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.880
and prison is that
she's like genuinely

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.530
doing it from a place of
not knowing that she's even

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.500
in the wrong, like your
whole "West Side Story"

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.270
bit and whatever.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.650
It's like she doesn't know
that she's saying crazy shit.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:39.460
And I think that for Nicky,
who is deeply aware of all

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.410
of that kind of stuff,
there's something

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.940
that feels very much like
if this girl likes me,

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.910
she means it, versus my mother
who's playing a head game

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.980
and is on some
manipulative trip.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.090
Like, if this girl's
spending time with me,

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.295
she's just not a liar.

00:19:54.295 --> 00:19:55.690
You know what I mean?

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.960
Even though she
wants Christopher

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.772
more than she wants
me, the fact that she's

00:19:59.772 --> 00:20:01.480
choosing me means she
actually-- and so I

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.050
think that that kind
of underlying truth

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.400
is at least what I've
worked out of why Nicky like

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.030
craves Morello so
much versus any

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.280
of the other women in prison
who may want to be with Nicky

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.326
more than Lorna actually does.

00:20:16.326 --> 00:20:19.093
CHELSEY KANTOR: Does that
continue in Season Two?

00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:20.676
NATASHA LYONNE:
[SNIFFS] I don't know.

00:20:20.676 --> 00:20:22.825
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:24.533
NATASHA LYONNE: I have
no way of knowing.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:33.690
It's-- uh-- well, Yael, does
that continue in Season Two?

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.170
CHELSEY KANTOR: Yael,
let's chat a little bit.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.580
YAEL STONE: I just want to
establish just that I didn't

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.710
mean should I go because
you were talking,

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.020
I just meant should I go
because you were going to talk

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.560
about us, and I wanted you to
be honest, rather than feel

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.620
you had to say nice
things about Morello.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.328
NATASHA LYONNE: Listen,
I feel like Nicky

00:20:49.328 --> 00:20:51.730
has nothing negative
to say about Lorna.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.550
I feel like Lorna
has some issues

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.510
to work out around
Nicky, that that's

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.850
potentially what's hurtful.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.400
You know?

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.670
Because I'm always
showing up for you,

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.590
and you're always
like oh, Christopher.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.080
Fucking Christopher, right?

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.144
I mean, it's like enough
already with the Christopher.

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:11.310
CHELSEY KANTOR: Let's just
meet Christopher already.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.100
NATASHA LYONNE: Is
this a PG thing.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.715
I realize I just want
to check in real quick.

00:21:16.715 --> 00:21:18.925
CHELSEY KANTOR: It will be
when we repost it later.

00:21:18.925 --> 00:21:19.716
NATASHA LYONNE: OK.

00:21:19.716 --> 00:21:23.210
Tone down for once.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:27.710
CHELSEY KANTOR: So let's
talk, Yael, about Lorna's

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.340
relentlessly hopeful
nature and where

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.460
you feel like that comes from.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.810
YAEL STONE: Probably in prison.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.940
Probably a place of
being under real strain.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.020
I think that that's when
we really reach the hottest

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:49.170
and really create the most
detailed fantasies about how

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.330
things are going to be good.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.432
Because it's tough.

00:21:52.432 --> 00:21:53.640
CHELSEY KANTOR: Preservation.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.510
YAEL STONE: Yeah.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.650
And along with that comes
the hair and the makeup.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.210
Because it's like I gotta keep
it together, keep it together.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.980
Everything's fine.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.580
Everything's fine.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.790
I think in opposition to that
is a really genuine relationship

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.340
there and a really
nice engagement

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.670
that's going on between them.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.813
But the other stuff is like
I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm OK,

00:22:16.813 --> 00:22:18.130
I mean, I'm OK, I'm OK, right?

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:18.630
Right?

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.430
I'm OK, I'm OK.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:24.950
Which I have definitely felt
myself and definitely seen

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.480
in other people.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.050
And it's like turned
up to 11, because she's

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.940
in some really
dire circumstance.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.790
I also think Lorna is
a pretty good player

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.890
in that political game.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:41.880
She's seemingly very ignorant,
and she is, in certain areas,

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.310
but she can play.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.630
She knows how to keep safe.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.930
She knows how to be
under the right wing.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.350
As soon as Madeline Brewer's
character comes back

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.940
from her whole
detoxing situation,

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.444
she goes to hug her
and embrace her again.

00:22:57.444 --> 00:22:59.860
And Reds like, nuh-uh, we're
not friends with her anymore,

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.940
and it's dropped.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.290
It's gone.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.650
She just drops her
sister like that.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.200
Because she needs to keep safe.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.470
And I think that's what's
so strong about this show,

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.000
the stakes are really high.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.205
You can get hurt.

00:23:12.205 --> 00:23:13.120
You can be iced out.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.680
You can be starved.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.940
I think that's the
success of the show

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.930
that the stakes are
like always up here.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.420
CHELSEY KANTOR: Do you think
that's why she resists Nicky,

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.860
because she has to play the game
smart and not with her heart?

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.310
Or do you think she
genuinely is still

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.047
holding out for Christopher?

00:23:31.047 --> 00:23:33.130
YAEL STONE: I think that
there's a tension, what's

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.716
really interesting about her,
and interesting about a lot

00:23:35.716 --> 00:23:37.090
of us as human
beings, is there's

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.670
a tension between our fantasy
life and our real life.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:44.840
And sometimes we compromise
decisions by gripping on tight

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.640
to that fantasy.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.170
And I suspect that's
what's going on with her.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.810
But that relationship
is always twisting

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.295
and changing and turning.

00:23:53.295 --> 00:23:54.920
CHELSEY KANTOR: So
everyone in the room

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.410
can tell she is
not from Brooklyn.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.050
She is Australian.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.370
And the accent you've
adopted for Morello

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.850
has been called the
best accent on TV.

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.100
So, bravo.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:06.460
YAEL STONE: Oh my goodness.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.873
CHELSEY KANTOR:
But it's sort of--

00:24:07.873 --> 00:24:08.839
YAEL STONE: Who said that?

00:24:08.839 --> 00:24:09.805
UZO ADOBA: The woman.

00:24:09.805 --> 00:24:12.260
CHELSEY KANTOR:
There was a vote.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.000
It's sort of gangster-film noir.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.410
You said it's sort of
inspired by Adelaide

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:19.467
from "Guys and Dolls."

00:24:19.467 --> 00:24:20.050
Is that right?

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.360
YAEL STONE: Did I
really say that?

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.234
UZO ADOBA: I love it.

00:24:22.234 --> 00:24:26.630
NATASHA LYONNE: (SINGING) A
person can develop a cold.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.820
I don't know where it came.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.420
I think there's a joy
in being an outsider

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.930
and being able to see a
culture in a different way.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:39.840
We, as Australians, we consume
a lot of American stuff.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.940
We mainline it.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.630
It's saturation!

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.976
So there's a sense
of being an outsider,

00:24:45.976 --> 00:24:47.600
but really having an
intimate knowledge

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.060
of an American
culture, and I guess

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.620
there's some parts
of that culture

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.270
that I've really
been fascinated by,

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.650
and I think it's very-- it
would be very fair to say this,

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:01.660
like a pastiche of sounds from
film-- definitely from films.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.300
CHELSEY KANTOR: Definitely.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.520
So we know that Uzo can sing.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.900
And you have a musical family.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.840
And your brother's in a
band called Blue Juice,

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.190
and you sang with them
before and your equally

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:15.420
musical sister.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.900
Will there be any singing
on "Orange is the New Black"

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.989
with this musical cast?

00:25:18.989 --> 00:25:20.030
YAEL STONE: I can't sing.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:20.760
I'm terrible.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.085
In fact, in Season
Two, there's moments

00:25:24.085 --> 00:25:25.560
of really making fun of me.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.170
And in Season One, like that
Christmas pageant thing?

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:28.850
UZO ADOBA: Yes.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.420
YAEL STONE: Uzo did
the ice skating.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.060
That was weird.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.330
UZO ADOBA: Yeah.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.810
YAEL STONE: Natasha did that
joke about the eggplant.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.350
That was almost
weird and very funny.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.434
And I sang (HIGH-PITCHED
VOICE) very high.

00:25:40.434 --> 00:25:41.350
I'm not a good singer.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.010
I'm terrible.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:42.595
But she-- wow.

00:25:42.595 --> 00:25:44.970
UZO ADOBA: Well, we have a
lot of people in the company--

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:45.230
CHELSEY KANTOR: That can sing.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.230
UZO ADOBA: Who can sing.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.200
Samira Wiley sings beautifully.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.802
Danielle sings
phenomenally well.

00:25:49.802 --> 00:25:51.010
NATASHA LYONNE: Annie Golden.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.120
UZO ADOBA: Annie Golden!

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.140
Annie Golden is a-- she
was in the T-Shirts,

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.700
like in a real punk band.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.220
CHELSEY KANTOR: So
musical episode?

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.386
NATASHA LYONNE: Lea Delaria.

00:25:59.386 --> 00:26:00.620
UZO ADOBA: Lea Delaria.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.250
Lea Delaria--

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.580
CHELSEY KANTOR: Scat machine.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.124
UZO ADOBA: A
beautiful jazz singer.

00:26:05.124 --> 00:26:07.290
CHELSEY KANTOR: We need to
see this in the episodes.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.800
YAEL STONE: Well, I mean, the
end of Season One was really--

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.620
CHELSEY KANTOR: The talent show.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.870
YAEL STONE: It was incredible.

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:14.730
That day, when we
shot-- when they

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:17.970
were doing the "Amazing
Grace" was just like-- crying.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.870
Crying, take after
take after take.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.645
It was the most beautiful thing.

00:26:21.645 --> 00:26:22.270
UZO ADOBA: Yes.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.020
YAEL STONE: Incredible
way to finish that.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.150
CHELSEY KANTOR: Speaking
of the whole company,

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.080
and this question's
for all of you,

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.379
the show goes through
flashbacks for most

00:26:30.379 --> 00:26:32.920
of the prisoners, which are a
brilliant way to kind of create

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.090
these fully-formed characters,
not defined by their crimes

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.760
or their race or
even their gender.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.750
So which so far has been
your favorite back story?

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.790
And which should we look
forward to this season?

00:26:46.992 --> 00:26:47.950
NATASHA LYONNE: Ladies?

00:26:51.387 --> 00:26:53.990
UZO ADOBA: It's hard to pick
a favorite, specifically,

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.660
just to land on one,
because I think they all

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.070
offer such a different
cross section of what

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:01.112
the show is about.

00:27:01.112 --> 00:27:03.570
You get to see-- I think what
you just said is so right on.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:08.780
What's so amazing is we get
to encounter each character

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.770
for who they are, not what
they've done necessarily.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:16.040
And what it is that
not by the crime,

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:22.150
but what emotional traumas that
they've been predisposed to

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.290
or encountered in
whatever situation be it,

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:28.050
Vicky's character
Janae-- what somebody

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:32.170
would do for love in part
or be it the absent mother

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:37.300
in Nicky Nichol's story or
Red and her family dynamic,

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.110
with the dynamic between
herself and her husband.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.300
Or Sophia and her back story,
watching that family dynamic

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:44.860
play out.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.690
So it's hard to
land on just one,

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.065
because I feel each story
is so fruitful and full

00:27:50.065 --> 00:27:52.670
of so many different aspects
of the human condition.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.050
NATASHA LYONNE: I will say
without saying anything

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.580
about what's coming
up, having read

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.120
the scripts, this season is
really exciting, especially

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.120
to already know the characters
and then to know them

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.650
as people, that now we've gotten
to spend some time together

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.570
is really-- it gets
deep this year.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.480
And so the favorites
or whatever.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.180
I always feel almost like
the show is sort of like

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.770
if "Roshomon" and
"The Wire" had a baby.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.320
NATASHA LYONNE: The
whole idea of there's

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.480
my version of events,
your version of events,

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.410
and the truth.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.960
And there's also this idea
of the scope of the show,

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.250
of like if you rack focus,
that person like way back there

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.840
in the corner who is
just a witness actually

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.000
is like the main
part of the story.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.560
And what's so amazing of
this show is the scope.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.180
It's just like if
you pulled back,

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.260
like we thought the
focus was over here.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.870
And then that thing that you
saw passing by the frame that

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:55.730
was like fascinating but
gone is now the centerpiece.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:59.300
And there's a lot
of that that happens

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.780
this season, where like
the people that you fell

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:05.830
in love with, it gets in much
deeper, and in hilarious--

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:08.850
like there's one person's
story I'm thinking of, like

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.490
[INAUDIBLE WHISPER].

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.600
UZO ADOBA: Oh, yes, yes.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.000
NATASHA LYONNE:
Like her story is

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.250
going to be fucking hilarious.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:14.540
UZO ADOBA: Yes.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.230
NATASHA LYONNE: And-- sorry.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.730
Hilarious.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:19.170
[LAUGHTER] And then
there's like other stories

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.250
that are going to be
like really heavy duty.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:25.138
And it's going to be a
very fun, fun year ever.

00:29:29.531 --> 00:29:32.534
I'm like and then it'll kind of
like flesh out the whole thing.

00:29:32.534 --> 00:29:34.200
It's just like it's
an (YOGI BEAR VOICE)

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.020
ever-deepening experience.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:37.770
UZO ADOBA: Deeper.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:38.728
CHELSEY KANTOR: Deeper.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.540
So we encourage people--

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.970
UZO ADOBA: I don't know why I
said it like that, but jinx.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.470
Because we said it
at the same time.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:47.840
CHELSEY KANTOR: We
encourage people online

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.673
to submit questions.

00:29:48.673 --> 00:29:50.220
I know we have
questions in the room.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.780
So I'm going to ask you guys
to head to the microphone

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.950
to line up to ask those.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.310
And while they're doing that--

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.450
NATASHA LYONNE: To the
window, to the wall.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:01.990
CHELSEY KANTOR: I wanted to
get your guys' take on another

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.690
topic that's been heavily
discussed on Google+ and across

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.580
the web over the past week.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.470
So the show's received
a lot of accolades

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:12.400
for representing women
and relationships

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.590
in a real, true way, not based
on convenient stereotypes

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.766
or cookie cutter things.

00:30:17.766 --> 00:30:19.140
And that's always
been important.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.930
But it seems even more
important in light

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:25.250
of the recent tragedy at
UCSB, and the #yesallwomen

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:27.340
hashtag and movement
that that started.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.150
So what I want to
hear from you guys

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:32.870
is what role do you hope a show
like "Orange is The New Black"

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.390
that exist to challenge the
status quo when it comes

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:39.660
to women's issues can have
in making this more than just

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.300
a trending topic?

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.420
YAEL STONE: I think the
evidence was this week.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.730
"Time Magazine"--
Laverne Cox was

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.149
the cover of "Time Magazine."

00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.648
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:47.648 --> 00:30:52.550
YAEL STONE: Like that's
a pretty exciting thing.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.410
UZO ADOBA: Huge.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.420
YAEL STONE: That is far
beyond the scope of the show

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.230
and probably what we
imagined the show could do,

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:04.880
and it's so wonderful to kind of
see that happening and changing

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.120
and this idea of the tag
line was tipping point,

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.600
like it's a moment of
change for a lot of people,

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.880
particularly for the
transgender community.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.140
I mean, and then just the
symbol bare facts of saying,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.010
hey, look at this cast life,
like on our call sheet.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.680
There are women and women
and women and women and women

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.120
and how rarely that
happens, I cannot say.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.990
Anything that I've
worked on in my life,

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.090
and I'm sure people of
much greater experience

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:35.200
than myself would agree that
often, the male-female balance

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.100
is not equal.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.110
And so it's really exciting
to have those voices

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:45.000
and be part of something
where we're not supermodels.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.702
We're all--

00:31:46.702 --> 00:31:48.618
NATASHA LYONNE: Speak
for yourself, all right.

00:31:48.618 --> 00:31:49.542
YAEL STONE: I'm sorry.

00:31:49.542 --> 00:31:51.390
NATASHA LYONNE: All
right, thank you.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.424
YAEL STONE: I'm sorry.

00:31:53.424 --> 00:31:55.090
NATASHA LYONNE: Are
we on the same show?

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:58.880
To use-- I feel like I'm
paraphrasing something Laverne

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:06.910
has said, this
idea of humanizing,

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.270
there's a greater
understanding right?

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.450
That actually is the
definition of paraphrasing.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.750
So I don't need any
judgment, alright?

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:21.500
I feel like that's kind of
happened, we put a face to-- I

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.950
was talking about
this recently, I

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.550
ran into this woman
was a judge in Texas.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.126
I ran into her in Palm Springs
and she's talking about like,

00:32:28.126 --> 00:32:31.210
oh I'm so happy,
I love your show.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.020
It's so great I sentence
people all the time.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.610
I didn't even realize
they were real.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:37.401
And I was like, what
are you talking about?

00:32:37.401 --> 00:32:38.260
This is terrifying.

00:32:41.965 --> 00:32:43.590
I had to be gracious
which is obviously

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.740
already difficult for
me, and a challenge.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.309
And the whole thing
was a nightmare.

00:32:47.309 --> 00:32:49.600
I was like, wow that's so
great, that you don't realize

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.780
the people you're sentencing are
real I'm so happy to meet you.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.160
But I do think that's part
of what this show is doing

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:01.100
is kind of really putting
a-- yes, I said this.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.320
UZO ADOBA: I think also what's
exciting on our show-- all

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.490
of those things and then
just the additional layer

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.800
of the behind the
scenes on our show.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.660
It's so great that we
have so many women,

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.750
and different types
of women represented

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.480
on the front of the
camera from race

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.130
to gender to size to
sexual orientation.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.430
All of these faces on
a single show I think

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:22.590
is important to underline.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:26.830
But then also once the camera's
been turned 180 degrees,

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.150
that same
representation of women

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:33.060
is reflected back in the
positions of Cindy Holland,

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.130
to Jenji, to the women
represented on writers,

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.810
to our visiting directors,
to Neri Tannenbaum, and Lisa

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:41.640
Vinnecor, and the
list goes on and on.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.300
That this concerted effort seems
to be happening with Netflix

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.110
aligning itself with
its pioneering efforts

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.080
in original programming,
continuing on in the background

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:51.580
as well.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.870
CHELSEY KANTOR: I have kept
them at bay long enough.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.665
So can we have the
first question, Erica?

00:34:03.665 --> 00:34:05.040
AUDIENCE: I thought
of something.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.039
Thought of a few things.

00:34:06.039 --> 00:34:07.830
Thank you so much for coming.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.090
In watching the show
and just seeing you here

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:13.170
it's just so clear that
you're obviously very

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:15.870
talented actresses as you're so
different than the characters

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:17.409
you portray.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:20.690
But what would you say about
each of your characters--

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:23.610
what parts of yourself do you
bring to those characters.

00:34:26.802 --> 00:34:29.260
YAEL STONE: I spend a good deal
of time laughing at Natasha

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.117
and I find that very
easy in my real life--

00:34:31.117 --> 00:34:32.200
NATASHA LYONNE: Thank you.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.030
YAEL STONE: --and as Lorna.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.717
That's what I bring in.

00:34:36.717 --> 00:34:40.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.559
NATASHA LYONNE: I mean I guess
that's piggybacking on that--

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:44.850
YAEL STONE: Don't piggyback me.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:48.050
NATASHA LYONNE: --which I enjoy
doing both on the show and off.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:49.840
I don't remember the question.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:58.590
I identify greatly with using
humor as a deflecting mechanism

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:02.859
in my life as well as Nicky's.

00:35:02.859 --> 00:35:04.400
UZO ADOBA: I think
the thing that I'm

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:12.480
most like with Suzanne is the
depth with which she wants

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.767
to love-- I have loved as
deeply, that deeply before.

00:35:15.767 --> 00:35:17.350
I didn't pee on the
floor or anything.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:18.646
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:18.646 --> 00:35:21.001
I did love that deeply.

00:35:21.001 --> 00:35:22.542
CHELSEY KANTOR: You
just threw a pot.

00:35:22.542 --> 00:35:23.970
UZO ADOBA: Yeah, exactly.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:29.210
But I do, I think that depth of
love, I certainly can relate.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:31.290
NATASHA LYONNE: And you
are loved as deeply, Uzo.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.350
UZO ADOBA: Aww, I
love these guys.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:34.950
Thanks, I really do.

00:35:37.639 --> 00:35:40.180
AUDIENCE: So you guys obviously
have really awesome chemistry

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.110
in the show.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.840
I'm just wondering, do you
guys also hang out afterwards?

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.190
I just have this image of like
Pennsatucky and Pornstashe

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.490
singing "My Heart Will
Go On" in karaoke.

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:54.739
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:54.739 --> 00:35:56.780
YAEL STONE: That specifically
has never happened,

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:57.820
I don't think.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.414
NATASHA LYONNE: Though, do we
have any real way of knowing?

00:36:00.414 --> 00:36:00.913
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:00.913 --> 00:36:02.037
YAEL STONE: That's so true.

00:36:02.037 --> 00:36:04.681
And for the right price,
I'm sure it could.

00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:05.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.040
NATASHA LYONNE: How
much money do you have

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.225
was actually the question.

00:36:08.225 --> 00:36:12.896
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:12.896 --> 00:36:14.100
I mean we do.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:21.150
Like we we're here,
we're at the fancy hotel.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.090
I came out of my
door in the morning,

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:24.900
we were all in our
exercise clothes

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.040
playing with my
dog in the hallway

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.540
only they were just coming
back from exercising.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.710
And then we were like,
we'll go exercise.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:35.420
So a lot of exercising
behind the cameras happening.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.450
You wouldn't know
it necessarily.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.220
One time Kate
Mulgrew said to me,

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:43.434
she said to me,
you go to the gym?

00:36:43.434 --> 00:36:45.790
That was a really nice
thing she said to me.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:46.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:47.400
Anyway we do.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.900
We do go to the gym.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.530
And then we came back
from yesterday's events

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.514
and it was Yael in
my room and then

00:36:55.514 --> 00:36:57.930
we were like jumping around
the room playing with the dog.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.460
There's a lot of--

00:36:59.460 --> 00:36:59.660
YAEL STONE: It's just
like babysitter's club.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:36:59.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:00.120
NATASHA LYONNE:
--a lot of playing

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.455
with the dog and exercise.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.300
We go eat together.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:13.020
I've never seen anything
like this where we really I

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:17.540
think that we made choice below
the level of consciousness

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.640
early on like either this
can be a disaster with all

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.640
these women, or this can be like
a whole other level of just so

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:31.210
much joy and strength and all
these sort of positive new age

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:31.920
themes.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.092
And we went for that one.

00:37:33.092 --> 00:37:33.592
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:33.592 --> 00:37:35.597
And it is terrific,
let me tell you.

00:37:35.597 --> 00:37:36.097
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:36.097 --> 00:37:37.545
YAEL STONE: Vagina!

00:37:37.545 --> 00:37:38.045
Vagina!

00:37:41.454 --> 00:37:43.890
You can say it.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.570
AUDIENCE: Hello,
thanks for coming.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:48.810
My question is about
preparation for the roles.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.910
Prison is a really
complex place, so

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:53.280
what did you do to
prepare for your role

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.930
and what did you
learn that you were

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:56.190
surprised by that preparation?

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.490
YAEL STONE: I'm going to
slightly skew that and say

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:09.040
for me, each day
I have turn up, I

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.950
have a very specific thing that
I like to go through for Lorna.

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:17.210
Because obviously she's a little
different from me in some ways.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:20.350
I like to start with
my prison underpants.

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:21.500
I always wear them.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:25.590
They're very large granny
panties, you know them.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.300
And then the bra
makes you breasts

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.100
go in this kind of
'50s style thing.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.840
And once I've got them on I'm
like, alright, this can happen.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.160
And then for me hair and
makeup is a great way in.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.770
For some characters
it's a wonderful place

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.330
to go inside-out.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.580
For Lorna, going outside-in
seems to work for me.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.910
And I really enjoy
that transformation.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:48.480
And the people to look
after us with hair and make

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.800
are very special people and
often under acknowledged

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.240
in a lot of these spheres.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.310
But that transformation
is incredible.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:58.439
And I often will find
from sitting down

00:38:58.439 --> 00:39:00.230
in the chair to getting
up in the chair I'm

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:03.589
like oh my god I'm suddenly
Lorna, and I didn't realize.

00:39:11.622 --> 00:39:16.800
NATASHA LYONNE: I got
by just showing up.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.270
UZO ADOBA: My preparation,
I did my homework as far

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:23.570
as reading the
book, and I watch--

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.860
I used to watch a lot
of MSNBC "Lockup."

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.930
Thank you, I love
that you like it too.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:34.050
When they're in there watching
through the window and the food

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.510
all getting thrown
at-- anyway, watch it.

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:44.970
As far as the day
to day, I do a lot

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:49.790
of walking both before
and after I start work.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:52.760
And usually as far as the
going in on the day to day.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.150
That relaxation
and the meditation

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:58.260
of that to both let
her in and welcome her

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:03.370
in as well as the putting her
away at the end of the day--

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.980
putting her back on the shelf.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.970
And depending on what the day
calls for-- sometimes a higher

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:13.710
shelf than others so that I can
put her away and say goodbye

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:18.670
to her-- I find to be very
useful in opening up the space

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.720
to allow for the music to sing.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.870
NATASHA LYONNE: Now I want
to answer my question.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:31.320
I guess what I do is think
about in prison you'd be there.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.670
You'd be there every day,
and like when we're there--

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:37.350
the way we're talking about this
morning-- by the end of the six

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.640
months that it takes
us to shoot a season,

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.235
we're so beat down
and beat to a pulp.

00:40:43.235 --> 00:40:44.610
At the beginning
of the season we

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:47.860
were coming off of a press
tour and hair and makeup

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.230
and, oh wow you're so great.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.690
By the end of those six
months, we're prisoners.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:59.220
We're really just exhausted and
kind of like underfed and over

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.045
sugared and just beat.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.920
Mostly what I try to do,
and such a joy of this show

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.570
is how little they-- it doesn't
matter if you get your beauty

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:16.650
rest or you ate too much
salt yesterday or something,

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:18.810
you got three hours of sleep.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.820
I try to really
live in that thing

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.330
about however I wake up
that morning, that's fine,

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.150
bring it to work.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.870
Not trying to--
because if you think

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.770
about really being
in prison, everybody

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.050
has good days and bad days.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.610
And some days you'd
wake up and you'd

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:35.200
be like, oh shit it's life
let me go do this thing.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.920
And other days you'd
wake up and be like,

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.520
I really don't want
to participate today.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.734
So I feel like I try to,
whatever the script is,

00:41:42.734 --> 00:41:45.400
memorize my lines I already know
who she is because we've gotten

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.990
to play them for a good
amount of time now.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.360
And then just try and
hold on to that state

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.340
and let it play into the day.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.530
It's a way to bring
in those levels

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:02.970
rather than trying to manipulate
myself into a certain something

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:03.630
else.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.190
I just feel like that's one of
the great joys of this show is

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:11.170
that we're not-- it's like
beyond cable, this show.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:14.370
So it's kind of a very come
as you are kind of gig.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:22.740
Like that's what is applauded
on our set is as much truth

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.750
and being as laid
bare as possible

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.380
is what's our language.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.800
And so I feel like that's
part of what we all try to do.

00:42:33.917 --> 00:42:35.000
AUDIENCE: Hi I'm Jonathan.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.230
I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:43.940
My question for you guys
is, a lot of my friends act.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.529
I used to act, and
I always wanted

00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:46.570
to get into the business.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:49.250
And for a lot of
people in my community

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:51.960
it's really hard to make
it, with limited resources

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.680
and not a lot of
positive support.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.149
I was just wondering
what did you guys you

00:42:56.149 --> 00:42:57.690
in terms of getting
into the business

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.590
and being a positive role
model for a lot of people

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:00.798
out there watching your show?

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:12.300
YAEL STONE: Well I
feel incredibly lucky.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.060
There's a lot of gratitude.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.390
And I know many, many
people who are deeply

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:21.840
talented human beings and I
think that we probably all do.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.460
People who are really
shining lights of creativity

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.470
and sometimes we get an
incredible opportunity

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.100
like this and you
take it and you say,

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.330
thank you and you
do what you can

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:34.940
to bring your whole self to it.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.680
And that's all I can say.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:43.280
I don't think I have any special
magic recipe other than just

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.200
I am so grateful to be here.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.360
So grateful to be here with you.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.250
And to be with these women.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.080
And to be telling such
a wonderful story.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:56.590
Thank you.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:09.240
UZO ADOBA: I think
definitely whatever

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:13.340
the area you can find
it-- to find training.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:18.290
If you can't go to school, take
class or read plays and things

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:22.520
like this are always important
just to keep your finger

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.319
tapped in.

00:44:23.319 --> 00:44:25.360
Maybe you're not working
on the job at the moment

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.980
but preparing for
it in some capacity.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.720
Gratitude and recognition
of that I think always

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.560
in any area of your life
is absolutely important.

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:40.350
I think it one, keeps
you sturdy and faithful

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.630
that something will come.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.210
And in saying the
something will come,

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:50.220
I can only speak to my
own personal experience

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.700
was when I moved to
New York to start

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.920
pursuing acting professionally.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.420
My mom dropped me off the
train station-- my family's

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:03.230
from Nigeria, we're
of the Igbo tribe.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:06.640
And my mom dropped me off.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:16.280
She turned off the car and she
said "Uzo, just work hard."

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.250
She's like, "all I'm going to
ask you is to just work hard."

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:21.810
She said, "I don't
know what will come.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:23.840
I don't know what will come.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.250
I don't know when it will
come, but something will come.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.880
I've never heard of nothing
coming from hard work."

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.750
And that has stayed
with me my entire life.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:34.690
I've never heard of nothing
coming from hard work.

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:37.570
I heard of nothing
coming from nothing

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:43.490
to borrow from
Lear, "King Lear."

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:47.140
Nothing comes from
nothing but I mean,

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:50.740
I've never heard of nothing
coming from hard work.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.640
What, the when,
the why, the how,

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.910
is less important to
the doing of the thing.

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:57.820
And something will come.

00:46:06.375 --> 00:46:08.949
CHELSEY KANTOR: We have time
for one more audience question,

00:46:08.949 --> 00:46:09.990
so you're going to be it.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:11.824
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
so much for being here.

00:46:11.824 --> 00:46:13.198
I was just wondering
if you could

00:46:13.198 --> 00:46:14.720
talk about what
it's like working

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.097
on the format of Netflix and
avoiding posting spoilers

00:46:18.097 --> 00:46:19.680
on social media or
anything like that.

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:21.240
Does that create
unique challenges

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.465
working on a show that is
streamed through Netflix?

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:29.750
NATASHA LYONNE:
What's the question?

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.820
What's it like
working for Netflix

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.710
and can you put spoilers,
is it hard not to?

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:34.090
YAEL STONE: The format.

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.927
NATASHA LYONNE: Yeah
I mean, it's great.

00:46:35.927 --> 00:46:37.010
We're having such a blast.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:38.810
I mean it's really
fun that it feels

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:46.350
like it's encouraged for
us to be as good as we can.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:48.430
It's not by committee.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.840
It's not like this
sort of watering down

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.000
the product and the
writing and like making

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.520
things as safe as possible.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.870
And keeping them as intelligent
as they are in the first draft.

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:07.010
And that's a real
treasure in show business.

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:11.057
That's really great as far as--
it's really great because that

00:47:11.057 --> 00:47:12.640
just kind of means
that we get to work

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.810
in a very protected
vacuum where it's

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.910
all about the sort of
creativity and integrity

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:20.010
and doing our best work.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.170
There's not a lot of noise.

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:25.540
And as far as the
spoilers on the internet,

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:26.760
it can be challenging.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.870
There are many
pictures that we take

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:31.750
the around throughout the
day that would be so much

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.900
fun to tell people.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.744
But really I don't want to know.

00:47:36.744 --> 00:47:37.910
I don't want to know things.

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:39.370
I don't want to know about
the end of "The Crying

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.165
Game," before I've watched it,
let me just watch "The Crying

00:47:42.165 --> 00:47:46.127
Game."

00:47:46.127 --> 00:47:47.960
YAEL STONE: Stop trying
to tell her the end.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.106
Stop it.

00:47:49.106 --> 00:47:50.920
NATASHA LYONNE: I
haven't seen it yet.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.500
But I just want
you to not tell me

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:58.020
what happens at the end
of "The Crying Game."

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.890
YAEL STONE: I think the
format the way it's laid out,

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:05.210
it's like, here's the feast, you
can eat it as fast as you want

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:06.480
or as slow as you like.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.660
And some people are like
nibble, nibble, nibble.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:09.993
Other people are like [GNAWING].

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:14.560
I think that's a great thing.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.560
We love choice.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.030
That's kind of the
world we live in now.

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:20.250
People delight in being
like, oh my god, I

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:22.391
watched it all in a
row, it was amazing.

00:48:22.391 --> 00:48:23.890
And other people
are like, I'm going

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:26.530
to spend the next year
watching this thing,

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:31.860
and only watch one
frame every night.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.620
I think that that's really
a joyful experience.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.710
It also means that people
get sucked into this stream.

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:40.380
So narrative-wise
you can tell stories

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.110
in a really fast direct way.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:43.890
You're not recapping.

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:45.340
If a viewer wants
to go back, they

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.270
can go back in their own
time and re-watch something,

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:50.060
get clarification on something.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.070
But otherwise it's just like
go, go, go, you can keep going.

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:55.820
And I think that
does have something

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:59.460
to do with the fervor
of people's excitement.

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.580
Because they've had
this experience.

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.135
It's like a Michael Barney film.

00:49:05.135 --> 00:49:07.260
People are just in there
for eight hours just like,

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:11.100
my god this is my life.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:14.490
So I think that the format is
a really successful format.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.570
And it is acknowledging
that people want choice

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.236
with the way they
watch things, and they

00:49:18.236 --> 00:49:22.509
don't want to wait every
week for that one hour.

00:49:22.509 --> 00:49:24.300
NATASHA LYONNE: And
what you said yesterday

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.790
whatever which is
that it ends up

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:31.480
appealing to the highest
common denominator, rather

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.900
than that sort of
undermining the intelligence

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:38.020
of the audience, like
you said that yesterday.

00:49:41.684 --> 00:49:42.475
UZO ADOBA: I agree.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.960
I agree, I think it's true.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.845
The way that the
format is set up,

00:49:48.845 --> 00:49:54.480
I think it's writing for
the entire shape of a piece

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.160
rather-- and I think what we
have that's really exciting

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.600
is-- the writers
have the opportunity

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.760
to tell the stories that
they want to tell start

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.600
to finish and see
those through, rather

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.910
than writing to a response.

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:08.560
Does that make sense?

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.800
And that I think has been
very interesting to watch

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:16.220
when you allow the art to
exist fully and completed.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:21.250
How people that have been,
thankfully delighting in it

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:22.360
in that way.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.412
You're allowing them to
give their full voice be

00:50:24.412 --> 00:50:27.460
it from the writing's end
and also from the performance

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:31.040
then that's been
really wonderful.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.700
And that it's consumed
equally as well.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:38.860
And I think yeah,
the binging element--

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:42.260
I think of it like Burger
King, you can have your way.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.360
Like, really.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.570
You can really just enjoy it
the way you want to watch it.

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:50.230
I don't know yet, I
haven't seen the hindrance

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:52.039
from having it laid
out all at once.

00:50:52.039 --> 00:50:53.580
NATASHA LYONNE: And
there's something

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.260
I heard Jenji say
the other day, which

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.270
is this idea of there's kind
of like no small characters

00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:59.340
in this format.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:03.790
So that even if a character is
only living in little bursts

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:06.490
or like one scene every
two episodes or something,

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:09.800
the nature of watching
13 hours of something

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:13.950
means that character
becomes very vital.

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:17.330
So that idea is also
sort of exciting.

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:21.050
That you can just
give little flavorings

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:22.460
in the salt and
pepper seasoning.

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.150
YAEL STONE: Having
said that, I tried

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:27.070
to walk around the city
with Connie Shulman, who

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:28.780
plays Yoga Jones.

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:31.020
That's a really
interesting experience

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.660
because people are
obsessed with Yoga Jones.

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.610
And if you added
up all the time,

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:37.970
she's not there that often.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:42.120
But that experience of just
like this full family, people

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.000
have a real sense of characters.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.730
And it's a real sense
of depth, in what

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:50.340
otherwise might be a cameo.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.660
UZO ADOBA: Yeah that's right.

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.530
Like what Natasha
was just leaning on,

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.559
when Jenji said that, I
thought that was so smart

00:51:56.559 --> 00:51:57.350
when she said that.

00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:02.180
Because characters that could
easily be misplaced on a series

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:05.820
that you roll out over
the course of 26 weeks--

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:09.970
because people watch it
sort of close together,

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:14.190
someone that popped in as a
pop of color in one episode,

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:17.520
suddenly now in another
season or four episodes

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:21.700
later or six episodes
later can have a back story

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:23.490
and you can track
it because you just

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.916
watched it three hours ago.

00:52:25.916 --> 00:52:27.860
CHELSEY KANTOR: It's
almost like a great book.

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.651
You can either read it
all the way through,

00:52:29.651 --> 00:52:31.520
or you could read a
chapter at a time,

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.910
but it builds like
a great story.

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:35.190
UZO ADOBA: It's very Dickensian
in that way, as well.

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:38.350
The way that we-- "A Tale of
Two Cities," where somebody you

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:40.860
meet in the beginning,
you think but they

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:45.220
have such an important--
Charles Darcy suddenly

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.210
is so-- that's the most
important character

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:52.042
in the whole way.

00:52:52.042 --> 00:52:53.750
CHELSEY KANTOR: We're
going to wrap it up

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:58.000
and I want to give each of
you one sentence to describe

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.130
what makes season two great.

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:04.480
Just one phrase to describe
what makes season two great.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.200
YAEL STONE: I did a stunt.

00:53:19.717 --> 00:53:21.050
CHELSEY KANTOR: Just brain dump.

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.188
NATASHA LYONNE:
Turn down for what?
