it's a strange - strange thing so I did

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170
it's a strange - strange thing so I did
 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.290
it's a strange - strange thing so I did
that a bit too and then you know the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300
that a bit too and then you know the
 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.030
that a bit too and then you know the
older you get realized the less you know

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040
older you get realized the less you know
 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.660
older you get realized the less you know
and you know some things and I guess the

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670
and you know some things and I guess the
 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.420
and you know some things and I guess the
key thing is to don't make a decision on

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430
key thing is to don't make a decision on
 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.610
key thing is to don't make a decision on
bit on based on some fear of the unknown

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620
bit on based on some fear of the unknown
 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.330
bit on based on some fear of the unknown
I mean I make decisions based on fear of

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340
I mean I make decisions based on fear of
 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.490
I mean I make decisions based on fear of
the known all the time I mean

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500
the known all the time I mean
 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.940

what the voting booth is hopefully for

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950
what the voting booth is hopefully for
 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.580
what the voting booth is hopefully for
but if it's something based on fear of

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590
but if it's something based on fear of
 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.910
but if it's something based on fear of
the unknown it's probably a bad decision

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920
the unknown it's probably a bad decision
 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.820
the unknown it's probably a bad decision
that's the only thing I know
