00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.480
LAURA LING: This is
Louis Bird, a 24-year-old

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.020
in the midst of rowing
2,400 miles from the coast

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.020
of California to Hawaii.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.890
By the time he
finishes, the journey

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.830
will take 54 days
and 42 minutes,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.710
in which Louis will rely
on the memory of his father

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.850
to survive the immense
challenge ahead of him.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.060
Tell me about your
father, Peter Bird.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.950
LOUIS BIRD: He was the first man
to row the Pacific Ocean solo,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.360
in 1983.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.750
It took him 294 days from
San Francisco to Brisbane.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.780
And then after that, it
was just always in him.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.269
PETER BIRD: I know that it's
just one oar-stroke at a time.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.190
You don't want to take that
oar-stroke, but once it's gone,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.560
then the next one's there.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.320
It's just-- that's
all I can about it.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.260
It's just like life.

00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:15.440
LOUIS BIRD: My father
passed away in 1996.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.710
I had five years with him.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.110
I've got a few really
precious memories of him.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.817
He was lost at sea in 1996.

00:01:21.817 --> 00:01:22.400
He was rowing.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.410
It was his fifth attempt
to row the North Pacific.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.370
And about 1,000
miles into his trip,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.020
they think that a
rogue wave hit him.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.750
And they found his boat
floating upside down,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.990
without any sign of my father.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.760
So, that's why this particular
row in the Pacific Ocean

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.670
means so much to me.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.205
I'm trying to get out there
and understand for myself what

00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:44.349
it feels like to be on
a boat in the middle

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:45.973
nowhere for an extended
period of time.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.190
LAURA LING: Have you
been on a boat before?

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.470
Are you a rower?

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.200
LOUIS BIRD: My experience
rowing is about six hours ocean

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.262
rowing.

00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:59.220
Growing up, I've always
been terrified of water

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.670
I can't see the bottom of.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.190
I've done lots of courses,
and I can navigate.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.514
But as far as time in the
sea goes, I'm a real novice.

00:02:07.514 --> 00:02:08.930
LAURA LING: What
do you ultimately

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.460
hope to get out of this row?

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.470
LOUIS BIRD: I believe
a lot that my father's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.242
going to be out there with me.

00:02:14.242 --> 00:02:16.960
And without putting too
much pressure on myself,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.980
I hope to find a little
bit of bit of closure

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.680
in my father's death.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.450
LAURA LING: After
months of preparation,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.820
Louis set off from California
with his rowing partner.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.000
LOUIS BIRD: OK, so we're
four days in, out here

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.370
in this bizarre alien world.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.400
I have found it quite
hard to adjust out here,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.330
if I'm being honest.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.910
I'm missing friends and family.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.460
It's tough.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.100
I'm so tired.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.540
At the moment, we're sleeping
about four hours a night

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.150
over a 24-hour period,
and rowing the rest.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.250
PETER BIRD: I'm homesick.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.260
I miss my family.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.572
I miss Louis very much.

00:02:57.572 --> 00:03:01.220
I miss him so
much, it's painful.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.910
I really wonder what
the hell I'm doing here.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.080
LOUIS BIRD: Warming up
OK in the next minute,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.400
I'd rather be anywhere
else but here.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.180
I'd like to see
some nice-- I want

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.380
to see a sunset and a sunrise,
some stars and a blue sky,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.550
and I'll be happy.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.800
It's just emotional, isn't it?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.270
About everything.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.350
Peter, my father-- he
must done this before,

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.090
this acclimatization period.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.090
PETER BIRD: It's got me.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.920
I'm just sick of
the whole thing.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.952
I want to see something
green for a change.

00:03:32.952 --> 00:03:36.460
It's just all blue, blue, blue,
and it makes me feel blue.

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:49.140
LOUIS BIRD: Finally, some
sunshine after-- what is it?

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.706
A week and a half now.

00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:52.080
We turned everything
on its head.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.226
There's light at the
end of the tunnel.

00:03:54.226 --> 00:03:59.670
We might be about 450 miles
off the coast of Mexico.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.155
Got 99 miles [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.480
So, we're on Day 20, and it's
been a beautiful day with sun,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.534
as you can probably
tell by my burn.

00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:26.200
I'm feeling close to
Dad, which is nice.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.310
I had a very-- I had the most
vivid dream of my entire life.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.570
Me and my mum were
painting someone's house,

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.870
and he just turned up at
the door unexpectedly.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.280
We got to speak, and we
got to laugh and joke

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.870
for the first time.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.810
I never had a dream that
vivid of him before,

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.530
and here I am in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.160
And it's all making sense.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.470
PETER BIRD: It's my 180th
day at sea, and my birthday.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.950
LOUIS BIRD: It is Day 29.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.148
It's Day 30.

00:04:57.148 --> 00:05:00.560
We're somewhere in the
Pacific, blah, blah, blah.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.272
Over a month in this
boat, part of me

00:05:02.272 --> 00:05:03.896
is looking forward
to getting to Hawaii

00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:05.584
and joining real life again.

00:05:05.584 --> 00:05:07.500
There were some dark
moments on the boat where

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.400
I've been in tears,
and just emotionally

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.007
coming to the place that holds
the end of my father's life.

00:05:14.007 --> 00:05:15.840
I hadn't prepared for
the fact that it would

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.760
be as difficult as it has been.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.090
But now I've kind of
made a breakthrough.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.320
And I feel a lot more
confident on the boat.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.320
We're over half way.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.289
I'm enjoying myself.

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.580
LAURA LING: Do you feel like
this has sort of given you

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.272
a new purpose?

00:05:27.272 --> 00:05:28.230
LOUIS BIRD: Absolutely.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.897
It is, without a doubt,
the most important thing

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:31.980
I've ever done in my life.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.510
And every single
stage has enabled

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.470
me to relate to a point
in my father's life.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.910
And it's like unlocking
a door in somewhere

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.280
I could never get into without
taking on something like this.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.210
We're four and a
half hours away.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.550
We're 17 miles away.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.741
We've nearly done it.

00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:50.560
Look at that.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.364
Land ho.

00:05:53.945 --> 00:05:55.050
I can't believe it.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.640
I can't even imagine
this is happening.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.560
We've nearly made it.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.980
It sounds a bit cheesy, but
he's completely within me.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.190
And wherever I go,
he comes with me.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.440
And I completely believe that.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.260
We're both ocean rowers.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.250
We'll always have
that now together.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.750
I miss him.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.240
And I hope that he's smiling
down from wherever he is.

00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:28.002
