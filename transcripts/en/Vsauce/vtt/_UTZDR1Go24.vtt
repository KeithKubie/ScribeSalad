00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.380
Do you consider yourself a fan of dogs?
Or cloud ice cream?

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.680
Well, it's episode 47 of IMG!

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.680
This is a mirror and this is clear glass.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.530
A broccoli tree house and, with the right
outline, Europe can be a dragon.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.800
In the early 1900s, Arthur S. Mole and John
D. Thomas took photos of thousands of American

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.269
soldiers standing in shapes from atop a tower.
Here they are as the Statue of Liberty.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.830
In the front, there are 17 men.
The men in the torch are a half mile away and

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.510
of the 18,000 men arranged into this shape,
12,000 of them are in the torch.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.120
The photographers also got people to stand
in the shape of Uncle Sam, President Woodrow

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.910
Wilson and a panther.
Subaru backwards is Ur A Bus and this piece

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.850
of furniture is actually a cake.
But this storm trooper?

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.620
Well, he's also a cake.
If you were a lot of rings, you can make your

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.100
fist Pac-Man.
And a stereographic projection projects a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.829
sphere onto a flat plane.
A complete 360 degree view gets wrapped up

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.729
in a circle.
Josh Summers makes some of my favorites.

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.840
It's as if everything you can see from where
you're standing becomes its own planet.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.750
Bongiovanni's paintings of birds look like
reality is melting.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.759
But Takeshi Kawano's melting animal sculptures
are even more liquid-y.

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.350
Lots of things will melt when our Sun dies.
At first, it will expand and become a red

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.649
giant, eventually swallowing the Earth.
As water boils away, we will be left with

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.229
this - what Earth would look like without water.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.289
And this is what Mars would look like with water.

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.309
But Niagara Falls without water?
Well, it's happened.

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:58.700
In 1969, the army core of engineers dammed
the river to strengthen some faults and slow

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.779
its erosion.
Lay on the ground and take a photo straight

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:06.999
down to put yourself in cool positions.
And here's a map of a global subway system.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.640
Buzzfeed collected 9 pictures of cats wrapped
up like burritos, but for the montage let's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.110
take a look at forever alone?
Nailed it.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.950
Nails bent into different situations by Andrei Nikolaev.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.340
When you're this happy, your eyes are actually
drooling smiley faces.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.680
Oh, and this cat's mouth is an angry bunny.
Wow, well, at least dogs haven't enslaved

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.150
kids yet.
Oh.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.060
Bruce Lowell sources LEGO parts and creates
fantastic items.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.810
A taco, a sandwich or a LEGO paint effect.
This painting is also an effect.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.610
The woman is a real person.
Alexa Meade uses acrylic paint on people's

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.670
bodies to make them look like paintings of
themselves.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.040
These people aren't painted, but they don't
know each other.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.780
I've always loved this project.
Artist Richard Renaldi walks around and finds

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.590
total strangers out in public.
He then asks them, despite the fact that they

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.850
don't know each other, to pose for photos
as if they were close friends or lovers.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.860
Strangers also touch when cartoon characters
are placed in famous paintings.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.290
And here are some hipster Disney princesses.
Or, the princesses as super heroes.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.450
Oh, remember those living photographs of soldiers?
Another type of living photograph is this.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.320
Many YouTube videos are quick paced and jump
cut every 4 seconds, but living photographs

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.760
do the opposite.
The subject poses for minutes, like when you're

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.500
taking a picture of someone but forget you're
in video mode.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.040
Watching is kind of amazingly awkward.
And the cloth wrapped around these trees lines up

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.670
with the mountains in the distance, which,
my friends, is artwork.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.830
And as always,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.630
thanks for watching.
