00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.090
This next problem is a bit of
a classic and I've actually

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.740
gotten multiple requests to do
some variation of this problem.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.190
So it says find the volume of
the largest open box-- It can

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.210
be made from a piece of
cardboard-- 24 inches square.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.910
So let me draw my
piece of cardboard.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.200
I don't want to
draw it filled in.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.120
So my piece of cardboard
is going to be a square.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.260
I'll draw it pretty big,
because I want you

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.300
to visualize it.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.640
And it's 24, what did they say?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.595
24 inches square.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:39.370
So it is 24 by 24 square
by cutting equal squares

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.230
from the corners and
turning up the sides.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.050
So what are they saying?

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.290
Well, they're saying
we're going to cut equal

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.820
squares from the corner.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.850
So let's say we cut-- let me
see if I can draw this well

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.690
--so I'm going to cut a square
here, and I'm going to cut an

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.810
equal size square there-- draw
this neatly --and then cut an

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.100
equal size square there,
and then cut an equal

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.123
size square there.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.810
So I'm going to cut out those
corners and then I'm going

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.540
to fold up the sides.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.930
Just so you can visualize it,
so those dotted lines are where

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.120
I would actually fold the box,
and then I would end

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.100
up with an open box.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.310
And let's see what the
dimensions would be.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.470
And that's actually what the
whole crux of the problem is.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.840
So how big of a squares should
I cut out in order to maximize

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.900
the volume up the box?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.220
Well, these are equal sided
squares that I'm cutting

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.945
out, so let's say
that each side is x.

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:44.405
So if this x, then this x, this
is x, this is x, this is x,

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:48.360
this is x, this is x,
this is x, this is x.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.880
And then what is going to be
the volume of our box when

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.730
we fold up everything?

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.860
Let me see, so I'll
draw the base.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.610
So this dotted square
right here, that's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.630
going to be the base.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.150
I'll draw it at an angle.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.050
That's the base.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.700
And what are the
dimensions of the base?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.400
Well, this base is going to be
the length of this side of the

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.750
cardboard minus this x
minus this x, right?

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.510
So this base right here, that
is going to be 24 minus 2x.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.010
It's just the whole length
minus this minus that;

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.360
that's how long that is.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.400
And of course, this is going to
be the same length, this is

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.810
going to be the same length.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.130
All of these sides of the
base are 24 minus 2x.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.100
And then this side is
also 24 minus 2x.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.840
And then what is going to
be the height of this open

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.410
box that we're creating?

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.770
Let me draw the sides of it.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.100
It's open, which means it
doesn't have a top to it.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.420
So we have an opening here,
so you can kind of see

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.720
the inside of the box.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.990
And what is this height?

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.850
Well, when you fold these
flaps up the height is x.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.742
If you can think about it--
here this is really just a bit

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:10.600
of visualization --this side
right here, that you can view

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.660
as this thing right here.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.380
I can even do it in a
different color for you.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.040
You can view this side,
this front facing side

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.450
as this right here.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.156
I'll just do a couple; you
I don't have to do all of

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:24.580
the side, I don't think.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.120
You could view this side
as this side right here.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.390
Right?

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.330
It's folded up.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.660
And then this backside is this
backside, and that side there

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.320
is that and this is the base.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.710
Anyway, so that is the volume
of our open box and we

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.840
want to maximize it.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.710
How do we do that?

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.070
Let's write the volume as a
function of x and then take its

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.100
derivative, figure out where
the derivative is 0, and hope

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.070
that that's a maximum point and
we'll prove it by taking the

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.500
second derivative and seeing.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.870
Now we actually want it to be
concave downwards because

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.250
concave downwards looks
like that, that means you

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.000
found a maximum point.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.480
So we know that the volume as a
function of x-- I like writing

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.240
the big v's --the volume of the
function of x is that side

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.700
times-- you know, you could
view it as depth times

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.980
length times height.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:21.020
So it's x, the height, times
the depth, 24 minus 2x, times

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.360
the width, 24 minus 2x.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.440
Now let's see if I can
multiply this out.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.600
It's probably the hardest
part about this problem.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.980
So x times-- what's
24 times 24?

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.400
I want to say it's-- actually
kind of sad, but I've made so

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.280
many careless mistakes
recently that I don't

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.970
want to make any more.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:43.870
I want to get the right number.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.100
For 4 times 4 is 16.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.780
4 times 2 is 8, 96.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.670
0.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.380
2 times 24 is 48, 6.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.840
9 plus 8 is 17.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.630
576: that's what I
thought it was.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.400
I should have memorized my
times tables up to 25.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.580
But anyway, 24 times 24 is 576.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.630
And then we'll have 2 times 24,
so that's 48 x, but we have

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.420
them twice so it's minus 96x.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.130
Because minus 2x times 24 and
then minus 2x times 24, so

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.220
that's 48 to plus
48, so minus 96x.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.900
And then finally the last
two: plus 4x squared.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.890
And now we can multiply the x's
out and we get the volume of

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.040
the open box is-- let me put
the x term first --4x to the

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.390
third-- I'm just multiplying
this out --minus 96x

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.320
squared plus 576x.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.180
Let me erase this.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.240
I should have been able
to do that in my head.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.920
Anyway, I'm not too proud to
show that I didn't know that.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.470
Let's see, so let
me erase that.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.200
And so what do we want to do?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.940
We want to take the derivative
of this, figure out at what x

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.250
values do we have a 0 slope,
and then test to see if those

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.470
were maximum or minimum points.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.820
If we have a maximum point at
that x value, and if it's a

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.520
global maximum, that we have
found the x value that

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.980
optimizes the volume.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.070
You might want to graph these
and experiment with them and

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.750
get a more intuitive
sense of it.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.100
But that's really what we did
when we found minima and

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.960
maxima, and we did concave
upwards and downwards

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.930
and all of that.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:50.165
Anyway, the derivative v prime
of x is equal to 12x squared--

00:06:50.165 --> 00:07:05.180
this part is the fun part --12x
squared minus 192x plus 576.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.550
That says 576.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.870
I know it's hard to read;
it's hard to read for me.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.710
So let's figure out
where this equals 0.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:18.460
So we want to know where
12x squared minus 192x

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.220
plus 576 is equal 0.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.050
And the easiest thing to do
here is just divide the whole

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.410
thing by 12, both sides.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.110
Because when you divide 0
by 12 you still get 0.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:35.150
So you get x squared minus--
what's 192 divided by 12?

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.725
Well, 192 was 24 times 4.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.100
Is that right?

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.840
24?

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:56.760
No, 24 times 16 is 192.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.300
I've been making so many
careless mistakes.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.240
12 goes into 192, 1.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.480
12, 72.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:02.700
All right.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.440
16.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.100
I should have been
able to do that.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:12.070
Anyway, minus 16x plus-- well,
this was 24 times 24, so

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.230
this should be 12 times 48.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.210
So this should be plus
48 is equal to 0.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.190
And we could write 24
times 24 is 5 plus 76.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.330
So 12 times 48.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:24.920
Right.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.940
So now we just have
to factor this.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.660
So what two numbers that when I
add them I get minus 16 and

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:38.970
then when I multiply them
I get 48, positive 48?

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.170
Let's see 6 times-- I want
to make sure I did this; so

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:47.160
12 goes into 72 six times.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.580
I just want to make sure I
have the numbers right.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.500
As you can tell, I don't do
these problems ahead of time,

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.180
because I want you see that I
go through the pain as you do.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:53.823
So let me make sure.

00:08:53.823 --> 00:09:01.640
I have 12 goes into
576 four times.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:07.480
48, and you get 96.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.030
12 goes into-- right.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.680
48 times, 12 goes into that.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.060
I shouldn't have had to do
that, but I've been making

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.256
so many careless mistakes.

00:09:14.256 --> 00:09:15.900
I haven't eaten dinner yet.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.000
So anyway, maybe I'm just
missing the easy factor, right?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.300
Because I have, what numbers
you get 12 times-- oh, actually

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.610
I just figured it out.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.230
12 times 4.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.140
Sometimes when your brain
is in calculus mode, the

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.440
algebra II gets difficult.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.620
So this is the same thing
as x minus 4 times x

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.440
minus 12 is equal to 0.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.620
So at x is equal to 4 we're at
some type of minima or maxima

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.850
where it's some critical point.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.060
And x is equal to 12.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.850
And let me tell you something:
we don't even have to look at

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.680
the secondary derivative here.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.560
What happens when
x is equal to 12?

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.520
What will happen to the
volume of the box?

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.080
If x is equal to 12, what is
the length of this base?

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.800
It's 0.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.460
Because the length of the
base is 24 minus 2x.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.710
So this would be 0,
this would be 0.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.140
So this is the point where we
have a volume of 0, so you

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.450
know that this is going
to be a minimum point.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.090
And if you want to verify it,
take the second derivative of

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.690
the volume and evaluate the
second derivative of the volume

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:21.720
at 12 and you will realize that
we are concave upwards and that

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.360
x equals twelve is
the minimum point.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.472
So you already know, in
all probability, the

00:10:26.472 --> 00:10:29.120
answer is x equals 4.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.900
And if you really wanted to
verify it, you can take the

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.250
second derivative, add x equals
4, and make sure that we are

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.470
concave downwards
at that point.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.400
Because if we want a maximum
point, we want to be some

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.180
place where the graph
looks something like that.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.060
So we're at a maximum point.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.070
So what's the
second derivative?

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:58.730
v prime prime of x is
equal to 24x minus 192.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.050
And what's 24 times 4?

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.070
It's 96, right?

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:08.246
So v prime prime of
4 is equal to 96.

00:11:08.246 --> 00:11:08.800
Right?

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.110
4 times 24 minus 192,
which equals minus 96.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:18.470
So the second derivative at
this point is negative, which

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.490
means that we are concave
downwards, which means that

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.630
this is a maximum point.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:27.390
And once again, I challenge you
to find another value of x

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.270
where you get a larger value.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.400
And just to get an intuition,
how large will this box be?

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.270
Well, if x is 4, then
each side is 24 minus 8.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:43.160
This would be 16 by 16 by 4.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.110
So that would be the optimal
volume for that box.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.900
Hope you found that useful, and
I will see you in the next

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.605
video where I will do another
optimization problem, and

00:11:52.605 --> 00:11:53.540
this one is especially fun.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:53.930
See you soon.
