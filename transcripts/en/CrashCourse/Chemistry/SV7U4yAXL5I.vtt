00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
Energy. The foundation of the universe,
we'd literally be nothing without it.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.060
It does all our work, provides all our heat, can be stored to use later, and never, ever goes away.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.320
Sounds like the best-est best friend ever.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.120
And yet, most of the time we take it for granted, but here at Crash Course, we feel bad for our old friend Energy;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.630
we want to understand it so that we can be
a better friend to it,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.130
and also so that we can understand what it's
trying to tell us.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.100
Like that any bond between two atoms contains
energy.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.750
How much energy? Well, that is not the simplest
question to answer.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.090
And yet, today we shall answer it...kinda,
using a nifty little thing called enthalpy.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:47.670
[Theme Music]

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.650
Last time, we learned about internal energy,
and the two ways that it can be transferred:

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.199
by heat, or by work.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.479
And heat and work are useful concepts, but
they have limitations.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:02.259
Particularly, that it is extremely difficult to figure out how much of which one is being done.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.280
Work is energy transferred to the motion of
objects,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.710
while heat is energy transferred to the motion
of atoms and molecules.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.400
But for any given change in energy, the split between work and heat could be pretty much anything,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.180
as long as there's some going to each.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.049
Say that my car is at the top of a hill, and
there's a frozen banana stand at the bottom.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.799
If I roll down with my brakes on, lots of heat will be transferred into my brake pads and my brake discs,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.680
and I'll kind of like very slightly knock into the frozen banana stand, doing a tiny amount of work on it.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.120
But if I am reckless and insane, very little
heat will be generated,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.780
and my car'll do a huge amount of work on
the frozen banana stand.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.900
Both paths transfer the same amount of energy, but one produces very little heat, and the other produces a ton.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.180
So, we say that heat and work are "pathway
dependent."

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.700
The amount of heat or work done depends on
the pathway you take.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.070
The change in energy, on the other hand, is
the same in either case.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.479
Change in energy is independent of the pathway.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.140
In chemistry and physics and math, we call
that a "state function,"

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.130
because the only thing that matters is the
starting state and the ending state,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.069
not the stuff in between, not how you got
there.

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.140
State functions are pretty great, because
they make the math very simple;

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.610
it's just one amount minus another amount.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.100
It would be pretty fascinating to know exactly
how much energy is tied up in a molecule.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.500
Unfortunately, it's next to impossible to
know that number.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.530
It's too big, and there are too many boxes
where all that energy could be hiding.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.360
It's like trying to measure the total volume
of the ocean, like, good luck.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.240
However, since energy, like volume, is a state function, we can very easily talk about the change in energy.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.780
Just like if you dump a two liter Mountain
Dew into the ocean,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.760
you can't tell me how many liters are in the ocean, but you can say that that number has changed.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.660
It has just increased by two.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.080
In the same way, we're interested in energy
being transferred in or out of the system

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.760
because of chemical reactions.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.800
And in many cases, all we're interested in
is the heat part.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.220
For example, if I burn a pile of wood, I care
about the heat being generated,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.420
not the work being done by the volume increase,
or by the rising smoke.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.620
So dealing with the whole internal energy
equation thing would kind of be overkill.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.240
What we really need is a state function based
on the loss or gain of heat in chemical reactions.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.960
Which yes, is what Enthalpy is for.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.400
In addition to being a silly-sounding word, enthalpy, which is represented by an equally silly capital H,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.980
is technically the internal energy of a system,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.040
plus the energy that's required to sort of
shove the surroundings out of the way,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.160
and make room for the system's pressure and
volume.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.040
With enthalpy, we can make some assumptions
and do some fancy math

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.900
and make the simplest equation we've ever
seen in Crash Course Chemistry.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.180
Let's get there real fast.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.030
So first, we're not really interested in the
total enthalpy of the system,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.480
which is good, because it's impossible to
measure.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.280
We're really just interested in how much it's
going to change, as a state function.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.790
So, the formula for enthalpy is usually written
as change in enthalpy.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.670
Delta E or "change in energy" equals q plus
w, so we can replace that part,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.190
and then we can make two big, huge assumptions.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.630
First, that pressure is constant.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.780
Fortunately, despite talk of high and low
pressure weather systems,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.160
atmospheric pressure, it really, changes very little compared to the other terms in the equation.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.740
Constant pressure is a pretty good assumption
here on the Earth's surface.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.360
So that last Δ only applies to the volume.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.320
The second assumption is that the only work
done in the system

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.610
is the work that the pressure does to change
the volume, known as pressure volume work.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.859
So W equals negative PΔV.

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.000
Now the signs are a little bit weird here:

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.190
an increase -- or positive change -- in volume,
results in an output of work by the system

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.150
-- a loss in internal energy --

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.180
which is defined as a negative amount.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.440
So the signs for work and for PΔV will always
be opposite, and so, voila!

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.460
The PΔV parts cancel, ΔH equals the heat
of reaction.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.220
Change in enthalpy is equal to the heat gained
or lost by the system.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.770
So I guess in the capital H for enthalpy does
kinda make sense.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.600
Thanks to this little trick for a lot of reactions that happen at constant pressure, like here on the surface of the earth,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.310
working just with enthalpies instead of internal
energy makes a lot more sense.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.890
I mean, it's hugely useful.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.600
We can determine how much useful energy is
contained in pretty much any chemical compound.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.280
This is done by simply measuring temperature
changes during chemical reactions.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.480
So we know what it is, we know that state
functions are great, but really why?

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.090
Why have we done this, and can I just go look
at pictures of cats now?

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.080
Well no, because you don't even know why enthalpy
is so cool.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.780
When a reaction takes place and enthalpy changes,

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.980
that heat is transferring into or out of actual
chemical bonds, these little guys.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.200
Atoms and molecules reacting so that they
contain more or less energy,

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.180
and that energy is either released to or taken
from the environment as heat.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.660
Those bonds are nothing but energy, and using enthalpy, we can measure how much energy they have.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.520
And we measure enthalpy with a weird little
science called calorimetry.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.080
In calorimetry, we have a reaction take place inside an insulated vessel, like a thermos, basically,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.580
and measure how much the temperature changes,

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.810
which we can then link directly to heat and
thus enthalpy change.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.400
Hopefully that sounds like fun because more
about the ins and outs of this are coming

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.510
in an episode on how to measure enthalpy.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.330
Scientists have actually done on the calorimetry
footwork for us,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.280
so we can actually predict how much heat a
chemical reaction will produce.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.550
You might not understand what's so great about
that,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.800
but just imagine because I live here in Montana,
where winters are pretty wintry,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.400
I can invent a hand warmer just by doing some
calculations on paper,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.020
without driving to Texas to buy the stuff
and do all kinds of expensive experiments.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.330
For that, we have to thank good old Germain
Hess.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.820
No, not Hermann Hesse, the gaunt, balding
Swiss author and poet.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.630
Germain Hess, the gaunt, balding Swiss...
uh...author and chemist.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.820
Yeah, even the history parts of chemistry
are confusing.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.360
Hess was a chemist, geologist, professor, author, and doctor, and he also got a law named after him,

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.350
which is pretty much the higher honor you
can get as a chemist:

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.130
Hess's Law, which also kind of led directly
to the first law of thermodynamics.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.410
Kind of a big deal.
Not bad.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.660
Hess's law says that the total enthalpy change for a reaction doesn't depend on the pathway it takes,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.040
but only on its initial and final states.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.320
Sounds pretty familiar, right?

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.060
As long as you start with the same reactants and end with the same products, the enthalpy change is the same.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.000
In order to study this stuff carefully,

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.419
he looked at the standard enthalpies of formation
of the reactants and the products of a reaction.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.560
To define standard enthalpy of formation, I'm first going to define what a standard state is:

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.780
Basically it's just a set of criteria so that chemists can all be studying stuff under the same conditions.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.400
Chemicals in their standard state are at 25
degrees Celsius and one atmosphere.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.060
Standard enthalpy of formation is the amount
of heat lost or gained when one mole of a

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.430
compound is formed from its constituent elements.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.330
And of course all of those elements have to
be at their standard states.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.580
Since absolute enthalpy is unknowable though,
we have to be measuring from a baseline,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.590
and that baseline is that individual elements'
most stable form at standard state.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.010
That most stable form is defined as zero.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.850
Values for compounds are measured from that
zero baseline,

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:57.229
and then standard state values can be used to calculate the enthalpy change for any reaction, even hypothetical ones.

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:00.880
Hess' Law is often stated in terms of standard
enthalpies of formation.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.240
The enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.720
minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of
formation of the reactants.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.389
Thanks to many hardworking chemists,

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:14.979
the standard enthalpy of formation has been
measured for hundreds of compounds.

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:17.729
We can just look them up in charts and plug
them into Hess' Law.

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:21.139
Speaking of which, here is Hess' Law as a
mathematical formula.

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:24.260
Pretty fancy looking, but it says exactly
the same thing.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.460
The enthalpy change for a reaction equals the sum of the stand enthalpies of formation of the products

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.829
minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of
formation of the reactants.

00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:38.480
That pointy looking funny 'E' looking thing is the capital Greek letter Sigma(Σ) and it means, "the sum of."

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.040
np and nr are the moles of each product and
reactant respectively.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.480
We have to factor that in because remember
the standard enthalpy of formation is measured

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.949
for just one mole of the substance.

00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:49.999
If the chemical equation uses more than that,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.760
we have to multiply the standard enthalpy of formation by the number of moles in the equation.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.940
Again, I have just the thing for the calculating.

00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:58.720
Exhibit A.
A hand warmer.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.649
It gets warm because of an exothermic chemical
reaction.

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:06.559
And I'm very happy the inventors knew how
 to calculate the enthalpy change of chemical reactions.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:13.380
They chose one that releases just enough heat, quite slowly, to heat up my hand nice and warm without burning them off.

00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:17.110
The reaction combines an iron powder, which
is in here, and oxygen,

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.319
which diffuses through the membrane of the
little packaging.

00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:23.629
It forms Iron(III) Oxide, the main ingredient
in rust.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:27.240
To calculate the enthalpy change of the reaction,
or heat of reaction,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.259
we simply find the ΔHf of all of the reactants
and products.

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:36.240
Either in the back of most textbooks or on
Google and plug them into Hess' Law.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.260
ΔHf of formation of iron and oxygen are zero
by convention.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.180
When in doubt, find them in the same table.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:48.319
And ΔHf of formation of Iron(III) Oxide is
listed as -826 kilojoules per mole.

00:09:48.319 --> 00:09:52.649
First we have to make sure we balance the
chemical equation, so do that number one.

00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:58.280
Second, let's look at Hess' Law and figure out what our products are and what our reactants are and stick them in.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.879
Then, plug in the number of moles for each
of our products and reactants.

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:07.249
Bang on your calculator and realize the ΔH
of the reaction is -1652 kilojoules.

00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:13.929
So, the reaction of four moles of iron powder
which is about 223 grams of iron releases

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:16.789
1652 kilojoules of heat.

00:10:16.789 --> 00:10:23.040
All that energy locked away in chemical bonds and then released as heat to make my aching frozen fingers.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.780
Better living through chemistry.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.580
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash Course Chemistry. If you were paying attention,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.840
today you learned what the state function is and how it varies from a path dependent function.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.700
Why enthalpy change is different from heat, even though they turn out to be pretty much the same anyway.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:43.579
That bonds are energy and to form and break them they release and absorb heat to and from their environment.

00:10:43.579 --> 00:10:47.119
We gave you the most cursory introduction
to calorimetry ever,

00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:50.779
which we will remedy next time and discussed
the power of Hess' Law
