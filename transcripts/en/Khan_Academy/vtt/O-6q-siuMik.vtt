00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:01.327
- [Voiceover] Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.327 --> 00:00:03.440
My name is David, and
I'm here to introduce

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.180
you to Grammar on Khan Academy.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.970
Welcome.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.083
I'm so glad you could join me.

00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:11.126
So, let's start by asking the question,

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:13.146
"What is grammar?"

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.375
What is this thing, why is
it worthwhile to study it,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.814
why would you wanna put
up with listening to me?

00:00:17.814 --> 00:00:20.879
Well, first of all, grammar
is a set of conventions

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:23.600
and rules that govern language.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.572
So what's the difference
between a convention and a rule?

00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:30.751
Well, a rule is kind of
the bare minimum of what

00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:33.050
it takes to make your
language understandable

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.513
by other people, right?

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:37.299
So in order to make a
car work, for example,

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.691
in order to make it move
forward as intended,

00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.895
the wheels have to go on the
bottom instead of the roof.

00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:44.730
That's a rule.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.004
The idea that all cars should
be painted teal, for example,

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.001
is a convention.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.950
Now is that true that
all cars should be teal?

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.829
No, not necessarily, but that
leads me to my second point,

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.639
that grammar is context dependent.

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:59.892
The kind of grammar that you use

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:01.657
throughout your day changes.

00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:03.352
It depends on who you're talking to,

00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:05.906
what you're trying to say, and
how you're trying to say it.

00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:09.111
And so we use multiple
kinds of grammar throughout

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.317
our days and throughout our lives.

00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:13.174
Another thing you need to
know is that you already

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:15.148
know so much grammar.

00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:17.841
Just from living and
existing in the world and

00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:19.676
talking to other people.

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:21.278
You know how to put a sentence together.

00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:23.786
If you can understand me, then you know

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:25.040
so much about grammar.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.826
You know more than I can teach you.

00:01:27.826 --> 00:01:31.611
What these videos are for is to give names

00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:34.142
to the things you already know.

00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:36.696
To give you a greater command of them.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:39.181
And I want to say, too,
that these videos are only

00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:41.526
about a very specific kind of grammar.

00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:43.987
It's called Standard American English.

00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:47.447
But I want you to know that
there are many Englishes.

00:01:47.447 --> 00:01:48.585
And you know what?

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:50.210
They're all great.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.300
They are all wonderful and vibrant

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.088
and important and special.

00:01:54.088 --> 00:01:56.897
And what I do not want for
you to take away from these

00:01:56.897 --> 00:01:59.753
videos is that I'm trying
to teach you what is right

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:01.588
and what is wrong.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:03.747
If the kind of English you
speak doesn't sound like the

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:07.091
kind of English I speak,
that is okay, you know?

00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:09.088
You are great.

00:02:09.088 --> 00:02:13.453
What I want to do is give you
the tools to harness language.

00:02:13.453 --> 00:02:16.565
To harness English and use it

00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:19.049
any way you want.

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.650
I mean, I'm saying I don't
care what color your car is.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.251
It could be pink, it could
be green, it could be purple,

00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:27.037
it could be paisley, you know.

00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:29.870
I'm just trying to make sure
your wheels are on straight.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.424
You are a grammarian.

00:02:32.424 --> 00:02:34.421
You have made a study of
grammar throughout your

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:37.161
entire speaking and reading life.

00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:40.667
And I firmly believe that
you can learn anything.

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:43.105
Welcome to Grammar on Khan Academy.

00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:44.452
David out.
