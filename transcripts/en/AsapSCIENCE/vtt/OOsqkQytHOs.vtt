00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.460
Video games provide a fun escape from reality;
though, they're often portrayed as violent,

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.370
lazy and a waste of time by some. The debate
has raged on for years - So are there any

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.160
positive effects? Can video games actually
make you smarter?

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.600
Video games provide a fun escape from reality; though, they're often portrayed as violent,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.180
broccoli. Seriously, extremely high doses broccoli can actually be toxic. Heck even

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.890
water toxicity exist. So if you binge and
do nothing but play video games, the risks

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.490
probably outweigh any benefits. In fact, we
have an entire video devoted to what would

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.780
happen if you stopped going outside, and the
negative effects of sitting - link in the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.399
description!

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.350
Having said that, many studies have actually
shown increases in cognitive function after

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.379
playing video games. One study in particular
had participants play Super Mario 64 for 30

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.709
minutes a day over 2 months. Afterwards, the
brains of these participants saw an increase

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:54.170
of grey matter in areas associated with memory,
strategic planning, and fine motor skills

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.350
of the hands, compared to those who had not
played. These are particularly encouraging

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.119
results for mental disorders which cause these
brain regions to shrink; using video games

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.129
as a therapy.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.719
Surprisingly, action games can also increase
attention to detail in individuals. Take a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.670
look at the following words on screen, and
yell out what colour the word is as fast as

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.670
you can! So: green, blue, orange. Ok, now
try a bit faster without me. As we continue,

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.009
it becomes more difficult because there is
a conflict between the word itself and its

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.369
colour. Chances are, if you play more than
5-10 hours of action games a week, you're

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.390
able to solve these problems much more quickly.
This is because your brain is actually more

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.810
efficient in the regions associated with attention.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.369
Of course, video games can also be incredibly
educational! And while you may not be playing

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.979
some of your favourite games for this purpose,
there are certainly many games that are used

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.859
as effective teaching tools for both young
and old.

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.999
They may even help kids who suffer from dyslexia
read more effectively. In a small study, dyslexic

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:05.810
children who played regular video games ended
up reading faster and more accurately - once

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.599
again relating to improved attention skills.
Meanwhile, other studies have found improvements

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.769
in eyesight. Not only can they see smaller
details more clearly, like tiny writing, but

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.379
they have an easier time differentiating levels
of grey. Very practiced action gamers were

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.420
58% better at perceiving fine differences
in contrast. Which is important as this is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.989
one of the first things to diminish with age.

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.519
Even in the elderly, improved memory and focus
is seen. More importantly, specially designed

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.400
brain teasing video games have been shown
to slow the aging process of the brain by

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.900
up to seven years. This is because they are
cognitively complex and require mental energy!

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.349
Think you're able to keep track of what's
in front of your eyes? Keep an eye on the

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.590
blue circle here. Eventually it will turn
yellow like all the others. I will then point

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.450
to a circle, and you tell me if it was originally
blue. If you knew this ball wasn't blue, then

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.390
you're a functioning human being. But lets
make it harder. Staring at the middle of the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.390
screen can help to keep track of the blue
circles. Was this circle originally blue?

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:13.239
If you said no, you'd be right. One more time,
but with 5 blue circles. Was this one originally

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.760
blue? Yup - it was. It turns out, the average
person can track about 3-4 objects, while

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.670
a practiced action gamer can track around
6-7.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.140
Finally, as technology continues to transform
medicine, surgeries are being completed with

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.090
the insertion of cameras and remote controlled
tools. And these surgeries have very clear

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.860
parallels to video games, with a screen and
controlling device. Not surprisingly, young

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.459
doctors with previous exposure to video games
show fewer errors and faster completion than

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.209
those without.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.650
Of course, all of these skills are only useful
if you use them; which you can't if all you

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.069
do is play video games. So enjoy your down
time and relax with your games in moderation,

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.620
but get out there and keep your life diverse
as well. Because that's how you'll win at

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.420
the game of life.
