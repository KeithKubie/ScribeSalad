00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.951
In today's video,

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.860
we are tackling
a project inspired by

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.580
the artist Greg Klassen,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.880
making a small end table
out of a piece of burl wood log.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.500
[Music]

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.680
Today's video is going to look
a little bit differently,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.040
because instead of
having my camera guy,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.400
Mark film everything,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.640
this is actually just something
I'm doing on my own time.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.540
So it's just being filmed
on my cell phone.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.582
I do have a spare mic,
so I'm using that.

00:00:25.582 --> 00:00:28.843
But it's mostly just going to be
single camera angle at a time,

00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:31.000
and we'll see if we
can make it look good.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.820
All right, I've got
this big ol log here,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.020
which has got
some lovely burl's on it.

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:37.025
Burl is basically

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:39.480
when the tree gets
sort of a tumor,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.500
and you can see we've got
a couple of them right here.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.080
One of them right here.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.960
This is what we're going to be
using to make most of the table.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.680
First thing I need
to do is cut this.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.160
What I want to do
is get one piece,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.620
maybe inch and a half,
two inches wide,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.140
that comes down through both

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.072
of these pieces
of burl right here,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.960
and then a second piece

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.340
that I'm going to cut
out this direction,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.280
that comes down
through this piece of burl.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.020
I have drawn onto the top
of it some lines.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.200
That's about where I want
that first cut to go.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.640
So I'll cut here and here.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.080
Then I'll have
this half of the log,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.580
and then I'll cut that direction

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.440
from what's left to try and get
this strip right there.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.840
I'm going to try and secure it
to the table as best I can.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.280
It's going to be
a little messy, probably.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:45.280
[Music]

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.380
Beautiful.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.360
Cut it open.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.500
Now, I just have to do
that like three more times.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.500
So more trimming will be done.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.000
Generally, I'll just trim
off kind of along this part.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.140
Little bit around here,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.500
and probably right around there.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.540
Just a nice little rectangle.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.920
Now, I need to clean these off.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.840
They're not very even.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.860
I just cut them with
a hand saw, obviously,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.385
and so, they need some planing work.

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:15.620
I don't actually feel

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.742
like these pieces
need to be 100% level

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:19.600
and even all the way through.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.248
If there's a little bit

00:02:20.248 --> 00:02:22.598
of fluctuation that's
not too much of a problem,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.000
it's not going to be sitting
on a flat base.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.100
I'm just going to build a frame

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.150
that goes around parts
of the edge of it.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.160
And so,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.280
if there's some wonkiness
going on in there,

00:02:31.293 --> 00:02:32.593
it's not really a problem.

00:02:32.593 --> 00:02:34.652
I think it will
actually add to the,

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:37.062
to the live edge look of it.

00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:38.495
Obviously though.

00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:41.350
I want it flat enough
that, you know,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.792
I can set a cup down on it,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.640
and not have it tip over,
stuff like that.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.046
Mostly for this,

00:02:46.046 --> 00:02:49.450
I think I'm just going to be
using a handheld belt sander,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.360
and see how it looks after that.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:08.620
[Music]

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.700
That is already bringing
out some brilliant figuring,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.840
and that's like 80 grit.

00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:14.956
This stuff is going
to look so good

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.340
when it's all polished up.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.720
Next step is to sand blast
the end pieces of the wood.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.940
I'm here with my friend Dennis,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.840
who is letting me use
his sandblasting kit,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840
because I don't have
one of those,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.760
and it's a pretty nifty set up.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.400
So we've got sand
that fits in that thing there.

00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:32.912
It feeds through here.

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:35.102
The blue hose has
the compressed air.

00:03:35.102 --> 00:03:37.050
It pulls all
the sand out with it,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.380
and it just--

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.229
It's like sandpaper
without the paper part.

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.198
It just starts tearing
stuff down, which is great,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.560
because these edges

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.140
are not really an area I
can get sandpaper down into.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.700
I even tried a little bit
with steel wool,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.960
and there's just too
many nooks and crannies.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.240
But sandblasting works great.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.772
Not breathe in sand
or wood dust,

00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:59.383
and let's not get
it in our eyes.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.160
What?

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:17.600
[Music]

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.540
Beautiful.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.780
Look at that.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.300
That is so much cleaner
than it was before.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.223
That's just--

00:04:23.223 --> 00:04:24.240
That is fantastic.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:48.060
[Music]

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.960
That worked great.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.840
This wood is so soft

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.400
that I'm able to cut even
through like a 2-inch plank

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.440
of it with no problem.

00:04:54.443 --> 00:04:57.022
So we're just going
to keep doing that.

00:04:57.412 --> 00:05:00.412
Now, one other little thing
I want to do right here,

00:05:00.412 --> 00:05:02.050
I have kind of a large cavity,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.850
and that's not
necessarily a problem.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.100
But I think we could make it
a little bit more interesting.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.532
We've got some extra
pieces of the wood,

00:05:08.532 --> 00:05:11.383
including some that have some
of this nice burl on it.

00:05:11.383 --> 00:05:13.750
So I think we're going
to try and cut a piece

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.280
that can sit right here as sort
of just an extra little island.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:36.940
[Music]

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.480
I think that's a great fit
for that piece right there.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.820
So now, I need to trim it this way,
and then flatten it off just a little bit,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.300
and I think we can use
this saw for that again.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:53.560
[Music]

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.600
So we've built the box.

00:05:54.613 --> 00:05:57.272
You can see that the wood
fits nicely into it.

00:05:57.272 --> 00:05:57.962
On the back,

00:05:57.962 --> 00:06:00.520
we're going for pretty much
flush up against the wall,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.640
but on the sides, you can see
we are leaving a gap.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.980
Now, we'll trim
down the blackboard.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.680
It'll have a little bit

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.640
of extra space going all
around the border.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.350
That's all right.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.454
Well, then flip
the white frame over,

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.250
and we'll attach the black part

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.500
of the frame onto the white
part of the frame,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.380
then we should have our box.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:27.900
[Music]

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.814
Also, just to make sure

00:06:28.814 --> 00:06:30.750
that none of the resin
tries to escape,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.600
I'm gonna seal up all of
the gaps with electrical tape.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.780
There is a little bit more prep
work we need to do on our box.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.662
We first actually want
to give that a coat of wax.

00:06:38.662 --> 00:06:40.050
Hopefully, that will make it

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.500
so the resin doesn't stick
to it very much,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.260
so we can then peel
the box pieces off later on.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.940
[Music]

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.650
You know, before I
clamp these on,

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.190
I want to cover
the clamps with something

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.131
so that resin doesn't spill out,

00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:56.806
and just get all over those.

00:06:56.806 --> 00:06:57.747
So I'm gonna use

00:06:57.747 --> 00:07:01.050
a little bit of foil
or plastic wrapped around those,

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.992
just to not ruin them.

00:07:05.242 --> 00:07:06.839
Now, when the resin flows,

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:09.050
the wood will not float
on top of it.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.536
We're going to be doing
the resin pour indoors,

00:07:11.536 --> 00:07:12.574
because it's not good

00:07:12.574 --> 00:07:14.500
if you let it get
too hot or too cold.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.046
So a nice climate
controlled environment is good.

00:07:17.046 --> 00:07:19.400
However, you also don't want
to be breathing it in.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.980
First step, we need
to pour off some

00:07:21.987 --> 00:07:25.712
of both types of resin into
our smaller mixing containers.

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.315
We'll then pour 1/2
into the other one.

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:29.174
For coloring,

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.860
we'll be using this alcohol
ink sailboat blue color.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.280
Mix it up for a while,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.920
then pour that into
our larger bucket,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.300
and our larger bucket will go
into our vacuum chamber.

00:07:39.302 --> 00:07:40.832
It will suck out all of the air,

00:07:40.832 --> 00:07:42.921
so there's not bubbles
left in the resin,

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.620
and then, it'll get poured
into the table.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.540
[Music]

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.320
No bubbles.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:08:01.360
[Music]

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.272
Coming back after
the second pour,

00:08:03.272 --> 00:08:05.850
and it's looking good
over most of it.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.306
But unfortunately,
we do have one spot

00:08:08.306 --> 00:08:09.582
where the resin cracked.

00:08:09.582 --> 00:08:10.382
You can see

00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:12.612
that crack extending
all the way down

00:08:12.612 --> 00:08:14.274
through that second pour layer,

00:08:14.274 --> 00:08:15.050
and I think it

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.733
actually even goes down
into the first pour layer,

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.020
a little bit down in there.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.665
It split right across,

00:08:20.665 --> 00:08:24.151
and maybe this is because I
poured too thick of a layer.

00:08:24.151 --> 00:08:26.359
May be the first
layer was still warm,

00:08:26.359 --> 00:08:27.516
and the interaction

00:08:27.516 --> 00:08:30.003
between the two layers
was too much for it.

00:08:30.003 --> 00:08:31.589
But let's mix up a third pour.

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:33.650
We're not going to use
nearly all of it.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.650
We're just going to try
and get it high enough

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.250
that it comes up to the level
of the wood everywhere.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.932
Maybe overflowing just
the tiniest bit.

00:08:40.932 --> 00:08:42.778
Fill some of these gaps.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:09:05.680
[Music]

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.579
This all filled in quite nicely.

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:10.052
There's a lot
of resin in that gap.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.120
So I think on this side,
it is full enough.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.980
We've got other spots
that may not have enough yet.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.820
This one over here
didn't feel quite as well.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.200
We'll cut off the other
side and see how it is.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:31.080
[Music]

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.217
We are going to take this edge,

00:09:33.217 --> 00:09:36.032
and give it a pass
right along this.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:49.040
[Music]

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.000
Perfect.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.040
This side of the table
is really the one

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.450
that has all of the cracks
that need filling.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.200
The other side did pretty good.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.800
This one's just got a few spots,

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.380
few cracks that didn't
feel quite enough.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.120
The other side
actually did have some,

00:10:06.126 --> 00:10:07.021
it looked like.

00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:09.496
When I planed the edge off,
they went away.

00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:11.143
So they were really shallow.

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:13.398
So we're just going
to mix up some resin

00:10:13.398 --> 00:10:14.750
with no coloring in it,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.942
and then we're going
to use a pipette,

00:10:16.942 --> 00:10:19.442
and fill right down
into these cracks.

00:10:19.442 --> 00:10:28.560
[Music]

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.550
The surface of our table

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.517
is pretty much all
prepped and ready.

00:10:31.517 --> 00:10:34.749
But what I need to do now is put
a couple more layers of resin

00:10:34.749 --> 00:10:36.120
over all of this.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.040
So I'm going to do one layer
just pour it over all of that,

00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:40.143
and that should pretty much
seal up the woods,

00:10:40.143 --> 00:10:41.350
so it stops soaking it in.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.571
After that layer is cured,

00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:44.536
I'll do a really clean up
work that I need to,

00:10:44.536 --> 00:10:45.899
removing drips off the edge,

00:10:45.899 --> 00:10:47.549
and maybe a little
bit of sanding,

00:10:47.549 --> 00:10:50.488
but then I'll do one more layer
of resin on top of that,

00:10:50.488 --> 00:10:51.450
and at that point,

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.920
it should all just be a glossy
clear perfectly smooth surface.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:07.780
[Music]

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.340
The frame for our table
is going to be made

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.750
of these simple pieces of metal

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.572
that I'm just grabbing
at the hardware store.

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:13.650
They're not too expensive.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.450
We're going to do
a little bit of grinding,

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.750
a little bit of welding,
and a little bit of painting,

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.232
and we'll have our frame.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:28.020
[Music]

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.659
Our metal pieces are cut,
welded, shaped and painted,

00:11:30.659 --> 00:11:32.361
and we've now got our frame.

00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:33.832
It's fairly minimalistic,

00:11:33.832 --> 00:11:36.672
but I really want the top
of this table to be the focus.

00:11:36.982 --> 00:11:39.450
We have now finished this table.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.468
The frame is built.

00:11:40.468 --> 00:11:42.358
It's attached, it's
sitting on here.

00:11:42.358 --> 00:11:44.050
You are still able
to lift it up.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.250
But the friction from
these little sponge rubber pads

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.784
on the sides does a pretty
good job of holding it in place.

00:11:49.784 --> 00:11:51.401
I'm quite happy with
how stable it is.

00:11:51.401 --> 00:11:52.800
I'm very happy
with how it looks.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.014
There are imperfections,

00:11:54.014 --> 00:11:56.720
and of course, things I
would probably do differently

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.282
if I were making a second one.

00:11:58.282 --> 00:12:00.160
Overall, I am quite happy

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.750
with how the surface
of this table turned out.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:07.307
I love that just incredible
wood grain that's visible

00:12:07.307 --> 00:12:09.340
through the resin.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.740
I'm very happy
with the result on that.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.360
So this has been
a really cool project,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.380
and I'm excited to have
this set up in my place

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.920
as a sort of combination
functional table art piece.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.300
That's going to be exciting.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.720
That's not all though.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.000
You know, we've always
got more for you see.

00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:26.878
That box up at the top
is going to take you directly

00:12:26.878 --> 00:12:27.557
to our last video.

00:12:27.557 --> 00:12:28.633
You should go check that out.

00:12:28.633 --> 00:12:29.897
The other box
is going to show you

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.760
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.620
If you hit this bomb the middle,

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:33.743
you'll be subscribe
to the channel.

00:12:33.743 --> 00:12:34.913
That way, you
never miss a video.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.840
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you the next one.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.840
Talk to you then.
