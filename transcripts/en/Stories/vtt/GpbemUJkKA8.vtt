AMANDA BRENNAN: A
lot of my work is

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.720
focused on keeping on the pulse
of trends of internet culture.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.520
My name is Amanda Brennan.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.730
And I'm a Content and
Community Associate at Tumblr.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.335
I am also a meme librarian.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.770
A meme is a piece
of content that

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.410
travels from person to person
and changes along the way.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.790
The term was coined in 1976 by
evolutionary biologist Richard

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.110
Dawkins in his book
"The Selfish Gene."

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.690
He originally used
it to describe

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.220
pieces of cultural
transmission, so stuff

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.490
like melodies or catchphrases,
even trends in fashion.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.360
Before the internet, memes still
came in all shapes and sizes.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.780
One of the earliest
instances is Kilroy Was Here.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.470
It's this piece of graffiti that
was popularized in World War II

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.730
by American soldiers.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.679
So when new soldiers
came through,

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.470
they knew that their
people had been there.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.620
Another one that's
a great example

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.660
is the Star Wars opening crawl.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.250
It's been used in
parodies since two years

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.370
after the original
film was released.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.900
Internet memes can take
many different forms still.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.430
They can be hashtags, emoticons.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.210
They could be a video or a vine.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.985
Songs can be memes.

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:20.630
What lives solely
in internet space

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.060
can sometimes be very
fleeting or temporal.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.130
Flash animations
like Homestar Runner

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.970
were huge in the early 2000s.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.770
2005 marked the birth of
YouTube and every video meme.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.520
BRIAN COLLINS: And
boom goes the dynamite.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.600
AMANDA BRENNAN: In
2009, we really thought

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.270
about stereotypes
and representing them

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.040
online in stuff like Advice
Animals and Rage Comics.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910
2013, we changed
language with doge.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.220
Dogs were assigned
their own dialect,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.633
just like cats were
in the early 2000s.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:49.133
[MEOW]

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.105
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.080
Memes had a longer life
span a few years ago.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.300
Now, we see memes like
"If a Dog Wore Pants."

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.370
It got super big.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.990
It appeared on the "Today Show."

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.130
But after a few days, no one
was really talking about it.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.820
It's so important
right now to be

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.020
archiving this stuff because
meme culture is really

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.540
rapidly growing.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.350
And it represents what's
going on the outskirts of pop

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.160
culture.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.230
We can learn so much about
how people communicate

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.290
through internet memes.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.660
We also really learn
about communities.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.600
There's a series of blogs called
"What Should We Call Me" where

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.890
people will change
it a little bit

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.570
to be about their profession
or their locality.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.570
And using the
reaction gifs, they

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.710
can identify their
feelings and share it

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.220
within a community that
knows how they feel.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.600
Memes are fun.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.500
And they're really cool.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.560
And it's a way to sometimes
work through hard stuff.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.330
It adds more nuance to
speech and interaction.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.550
We have no idea how
people were really

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.290
sharing their weird cultural
ideas before the internet.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.050
Now, someone can tweet
something and someone

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.342
across the globe can
identify with it.

00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:03.800
SPEAKER: Have memes
changed the way

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.244
you communicate with friends?

00:03:05.244 --> 00:03:06.660
Let us know in the
comments below.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.170
And to find out how a former
corporate lawyer gave up

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.500
his career to be a
full-time LEGO artist,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.400
check out this video right here.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.120
NATHAN SAWAYA: I left the law
firm behind to play with bricks

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.060
full time.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.610
The bricks I use in my art
are the very same bricks

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.360
that people could
purchase at a toy store.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.270
I don't paint them.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.880
I don't have access to special
colors or special shapes

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.000
and sizes.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.490
And we're in my
art studio today,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.322
where I have over 5
million LEGO bricks.

00:03:31.322 --> 00:03:32.530
SPEAKER: Thanks for watching.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.030
