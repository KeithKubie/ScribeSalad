00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.770
PROFESSOR: How can I recommend
you to world class faculty

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.400
members here at MIT
if you're sloppy?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.800
PHIL: One of the students
doesn't want to confess to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.125
spilling half a bottle of
hazardous chemical on the

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.230
laboratory floor.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.090
I mean, that's a major
safety hazard.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.990
IKE: Did you guys
know who did it?

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.120
PHIL: No.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.455
IKE: Yeah, I can't tell you.

00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:33.330
I'm a brother.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.560
I'm a homey.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.390
PHIL: This is when
we have a witch

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.842
trial like in The Crucible.

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:42.336
And if nobody confesses, we
send everybody home, and

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:43.780
everyone gets an
F for the day.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.146
IKE: [BLEEP]

00:00:44.146 --> 00:00:45.690
was the one who spilled
the urea.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.110
Don't tell [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.100
Don't tell.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.030
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.980
PHIL: Pretty angry.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.410
I would say it was urea, but
we can't know for sure.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.965
So.

00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:04.608
IKE: But he knows himself.

00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:05.540
He knows himself.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.444
[LAUGHS]

00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:08.872
It's a secret.

00:01:08.872 --> 00:01:13.160
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.710
PHIL: Recently across the
country and, of course,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.160
throughout time, there's been
waves of serious injuries and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.990
deaths as a result of not
following best safety

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.030
practices in the laboratory.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.520
PROFESSOR: The labs have
not been cleaned.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.070
Chemicals, basically, have been
spilled on the scales and

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.070
on the floor.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.780
PHIL: If somebody steps in
that, they track it home.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.570
It's on your shoes.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.880
It gets on your rug.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.980
PROFESSOR: You come in, and
you spill the chemicals.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.590
And then, you just disappear.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.172
And that is just not right.

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:53.252
PHIL: Next thing you know,
you're doing Pilates in a

00:01:53.252 --> 00:01:55.070
puddle of urea.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.330
HANSOL: He's basically
yelled at us.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.085
That's as far as he's going
to get in terms

00:01:58.085 --> 00:01:59.690
of yelling at students.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.080
PROFESSOR: I forgot
you're freshmen.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.820
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you a fresh

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.780
start today.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.000
You're going to clean
up your act.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.250
Today's your new start.
