00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.461
up against your body.

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:05.046
Whoa.
It's bigger than John.

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:08.341
Hey, I love every type of sword,
but this is the one type

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.010
of sword
that I know is not for me.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.637
These type of
two-handed greatswords

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.180
were given to the largest,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.349
tallest soldiers
to guard banners.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.435
They were sometimes
called Doppelsoldners.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.479
In armored duels, they would
use it with immense --

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.607
absolutely immense
swiping motions.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.235
But you can't stand
and fence with it.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.946
This is a weapon that you're
gonna be covering and guarding,

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:32.824
and there's a lot of opportunity
to bind and trap.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.200
This is a weapon
for you guys.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.786
Yeah, my God.
That's --

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.622
This is the heaviest weapon
of this entire competition

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.416
that I've put in my hands.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:45.545
The blade -- it's a flamberge,
flambergé, flammard, flambard --

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.298
"flame blade" --
and the belief is that

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:51.593
the, uh,
waves or the flame portion

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:56.347
is an attempt to combine the
slicing power of a curved blade

00:00:56.347 --> 00:00:58.892
with the versatility
of a straight blade.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.977
Hmm.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.229
Flame blades like this
were actually

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.898
on many different types
of swords,

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:08.401
from arming swords to side
swords to even rapiers.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.946
And there's even an Indonesian,
uh, blade called the kris knife,

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.616
that uses the same pattern
and principle.
Right.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:17.410
So, one of things that I like
about, uh, this sword --

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.245
we talked about
longswords in melee

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.123
and how in our sport,
they're not as effective

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:24.501
'cause you don't feel the --
the blows.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.169
This, you're gonna feel
the blows of.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:29.547
You have the ability
to have a wider grip on this.

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:31.049
This is gonna give you
more power.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.425
You're gonna get more torque
over it,

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.010
more control
over this weapon.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.180
You can choke up
if you need to.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.600
But imagine if somebody's got
a long arm length,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.103
and they get to put this out --
fire blows from afar.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.397
You're gonna see some --
some real big swings here.

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:49.442
Wait, wait, wait.
But it has an amazing,
amazing balance

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.946
that it's still a maneuverable
weapon for its size and weight.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.698
I mean, just to put that
in perspective, I'm 6'1".

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:57.450
Right?

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.535
Yeah, that's 6-foot.
Look at the size
of this weapon.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:01:59.536
That's 6-foot tall.

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.831
