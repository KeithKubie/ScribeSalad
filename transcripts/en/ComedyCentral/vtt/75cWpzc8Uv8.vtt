EDGAR ALLAN POE, HE'S ONE

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:16.116
COMPLETELY DISRESPECTED
BY EVERYONE

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.218
HE EVER CAME IN CONTACT WITH.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.053
HE WAS ALWAYS BROKE.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.656
AND HE CAME INTO CONTACT
WITH A FELLOW

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:26.360
BY THE NAME OF RUFUS GRISWOLD.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.929
SO GRISWOLD SAYS TO POE,

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.797
HEY, I'M MAKING THIS BOOK CALLED

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:32.833
<i>THE POETS AND POETRY
OF AMERICA.</i>

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.701

AND IF I LIKE 'EM,
I'LL PUT 'EM IN.

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.239
HE KNOWS IF HE PUTS HIM
IN THE BOOK,

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.309
THEN EDGAR ALLAN POE WILL BE
LIKELY TO WRITE A NICE REVIEW.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.879

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.132
POE'S SITTING THERE WITH
THE BOOK IN FRONT OF HIM,

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:06.200
FLIPPING THROUGH THE BOOK.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.035
FLIP, FLIP, FLIP, FLIP, FLIP.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.504
WHAT THE [bleep]?

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:13.207
ARE YOU [bleep] SERIOUS?

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:17.811
THIS [bleep]SUCKER,
HACK, LOSER, ASS[bleep]

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.647
HAS PUT ME IN THE VERY BACK
OF THIS BOOK.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:24.585
I'VE BEEN HORNSWOGGLED
BY A [bleep].

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:26.486
GRISWOLD COMES TO HIM,
AND HE'S LIKE,

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.322
EDGAR, WHAT DO YOU SAY

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.362
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
A-A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.264
IT'S BASICALLY BRIBERY.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:40.501
AND POE'S LIKE,
SURE, NO PROBLEM.

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:43.070
I'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY, AND WRITE

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.204
NO PROBLEM.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:48.742
NO [bleep] PROBLEM, RUFUS.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:51.845

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:56.083
SO--SO HE--SO HE WRITES

POE'S GONNA WRITE
THIS GREAT REVIEW OF MY [bleep].

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:04.391
THEN HE--WHEN--WHEN HE READS
THE REVIEW THAT HE PAID FOR,

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.460
LIKE,
NO ONE SHOULD READ THIS.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.096
NONE OF THESE POETS ARE GONNA BE
REMEMBERED EXCEPT FOR ME.

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:11.365
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME
TO EVEN LOOK AT THIS THING.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:12.499
ALL OF THIS IS CRAP.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.501

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:15.769

HE HAS NO TALENT AT ALL,

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.503 line:0%
 
AND IF YOU GIVE GRISWOLD
A HAND JOB,

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:51.939 line:0%
 
HE'LL PUT 20 POEMS
IN HIS [bleep] BOOK.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.843 line:0%
 
HE IS A VILE, HOLOGRAPHIC
PIECE OF [bleep].

00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:57.578
HOLOGRAMS DON'T EVEN EXIST YET,

00:02:57.678 --> 00:02:58.612

A [bleep] HOLOGRAM.
