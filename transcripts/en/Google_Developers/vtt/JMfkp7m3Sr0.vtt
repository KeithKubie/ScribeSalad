00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.280
MALE SPEAKER: It's time now to
get your game on, with EA and

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.440
Strike Fortress, a game designed
to be used in the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.090
Chrome browser.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.320
We're joined by Daniel from EA
to talk us through this.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.220
Red versus Blue.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.450
We're in the middle
of a game here.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.380
Walk us through the action.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.850
DANIEL: That's right.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.195
We've got two guys here
who are playing.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:16.620
This is Blue Team.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.080
And it's totally in the
Chrome browser.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.450
We're using a JavaScript and
Web GL based engine written

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.160
from scratch.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.750
And they're communicating over
WebSockets in a client server

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.280
architecture, just like you
might play in any other

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.730
multi-player game.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.040
So, just using all HTML5
technologies in Chrome.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.750
So that is cool in
and of itself.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.570
But you've got a tablet
in your hand--

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.970
DANIEL: That's right.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.510
MALE SPEAKER: --to show us
how you can actually

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.450
play God in this game.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.970
Let's shift over to the third
screen here to talk about it.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.960
DANIEL: So one of the dreams of
this kind of experience is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.820
building a technology that
can be experienced

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.570
wherever you are.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.255
So when these guys are playing
on their desktops, playing at

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:55.650
home, or playing on their TVs,
in kind of a console setting.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.390
But I'm not there.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.840
I'm actually on my tablet.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.130
So I can actually--

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.650
MALE SPEAKER: But you get to
mess around with the game.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.920
DANIEL: That's right.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.530
Well because I'm good friends
with these guys, you know--

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.230
MALE SPEAKER: Not for long.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.340
DANIEL: Yeah, not for long.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.890
I have angst with this
guy over here.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.380
So I'm actually going to mess
with their game by interacting

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.310
with their game world and
putting a mine right there,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.570
where that guy can--

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.446
oh look, he hit my mine.

00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:15.760
Oh, look at that.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.010
Sorry guy.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.170
He didn't die quite
though, yet.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.510
So maybe I'll throw
a missile on him.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.400
MALE SPEAKER: So you could
choose to mess around with the

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.310
Red or Blue team.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.440
I mean, you're in
control here.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.800
DANIEL:Totally.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.080
A malevolent or a benevolent
spirit, depending on how you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.130
feel in this particular game.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.610
This is a social game
experiment, really.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.970
Since we were doing a prototype
build just purely

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.600
for research and design and
building a new technology.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.960
We experimented with the idea of
a second screen smart glass

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.340
controller to basically jump in
the game wherever you are.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.120
MALE SPEAKER: And you could also
use your mobile device,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060
your Android device as well.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.630
DANIEL: Yes, you
certainly can.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.980
You can use the new Nexus 7
they came out with today.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.800
Totally.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.900
You can come up here and scan
these QR codes we have on the

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.240
wall and jump right into in
this game that's playing.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.505
MALE SPEAKER: Now what's the
future of this technology?

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:04.180
Have you already thought about
some other iterations of this

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.570
kind of third party interaction

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.470
with a game like this.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.022
DANIEL: For sure.

00:02:08.022 --> 00:02:11.370
A technology like this, fully
built out and then realized by

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.400
a full game team with a vision,
could produce a design

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.090
that hits you perfectly
wherever you are.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.900
So you can be on your phone,
with your couple second

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.010
Facebook checking type
experience that's super fast.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.500
You could be on the two hour
console experience.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.650
You could be on the 10 minute
more tablet-y experience.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.080
And each one of those would
be fed to you differently.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.640
To the same technology, but in
a different stream, different

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.270
data that you need based
on where you are.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.310
And you as the user
don't care.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.770
You just want to play your
game in different ways

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.620
wherever you have the time
and can do that.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.140
MALE SPEAKER: Now without giving
away the keys to the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.730
kingdom, any sort of tips or
learnings from this for other

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.900
developers curious on doing
a similar thing?

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.740
DANIEL: Well one of the most
interesting things is that

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.070
your JavaScript web programmers
and your C++ and C

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.290
game engine programmers
tend to be

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.130
different breed of people.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.610
And they don't live
in the same world.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.380
And I guess we need to grow a
new world of community where

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.910
they like to play in the same
place with the same tools in

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.930
the same kind of--

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.280
[FEEDBACK]

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.040
MALE SPEAKER: We've got some
serious action going on here.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.120
All right, we're going
to finish up.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.430
If you can maybe show us a quick
demo again of what's

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.930
going on here.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.510
DANIEL: Sure.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.550
One last thing.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.930
Now that I've been so mean,
I'm actually going to help

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.530
heal one of these guys by
dropping him a crate.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.490
Get that crate!

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.970
There you go.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.640
He's healed.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.730
So, easy.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.240
Easy to just influence a game.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.820
MALE SPEAKER: So you
could be violent or

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.470
provide some first aid.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.910
DANIEL: One of things we did
with this game was that we

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.280
made it super difficult to win
unless you have people in the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.520
crowd that are on your side.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.300
So it is in their best
interest to--

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.710
MALE SPEAKER: So
we'll encourage

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.820
folks to drop by later.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.600
DANIEL: --to come
by and help out.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.950
MALE SPEAKER: Daniel,
thank you so much.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.320
DANIEL: Thanks.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.570
MALE SPEAKER: We appreciate
your malevolence.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.180
DANIEL: Appreciate it, thanks.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.090
MALE SPEAKER: OK we're joined
now by Jayme from the Chrome

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.700
team to talk about a project
that's redefining what it

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.600
means to have a jam session.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.870
And I don't think I'm
overstating that.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.330
Because this is absolutely
amazing.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.540
So walk me through what this is
called and how people can

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.840
interact with these
instruments from

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.020
anywhere in the world.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.430
JAYME: Sure.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.850
So at I/O today we're giving
a demonstration of Web Lab,

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.170
which is a series of physical
installations housed at the

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.410
London Science Museum, and that
could be controlled by

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.660
anyone anywhere in the world
through their browser in an

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.230
immersive HTML5 experience.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.160
Now one of those installations
is what

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.090
we're calling The Orchestra.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.560
And it explores the theme of
how the web has now enabled

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.570
people from all over the world
to come together and make

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.690
things in ways that were
never before possible.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.435
MALE SPEAKER: In this
case we're talking

00:04:38.435 --> 00:04:39.200
about making music.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.750
JAYME: So for music, what we've
done is created eight

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.830
robotic mechanical musical
instruments that are housed in

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.260
London Science Museum.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.170
And you can come to
chromeweblab.com and take

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.750
control of those instruments
and make music with people

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.870
from all over the world in a
three minute jam session.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.530
MALE SPEAKER: All right, this
is a fascinating demo, we

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.970
should say.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.280
This is absolutely live
in London right now.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.930
This is set up.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.220
This is no trickery,
no pre-anything.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.610
JAYME: No, no.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.280
Not at all.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.086
So it's coming up to 5
o'clock in the London

00:05:09.086 --> 00:05:10.680
Science Museum now.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.460
And if we go into the
experiment, we can get a live

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.000
video and audio stream
directly from there.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.590
So we'll just give
it a sec to load.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.210
MALE SPEAKER: And just so people
can know more, where

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.620
can they go to find out
information on this?

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.630
JAYME: Sure.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.620
So at the moment, this
is just an exclusive

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.540
developer preview at IO.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.730
You can go to chromeweblab.com
to watch the teaser trailer.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.890
We're going to be launching in
beta later in the summer and

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.760
then coming out of beta once
we've got feedback, both

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.170
online and in the museum,
later in the year.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.390
MALE SPEAKER: Or beta
for those of us on

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.262
this side of the pond.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:46.700
JAYME:That's right.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.200
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.977
So walk us through this.

00:05:47.977 --> 00:05:48.300
It's really cool.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.600
JAYME: Sure.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.080
So once you've chosen to play
the museum instruments, you

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.430
have a choice of different
instruments to play from.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.700
You can already hear that
there are a couple of

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.520
instruments being played
by people.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.630
Let's say the vibraphone.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.010
That's my favorite instrument.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.570
So, it's just loading up the
video and audio here.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.230
And we'll join the queue.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.650
MALE SPEAKER: So if you want to
be a participant in this,

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.970
there's a queue for
each instrument.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.420
You get a set amount of
time to participate--

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.100
JAYME: That's right.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.140
There's a queue.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.360
And each person has a
three-minute jam session.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.650
So there aren't huge backlogs.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.500
While you wait, you can still
go and play with any of the

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.210
other experiments
within Web Lab.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.060
But we're already straight in.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.400
So let's go for it.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.070
MALE SPEAKER: So folks
who are at the museum

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.780
are seeing this happen.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.600
Can they control some of these
instruments as well?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.050
JAYME: That's right.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.660
So there are eight instruments
in total.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.890
During museum opening hours,
four are controlled by people

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.660
in the museum.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.780
And four are controlled
by people online.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.630
The other cool thing about
this project is that the

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.980
science museum is letting it run
for 24 hours a day, seven

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.330
days a year, for a whole year.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.750
And so, at nighttime, all eight
instruments will be

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.480
handed over to online users.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.687
MALE SPEAKER: Which will be
amazing to see this all

00:07:07.687 --> 00:07:08.650
happening in the middle
of the night.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.510
JAYME: Yeah, it's a real
night-at-the-museum type

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.260
experience.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.550
MALE SPEAKER: All right, so
go ahead and play this

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.030
vibraphone for us.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.570
JAYME: Yeah.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.800
So here we have a sequencer.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.750
You can see I'm the
pink colors.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.050
The purple and blue dots are
other instruments being played

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.990
by people from around
the world.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.870
So we're here in Moscone
in San Francisco.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.560
MALE SPEAKER: And there it is.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.840
It's playing--

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.740
JAYME: This is the live video
and audio coming through.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.260
There's some clever stuff going
on with Web Sockets and

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.190
Node.js to make sure that all
the clients are synced.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.460
And that the jam you're having
with someone in Brazil or

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.095
someone in New York is exactly
the same as what you're

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:43.905
hearing wherever
you're playing.

00:07:43.905 --> 00:07:44.810
MALE SPEAKER: This
is super cool.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.950
And just quickly, when
is it available for

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.790
everyone to try it out?

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.610
JAYME: So from later in the
summer, we're going to be

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.090
going into beta.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.930
And go to chromeweblab.com and
follow Chrome's G+ page to be

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.160
the first to know when
it will launch.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:57.330
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:57.960
This is awesome stuff.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.750
Jayme, thank you so much
for this tour.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.210
Appreciate it.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:00.520
JAYME: Thank you.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.070
Cheers.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.280
MALE SPEAKER: Moving
on to mobile now.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.130
And for fans of Chrome, you
know that the Chrome

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.550
Experiments for desktop has
been around for awhile.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.780
But the mobile experiments
is very recent.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.020
We're joined by Boris, who is a

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.620
developer-advocate at Google.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.740
Tell me a little bit about
Mobile Experiments.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.950
Why it was created, and
how people can use it?

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:17.220
BORIS: Right.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.205
So we launched this project for
the launch of Chrome for

00:08:21.205 --> 00:08:24.000
Android stable, which happened
just yesterday.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.250
And basically, all the
experiments are available on

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.180
chromeexperiments.com.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.000
And if you're on a mobile
device, you'll get redirected

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.320
to the mobile version.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.570
So here I have the mobile
version of the Chrome

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.360
Experiments on my phone.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.045
And the phone is being mirrored
to this large display

00:08:39.045 --> 00:08:41.360
here, so that you can
all see what's

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.030
happening on the screen.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:42.299
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:46.040
So anyone who wants to go and
get some inspiration can go to

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.510
the Chrome Experiments site.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.160
BORIS: Exactly.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.970
So Chrome Experiments initially
launched as a

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.310
community thing.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.860
So a lot of people just have
been creating these great

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.240
visualizations and other
interactive animations, and

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.210
submitting them to Chrome
Experiments for other people

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.640
to get inspired and
submit their own.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:01.830
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.010
So walk us through the
first one you've

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.030
got for mobile here.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.870
BORIS: Sure.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.910
So this is a multi-touch toy.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.990
Of course on mobile, things are
a little bit different.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:15.080
We have touch input, slightly
slower CPUs.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.920
So a lot of these things
need to be done on GPU.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.950
And a lot of interesting-ness
comes from multi-touch

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:22.980
interaction.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.840
So here you can see,
as I move my finger

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.860
around on the screen--

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.380
MALE SPEAKER: That's really
cool with just one finger.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:28.940
BORIS: Just one finger.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.280
MALE SPEAKER: And can you pull
it up just a little bit?

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.000
And we can see you've got more
than one finger on there.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.190
BORIS: Let me switch
modes as well.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.840
I'll switch it to Galaxy.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.210
So here you can see--
oops, sorry, that

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.580
must have been Bubbles.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.076
I'll switch it to Galaxy.

00:09:39.076 --> 00:09:41.400
And you can see the star
moving around.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.450
Now, if I do multiple
fingers, three

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.280
fingers, even four fingers--

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.050
and this can track up to 10 or
so touch points at once.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.070
MALE SPEAKER: Now can you talk
to me about some of the

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.960
technology involved with this?

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.110
BORIS: Sure.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.920
So this is all being rendered
on a large Canvas element.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.480
Canvas is a standard
HTML5 technology.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.200
And generally, Chrome for
Android supports many of the

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.520
same HTML5 technologies
that Chrome does.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.990
So here you can see, it's very
smooth, very responsive.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.760
This is due to hardware
acceleration.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.810
So, pretty neat stuff.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:13.250
MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.600
Let's move on to the next one,
which is a way to spice up

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.240
menu selections, which is part
of so many different apps.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.560
But they can look staid and not
really that interesting.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.630
And so, there's a new one here
that could provide some cool--

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:31.570
BORIS: This is a totally new
take on scrolling lists.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:35.610
So let me go back to the Chrome
Experiments site.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.620
And here.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.130
You can visit this site as well
on your mobile device.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:40.610
MALE SPEAKER: Again,
it's brand new.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.350
So there are just a handful
of them there now.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.410
But more to come, obviously.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.160
BORIS: I think there's
about eight.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.800
But we're going to open
this up for external

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.650
developers to submit.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.310
So this is the list experiment
that we talked about.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.550
And you can see here, what looks
like a regular touch

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.720
list comes to life when
I start scrolling.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.250
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, nice.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:04.000
BORIS: So these little things
slide into place.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.990
And this is all done with
CSS-3 animations and

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.200
transitions.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:07.370
MALE SPEAKER: Nice.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.530
So we don't have
much time left.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.126
So I'd love to get to the
last example, if we

00:11:10.126 --> 00:11:12.030
can, which is a game.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:17.270
Which is very, very popular for
folks on mobile devices.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.180
But in this case, it taps into
what we were talking about

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.320
earlier, with that multi-touch
ability.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.790
BORIS: Exactly.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.120
So the last one I'll show
is called Finger Forest.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:33.080
And it is a side scroller, but
again it uses touch for input.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.730
MALE SPEAKER: So they created
a little game here to

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.730
illustrate it.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.300
BORIS: It's a little game.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:41.860
So basically, it's a forest.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:47.510
And the forest has acorns
and squirrels in it.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.510
And you're the squirrel.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.700
And let me just show this
on a different device.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:02.330
So you're the squirrel.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.090
And the idea is to bring the
squirrel to the acorn, and

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.560
make it do a happy dance.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.440
So I'll just draw a line here.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.660
MALE SPEAKER: All about
the happy dance.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.575
BORIS: Definitely.

00:12:11.575 --> 00:12:13.590
MALE SPEAKER: Oh no, Boris!

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.710
BORIS: So I seem to have
failed that one.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.100
But if you succeed, eventually
you get to levels where you

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.440
have multiple squirrels
and multiple acorns.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.400
And you have to solve
the puzzle.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.530
And the trick is, you need to
keep your finger down on the

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.090
screen for the whole time.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.590
Otherwise it crashes.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.970
So it's a pretty simple
little game.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.170
And what this uses-- it actually
technologically is

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.165
quite interesting.

00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:38.890
Because it has multiple
canvases layered

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.710
on top of one another.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:40.900
MALE SPEAKER: And here
you could use the

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.910
two fingers as well.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.110
BORIS: And here we're getting
into two fingers.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.820
MALE SPEAKER: That's
very cool.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.110
Boris, thank you so much
for this demo.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.205
The point is inspiration for
folks who are developing on

00:12:49.205 --> 00:12:50.990
the mobile platform, right?

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.780
Thank you so much.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:51.996
BORIS: My pleasure.

00:12:51.996 --> 00:12:52.762
Thanks.

00:12:52.762 --> 00:12:55.840
MALE SPEAKER: And we finish up
our visit to the Chrome area

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.340
with Ido, who's going to do an
un-boxing of the Chromebox.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.320
Which has been a sort of
replacement for the desktop.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.070
And you're going to do it and
get it all set up here in

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.010
under two minutes.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:06.680
Is that right?

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.470
IDO: Exactly.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.990
MALE SPEAKER: Ready

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.030
IDO: You taking the time?

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:12.620
MALE SPEAKER: Go!

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.970
IDO: So first here,
I just open it.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.160
It's packed real nice.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.110
Put it aside.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.770
First and foremost, just
put the electric in.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.580
And then some Internet
connection.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.080
MALE SPEAKER: Still got the
plastic wrap on it?

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.960
IDO: Oh yeah, that's fine.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.640
I'll just clear it if we want.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.980
MALE SPEAKER: You've got
all the connectors.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.180
And tell me a little
bit about the specs

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.170
that's inside the Chromebox.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.550
IDO: So, it's got
a very nice CPU.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.440
It runs much faster than
it used to be.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.540
And basically, this device
is replacing the desktop.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.850
You're getting a very
easy installation.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.560
If I'm [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.260
MALE SPEAKER: And much
smaller, obviously.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:46.990
IDO: Much smaller.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.350
The design is really sleek.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.900
And you'll see that now
it's booting up.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.030
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.805
That is under 30 seconds.

00:13:52.805 --> 00:13:54.620
IDO: Yeah, and now actually
we could set it.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.610
So it's really, really a smooth
and a nice experience

00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:59.980
to set it up.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.120
And it's already checking
the updates.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.040
It will download, now,
the latest software.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.110
And it's a very, very
powerful device.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.970
I strongly recommend
it to users.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.930
MALE SPEAKER: Now you're a
developer-advocate at Google.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.980
What's the response been on the
Chromebox which has been

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.820
out for a few months or so?

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.990
IDO: Oh, it was very,
very great response.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.220
We got lots of great feedback
that we are listening to.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.370
And then we're going to
improve it over time.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.550
And just like in Chrome, every
six weeks we're getting a new

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.670
version in it, which is
extremely important.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.760
Because then you have the
speed, simplicity, and

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.900
security all baked in and
getting proven over time.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.620
So unlike other systems, which
over time you need to take

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.820
care of them, this is actually
getting better over time.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.120
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.385
So the Chromebox we have.

00:14:40.385 --> 00:14:42.440
Of course Chromebooks, people
know about already, too.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.650
What's the developer response
been between the two of them,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.440
in terms of being able to do--

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.090
IDO: Oh, amazingly warm.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.870
Actually on Chromebooks, we have
this huge battery life.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.010
So you could literally go and
work with it for a full day.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.480
And the battery is very nice.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.350
The trackpad is amazingly
good.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.080
And it's a very, very
nice device.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.020
We mostly look at it as a
producing-content device.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.260
So the keyboard is very nice.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.880
If you need to write
long essays, that's

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.760
the device for you.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.174
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so are we
almost-- we're almost set up

00:15:07.174 --> 00:15:07.430
here, right?

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.490
IDO: Oh, yeah, I could
just login.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.950
MALE SPEAKER: So it's very
similar to a Chromebook

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.080
experience.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.790
You use your Google account.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.190
IDO: And once I'm in,
we have the sync.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.590
So everything that I worked on,
on other machines would be

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.990
synced in automatically.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.190
So the exact point that I left
my desktop, it's right here.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.400
We could take a photo, just
for the first time.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.465
I could actually
take my photo.

00:15:30.465 --> 00:15:32.710
It just took it from my G+.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:36.160
And at first we have this
initialize screen to show you

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.370
what's going on.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.950
And it's updating--

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.565
MALE SPEAKER: And this
is actually bringing

00:15:39.565 --> 00:15:40.700
in all of your tabs?

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.010
IDO: Everything.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:42.080
All my extensions.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.940
Everything that makes
me more productive.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.960
And I am good and up to run.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.090
MALE SPEAKER: I mean, obviously
it took a very, very

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.960
short amount of time.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.020
And that's really the purpose
of this, is to-- of course

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.320
it's a great platform
for developers.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.070
But it's such a seamless and
easy experience to just boot

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.350
up and be able to be online.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.490
IDO: Absolutely.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.990
And actually in Chromebook,
it will boot up in

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.750
less than six seconds.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:04.020
Actually much faster,
most of the time.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.070
MALE SPEAKER: Six seconds?

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:05.700
IDO: Six seconds.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.330
From offline.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.050
So if you are just in sleeping
mode, it's immediate.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.120
And if you are offline, it's
probably six, maybe less.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.460
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:12.740
IDO: It's very impressive.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.435
MALE SPEAKER: That's
fantastic.

00:16:13.435 --> 00:16:14.650
You can't get much faster.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.860
Well, I suppose you can
get faster than that.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.320
IDO: Yeah.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.030
I mean, it's extremely fast.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.610
And we did that because in
that case, less is more.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.640
So you're getting less
headaches, less things that

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.990
you don't really need in
use day in, day out.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.260
And this actually great OS is
built for people that are

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.340
spending the vast majority
of their time on the web.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.300
Which is lots of us.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:34.790
MALE SPEAKER: Which is
pretty much all of

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.820
us these days, right?

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.380
IDO: Exactly.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.070
So in that mind, this was the
main goal to achieve.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.090
And I think it's working
very, very nicely.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:42.500
MALE SPEAKER: All right, Ido.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.290
Thank you so much for
that demonstration.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:43.640
IDO: Thank you.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.120
MALE SPEAKER: That
was fantastic.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.530
Stay tuned for lots more
here at I/O Live.
