00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.580
You'll find that the essential
interactions are how many rows,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.010
what is the cell for each one, and what
should happen when a row is selected?

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.030
The first two are required
to build a table at all.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.480
We'll see that tables ask how many
rows they have, and then for each row,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.390
they ask for a cell view.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.710
After we build some tables,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.240
we'll look at what should
happen when a row is selected.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.020
This is the most common way that
users interact with tables.
