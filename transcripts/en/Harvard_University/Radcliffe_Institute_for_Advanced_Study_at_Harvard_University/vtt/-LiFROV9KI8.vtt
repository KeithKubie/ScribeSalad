00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.370
- Now, let me state
what I'm going to do.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.670
The big question I'm
trying to get at is this.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.400
What do we mean when
we say the "flight

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.210
to heaven" in early China?

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.700
What is heaven?

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.170
Is there really
"up there" there?

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.590
So the best case to state
this issue is the following.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.850
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.290
- In 1974, some farmers
digging a new well

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.400
in the shadow of a strange
hill collided with history.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:01:03.360
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.200
- For at the bottom
of that simple well

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.310
stood the army of
the mighty Qin,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.565
still leading their
emperor into eternity.

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:17.525

[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.800
- 8,000 terracotta
warriors, none of them

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.670
look alike, what for?

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.169
The army, as the film states,
is leading their emperor

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.130
into eternity.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.590
Really?

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.290
Well, we don't want to
beat up on the filmmakers

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.730
because I love film makers.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.570
I think the scholars are to be
blamed for this misinformation.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.280
So what I'm going to
do today is really to--

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.400
I hope-- set the
record straight.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.270
The common explanation of the
presence of terracotta army

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.970
is that it is there
to defend the tomb.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.810
Again, really?

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.720
Now, just give you
a little background,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.700
this is the Qin state.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.790
And it actually came
from very humble origin

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.860
and was actually considered
barbarian in comparison

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.230
with all the six
states to the east.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.990
The six states are more
cultured, more civilized,

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.220
whereas the Qin started as a
sort of backward backwater.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.640
But then because they
instituted the political reform

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.080
and the rule of by law,
they eventually took over

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.740
and then annexed the
land of China in 221 BC.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.835
And as soon as the emperor--

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:25.390
initially a young prince
who stepped into the throne

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.140
at the age of 13--

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.720
ascended to the throne, the
construction of the mausoleum

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.920
started.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.680
And it took about four
decades to finish,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.440
so it has been a long
haul for this monuments

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.080
to come to being.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:53.620
Now, oddities abound
about this tomb complex.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.300
The foremost question is this.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.860
What again, was the
terracotta army for?

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.490
If the army is there to
defend the emperor's tomb,

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.290
why is it located so far off--

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.080
one mile away-- from the tomb?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.660
If defense was their mission,
why the so-called warriors

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.959
are not in a combat
ready condition?

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.890
For one thing, none
of them wear helmets.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.830
Not for lack of helmet
at the site, only

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.420
they seem to be misplaced
as if deliberately kept away

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.575
from the warriors.

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:40.790
Piles of helmets are stored in
an auxiliary pit immediately

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.800
east of the tomb mound.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.930
Made of stone, they are not
meant to be actually worn.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.020
So we have a curious situation.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.200
The soldiers are deprived
of helmets for a reason.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.270
The helmets are kept
away from the warriors

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.730
in permanent storage.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.370
Very likely, the message
seems to be-- peace reigns

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.260
in this land, or in this world.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.760
There's no need for
military action,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.730
so the helmets are put away.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.850
But then, there's
really no question

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.610
that the terracotta
figures are what they are.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.810
That is, they are
soldiers, warriors,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.000
only they are not
ready to fight.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.320
If the army is not there
to fight, what is it for?

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.640
Or what is it good for?

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.860
There are more mysteries.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.220
The defense theory
says that the army

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.560
is there to defend the tomb.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.590
And then to the west
side of the tomb

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.210
archaeologists found
two bronze carriages

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.160
and now commonly believed to be
emperor's spirit vehicle that

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.330
takes him to heaven.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.220
So the situation is
basically like this.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.510
The commander-in-chief
says, soldiers

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.760
I really appreciate
you defending me,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.620
now I'm leaving you.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.457
So they essentially
beat their ways and head

00:06:12.457 --> 00:06:13.540
into different directions.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.760
So apparently you can
see that the defense

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.540
theory doesn't quite hold.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.280
So the key to unlock the
all this set of mysteries

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.850
actually lies in an auxiliary
burial pit right here.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.210
The army was there.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.870
The pit is here to the
southeast of the tomb mount.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.960
The pit contains 24 or so
life size, or even larger

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.750
than life, terracotta figures.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.260
Apparent upper bare
torso in sharp contrast

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:54.050
with the terracotta warriors
one mile to the east.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.430
So what you have here is
actually an oxymoron--

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.740
that these figures
are now commonly

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.590
believed to be acrobats.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.090
Indeed, they are.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.570
But then, they are
really solid acrobat,

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.031
very serious acrobat, which
is essentially an oxymoron.

00:07:16.031 --> 00:07:18.680
Acrobats are
supposed to make fun

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.090
but there they are,
all in a straight face.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.350
And then there is this bronze
vessel found in the pit.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.710
By its size and
weight it is certainly

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.960
the most stately ritual vessel
of the land in this time.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.980
Now, bronze vessels
are ceremonial objects

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.310
often associated with temple
offerings and other ritual

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.410
occasions.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.190
As such, their
symbolic significance

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.550
derives from their
physical size, weight,

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.800
and refined decoration.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.050
Now, the cauldron here
is weighty enough,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:05.990
but it is really a
sort of odd piece out.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.250
According to the
early ritual manual,

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.950
there's a hierarchy in
the number of vessels

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.450
that you are entitled for use.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.590
So the common gentry,
the gentleman,

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.920
is entitled to one vessel.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.520
The vassal state rulers
are entitled to three,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.360
ministers of state entitled
to five, son of heaven--

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.460
that is emperor--

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.480
entitled to nine.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.580
But here we actually have
the curious situation

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.470
that the emperor
receives only one vessel,

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.710
which obviously
his doesn't quite

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.570
square with the ritual theory.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:55.270
So again, we have a problem of
what is the cauldron here for?

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.880
There are three
prevailing theories.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.100
One is that the
vessel is there--

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.650
initially belonged to
an ancestral temple,

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.190
and in the time of
crisis, a wartime crisis,

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:11.770
it was in haste
moved to this pit.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.810
The second theory
is that it is part

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:19.560
of a ritual ceremony,
in which case

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.510
it expands the seriousness
of these acrobats.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.690
The third theory is no, no,
no, they the whole thing

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:31.250
is just entertainment for
the afterlife emperor.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:38.740
Now, we can basically
eliminate all three theories

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.539
very quickly.

00:09:39.539 --> 00:09:41.080
The first one
obviously doesn't hold.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.370
If it's a serious
temple object, you

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.870
don't want to put it in the
company of mere acrobats.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:55.000
It should have received
more serious placement.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.910
If it's a funeral, then
you're hard-pressed to explain

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.610
the presence of the acrobats.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.680
And if you stick
to the acrobats,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.850
you then find yourself struggle
to explain the cauldron.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.760
So essentially you have
this impossible situation,

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.100
either way it
doesn't quite work.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.010
So I guess the bottom line
is-- the baseline is--

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.580
we have to find a
way to explain both

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.340
the cauldron and the acrobats.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.040
And if we can do that, then
we have a key to this problem.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.000
So fortunately I have--

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.110
and this is, I guess,
in my discovery--

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.690
I have found this
sarcophagus near contemporary

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:46.790
to the site that has both the
cauldron and the sarcophagus.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:51.230
So if we can unlock the secret
here in this sarcophagus,

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.780
then we have a way of
explaining why is it

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.730
that the cauldron and the
acrobatics belong together.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:05.890
Now, the sarcophagus is carved
on both in and out of faces.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.040
And in the interest
of time, I'm not

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.610
going to take you through
all the iconographic

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.360
identification, which
is the sort of thing

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.030
we art historians
make a living on.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.200
So I'll just present
you with the finding.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.260
So the finding is essentially
that what you have here

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.834
is a seasonal cycle.

00:11:25.834 --> 00:11:28.270
Now, why seasonal cycle?

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.130
More precisely, what
is the relevance

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.230
of the seasonal cycle
to a sarcophagus

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.110
intended to hold a dead body?

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.500
Now, implicit here is actually
the early Chinese understanding

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.610
of individual body and
its post-mortem existence.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.450
To begin with, the body is
just a vessel and the system.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.050
What makes life
possible is the key--

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.250
vital energy, or breath.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.650
The enemy is both
the natural world

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.890
out there and the human body.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.920
The breath manifests itself
in the seasonal cycle.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.450
The key also consists of
both yin and yang energies,

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.490
two key components.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.980
In springtime the
yang energy grows,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.050
reaching its apex in summer.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.300
Subsequently, that
yin energy grows,

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.530
hitting the nadir in winter.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:27.010
The system is expressed in a
more abstract set of notations

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.300
that Chinese devised to describe
the broader range of phenomena,

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.490
and this set consists
of eight trigrams.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:40.570
So you would have the
Zhen, Li, Dui, Kan.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.600
Now, a trigram is--

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.440
as you can see--

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.460
consists of essentially two
line, well, three lines,

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.970
but of two kinds.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.670
One is the broken line,
another is the continuous line.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.760
So essentially,
the way it works is

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.780
rather like the computer
language, on and off,

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.535
and with that you can account
for a variety of phenomena.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.310
In fact, this
whole trigram thing

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.410
is really a
computational device.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.290
Now, I wouldn't bore you
with all the elaborate detail

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.560
of how this complex
system works but suffice

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:28.280
to call attention to trigrams,
Li on top, and Kan below.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:37.000
Now, the whole point of having
this kind of abstract system

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.750
or scheme is that it can
be used to describe a range

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.810
of phenomenon and things.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:52.780
So take for example, the word,
the notion, the concept of Kan

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.640
that is used here.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.900
It can mean a list of things.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.240
In fact, the list
can go on forever.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:06.460
So largely it's north, winter,
water, kidney, essence.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:13.170
And this whole system also works
by way of binary relations.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:17.230
So you can just flip
this to describe what's

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.829
opposite in regard to Li.

00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:21.370
So that's how this
whole thing works.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:31.810
Now, if we plucked this
into the set of values

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.600
into the bodily
system, we see how

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.610
all early Chinese conception of
the body is not about the body.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.780
It is really a
network of values.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.180
They are reference points.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.785
The network allows
for the conception

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:51.240
of body as both a physical
frame and the ecology

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.570
of natural elements.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:59.640
The Kan trigram that
you see here, the trike,

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.440
actually points to
a set of qualities--

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.570
water, nadir, kidney, winter,
and so on and so forth.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.110
To the extent that it
has a water quality,

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.220
it feeds on the body
as a imaginary ecology,

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.550
pumping up the water,
as you can see here.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:22.410
So the spinal track is where
you pump your energy up

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.150
to the brain area.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.710
And they call it pumping up the
water, the essence, whatever,

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.800
from the kidney region
up to the brain area

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.680
where it nourishes
the vitality and makes

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.950
the body's system functional.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:44.880
Now, the Kan department--
and we can call it

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.670
a department because the
Chinese have this way of mapping

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.430
bureaucracy into everything.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.190
So this Kan department
provides the energy source,

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.850
often visualized as a ding.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.570
Vessel, as you can see here.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:05.230
That is this tripart quadrant
that Chinese call ding.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.990
Here the Chi or breath
is processed and turned

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.640
into a vital energies.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.180
The process is one of
physiological alchemy,

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.600
also called a
inner alchemy, that

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.890
is a physiological
process modeled

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.190
upon the heart of
physical alchemy.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:27.530
Now, if we mapped this onto
the sarcophagus carving,

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:32.600
we can see how this
whole bodily system

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.870
works by way of seasonal cycle.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:40.100
But also this is where
we also find a ding,

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.190
the quadrant, the vessel.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.890
Here, right here.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.490
But the question also
is why is this ding--

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.900
this particular ding, as seen
as being raised from the water,

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.620
which is a Kan system--

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.420
tilted?

00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.590
And it's often repeatedly
shown up in numerous examples

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.480
as a tilted object.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.210
There's actually a good
point why it is tilted.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:09.690
The early Book of Change, for
those of you who lived through

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.920
in the 1960s would know that
I Ching, a Book of Change,

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.430
would give you the description
that this ding vessel is

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.569
something that gets rid
of the stale passings

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:24.050
and taking the
fresh good things.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:29.390
So essentially, this
is a trope for saying

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.990
that this is a
vessel that allows

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.930
you to change your
breath, especially

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.870
if you consider that--

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.230
here's a passage.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.910
So the cauldron is overthrown,
its feet turned up,

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.580
but there will be
advantage in getting

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.050
rid of what is bad in it.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:49.070
So for the practitioner, a
breathing exercise that could

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:54.330
use this concept to regulate
their breath and consider--

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.680
especially in the time
of seasonal change--

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.000
you get rid of the stale breath,
you're taking the fresh breath,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.680
and that goes on through
your internal vessel.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.040
And that's why you could
see that it's tilted,

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.060
and there's also the
dragon sticking out.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.500
The dragon is normally
on this rising yang

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.330
associated with the spring,
and so on and so forth.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.390
And what is that bubble thing?

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:32.030
Well, one possible meaning is
that if you look at this also

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:37.770
from a painted, or rather
contemporary painted coffin,

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:44.690
you will see this young figure
with this antlered archer

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:45.845
shooting at the bubble.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:54.860
It's held by this bird, so the
meaning is actually clear--

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.010
essentially the one who
killed the stale breaths.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.280
And so this bird is going
through this breathing exercise

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.860
and thereby gaining vitality.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:18.136
So if we then examine where
this cauldron scene is located

00:19:18.136 --> 00:19:19.510
in this entire
program, you could

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:23.820
see that it is right
between spring and summer,

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.640
and so everything
starts to make sense.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.530
All right, so we
kind of explained

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.920
what the cauldron is
doing there, and now let's

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.250
move to the acrobatics.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.870
If the vessel scene is about the
springtime growth of the yang

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:47.390
energy--

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.470
or also known as the
growing yang energy--

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:55.100
the acrobatic scene pertains
to the autumn sequence.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.760
It's part of the
autumn sequence,

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.290
and it pertains to the
growth of that yin energy.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.410
And that is the case here.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.310
But the question is
why is the acrobatics

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.920
associated with the autumn?

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.510
And this actually, is a result
of historical development.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.260
Autumn-- so essentially,
what I'm saying

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.360
is that these two
things, even though they

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.250
have seasonal association,
but the real point

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:28.000
is that they are each associated
with a particular kind

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.570
of energy.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.320
This is a rather a
growing yang energy,

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.250
and this is a
growing yin energy.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.370
So the question is why is this
growing yin energy, this autumn

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:40.880
energy, associated
with acrobatics?

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.295
Initially, autumn is a time--

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.430
commonly considered
the time associated

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.930
with a withering killer
spirit, or breath

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.500
that strips the tree of leaves.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.310
So the fact that we observe
in autumn the wind stripped

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.940
the tree of leaves, you
know that this breath

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.620
is kind of killer.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.250
And so early calendrical
text basing an autumn

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.830
for military action,
since human affairs

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:14.220
are expected to conform to
the cyclical rhythm of nature.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.490
If nature kills in
autumn, then human beings

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.570
should do so accordingly.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.020
In other words, if you
read these ritual manuals,

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.100
basically say that you are not
allowed to wage war in spring

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.530
because that's a
time when life begins

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.120
and absolutely forbidden.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.460
So yes, if you want to wage
war, do it in the autumn.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:39.870
So military action or
martial exercise often

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.760
signify an autumn scene.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:49.290
Over time, the military
exercise, or martial exercise,

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.450
evolved into a variety show.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:55.010
I guess people-- most
people-- don't like war.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.610
So they are accordingly
replaced by acrobats

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.920
as a signature scene of autumn.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.400
So in either case, the
growth yin energy in autumn

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.680
is the real point.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.330
Now, if we are to
diagram this movement

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.460
of growing yang and growing yin
energies, we would have this.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:23.640
The growing yang ascends,
the growing yin descends.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.930
And if you are to correlate
them to seasonal terms,

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.850
as early Chinese
are prone to do,

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.820
we end up having the
winter as a nadir,

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.270
and the summer as the apex.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.000
The dispersion of energies,
a condition of falling apart,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.290
spells death in early
Chinese imagination.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.830
Conversely, concentration
of energies and convergence

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.290
of growing yin and
growing yang energies

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:53.340
spell life and vitality.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:59.160
For that reason, this decorative
scene of a whole vessel

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.830
is rather suggestive.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.730
You could see that this
is the autumn scene,

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.940
therefore it signifies
growing yin energy.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.810
And you can only go down, and
that gets you to the winter.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:14.280
And in the meantime,
these mulberry tree

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.590
scenes and so forth--

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.520
archery scenes associated
with the growing yang,

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.650
the spring, therefore
you can go up

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:29.040
and you can see that the hot
mating scene signifying summer.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.790
So you could see that the
cycle is actually disrupted.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:36.480
Each growing yang
breath and growing yin

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.280
breath go separate ways.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.346
And that it actually
is a bad situation

00:23:40.346 --> 00:23:41.970
because you don't
want that to happen--

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:47.210
because essentially what that
situation means is death.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.000
But for the design
of the vessel they

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.960
want to make sure that things
don't go wrong, don't go back.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.220
So they created this
middle band which

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.670
are this part of the scene--

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.500
actually, is the autumn scene,
and this is the spring scene.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.320
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.150
This is the spring scene,
and this is the autumn scene.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:14.030
So the point is to artificially
let two yin and yang breaths

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.700
to come together,
therefore creating life.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.760
And that is a perfect sort
of cosmological model,

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.760
as you can see, even though
it takes seasonal cycle

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.550
as it's a natural model.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.080
But you could see it's
actually quite artificial.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.660
It's a way of, you might
say, going against nature

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.710
to some extent because
it's working against how

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.330
the seasonal cycle would go.

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.050
So you could see that
essentially that's

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:48.850
a condition of vitality.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:53.250
This is the ideal
situation you want to have.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.350
And if we go back
to our sarcophagus

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:59.610
we see the cauldron
and acrobatics scenes,

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.230
and then we know
what they really

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:06.000
pertain to is to have both the
growing yang and growing yin

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.790
energies facing each other.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.130
And sure enough, you will
have the summer scene

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.900
with two birds and everything.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:20.820
So that is essentially the
larger underlying design.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:29.370
And again, if we
return to our pit,

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:34.110
you see essentially the
same, the presence of the two

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.300
components-- the
growing yang and growing

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.170
yin coming together.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:44.550
So what you see here
is that the pairing

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.150
of the cauldron
and the acrobatics

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:52.680
suggest a staged symbolic
effort aimed at revitalization

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.180
by bringing together growing
yang and growing yin energies.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.950
Now, a cross reference
to our sarcophagus scene

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.930
suggests that indeed,
that is the case.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:10.800
You have three figures in
the upper temple scene,

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.380
as you can see, two of them
seated with raising the finger

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:21.060
and pointing downward, with
another one bringing two things

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.760
together.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:26.040
So this gesture essentially
is heaven, and this is earth.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.740
So they're praying both
to heaven and earth.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:34.380
And this figure essentially
is a hypothetical, imaginative

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.330
figure that can force--

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:40.930
that can bring these two forces,
the heaven and earth, together.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:46.110
And if we notice this
whole gesture of pointing,

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:50.190
and we go to our pit, we find
all these figures are doing--

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.380
a lot of these figures
doing the same thing.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.920
They raise their fingers, which
is again, quite suggestive.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.950
And this pit actually is
also suggestive in that you

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:06.330
have all these figures
arrayed in pairs,

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.990
and one stout figure
facing one skinny figure.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.270
And that has puzzled scholars.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.580
Why is it?

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.830
So my theory is that probably
the skinny figure stands

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.190
for the growing yang, and
the stout figure stands

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.250
for the growing yin, and they
represent different energy

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:27.300
forces and that coming together.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.270
And to further
testify my theory,

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:34.740
you can see from a sarcophagus a
carving of two fingers likewise

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:41.100
with the upper bare torso
trying to raise this cauldron--

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.120
this vessel--

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.230
up in a way that
these figures seem

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.770
to collaborate in this
whole ritual process,

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:50.940
as you can see here.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.240
And keeping in mind
pairing, it's also--

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.340
we can see how the same
logic works out in slightly

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.650
different iconography.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.940
So from another sarcophagus you
see a cauldron in the middle,

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.260
and you see the dragon, and
you see the tiger, respectively

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.930
representing growing
yin and growing yang.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.670
So by this stage
I'm sure you know

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.770
very well just how this
whole vocabulary, how

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.240
this whole mechanism, works.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.090
Essentially, they're coming
together, merging their breaths

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.350
in this vessel.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.900
And lo and behold, this
vessel starts to come alive.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.880
You can see the pair
of eyes opening.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.394
Essentially it means
that life is happening

00:28:30.394 --> 00:28:32.310
in this vessel, which
is another way of saying

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:38.370
that this vessel itself is
a sort of energy cooker,

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.920
and things go in and life
becomes possible there.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.010
It's a kind of incubator.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:52.470
So again, don't take
tiger, dragon literally.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:57.270
All things in Chinese vocabulary
is more relational rather

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.870
than referential, so
what matters is really

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:08.310
how binary work and can be
replaced by similar binaries.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:13.270
So essentially, they
all mean the same thing.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:16.380
So in a way it is really sort
of a computational system.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:21.020
So you can replace all these
phenomena along the same line

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:26.030
so long as you keep
that pairing and going.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.590
But I want to call your
attention specifically

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.890
to this pair, mercury
and lead, which

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:36.180
is very essential to the
alchemy in the ancient Chinese

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:36.930
experiment.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.230
Alchemy, mercury, lead are
the key components that

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.430
would make some kind of physical
transformation possible,

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:46.770
or so they imagine.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:52.800
Then it also become the way,
even if they couldn't quite

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.680
succeed in real life,
they will imagine

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:01.980
certain physiological process
as a result of this interaction

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.410
between the mercury and lead.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.780
They believe that human
body actually has these two

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.120
components-- mercury and lead.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:13.350
And having them interact
would get your body going.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:18.650
So with that in mind, let's turn
to this paragraph by Sima Quin.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.045
The Records of the
Grand Historian

00:30:21.045 --> 00:30:24.870
were written around 100 BC.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.850
Pretty much all the
literature if you go out

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.790
to read everything about
the First Emperor tomb,

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:34.060
everyone cites this passage
because it's so well known.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.630
And that's also
how we understand,

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:42.970
or we infer that the
emperor's tomb is all about.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:46.180
So essentially it says
the emperor was interred

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.120
at this mountain and
the workers dug down

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.000
to the third layer of
underground springs

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.490
and mercury was used to fashion
imitations of the 100 rivers.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.470
Above were
representative of heaven,

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.870
below representative of earth.

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.510
Now, this paragraph had
been endlessly quoted

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.880
and misunderstood, mainly
because it's very misleading.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.930
In fact, if you watch
all these documentaries,

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.240
they basically say that
inside the emperor's tomb

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:18.660
is a representation of China
with all the Yellow River

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.880
or Huang He River below,
and with heaven above.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.780
I actually question that
because of the notion

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:31.630
of having a geopolitical map
as the object of representation

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:36.120
was very alien in early times.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.540
Actually, we do have a
very curious situation

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:44.400
that mercury is important
in tombs, and only

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.950
in two civilizations,
so far as I know,

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.540
that deploy the use of mercury
was present or practiced.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.550
One is in China,
another is in Mexico.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:58.425
So in Mexico, a
third century BC tomb

00:31:58.425 --> 00:32:02.820
you have the mercury
in a lower level.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.340
By any case, this
passage becomes

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:10.830
the source for
modern video-makers

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.970
to imagine the inside.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:18.840
Then they imagine this mercury
floating around and all that.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.750
What is wrong with
this is that it posits

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.610
a static cosmological model.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:27.390
Earth is forever Earth,
heaven is forever.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:30.510
And that is totally
wrong because the dynamic

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:33.120
of the Chinese
cosmological model

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.570
is precisely that
nothing stays what it is.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:40.260
It always goes up
and down, changes.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.830
So if we read one
of the early sources

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:45.810
you will see what I mean.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:50.820
The breath of earth ascends
on high and that of heaven

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.110
descends below.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.530
That music-- and that
is considered music

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.280
where you have the harmonious
action of heaven and earth

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.270
coming together.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.660
So this is more of a
proper understanding

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:08.130
of early cosmological model, and
that music model, that harmony,

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:13.480
of how breaths would often
constantly circulate and change

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:18.160
places, so one day's earthly
breath becomes next day's

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.590
heavenly breath, so
nothing's locked into space.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:28.280
Now, this music model,
this harmony, this flow,

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.450
is really the key, master key.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:34.130
So I think the more
fitting physical model

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:37.960
that will help you to imagine
what the early Chinese cosmos

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.400
is is this duck-shaped object.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.800
This is actually the
cosmological model

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.130
because it's painted
on both sides--

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:49.540
lack of painting both sides.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.470
On the one side is a
drum with a dragon.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:56.860
The other side is
a bell and chimes.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:01.390
So what they mean is
that the drum simulates

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.370
the thunder of the
spring, waking up

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:06.010
all the hibernating creatures
from the long slumber

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.240
of winter.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.330
And they're interacting
with the bell that

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.090
is associated with
autumn, and together they

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:16.489
can make the life
happen, as you can see,

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.820
which is this
pattern-- actually,

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:23.889
probably subtlety refers to
this copulation in spring.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:29.600
And sure enough, we
find the same pattern

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.449
appearing on that
vessel from the pit

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:33.800
I've been talking about.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.760
And it also found
both below and above,

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.060
which means that this copulation
of two kind of breaths

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.139
is constantly going on.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:52.030
So essentially, we see
that this vessel is really

00:34:52.030 --> 00:35:00.280
sort of a mixture of energy,
is an incubator of life.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.860
And it's also for
good reason that it

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.650
has some kind of
conceptual relationship

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:10.950
to this imaginary
model in the body

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:19.710
where you could see that there
is the ding vessel at the lower

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:26.430
region constantly cooking,
heating up, and generating

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.430
energy.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:34.430
And as it generates
energy, the system

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:37.734
also posits some kind of
vehicle or wheeled thing,

00:35:37.734 --> 00:35:39.150
even though this
is a [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:42.320
But sometimes they used
an image of actual vehicle

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:48.590
to carry this energy through
the spinal cord up to the brain

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.640
region.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.170
And in the meantime,
the whole thing

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:56.210
is imagined as a natural
environment, natural ecology,

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.400
which is another way of
saying that the body is not

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.870
to be taken seriously.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:05.580
It's really that ecology, that
system, that ultimately counts.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.930
So that calls our
attention to this vehicle,

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.900
what in Chinese
terms called a "river

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.060
carriage," in special terms.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:24.030
So this pairing of the vessel
and the wheeled carriage

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:28.370
is very important
for our purpose.

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:31.160
As you can see here
on the sarcophagus

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:36.080
you have the vehicle
and the cauldron,

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.640
and what is referred
to is really

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.370
this kind of relationship.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:46.530
So could it be that we
have similar correlation,

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:53.400
or connection, between a
cauldron and the vehicle?

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:59.930
Here, I'm really experimenting
so no one has thought that way.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.450
I'm probably out
on a limb on this,

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.430
but still I want
to explore further.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.080
And I think there's
a strong case

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.210
to be made that
there's a connection--

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:11.570
a possible connection there.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:14.840
So this bronze carriage,
half life-size,

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:20.510
which meant that it is
produced for afterlife use--

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.940
so this actually is a
good occasion for us

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:29.240
to kind of step back and reflect
on the whole history of the use

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:34.600
of vehicles in afterlife.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:38.000
The use of vehicles in
China goes way back,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.190
as you can see from
this burial site

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.860
where you see the
human figure and you

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.690
see the horses harnessed.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:51.560
And that dates back to
1250 BC, Shang Dynasty.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.990
And if we take a
step further back,

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.520
we essentially have
a whole history of--

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:05.930
we have a big picture view of
how the whole humankind evolved

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:12.050
in civilizational terms with
the increased use of vehicles.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:16.850
By the way, the use of chariot
is really the key technology

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:19.716
that enables the--

00:38:19.716 --> 00:38:24.330
I would say-- the
pre-Indo-European cultures

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.440
to wipe out the other
three ancient civilizations

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.480
with this.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:33.780
Around-- I guess the key
years around 1600 BC--

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.240
that was a time when this
thing really happened,

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.510
this revolution really happened.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:43.470
So I have here a
little animation.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:48.270
As you can see, this is China.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:51.790
And so this chart indicates
the passage of time.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.700
And we can see how it--

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.650
and also as a
vehicle goes around,

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:02.010
it's actually remarkable,
though the word associated

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.310
with vehicle remained
rather consistent

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.790
and gets spread around.

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:11.490
If you look at how, in
terms of linguistic entity,

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.670
that means our current
modern sense of the vehicle,

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:17.610
it goes rather consistently.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:21.030
And I think the
Chinese word [CHINESE]

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:25.110
is probably derived from
the old Indic word "chakra."

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.030
It sounds more or less similar.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.280
But the mystery really is--

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.800
this is fairly straightforward--
but the mystery really

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:41.520
is what do people bury the
vehicle in the tomb for?

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.960
Why are they doing it?

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.210
So you can see we
have two examples that

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:48.390
will probably
basically illustrate

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.340
how the scholars think
about this issue.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:54.360
One is that you have the
real life-size vehicle as

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:59.420
exemplified from the
tomb of Tutankhamen.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.250
It's decorated with the
precious objects and so forth.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:06.810
So that the minute people
or scholars see this kind

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:11.250
of life-size vehicle
highly decorated--

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:15.870
and the knee-jerk reaction
is that it [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:17.760
status, social status.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.460
It is a status symbol.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.130
And then this, from
Hungary, is a small model

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:25.380
of a vehicle crudely made.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:29.250
And then the explanation-- the
common explanation is that it

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:34.790
is transport to afterlife.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:38.830
So currently, basically
these two kind of theories.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:43.540
Fortunately, our
case here in China,

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.370
we have known enough
of the context

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:48.270
to actually go deeper than
just these two theories.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:51.592
And we can literally have a
more refined understanding--

00:40:51.592 --> 00:40:53.800
at least in the Chinese
case, I can't speak for other

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.000
cultures--

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.400
what the vehicle is
doing in the barrel.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:05.180
So recall that you have the
vessel, the inner vessel,

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:09.350
and you have the
vehicle going, and if we

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:13.400
think about what's going
on here the same logic

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.110
may be operative.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:20.970
And it's especially in
regard to this sarcophagus.

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:25.050
So the connection between
the two sets of works

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.540
actually runs deeper.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:33.510
The back of the
carriage has this door,

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:36.120
and this door is decorated.

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:43.620
And what is remarkable is that
it has two different kinds

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.700
of patterns.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.630
One is the so-called
[INAUDIBLE] pattern,

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.300
or wavy pattern, which
typically associated

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.790
with spring, with growing yang.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.400
And the other is this
[INAUDIBLE] pattern,

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.680
which is typically
associated with yin,

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.990
growing yin force with autumn.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:04.360
And they often are
brought together

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:11.120
in some kind of obviously
revitalizing intent or scheme.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:18.080
Now, if you think I'm reading
too much, we have evidence.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.250
Similar pairing shows
up the wavy pattern

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.380
and the [INAUDIBLE] pattern.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:28.220
So obviously, it's a common
vocabulary-- form of vocabulary

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.670
that they use.

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:33.410
And if we again look at a
more contemporary design,

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.630
you see there
again the cauldron.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.090
You see the tiger, dragon.

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:41.450
By now you know it's growing
yin force, growing yang force

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.080
coming together.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:46.640
And then if we examine
their decorative pattern

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.960
you see similar wavy pattern
and the [INAUDIBLE] pattern

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.870
interacting.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:43:01.890
So essentially, it should
come as no surprise

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.040
that this [INAUDIBLE]
pattern appears

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:09.270
on the surface of
these acrobats.

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.910
Too bad we don't have
many survivings of it

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.000
because a lot of them
just deteriorate.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.310
And so we at least have enough
fragments to give us a sense

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:20.860
that this is what's going on.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:27.270
So it all comes down
to seasonal cycles.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.470
It all comes down
to what a season can

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.800
mean in an extended way.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.000
So if we hold on to
this line of thinking,

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.370
we find that we
are able to expand

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:42.980
a lot about this tomb site.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:48.990
So according to the early
texts, in springtime

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.230
you do the following things.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:54.140
You try to capture geese
as a gift for weddings

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.050
and because geese means
young, and all that.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:02.090
So you renew your breath
through overturned vessels

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:05.060
that get rid of the
stale taking the fresh.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.970
You have this
spring inauguration,

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:12.040
according to ritual
manual, in east suburb.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.600
And let's see if it
applies to the tomb site.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.130
You have the capture of
geese, you have the vessel,

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:25.210
you have the inauguration
of the spring to the east.

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:29.530
And that also explains why is it
that the terracotta army is so

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:32.780
far away from the tomb mound.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.360
It's actually one mile.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:39.760
The point is actually
that it is the suburb.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:44.350
It is the east suburb to
just [INAUDIBLE] east suburb.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:48.160
And to [INAUDIBLE] you
have to be really far away.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:54.130
Then how do you then
explain the fact

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:55.990
that they are not
wearing helmets,

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:59.170
whereas helmets are kept away?

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:02.120
I think the point is this.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.540
They want to have
the army so that you

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:10.040
would have the gravitas of
the solemnity of the ritual

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.790
occasion because it's the
inauguration of the spring.

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.800
But if you have them
wear the helmets,

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.230
that means they are
in military action.

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:21.740
And military action is
not allowed in spring.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.706
It's a big no, no.

00:45:24.706 --> 00:45:26.330
So they have to take
away their helmets

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:30.040
so that they have
enough gravitas,

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.630
but then they
don't want to cause

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:36.780
any association with autumn,
with military action.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:42.940
So all the helmets
are left actually

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:48.070
in the company of the ding
vessel, which actually makes

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:51.020
sense because the ding vessel
is associated with the spring,

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.260
and this is with autumn,
and they come together

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:57.700
as they generate life.

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.480
Now, a lot of what
I'm saying relies

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:07.190
on this man named Lu Buwei.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:12.934
Under his leadership, they
compiled this massive work,

00:46:12.934 --> 00:46:14.350
and from that
massive work there's

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:20.990
this prescription of what you
do in different seasons, what

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:22.520
we call "monthly ordinance."

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.550
That was Lu Buwei's creation--
or his team's creation.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.560
Now, he's important
in a number of ways.

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:35.840
So here's a little
interesting recap

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:41.150
of how he helped first
emperor, or the young man,

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:44.010
to gain the power
and unify China.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:46.910
So it all takes us
back to this map,

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:51.780
and he's from this place called
a Wei state, as you can see.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:58.400
And then he found that
there's a young prince, Yiren,

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:02.791
who was a prince of Qin,
but was held hostage in Zhao

00:47:02.791 --> 00:47:05.290
because the Qinians all want
to be at peace with [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:07.190
so they exchange hostage.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:11.840
So this poor man, young
prince, was sent there.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.620
So Lu Buwei was
actually a merchant.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.860
He made a huge amount
of money and he's

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.650
one of our forerunner
of capitalist.

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:22.130
So he thought that he wanted
to invest his fortune--

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.830
monetary fortune--
into political fortune.

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:28.280
So he spotted this
prince and then he said,

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.990
OK, I'm going to make
a killing out of this.

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:34.880
And so he basically
cozied up to him

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.220
and they really become friends.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:42.290
But this young man fell
in love with his consort

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:45.770
and Lu Buwei very generously
said, all right, you take her.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:49.670
So essentially, they
married and then

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:53.470
their son is the
future first emperor.

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:56.510
So sure enough, they
went back to Qin

00:47:56.510 --> 00:48:03.150
and eventually
succeeded in the throne

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:05.650
and that was the
rest of history.

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:11.252
Now, what is interesting is that
after they assume the power,

00:48:11.252 --> 00:48:16.680
Lu Buwei rekindled
his passion, or flames

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:22.790
according to some theory,
with the woman, Lady Zhao.

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:25.140
But then he was also
fearful that people

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:30.120
might catch him doing that, or
that close alliance with him

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:36.108
and her wouldn't be very
good, so he introduced

00:48:36.108 --> 00:48:42.830
a very virile man named
Lao Ai as a fake eunuch

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:46.750
into the harem, and
where he and she

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:50.240
they struck up a
passionate romance

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.550
and actually bore two children.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:02.490
And I'm telling this actually
for good, serious reason

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:06.480
because this virile man,
according to the early source,

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.710
is so potent--

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:10.410
his male potency--
that it is said

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:16.050
that he could use his erected
male organ to cause the wheel

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:17.880
to turn around.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:21.060
Now, that's really a strange
way of showing male potency.

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.480
And I think this is actually
a complete misunderstanding

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:29.640
of what essentially was
initially a breathing exercise.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.780
So according to the ritual
manual of breathing exercises--

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.690
even the later manual-- but
at least point out the early

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:41.070
practice is that as the fire,
energy gets into that inner

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:44.340
vessel, the male practitioner--
a lot of these manuals written

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:46.100
for man--

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:51.540
the male practitioner will
feel the sensation of erection.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.160
It's actually clearly stated.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:57.480
So whether this is metaphoric
or real, we don't know.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:02.790
And then you are supposed
to transport that energy.

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:04.860
Instead of letting
go of it, you're

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:08.310
supposed to transfer the energy
through the spinal cord up

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:09.300
to the brain region.

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:16.680
So the point therefore, is
that this so-called erection

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.290
actually has a lot
to do with the will,

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:24.630
so with that may be where things
got misunderstood in this case.

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:27.270
And sure enough, we
always have evidence.

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:34.230
So the-- people laugh, so
you already see what I see--

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:36.570
and there's a wavy
pattern actually.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:37.600
There's a wavy pattern.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:41.070
So archaeologists
actually insist that this

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:45.230
is a cap for this vehicle axle.

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:48.260
I see something more,
but I wasn't quite sure.

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.350
But you see you laugh, that
kind of confirmed my impression.

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:53.030
In fact, that already--

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:59.870
even though if it's
truly a vehicle axle cap,

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.450
it certainly didn't take
much for the designer

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:05.470
to think, or take the
next step, which is this.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:12.260
They did find this near
contemporary bronze male organ

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.220
in tombs.

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:16.050
And scholars, curators,
or exhibitions--

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:19.670
actually now there's one on
display in San Francisco Art

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:20.690
Museum--

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:24.230
and if you read
the press interview

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:28.960
they typically talk about the
afterlife, sexing, the tomb,

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.080
and all that.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:35.400
It actually doesn't quite
add up because a lot of these

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.500
were found in tombs where the
husband and wife and not buried

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.000
together.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:43.750
So in any case I
think what may happen

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:50.140
is that it was meant as part
of this revitalization regimen

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:55.990
where all these pieces are in
place to reenact and simulate,

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:59.320
artificially simulate a
process, not actually doing it.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:02.290
No one's doing it,
I mean, in the tomb.

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:08.050
So we then know
how it came about.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:10.240
But more importantly
the point I want

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:15.640
to end up with is that
now we understand actually

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:22.210
why early Chinese often
imagine heaven as a wheel.

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:26.320
So did the first emperor, or
the spirit of the first emperor

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.880
go to heaven?

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.580
No, it's not going anywhere.

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:34.510
The crucial thing is really to
keep the Chi energy circulating

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:36.400
in this vital ecology.

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.030
The entire tomb complex
is that ecology.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:43.630
The army is here to provide
the growing yang energy needed

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:47.050
for the conjugation of
energies yin and yang, heavenly

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:49.390
and earthly forces.

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:53.160
Even though there is a concept
of heaven in early China,

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.980
there is really no
"up there" there,

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.410
certainly not in a static way.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:03.140
Heaven is a flow
in all directions.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.810
Thank you.
