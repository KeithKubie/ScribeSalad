00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:06.270
INTERVIEWER: This is a
pretty weird combination

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.420
of festive and ominous.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.670
The guy here is
dressed to the nines.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.310
He doesn't look concerned,
and neither do the horses,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.150
for that matter.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.149
But there's that face mask.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.230
Is the guy sick?

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.490
Is the horse sick?

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.780
Is it just allergy season?

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.500
Thankfully, we have
some answers, courtesy

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.746
of the man behind the camera.

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:27.620
RODRIGO GONZALEZ: Hi.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.230
My name's Rodrigo Gonzalez.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.550
I am a photojournalist
in Mexico City.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.640
This photo was taken
in the Alameda Central

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.890
in downtown Mexico City.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.384
It's a huge part park, and a
very popular touristic spot.

00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:39.800
INTERVIEWER: Which is the
reason the masked man was there.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.754
He's an officer in a force
known as The Tourist Police.

00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:45.170
RODRIGO GONZALEZ: This group
was created to help and guard

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.102
tourists visiting
the Alameda, so they

00:00:47.102 --> 00:00:49.560
are dressed with a mix of police
uniform and typical charro

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.510
garments.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.610
A charro is a traditional
Mexican horseman,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.610
and also is one of the
most recognizable symbols

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.100
of Mexican culture.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.240
Like the Mounty for
Canada, or the cowbody

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.160
for the United States.

00:01:00.992 --> 00:01:02.450
INTERVIEWER: But
that still doesn't

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.210
explain why this officer
is wearing a face mask.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.340
RODRIGO GONZALEZ: The photo
was taken on April 26th, 2009.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.180
It was taken when an epidemic
swine flu, or influenza, was

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.065
declared in Mexico City as
part of a worldwide pandemic

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:16.340
of the virus.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.200
INTERVIEWER: The 2009
influenza pandemic

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.380
was not something to ignore.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.850
Eventually it killed over
14,000 people worldwide.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.310
That's why the officer
was wearing a mask.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.390
And he wasn't alone.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.270
Many Mexican citizens
protected themselves this way.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.490
They were worn in
churches and schools,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.730
by the media and
the military, but it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.561
was just one small precaution
Mexicans took during that time.

00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.310
RODRIGO GONZALEZ: What
I took his picture,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.010
the health emergency
was just starting.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.550
At that time, we had no idea
that some days later, Mexico

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.450
City would almost get to stop.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.140
public transportation
would stop,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.064
supermarkets were
emptied, and everyone

00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:53.980
would be in their homes,
protecting themselves

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.300
from the virus.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.269
It was crazy.

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:58.310
INTERVIEWER: And what
Rodrigo saw and experienced

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.885
taking pictures that day was
like nothing he'd ever seen.

00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:02.385
RODRIGO GONZALEZ:
Seeing the streets

00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:05.730
of the city almost empty at
rush hour, it was unbelievable.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.895
It was like one of
those Sunday movies.

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:11.020
INTERVIEWER: Hey, everyone.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.400
Thanks for watching
"This Happened Here."

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.450

thousands of people

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.306
disappeared in Argentina
during the Dirty War.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.070
SUBJECT 2: Many of the mothers
came together in their grief.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.920
They began to
demand toe be heard,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.110
wanting to know where
their children were.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.230
When they were not given any
information, 14 mothers began--
