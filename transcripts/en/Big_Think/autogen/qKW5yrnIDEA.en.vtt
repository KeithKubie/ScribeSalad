they were really actually really nice
and very like when they came to us they

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650
and very like when they came to us they
 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.379
and very like when they came to us they
were very straightforward and really

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
were very straightforward and really
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.240
were very straightforward and really
like gave me a lot of confidence in

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
like gave me a lot of confidence in
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.000
like gave me a lot of confidence in
their in their sincerity and their

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010
their in their sincerity and their
 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.590
their in their sincerity and their
willingness to go and do good things so

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600
willingness to go and do good things so
 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.630
willingness to go and do good things so
it was I was very excited by and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
it was I was very excited by and
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.580
it was I was very excited by and
obviously it was you know life changing

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
obviously it was you know life changing
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.400
obviously it was you know life changing
in terms of what kind of freedom it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410
in terms of what kind of freedom it
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.680
in terms of what kind of freedom it
would give me going forward financially

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
would give me going forward financially
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.460
would give me going forward financially
and otherwise but the I was it was a

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470
and otherwise but the I was it was a
 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.639
and otherwise but the I was it was a
very good thing it you know once once we

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
very good thing it you know once once we
 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.920
very good thing it you know once once we
got there and and you saw some of the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
got there and and you saw some of the
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.690
got there and and you saw some of the
internal politics it was a different

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700
internal politics it was a different
 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.780
internal politics it was a different
story but yeah

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790
 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.670
Nutella was a software that allowed

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680
Nutella was a software that allowed
 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.400
Nutella was a software that allowed
people who ran it on their computers to

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410
people who ran it on their computers to
 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.900
people who ran it on their computers to
connect to other people who run the

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910
connect to other people who run the
 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.290
connect to other people who run the
software and once you're connected you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300
software and once you're connected you
 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.280
software and once you're connected you
would be connected to sort of like

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
would be connected to sort of like
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.410
would be connected to sort of like
what's the best expression you'd be

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420
what's the best expression you'd be
 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.230
what's the best expression you'd be
connected so that the people around you

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240
connected so that the people around you
 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.550
connected so that the people around you
and who are then connected to other

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560
and who are then connected to other
 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.380
and who are then connected to other
people and so you would have a horizon

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390
people and so you would have a horizon
 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.359
people and so you would have a horizon
of people who you could try to remember

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369
of people who you could try to remember
 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.040
of people who you could try to remember
what the feature said originally was but

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050
what the feature said originally was but
 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.750
what the feature said originally was but
you could talk to them and you could

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760
you could talk to them and you could
 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.359
you could talk to them and you could
search whatever files they wouldn't make

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369
search whatever files they wouldn't make
 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.660
search whatever files they wouldn't make
available and transfer files with them

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
available and transfer files with them
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.460
available and transfer files with them
and what was unique about this was that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470
and what was unique about this was that
 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.880
and what was unique about this was that
it was a system that allowed people to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890
it was a system that allowed people to
 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.359
it was a system that allowed people to
connect directly to each other and as a

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369
connect directly to each other and as a
 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.490
connect directly to each other and as a
result find other people and find data

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500
result find other people and find data
 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.950
result find other people and find data
that way without having any company or

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960
that way without having any company or
 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.070
that way without having any company or
central server in the middle of it so

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080
central server in the middle of it so
 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.770
central server in the middle of it so
there'd be no no one would control it it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780
there'd be no no one would control it it
 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.499
there'd be no no one would control it it
would just be sort of a free way to

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509
would just be sort of a free way to
 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.590
would just be sort of a free way to
connect to other people and Napster was

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600
connect to other people and Napster was
 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.109
connect to other people and Napster was
very successful at that point and they

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119
very successful at that point and they
 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.910
very successful at that point and they
had apparently they had a great deal of

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
had apparently they had a great deal of
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.020
had apparently they had a great deal of
computer hardware just dedicated to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030
computer hardware just dedicated to
 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.820
computer hardware just dedicated to
letting everyone connect to them and it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830
letting everyone connect to them and it
 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.609
letting everyone connect to them and it
was a big expensive operation for them

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619
was a big expensive operation for them
 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.750
was a big expensive operation for them
to do so this was a very simple little

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760
to do so this was a very simple little
 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.960
to do so this was a very simple little
bit like it when I was designing it it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970
bit like it when I was designing it it
 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.930
bit like it when I was designing it it
was very much in my mind that it wasn't

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940
was very much in my mind that it wasn't
 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.460
was very much in my mind that it wasn't
going to function perfectly like you

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470
going to function perfectly like you
 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.780
going to function perfectly like you
would never be able to talk to everyone

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790
would never be able to talk to everyone
 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.220
would never be able to talk to everyone
else on these networks it would always

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230
else on these networks it would always
 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.690
else on these networks it would always
be like you could just talk to the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700
be like you could just talk to the
 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.750
be like you could just talk to the
people nearest you but it was something

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760
people nearest you but it was something
 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.910
people nearest you but it was something
that you could do and it's exciting

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920
that you could do and it's exciting
 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.550
that you could do and it's exciting
because it was software that created

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560
because it was software that created
 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.970
because it was software that created
something much larger out of little bits

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980
something much larger out of little bits
 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.890
something much larger out of little bits
of software and didn't require actually

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900
of software and didn't require actually
 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.850
of software and didn't require actually
any physical hardware or any any service

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860
any physical hardware or any any service
 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.470
any physical hardware or any any service
to set up it was just software that

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480
to set up it was just software that
 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.320
to set up it was just software that
connected people

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330
 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.810
well I think the biggest problem they

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820
well I think the biggest problem they
 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.100
well I think the biggest problem they
had is that we didn't really ask them

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
had is that we didn't really ask them
 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.480
had is that we didn't really ask them
about it it was more at and it's just as

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490
about it it was more at and it's just as
 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.560
about it it was more at and it's just as
well that we didn't I mean I'm sure if

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570
well that we didn't I mean I'm sure if
 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.150
well that we didn't I mean I'm sure if
we had they would have they would have

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160
we had they would have they would have
 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.060
we had they would have they would have
said that it's a bad idea you know we

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070
said that it's a bad idea you know we
 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.020
said that it's a bad idea you know we
really should look at this and you know

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030
really should look at this and you know
 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.070
really should look at this and you know
to their credit they're probably right

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080
to their credit they're probably right
 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.470
to their credit they're probably right
if you're a big big corporation like

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480
if you're a big big corporation like
 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.760
if you're a big big corporation like
them that's not what you need to be

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770
them that's not what you need to be
 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.460
them that's not what you need to be
doing your job is more how do you

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470
doing your job is more how do you
 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.990
doing your job is more how do you
monetize people rather than how do you

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000
monetize people rather than how do you
 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.870
monetize people rather than how do you
enable people to do things they want to

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880
enable people to do things they want to
 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.530
enable people to do things they want to
do

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540
 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.690
no i think i think i probably wouldn't

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700
no i think i think i probably wouldn't
 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.259
no i think i think i probably wouldn't
do it again in the same way but you know

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269
do it again in the same way but you know
 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.240
do it again in the same way but you know
I i think what ended up happening was

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250
I i think what ended up happening was
 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.009
I i think what ended up happening was
fine and and i think it was only good

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019
fine and and i think it was only good
 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.899
fine and and i think it was only good
for pretty much everyone involved like

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909
for pretty much everyone involved like
 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.539
for pretty much everyone involved like
it didn't look good for AOL but it did

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549
it didn't look good for AOL but it did
 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.860
it didn't look good for AOL but it did
it end up hurting them did not move the

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870
it end up hurting them did not move the
 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.319
it end up hurting them did not move the
needle at all like they were I think

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329
needle at all like they were I think
 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.270
needle at all like they were I think
they denounced the time warner merger at

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280
they denounced the time warner merger at
 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.860
they denounced the time warner merger at
that point and so they were doing what

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870
that point and so they were doing what
 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.859
that point and so they were doing what
they were doing that was that
