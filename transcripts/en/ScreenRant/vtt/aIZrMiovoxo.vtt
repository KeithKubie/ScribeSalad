00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.910
Aquaman

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.049
Around one year after the release of Justice league fans

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.369
We'll get to dive back into the DC extended universe with the release of Aquaman Aquaman

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.449
Has not got true justice on the big screen, or the small screen?

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.859
So it will be interesting to see how the character is brought to life for his own solo film

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.809
With James wan is the director at the film already looks promising and the aquaman himself?

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.019
Jason Momoa has surrounded himself with a great cast that includes Amber heard Nicole Kidman and willem Dafoe

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.960
The film will introduce fans to a film universe of Atlantis and could really set itself apart in the superhero world

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.790
Marvel has not produced anything like this and the brief glimpses we've seen of Aquaman in the Justice league really showcase the unique powers the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.119
character has

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.739
samoa was perfectly cast in the role and with no movie releases between

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.789
Justice league and Aquaman fans will really be clamoring for another film

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.959
there seems to be multiple villains set up in this movie including the black Manta and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.799
King Narus the Storyline will take place after the events of Justice league with some original flashbacks probably peppered in

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.259
she would do a

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.449
Butcher's Wonder Woman -

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.289
After the critically panned suicide squad and Batman VS

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.499
Superman Dawn of Justice Wonder woman was exactly the boost the DC Eu needed to set itself on the right path

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.309
The first film of a box-office smash and it's only fitting that warner bros has greenlit wonder woman 2 to continue the solo

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.259
Adventures of Dal gazoo well the first wonder woman was more of a prequel the sequel will likely take place

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.180
After the events of Justice league this can put her in modern times and showcase a whole new adventure

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.709
the key to this film being a success of the involvement of director patty jenkins

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.450
Getting her to return is essential and will help make the film be a huge success again

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.630
along with Godot's return Robin wright and other cast members will likely reprise their roles from the original film

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.740
You can also expect to see a few cameos from other DC heroes

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.540
This may include her justice league co-stars like Superman Batman or the flash

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.380
The Built-in audience that loved the first movie will flock to this one no matter how Justice league or aquaman does

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.420
It's currently set for an estimated 2020 release but no official date has been announced

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.650
My name is Barry Allen

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.650
And I am the fastest man alive

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.960
the flash the flash still remains one of the more popular characters in the DC universe

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.459
And the solo film will really give viewers a chance to see his powers on the big screen

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.609
With the fourth season of the TV series set to debut there are millions of fans that can serve as a Built-in audience

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.689
For the Justice league actor, Ezra Miller is stepping into the role of the flash

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.359
And he will continue that role for his own solo film

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.300
It was originally set to be released in the spring of 2018

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.359
But it's been pushed back as the screenplay is fully developed and a director gets assigned to the game at the San Diego

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.989
comic-con a brief teaser for the film alluded to the flashpoint storyline

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.010
That was featured in recent comic books this story is much better than the original

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.740
Origin story that got panned and has fans extremely excited for the way that it can turn out the flashpoint

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.640
Story involves time travel changes to history and a whole lot of high-speed

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.850
Running the special effects for the flash have been incredible already, and it will be great to see them used for his own film

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.699
Shazaam and Black Adam One of the DC

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.140
Comics Legends is Shazam the superhero may have helped Start DC

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.220
But he is not as well known as the other comic-book characters like Batman and Superman

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:11.700
this gives

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.880
Filmmakers a chance to make a great original film that builds a natural fanbase much like the Little-known

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.219
Guardians of the Galaxy did when it was first released?

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.049
Shazam Follows the story of a young boy who had the ability to transform into an adult?

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.620
Superhero when needed no actors have been announced for the role of Shazam

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.560
But dwayne the rock Johnson has been announced as Black Adam

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.500
And that has fans excited for the possibilities black Adam initially starts out as a super villain

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.199
But he slowly transforms into an antihero

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.919
This story Arc is exactly why black Adam is getting his own solo film Starring Johnson the Black Adam film will be

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.060
Interesting to see and Johnson's Charisma can really help boost the dce you?

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.530
Down the line it would be great to see black Adam. Have scenes with will Smith's Deadshot. Ben Affleck's Batman or Henry Cavill Superman

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.739
Shazam is scheduled to start filming early next year with black Adam likely to follow shortly after oh

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.539
Gotham City Sirens

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:16.159
One of the key elements of making the DC eu a success has been focusing on female heroes and stories centered around them

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:22.369
This is one of the main things lacking from Marvel cinematic universe and one thing that DC has thrived on

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.049
With a success of wonder woman and major praise for Margot Robbie's character of Harley Quinn?

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.639
Warner Brothers has greenlit a spin-off project entitled Gotham City siren

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.620
The film Will Team up Harley quinn with female Batman Baddies catwoman and Poison Ivy

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:45.019
Catwoman has been iconic in the DC film universe played by Halle Berry Michelle pfeiffer and Anne Hathaway the role has big shoes to fill

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.449
each character has their own

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.150
characteristics that can make them shine in a group and create an

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.209
Interesting film David Ayer was attached to the rex of film and has been called a passion project for both Air and Robbie

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:02.899
Along with the three characters, you can probably expect to see a number of other characters from the Batman universe featured in the movie

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.820
There's no word yet on a main villain, but the film could hit theaters as early as 2019

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:16.009
It'll be released before we see another suus squad I have no intention to but unfortunately he's busy about being good green lantern Corps

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.759
The 2011 Green Lantern was never a part of the DC

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.430
Eu but it is considered a failure among all of the films. It was a bad start for DC

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.239
But they have tried to tuck it under the table forget. It was ever made and move on

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:36.110
That is one of the reasons that the green lantern doesn't appear in Justice league and will instead get its own solo movie to focus

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.780
on

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:43.100
Officially known as the green lantern Corps this is the film that can do justice for the green lantern mistakes of the past instead

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.120
Of just focusing on hal jordans version of the green Lantern the film will team up Jordan with Jon Stewart as both lanterns

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:57.409
There's been no casting news release but you can pretty much guarantee that Ryan Reynolds will not be reprising his role of hal Jordan

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.990
Once the Green Lantern Corps are established

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.299
You can probably expect them to join the fray for a justice league sequel in the future the film is currently

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.799
Scheduled for a 2020 release date and more news will likely come within the next few months

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:16.100
The best news about the film the Dark Knight Trilogy writer David s Goyer has been hired to helm the script

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.170
teen Titans go

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:25.069
Now the human robot will be getting his own solo movie simply entitled cyborg said for a release in

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.840
2020 fans will get to see a big-screen version of the robot in all the powers that he had

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.470
We briefly saw his origins during a quick clip in Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice, but the solo movie will likely explore

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.470
how his body was destroyed and turned into a superhero version of

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.450
Frankenstein's Monster the movie has the potential to be a great mix of Justice league and robocop

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:50.150
But the mostly CG suit cyborgs special effects will be incredible to see and the Justice league will give a great

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.230
Glimpse into what he has to offer?

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:58.129
Along with Ray Fisher playing the title role the only other casting news that has been announced as scandal star Joe

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.159
Morton Junior as silas Stone cyborgs father

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.129
Morton will also have an appearance in Justice league

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:11.030
It'll be interesting to see the villains and other characters that play a role in that film do some you will see total yeah onesies

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.160
Don't want to take down

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.850
Suicide Squad -

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.729
suicide squad may have got trashed by both critics and fans

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:24.309
But it was a major financial success and a huge hit for warner brothers the film had an all-star cast

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:30.279
But it featured a lot of characters in the storyline that is not his mainstream its films like man of steel and wonder woman

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:36.999
The main problem with the original film was packing in so many characters and stories and introductions now that the characters are

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.989
Established the sequel can have more fun with the story and delivering a solid film

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.140
Suicide squad - will likely up the ante on

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.580
Action-Adventure, and probably introduce a few new villains that are forced to fight for the better

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.160
Good

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:55.509
The only thing you really need to know is that will Smith and margot Robbie will be reprising their roles as deadshot in Harley quinn

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.069
They had incredible chemistry in the first film and it'll be great to see them team up again

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:07.239
Batman also had a small role in the first film so you can probably expect other DC heroes to show up for appearances in the

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.509
Sequel Jared Leto's Joker will likely return as he helped quinn escape during the closing moments of the first movie

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.770
Justice League Dark

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.299
Don't get Justice League dark confused with the regular Justice league

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.810
It's a much different story

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.770
involving some of the craziest characters that DC has ever

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.229
Created like a mix of the justice league in the suicide squad the film is set to feature a collection of supernatural

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:37.479
heroes doing battles against Demons vampires and other crazy enemies like zombies

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.160
constantine leads the group the first sign that this film is going to be a huge hit the

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.440
Character was great on the NBC show and has made multiple guest appearances on the Cw's arrow

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.980
Another big hero in the film is going to be swamp thing

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.539
The monster hasn't appeared on the big screen in decades and could be the groot of the DC universe

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.599
Other characters that may appear in the film include the ragman spectre shade and Phantom stranger

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.019
The film was originally going to be titled the dark universe

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.030
But universal stole that from them for their horror monster extended line of films like the mummy

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:16.119
Justice League Dark will have a lot of superhero Elements, but will also blend in real horror to the story

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:22.330
It's a great side project for the DC Eu that can really showcase some unique stories and possibly an r-rating

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.330
The Batman it seems like no one gets sick of seeing Batman on the big screen

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.429
And that is a big reason why warner bros have signed for a solo film entitled the Batman?

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.729
Ben affleck is scheduled to reprise his role as bruce Wayne in a solo story that will likely send him back to Gotham

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.870
Even more exciting than Batman himself is the villain announced for the film?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.089
Deathstroke is a classic DC comics villain that has not been portrayed on the big screen

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.119
He was used in the show arrow during one of their greatest

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.359
Storylines and could be one of the most memorable baddies in the Batman universe

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.989
Joe Manganiello has signed on to play Slade Wilson's a man behind Deathstroke's mask there

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.359
Have multiple multiple behind the scenes for the film

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.680
But currently matt reeves have signed on to direct and revamped the original script

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:16.179
This adds a great freshness and enthusiasm behind one of the best heroes of all time

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.110
The film will really help

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:24.340
Establish the DC Eu is a powerhouse in the industry and could set the standard for future phases of the extended universe

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.410
hopefully it will help launch and introduce other films like nightwing teen titans and

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.739
Batgirl looking for something to save you from sheer boredom

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:38.229
Why not try playing Vikings war of the clans for just 5 minutes to see what all the buzz is about?

But finally on mobile and in 3D with massive online clan battles across the globe with over 3 million players
