00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.290
I'm Jennie Kim, I'm of Korean descent and I experience alcohol flush reaction.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.420
&gt;&gt; Well for those of us like me who have not

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.900
experienced the alcohol flush reaction, can you describe it for us.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.140
&gt;&gt; Basically I get really warm and I turn bright red whenever I drink alcohol

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.830
&gt;&gt; I see, do you, is it associated with any feelings of being sick?

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.460
&gt;&gt; I get a little bit queasy. I don't tolerate alcohol very well and I

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.620
really can't drink more than a couple of drinks at a time.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.350
&gt;&gt; I see. So your tolerance then is maybe a little

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.650
bit lower than other people of your same height and size?

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.500
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.500
&gt;&gt; Now, is this something that's common in your family? It is, my

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.330
dad also experienced lacall flesh reaction, and

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.410
he really doesn't drink as a result.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.730
&gt;&gt; Now, when did you first realize that you had this kind of alcohol flush?

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.080
&gt;&gt; It's kind of a funny story, my mom was

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.630
looking through my Facebook party pictures back when I was in

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.710
college. And one day she just, sort of as she was looking

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.390
through them, looked up and me and said, why you so sunburned

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.860
in all your pictures? And that's when I realized something was up.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.530
&gt;&gt; I see. So it wasn't actually even, you know, you noticed

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.780
something about yourself as much as you felt a certain way. Maybe you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.560
didn't have anything to compare it to per se like, from a personal

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.420
experience and your mom sort of, was like, wow, you look really red.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my mom

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.290
didn't, didn't understand, because she herself

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.940
does not have alcohol flush reaction.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.650
&gt;&gt; I see. Now, does this mean that you have any

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.710
personal genetic information about yourself or

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.510
your family for this particular trait?

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.670
&gt;&gt; Yes, we've all, we've all used 23 in me.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.670
&gt;&gt; You have? And what was your report

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.689
for the ALDH two, the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme?

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.849
&gt;&gt; If I can remember correctly, my father and

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.280
I only have one working copy of that gene.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.645
&gt;&gt; I see, so you're heterozygous?

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:44.260
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.220
&gt;&gt; So, wow, so that means you well we don't know who you inherited it

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.700
from unless we know, is your mom, you said your mom does not have this?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.250
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.630
&gt;&gt; I see, so you know that you inherited this from your dad.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.810
&gt;&gt; Definitely from my dad, yeah.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.300
&gt;&gt; Wow, how does that make you feel?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.860
&gt;&gt; I dunno, just empathetic I guess.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.860
&gt;&gt;

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.912
[LAUGH]

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:01.705
&gt;&gt; For my dad.

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:02.479
[LAUGH]

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.740
&gt;&gt; do you consider this, a, I guess a good or a bad

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.009
trait at all? Or a positive or a negative thing? Well, it's funny

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.480
that you asked that, you know, I think if you'd asked me this

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.310
in col, back in college, I would have said it's definitely a negative

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.840
thing. I wish I didn't have it. Then I could, you know, have

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.470
champagne all the time and it would be awesome. but now I'm actually

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.780
pretty grateful for it. first of all, it's good I think that it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.070
helps me be more aware of the impact that alcohol has on my body.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.570
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.675
&gt;&gt; Which is generally a good thing for my health and

00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:34.090
well-being and second, I actually kind of like, or at least appreciate,

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.090
strangely enough, how this reaction is

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.700
somewhat socially embarrassing and awkward. I

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.860
actually appreciate feeling bad about myself

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.010
sometimes, because that's why I'm funny.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.340
&gt;&gt; You raise an interesting point there, as someone who experiences alcohol

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.700
flesh reaction, and let's say someone watching this class maybe is only just

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.680
discovering this for themselves. Isn't it an embarrassing feeling, or

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.050
like do people ever make fun of you for it, or?

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.920
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, I think back when I

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.800
started noticing it, I was much more self-concious. I

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.505
like to think though that people are really too

00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:13.315
self-involved to really notice other people, at least I am.

00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:13.470
[LAUGH]

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.840
So I have become a lot more comfortable with

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.790
that, and I also just don't care as much.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.690
so obviously the disadvantages of alcohol flush

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.320
reaction are that you can feel kind of

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.270
bad. You don't have that high of a tolerance, and there may be some kind

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.000
of awkward social stuff occasionally. Are there

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.340
any advantages, besides the ones you mentioned about

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.340
you know, being more self-aware about yourself?

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.410
Is there any kind of other advantage to?

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.630
&gt;&gt; I actually like the fact that it moderates. It forces me to moderate

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.490
my drinking, and to be pretty judicious about drinking. I always have to ask

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.560
myself, like, is this cocktail really worth it?

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.830
I have a saying that I can either

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.830
be drinking, or I can be cute, but I can't be both at the same time.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.830
&gt;&gt;

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.390
[LAUGH]

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.500
&gt;&gt; So, I'll often just choose to be cute, and, you know, just choose

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.620
not to partake in, in alcohol at all and as I'm getting older I

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.780
kind of appreciate that more, to have that, to have that choice, and I

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.420
feel better, you know, in the mornings

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.890
than maybe some of my other friends would.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.450
&gt;&gt; How

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.350
do you think this particular trait of

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.880
the alcohol flush is seen culturally and socially

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.930
by other people, even outside your own

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.060
personal experience, how do you think it's portrayed?

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.840
&gt;&gt; I actually don't know. I've just never been on

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.320
the other side of it.I, I imagine again that it's

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.670
kind of like my mom. People would just ask, like,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.340
are you okay, or are you sunburned, or what happened there?

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.340
&gt;&gt;

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.698
[LAUGH]

00:04:38.698 --> 00:04:42.330
&gt;&gt; but I don't know if people really, really are aware of it,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.240
or, you know, know that much about it. It usually helps when you're

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.980
out drinking and getting this reaction.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.530
Other people around you are also drinking,

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.610
so maybe that also contributes to the fact that people are less aware.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.955
&gt;&gt; Right, have you ever felt

00:04:57.955 --> 00:05:04.020
pressured to drink, even though you

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.150
didn't want to specifically for this reason?

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.370
&gt;&gt; No, that's just not my nature in general. You in

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.780
know my, my thinking is, as far as alcohol flush reaction

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.780
is concerned, is just, it's kind of like singing show tunes,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.010
or getting sleepy, it's just something that happens naturally when I drink.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.290
&gt;&gt; If you had the chance to change

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.390
this trait about yourself, would you change it?

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.060
&gt;&gt; It's funny that you ask, you ask that. I mean if you asked me the

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.190
same question ten years ago when I was still in college

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.610
I would have said yes, definitely, get rid of it now,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.020
champagne for everyone. but today I actually really appreciate it. I

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.280
mean first of all I appreciate the fact that it forces

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.820
me to moderate my drinking and to be more aware of

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.720
the impact alcohol has on my body. Second of all, I

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.360
appreciate the kind of embarrassing effects that it has because, you

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.560
know, it forces me to be comfortable with being uncomfortable and

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.970
feeling awkward. and also I think it's important that, I'll call

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.740
flush that you, that I realize that this, this condition is completely

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.600
under my control, you know, if I don't drink alcohol, then

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.110
I don't turn red, you know, I just stay normal Asian colored.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.110
&gt;&gt;

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.390
[LAUGH]

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.120
&gt;&gt; Period, and that's a huge factor. I think

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.510
it would be much, for me, it would be a

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.360
lot more difficult if this was something that I had

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.310
no control over. So, for example, like asthma attacks, or

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.020
seizures, or allergies, or things that, you know, you might

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.230
not have control of, over the stimulus and the reaction

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.960
to me that would be a lot more debilitating. So

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.170
for me, this is not that big of a deal.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.550
&gt;&gt; What about any kind of any kind of medication? You know, for lactose

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.620
intolerance and people whose bodies don't metabolize lactose very

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.480
easily, they can actually take a bioactive form of lactase

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.310
which allows them to digest dairy products is there anything

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.610
like that for alcohol flush reaction that you know of?

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.430
&gt;&gt; There's kind of this over the counter remedy

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.970
that a lot of like, my Asian peers and

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.820
I discovered it's just an over the counter antacid

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.690
or acid reducing pill, which I used to call

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.350
the anti Asian pill and I used to take that

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.010
when I drank. But later, I found out that research shows

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.230
that actually isn't good for you to suppress your body's

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.840
symptoms as it processes its toxins so I stopped taking it.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.680
&gt;&gt; Wow, I did not know that

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.640
so what advice would you give to an individual

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.930
who may be watching this for the first time, maybe

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.090
discovering that, you know they have alcohol flush reaction.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.940
Is there any important advice you would give that person?

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.960
&gt;&gt; Well, I'd tell this person, let's just call her 21

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.850
year old Jennie Kim, I'd tell her first of all you're

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.220
going to need a good full cover foundation that looks natural and

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.580
also photographs well, for those nights out when you'll be drinking. Makeup

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.170
Forever makes a good one, number 173. It looks too

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.770
dark in the bottle, but trust me, that's your shade.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.160
And then second, I would tell her, don't sweat it,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.880
don't worry about it, you know, just be grateful that

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.090
you are able to consume that much alcohol in one

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.230
sitting, you know, use those calories for cheese fries instead,

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.930
because that body's not going to keep itself. And finally, I

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.520
would tell 21-year-old me that it's okay to feel embarrassed, because,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.450
you know, yeah, it's embarrassing to look like a

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.910
cherry Jolly Rancher next to your cute blonde friend at

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.180
the club. Nobody wants to do that, but you

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.480
know what, life is embarrassing, life is messy. Life is

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.210
like, your big red face, you know, it's how

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.060
you handle it that matters. And I can tell, I

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.170
could tell her right now that, you know, while you're

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.015
cute blonde friends might stay perfect, they'll never be hilarious.

00:08:29.015 --> 00:08:30.130
[LAUGH]

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.090
And also stay away from gauchos, because that's not a good look for anyone.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.950
&gt;&gt; Duly noted, I think that's good

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.299
advice overall. Jenny, thanks for joining us.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:38.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
