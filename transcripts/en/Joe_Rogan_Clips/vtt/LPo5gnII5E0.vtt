1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.210
Some of it's just not,
you can be friends with people that you don't agree.
I,

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.770
me and Nick Depaulo disagree with like 75% of shit.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.600
I love the guy.
I always love hanging out with them.
I've known him forever.

4
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.840
I never,
never like never do I say God's nick again.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.030
I love it when he gets mad about shit.
Damn.
Well what?

6
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:21.540
You don't know what fucking Obama deck?
Yeah,
it's great.

7
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.023
<v 1>He's on,</v>

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.190
he's on that a cameo website and you can just pay him to trash your liberal

9
00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:31.490
friends.
Oh,
that's fun.
It's so fucking funny.
And he'll just like,
it was like,

10
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:36.140
what do you like fucking Hillary?
You fucking faggot
in his kitchen.

11
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.460
Yeah,
it's fucking great life.
Beat her on.
Yeah.
Um,
but I look Patrice,
you know,

12
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.210
I remember I,
I watch my son,
my son's mother was in labor for 30 hours,

13
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.860
fucking crazy long labor overnight and the next morning she's like lying down.

14
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:51.020
He's like in the little fucking other room or whatever.

15
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:54.860
And I'm watching like a fan made Patrice O'Neal documentary and he's just saying

16
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:59.861
like the most heinous shit about how women aren't shit and about how fucking a

17
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.780
bitch,
you know,
she needs you.
And by,

18
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.200
and I just watched my son's mother pushed my son out of her for 30 hours.

19
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.330
It was fucking,
I mean the,

20
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:10.640
the whole experience was so mind blowing and in my mind I'm going,

21
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.470
I could never in a million years do what she just did.

22
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.390
I had this whole other appreciation for what a woman is.
It's like a,

23
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.000
it blows your mind when you got kids and then Patrice is fuck it up.

24
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:24.770
They're just this big fat black guy saying horseshit cause he,
he's fucking,

25
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.140
but it's the funniest shit on the planet.

26
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.960
The absolute funny shit on the planet and you can laugh at it.

27
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:32.150
You don't have to get mad at,
I don't agree with half the shittiest,

28
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.650
most of the shit that he says.
All that fucking Aye.
Look Dude,
I'm an idiot.

29
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:40.010
I don't look at,
I don't,
I don't go after women that are below me.

30
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:43.040
I like to go after women that are above me and that sort of elevate me and make

31
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:46.030
me want to be better.
I think that's,
it's a little check and balance system.

32
00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:48.710
I have him for myself,
you know?
Um,

33
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.510
but you don't have to be so connected to whatever the messages,

34
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.150
you can literally take it for face value,
which is,
it's just really funny.

35
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:56.870
Like undeniable

36
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.570
<v 0>funny.
Yeah.
He was a monster and he also,
he had points,</v>

37
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.530
really good psychological insight.
He knew what made people tick.

38
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.090
He knew what made people say stupid shit.
He knew it made people stumble.
He's a,

39
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:14.091
he was a master at understanding like how to get off controversial ideas.

40
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.770
Yeah.
You know,
he was in,
but his,

41
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.600
his contribution for a lot of us was a,

42
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.090
he had an extra level of,
I don't give a fuck,
you know,

43
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:28.140
like you would see don roasts.
He would,
he'd,
you know,
he'd roast and he was like,

44
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.010
yeah,
I don't even know why I'm up here.
You want me to be,
or even on my level.

45
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.430
Yeah.
It was Charlie Sheen.
Yes.
Yeah.
Charlie Sheen rose again.

46
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:38.790
He just went off script through the paper and was just,
that was brilliant.

47
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.950
Chartered.
He's a killer man.

48
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.160
<v 1>Did that one,
cause he,</v>

49
00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.830
I guess he agreed because he said that was the only guy that he was interested

50
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.630
in roasting.
I like,
I'm not doing it for the paycheck.

51
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:49.510
Charlie Sheen's a fucking g.
Yeah.
Um,

52
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.270
<v 0>well it's just that he's,
you know,
he would,</v>

53
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.980
he just had this don't give a fuck style.
Yeah.
And we all,
like,

54
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.130
we all,
I think I can be speaking

55
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.420
<v 1>for myself.
I appreciate,</v>

56
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:04.690
I don't give a fuck style more than any other style of comedy.
For me,

57
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:08.440
my favorite shit was like,
first of all,
Joey Diaz,

58
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.390
but then when you go back to the greats,

59
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:15.220
like Kinison and Hicks and this guys didn't give a fuck.
They went out,

60
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.940
they went off and it was the most fun to watch as a person who was a,

61
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:23.170
an audience member for me was the most fun to watch.
And I think,
you know,
that's,

62
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.660
that's the shit that I got.
And it's,
yeah,

63
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.690
we grew up on that and then society changes.
And I'm like,
no dude,
I've been,

64
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.440
I've been working on this for so long,
please let me,

65
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.940
I have to change my entire like foundation of what I think is funny now because

66
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.620
it's almost like,
and that's why I think guys like Legion of skanks and,

67
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.880
and the specialist,
you guys name it,
Legion of Skanks,
me and big J.
Okay.

68
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.320
So big Jay would constantly cheat on his wife and uh,

69
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.960
it was like a regular occurrence and she knew it and everyone knew it.

70
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.600
And one time we were there and we were hanging out and we were about to leave.

71
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:55.030
They were in an argument and she's like,
fuck you,
why don't you go,
hey,

72
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:58.390
how was your legion of skanks and me and big j,

73
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.820
we were both playing guitar hero at the time.
There was like a big game.

74
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.340
We both looked at each other.
We're like guitar hero name.

75
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.260
And that was what we named our band initially.

76
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:09.280
And Guitar Hero was Legion of skanks and then we're not that creative.

77
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:14.200
So we wrote a script.
How long ago was this?
Probably 10 years ago.
10 years ago.

78
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.280
10 years ago.
The name.
And then that was the guitar hero band.
Maybe even more.

79
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.720
Probably more.
Yeah.
Actually way more.

80
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.100
Cause it was right with me in big Jay became friends.
Um,
and then we wrote,
yeah,

81
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.930
Legion of skanks is a great name.

82
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:29.350
It's probably one of the all time greatest names of anything.
Right.

83
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.310
You stop and think about like bands or television,
legion of skanks.

84
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:36.460
That is a great thank you.
Thank you,
Joe.
Great Name.
Yeah.

85
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:39.010
Well I've got to give it a big Jack because he recognized it immediately.

86
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:41.920
And then every project we ever did since then has been named Legion of skanks

87
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:43.930
until the podcast work.
It's good.
Move.
