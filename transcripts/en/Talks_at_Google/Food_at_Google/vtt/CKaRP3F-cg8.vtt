[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.740
SPEAKER: And you are
all here, very wisely,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.410
to meet the amazing
Gail Simmons.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.185
GAIL SIMMONS: I'll
just come out.

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:15.841
I'm like standing in the corner.

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:16.840
I don't really know why.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.710
Hi, guys.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.030
SPEAKER: Welcome.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.030
GAIL SIMMONS: Thank you.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.370
SPEAKER: So maybe you
know Gail from "Top Chef."

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.960
Maybe you've read
her lovely book.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.620
But today she's here to talk
to us about her new cookbook.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.000
So tell us, what's the deal?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.730
GAIL SIMMONS: Thank you.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.938
Thank you guys for having me.

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:32.382
It's my first time at
Google on the West Coast.

00:00:32.382 --> 00:00:33.090
SPEAKER: Welcome!

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.790
GAIL SIMMONS: It's
pretty awesome.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.860
I know, wow.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.950
You make a good reason
for moving to the left.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.830
Anyway, last week I
launched my first cookbook.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.530
I took about five
years to work up

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.410
the courage to make it
and two years to write it.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.210
It is definitely
a labor of love.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.840
You all have it in your hands.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.390
It's a very personal book.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.500
"Bringing it Home" started
in several notebooks--

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.510
I don't know-- 15 years ago.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.780
Stories, recipes, flavors,
dishes that I would write down

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.220
from my travels.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.062
And for years I thought,
well, who else would ever

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:10.270
want to look at these but me?

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.120
And finally, about a
little over two years

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.471
ago, I decided to put them
all together in one volume

00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:17.720
and share them with the world.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.140
So they're brand new,
and they're very special.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.500
The background of
the book itself

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.110
is that I have really--
well, obviously

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.607
spent my whole life eating.

00:01:27.607 --> 00:01:29.440
But my mother was
actually a cooking teacher

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.319
and my father was a great
adventurer and traveler.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.485
He was born in South Africa.

00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:36.910
And we spent a lot of our
lives traveling back and forth

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.620
between here and South Africa.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.910
Here, actually, is
not here at all.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.540
But I grew up in
Toronto, Canada--

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.647
so pretty, actually, far from
here with not as much sunshine.

00:01:46.647 --> 00:01:47.480
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.730
SPEAKER: We don't have to
be too technical about it.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.110
But "here."

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.775
GAIL SIMMONS: Sure,
but North America.

00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:52.275
Certainly.

00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:53.230
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.417
GAIL SIMMONS: And
I've been working

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:57.250
in the food industry
for 20 years in a bunch

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.630
of different capacities.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.750
I started out as an
assistant editor.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.560
I knew I wanted to
write about food

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.680
and so went to
culinary school, worked

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.350
as a cook in some of
the greatest, toughest

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.610
kitchens in New York.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.116
Not advisable, necessarily,
but an extraordinary education.

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:14.490
SPEAKER: And an
adventure, right?

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.865
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes,
and absolutely

00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:19.300
an adventure-- an eye-opening,
extraordinary exploration

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.030
of food, and an amazing
time to live in New York.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.630
And then from there, went to
work for an incredible food

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.501
writer as his recipe
and research assistant.

00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:30.250
And then I worked for
a Chef Daniel Boulud

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.040
for three years in marketing
and public relations.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.190
And in 2004, I took a job
at "Food &amp; Wine" Magazine--

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.350
actually, originally,
directing part

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.520
of the marketing department.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.180
And soon that transitioned
and split into two jobs

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.550
without me realizing that
either would actually happen.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.800
I took over the direction
of the "Food &amp; Wine" Classic

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.330
in Aspen, which
is "Food &amp; Wine's"

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.260
biggest event of the year.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.845
SPEAKER: So fun.

00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:51.345
Yeah.

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:54.910
GAIL SIMMONS: The most fun and
most beautiful place on earth.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.310
And then, simultaneously,
Bravo called "Food &amp; Wine"

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.100
and asked if they would partner
on a risk they were taking

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.100
for the network-- a new
show about the real life

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.975
of competitive cooks.

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:05.609
SPEAKER: I don't
think it worked out.

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.150
GAIL SIMMONS: I
know, I can't believe

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.520
I actually accepted the job.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.880
SPEAKER: So risky of you.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.200
GAIL SIMMONS: I know.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.670
I mean, at the
time, it really was.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.750
I have to say that when
my publisher came to me

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.260
and said that they had
this idea for a show

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.110
and that Bravo wanted to
partner with us on a reality

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.330
show about real,
professional cooks--

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.100
competitive reality show--

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.510
I was completely squeamish.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.634
SPEAKER: At the time, it
was definitely a new idea.

00:03:30.634 --> 00:03:31.030
GAIL SIMMONS: I
mean, this was 2005.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.180
SPEAKER: Yeah, it
was a long time ago.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.810
GAIL SIMMONS: So my point of
reference for competition shows

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.789
at the time were--

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:36.580
SPEAKER: "Survivor"

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.334
GAIL SIMMONS: "Real World,"
"Survivor," "Fear Factor."

00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:41.500
SPEAKER: It's a combination
of those three, I think,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.460
if you really think about it.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.940
GAIL SIMMONS: That's
what it was, exactly--

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.210
with a lot of perishable
goods, knives, and fire.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.300
I was like, bad, bad.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.970
Don't do it.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.261
SPEAKER: And chef temperaments.

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:50.230
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.930
But it was my job, so
I took it regardless.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.390
And we actually flew
to San Francisco

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.490
and shot our first
season in San Francisco

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.390
right around this time 2005
so exactly 12 years ago.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.920
SPEAKER: Wow, gosh.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.287
GAIL SIMMONS: I was 7.

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:06.120
SPEAKER: I was, too.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.369
GAIL SIMMONS: I was a prodigy.

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:08.720
I was the Doogie Howser of--

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.295
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:11.170
--yeah,w of the food world.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.870
And we've been
doing it ever since.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.079
We've made 15
seasons, 5 spin-offs,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.832
been nominated for 11 Emmys--
one of which we actually won.

00:04:19.832 --> 00:04:20.790
SPEAKER: Yeah, you did!

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.600
GAIL SIMMONS: Which we
really could have never--

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.350
I mean, thank you.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.019
Thank you.

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:25.810
That wasn't so much a
pat on the back as it

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.190
was the fact that we were--

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.780
and still are-- we
think of ourselves,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.821
in our category, as The
Little Engine that Could.

00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:33.070
We are a small cable
show of a bunch

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.080
of food nerds having
a real conversation

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.580
about professional kitchens.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.832
And we shot our 15th season
in Colorado a few months ago,

00:04:40.832 --> 00:04:42.790
and it premieres in
December, which is awesome.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.480
SPEAKER: Can't wait.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.980
GAIL SIMMONS: It's
really beautiful.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.814
SPEAKER: Can't wait.

00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:47.730
GAIL SIMMONS: And
obviously, it's allowed me--

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.550
back to the book-- a
lot of time to travel.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.299
We shoot every season
in a different city,

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:52.360
in a different country.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.100
And my job with "Food
&amp; Wine" continues,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.460
so I spend a lot of time
traveling and on the road.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.450
And so this book
is a combination

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.750
of recipes and discoveries
and lessons learned along

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.530
my adventures traveling for
work, cooking with chefs,

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.640
spending a lot of
time on flight delays

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.620
with some of the greatest
chefs in the world,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.090
sitting at judges'
table with them

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.720
and discovering little roadside
street stalls from Colorado

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.750
to the Cayman Islands
to Singapore, Indonesia,

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.030
and Japan.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.830
And so it's been a
wild ride, and I've

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.130
had to eat a lot of food.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.010
But most of all,
the best thing of it

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.290
is that I take all of
these ideas home with me.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.360
And so this book is very
much a home cookbook.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.610
It is not about tweezers
and chefy-chef terms.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.730
And I think that every recipe,
although based in the familiar,

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.090
really has a lesson or a tip
or a flavor combination that'll

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.080
make you a better cook
in your own, real life.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.150
SPEAKER: So excited
to try it out.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.820
GAIL SIMMONS: Thank you.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.010
SPEAKER: What are you
going to make today?

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.480
GAIL SIMMONS: So I'm going to
make two dishes which I thought

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.640
would be great for
lunch-- healthy, fresh,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.650
and both of them very simple.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.670
The first one is a grilled
radicchio and lentil salad,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.840
and the second is a rustic fish
soup with fennel and orange.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.480
And both are really
great this time of year,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.810
very seasonal in terms
of their ingredients.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.785
Hardy, but super
healthy and fresh.

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:11.910
SPEAKER: Well, let's do it.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:12.280
GAIL SIMMONS: You want to cook?

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.580
GAIL SIMMONS: You guys in?

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.329
SPEAKER: Let's go.

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:18.610
GAIL SIMMONS: Also feel free,
by the way, to talk to me.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.132
I don't eat people.

00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:22.590
And I just want to
make sure that I

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.839
know how to turn on the stove.

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:24.780
I do-- look at that.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.700
SPEAKER: I, notoriously, do not.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.715
So if you've been
to talk with me in--

00:06:28.715 --> 00:06:30.840
the one in Mountain View
is really confusing, and--

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.040
GAIL SIMMONS: These are
induction, right, by the way?

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.900
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.710
GAIL SIMMONS: So, right--

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.330
I'm going to make you work.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.760
SPEAKER: I just
stand here and talk.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.235
Of course, happy
to help, always.

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:45.122
GAIL SIMMONS: So the first thing
I'm doing is making my lentils.

00:06:45.122 --> 00:06:46.080
The lentils I'm using--

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.680
I'm using green lentils.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.970
But obviously, you can
use any lentil you want.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.390
And you can certainly flavor
them in different ways.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.210
The most important
thing about lentils is--

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.710
don't overcook them.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.940
So I'm going to start with
about 5 cups of water.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.899
I'm adding some bay leaves
and some garlic cloves

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:04.440
to the water.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.190
And I'm going to
bring it to a boil.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.940
I'm just going to
squish the garlic cloves

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.910
a little bit so that all those
delicious oils and flavor comes

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:12.410
through.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.675
Drop them right in.

00:07:13.675 --> 00:07:16.590
You know what I need from
you guys, if you don't mind?

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.500
A kitchen towel--
forgot to grab.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.555
Are there here?

00:07:20.555 --> 00:07:21.720
SPEAKER: Here, right here.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.009
GAIL SIMMONS: Oh, perfect.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.050
Great, thank you, because
now I have garlic juice

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.750
all over my hands.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.610
I'm going to bring
that to a boil.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.790
Then I'm going to salt the
water and add my lentils.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.850
The thing about salting, which
people talk about all the time,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.380
is most people
would add the salt--

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.670
or think to add the
salt-- right now.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.450
Season your water.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.658
You always want to season
your water-- whether you're

00:07:41.658 --> 00:07:44.012
cooking beans, legumes, pasta.

00:07:44.012 --> 00:07:45.720
Seasoning is obviously
something that you

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.060
hear us talk about ad
nauseam on "Top Chef"

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.220
and in any cook's life.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.414
But a little trick that
I've learned over the years

00:07:52.414 --> 00:07:54.330
is you don't want to
salt the water right now.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.760
You actually want
to salt it right

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.360
before you put whatever
it is into the pot.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.194
So that will drop the
temperature slightly,

00:08:02.194 --> 00:08:04.110
but then it comes back
to a boil very quickly,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.260
and that's when you add
the pasta or the lentils

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.150
or whatever you're putting in.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.420
Over time, if you salt
your water too early,

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.550
it will pit the pot.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.090
Salt is corrosive.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.319
So I like to, now,
get in the habit--

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:20.610
when I remember-- to actually
wait till the water comes

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.125
to a boil to salt it.

00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:25.060
And it's going to take a minute.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:25.650
So we'll wait.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.690
And in the meantime,
I'm going to start

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.190
two pieces of the salad.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.120
One is the vegetables
that will get grilled.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.039
And two is the salad
dressing itself.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.690
And the good thing
about salad dressing

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.100
is that it can be
made in advance

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.870
and it can be made
in big batches.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.299
I'm making literally
the simplest salad

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.980
dressing of all time.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.930
And it's a salad dressing
that has a lot of flavor.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.210
And you don't have to
worry about ratios so much.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.000
And you can make it
times 5, times 10.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.910
Keep it in a jar.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.135
I like to keep it in a sealed
Mason jar in my fridge.

00:08:58.135 --> 00:09:00.510
And then you just give it a
shake and you always have it.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.760
And it's so much better than
buying store-bought dressing.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.150
There are certain
reasons and times

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.340
to buy a store-bought
dressing, granted,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.254
but there's a lot of added
salt and preservatives

00:09:12.254 --> 00:09:13.420
that none of us really need.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.910
So I'm a big advocate of
just making it yourself,

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.820
which is really easy to do.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.430
I'm going to start with some
lemon juice and some red wine--

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.730
or sherry vinegar,
whatever you have at home.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.700
And mix those together.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:34.680
Most classic dressings call
for about a 50-50 ratio

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.950
oil to vinegar.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.660
I'm an acid person.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.192
That sounds weird.

00:09:40.192 --> 00:09:41.400
SPEAKER: Culinarily speaking.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.149
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes.

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:46.050
I like acid in my food.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.910
So I tend to actually put
a little more than that.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.980
But first little trick for you--

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.500
I'm putting some chopped
shallots in here,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.200
and I'm going to give
that a bit of a whisk.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.480
And then I'm going to
let them sit in the acid

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.630
before I add my
seasoning and my oil.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:08.160
If you let them sit for five
minutes or so, they'll soften.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.159
And that strength--
the astringency--

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:10.950
SPEAKER: Sharpness?

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.580
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah, sharpness--

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.650
SPEAKER: Comes out
of it a little bit?

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:13.880
GAIL SIMMONS: --of any onion.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.270
But in the shallots,
which are great in salads,

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.170
you want the flavor
of them, but you don't

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.294
want that intense onioniness.

00:10:20.294 --> 00:10:22.460
So if you let them sit in
the acid for a few minutes

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.905
before you make the dressing,
then they're good to go.

00:10:25.905 --> 00:10:26.780
How's my water doing?

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.980
SPEAKER: It's getting there.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.900
GAIL SIMMONS: Great.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.680
I'm going to oil--

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.685
SPEAKER: It's a technical term.

00:10:31.685 --> 00:10:31.850
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.780
SPEAKER: Yeah,
it's getting there.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.890
GAIL SIMMONS:
That's what happens.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:34.970
I feel like it's
going to be fast.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.420
You can tell.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.000
SPEAKER: I think so,
it's coming together.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.240
GAIL SIMMONS: This is a
state-of-the-art teaching

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.830
kitchen, by the way.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.577
I'm very honored to be the first
guest in this kitchen, that's

00:10:42.577 --> 00:10:43.160
kind of crazy.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.102
SPEAKER: Oh, we could
not be happier about it.

00:10:45.102 --> 00:10:46.310
GAIL SIMMONS: That's amazing.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.360
SPEAKER: We took some good
learnings from our original

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.650
and changed some things around.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.840
GAIL SIMMONS: That's
what it's about.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.490
SPEAKER: You know, we launch and
iterate here at Google, right?

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.110
Iterating on the
teaching kitchen model.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.290
GAIL SIMMONS: I imagine
that's some sort of insider,

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.100
yes, we do.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.964
I get it.

00:10:58.964 --> 00:11:00.130
SPEAKER: Maybe a little bit.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.630
GAIL SIMMONS: I'm learning a
lot while I'm here, by the way.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.880
OK, so I'm just oiling
the grate a little bit.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.842
And then I'm going to
lightly grill a few things.

00:11:11.842 --> 00:11:13.550
You guys, I don't know
if you can see me.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.722
I can't really see what
you're looking at there.

00:11:15.722 --> 00:11:16.430
What do you need?

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.760
What do you want to move?

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.960
SPEAKER: She's just
clearing the path.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.760
GAIL SIMMONS: Oh,
yeah, go for it.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.926
OK.

00:11:22.926 --> 00:11:24.050
SPEAKER: They can kind of--

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.633
right on the--

00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:26.420
GAIL SIMMONS: Oh, I
see what's happening.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.610
Well, that's where
I'm going to be.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.585
SPEAKER: And now, look.

00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:31.970
GAIL SIMMONS: Oh, wow,
the magic of television!

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.440
SPEAKER: We're so fancy!

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.990
GAIL SIMMONS: That's right.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.870
So I'm going to
slice an onion up.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.516
When you're-- this
might seem basic,

00:11:41.516 --> 00:11:42.890
but when you're
cutting an onion,

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.620
don't ever cut off
this end, the root end.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.930
Cut off this tip and
then peel from here.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.880
If you cut off the
root, the whole thing

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.950
will sort of fall apart on you.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.830
And it's easier to
just peel it like this

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.690
before you take off
that root and cut it

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.085
and leave the root at the end.

00:12:00.085 --> 00:12:01.210
SPEAKER: That's a good one.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.530
I don't even think
of that, really.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.100
GAIL SIMMONS: Well, a lot--

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.199
there's different schools.

00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:05.740
Some people don't
care as much as me,

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.824
but I just find it easier.

00:12:06.824 --> 00:12:08.365
Because then, all
of a sudden, you're

00:12:08.365 --> 00:12:10.210
dealing with the clumsy
rings and everything

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:10.930
is falling apart.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.780
And it's a lot easier--
especially for this recipe,

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.300
because I'm going to be grilling
the onion in big slices--

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.800
to keep the whole thing intact.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.660
SPEAKER: Sure, keep
it more intact, yeah.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.040
GAIL SIMMONS: And there's
kind of big grates

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.450
that I don't want
it to fall into.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.640
And I don't really want to
start a fire as the first person

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.430
in this kitchen.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.460
SPEAKER: We have a
really good hood system.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.660
Everyone is very safe.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:28.900
GAIL SIMMONS: Great.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.280
I'm sure there's
an exit strategy.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:30.850
We're going to be fine.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.100
AUDIENCE: So would you cut off
the root if you were dicing it?

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.960
SPEAKER: Would you cut off the
root if you were dicing it?

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.150
GAIL SIMMONS: If I were
to dice this onion,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.590
I would cut it in half so
that I have a flat surface.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.180
Because you always
kind of-- life

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.440
is easier with a flat surface.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.270
Can I grab a bowl
for food waste?

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:47.770
Anything.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.460
I would cut it in
half like this.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.860
Put one half on the flat
surface and diced it.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.360
And then slice the other half.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.980
Again, to keep this intact.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.550
If I cut this off and then cut
it in half, all the petals,

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.050
all the levels would fall apart.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.509
Now for the sake of grilling
it the way I want to grill it,

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:09.341
we're getting there.

00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:10.090
SPEAKER: We are.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.940
GAIL SIMMONS: Once again,
it's almost happening.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.680
SPEAKER: It is tiny bubbly.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.221
GAIL SIMMONS: I'm
going to slice this

00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:22.210
into sort of like quarter
to half inch rings.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:27.580
I don't want them too, too thin
because I want to keep them--

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.230
again, not to fall
through the crack.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.157
And there's a little
bit of this tougher skin

00:13:32.157 --> 00:13:33.490
here that I'm going to take off.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.370
And then I'm going to
quarter my radicchio.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.510
And I'm going to
grill that, too.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:54.070
Radicchio is one of my
favorite lettuce to use.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:58.131
It's sort of hearty and
beautiful and great this time

00:13:58.131 --> 00:13:58.630
of year.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.519
And it's great on the
grill, because it adds

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:01.810
a little bit of a smoky flavor.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.860
And it's one of those
really simple things to do.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.359
SPEAKER: I think people don't
think about that, necessarily,

00:14:06.359 --> 00:14:07.300
grilling lettuces.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.134
GAIL SIMMONS: Heartier lettuces
are really easy to grill.

00:14:11.134 --> 00:14:13.300
I'm going to actually brush
these with a little oil,

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.690
too, just to make
sure that we don't

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.260
have any problems on the grill.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.690
I love-- hearty
lettuces that are big,

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.050
that obviously
won't fall through,

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.910
are really great
for this purpose.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.550
I love to grill romaine.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.440
Delicious for a grilled Caesar.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.587
SPEAKER: Grilled
Caesar is my favorite.

00:14:34.587 --> 00:14:36.670
That was a surprise the
first time I had that one.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.634
Why haven't I been doing
this my entire life?

00:14:38.634 --> 00:14:41.300
GAIL SIMMONS: Right, well that's
how I feel about this radicchio

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.940
salad.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.470
So perfect.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.779
Little bit of salt, season
those up a little bit.

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:50.820
And then I'm going to put
them right on the grill

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.532
and do the same
with that radicchio.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.250
I'm using kosher
salt, by the way.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.810
I find that the
coarseness of the grain

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.390
is really easy to handle.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.940
Fine, fine sea salt,
when you're cooking,

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.690
I like it for
finishing, perhaps,

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:11.670
and for other purposes.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.420
But fine sea salt,
I find a little bit

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.590
difficult to measure
in your hand.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.760
Because it's hard to tell
how much you're using.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:32.090
So most cooks use kosher salt.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.150
SPEAKER: We have arrived.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.820
GAIL SIMMONS: All right!

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.064
SPEAKER: We are lentil ready.

00:15:36.064 --> 00:15:36.980
GAIL SIMMONS: Awesome.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.160
SPEAKER: Or salt, salt
ready prior to lentil.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.424
GAIL SIMMONS: You want to throw
a generous pinch in there.

00:15:45.424 --> 00:15:46.340
SPEAKER: Look at that!

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.381
GAIL SIMMONS: Keep going.

00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:48.070
Keep going.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.150
One more big one.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.101
There you go.

00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:52.600
Thank you.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.200
SPEAKER: Lentils, yeah, here?

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.880
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah, we'll trade.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.660
When that boils again, which
will be in about 10 seconds,

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.610
you're going to dump
those lentils right in.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.105
And then, would you set
your phone for 20 minutes?

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.724
SPEAKER: I appreciate
your use of resources.

00:16:07.724 --> 00:16:08.889
GAIL SIMMONS: You know what?

00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:10.060
It takes a village, people.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.060
SPEAKER: What we need
is just an, OK Google.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.234
Set a timer for 20 minutes.

00:16:14.234 --> 00:16:15.400
GAIL SIMMONS: Hello, Google.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.330
Isn't that what I'm
supposed to say?

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.110
SPEAKER: OK Google.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.401
GAIL SIMMONS: OK Google, sorry.

00:16:18.401 --> 00:16:19.590
I just got one, by the way.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:23.019
Because listen to this, guys.

00:16:23.019 --> 00:16:25.060
I have a friend who works
for Google in New York.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.650
And she brought
me and my daughter

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.990
to the crazy donut
pop-up that we

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.360
did in Brooklyn last weekend.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.040
And we went in
hoping to get donuts,

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.581
because my daughter
is three, and she

00:16:34.581 --> 00:16:38.470
doesn't care about the devices.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.120
And she would just
like to get a donut.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.390
And so, you go and you
ask Google, OK Google,

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.830
answer the question.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.515
And we got a-- we
got the whole thing!

00:16:47.515 --> 00:16:49.080
A little donut!

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.280
And my daughter was
hugely disappointed.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.290
Good thing they were
also handing out donuts.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.865
And I was pretty
psyched about it.

00:16:58.865 --> 00:16:59.740
Right, actual donuts.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.114
SPEAKER: Now food,
there's always

00:17:01.114 --> 00:17:02.260
food at Google everything.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.910
It's an integral
part of our culture.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.493
GAIL SIMMONS: Great
minds think alike.

00:17:05.493 --> 00:17:07.134
Great minds think alike.

00:17:07.134 --> 00:17:10.359
So I'm brushing a little bit
of oil onto the radicchio, too,

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:13.510
to make sure it
doesn't stick and burn.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:18.564
And then I'm going to char it
up just a little bit as well.

00:17:18.564 --> 00:17:19.980
SPEAKER: So romaine
and radicchio.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.410
What are other
lettuces you think

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.540
hold up well on the grill?

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.240
GAIL SIMMONS: You
just want something

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.670
that has a bit more
of a heartiness to it.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.220
So, you know, kale can work.

00:17:32.208 --> 00:17:33.110
AUDIENCE: Cabbage?

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.240
GAIL SIMMONS: Well,
cabbage, sure.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.186
Brussels sprouts in
the lettuce-y family.

00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:41.560
So those are going
to go right on

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.226
and I probably have
to do both of these.

00:17:43.226 --> 00:17:46.650
I see what's happening.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.930
You can sort of hear
them starting to sizzle.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.230
Tongs, yes, thank you.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.260
OK, so my radicchio and
onions are grilling.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.020
I'm cleaning my
station, also important.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.000
Clean as you go.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.979
And now I can add the oil
to this beautiful dressing.

00:18:09.979 --> 00:18:12.270
I'm going to season it first
with some salt and pepper.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:20.870
Looking good over there?

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:21.560
SPEAKER: Looking good.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.530
GAIL SIMMONS: Great.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.870
SPEAKER: It's getting
a little crazy.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.840
Let's turn it down a little bit.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.270
GAIL SIMMONS: That's OK.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.620
OK, good.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.286
No, that's good.

00:18:26.286 --> 00:18:28.036
Moderate, thank you.

00:18:28.036 --> 00:18:31.290
And then I'm just whisking in--

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.150
I could use a whisk, but there's
not that much liquid in here--

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.430
a few tablespoons of olive oil.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.070
Keep whisking as
you move it around,

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.070
so that it incorporates.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.160
But you don't have to worry
that much about emulsifying

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.240
a fancy dressing here.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.075
Smoking, that's a good sign.

00:18:51.075 --> 00:18:51.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:52.250
GAIL SIMMONS: Pardon?

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.970
AUDIENCE: Is the shallot
going to emulsify?

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:54.730
GAIL SIMMONS: No, not really.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.340
It's just the oil and the acid.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.490
So it's really-- I mean, if
you want to get really crazy,

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.850
you can whisk it really,
really vigorously

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.620
and add the oil
really, really slowly.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.470
And they'll ultimately
emulsify together.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.180
SPEAKER: But not like
the required state

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:09.840
for this dressing?

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.048
GAIL SIMMONS: No, not at all.

00:19:11.048 --> 00:19:12.090
I don't really believe--

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.506
when you're at
home and you just--

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:15.990
it's going to taste the same.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.736
So my dressing's done.

00:19:19.736 --> 00:19:21.360
SPEAKER: I think that
maybe did qualify

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.560
as the easiest dressing ever.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.965
GAIL SIMMONS: Let's turn
this down just a little bit.

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:28.380
You can put a lid on that.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.650
Do you think we
have a lid for that?

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.550
SPEAKER: I'm certain it exists
somewhere in this space.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:36.777
Not certain exactly where.

00:19:36.777 --> 00:19:38.610
GAIL SIMMONS: That's
what we have Jared for.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.540
SPEAKER: Jared is on it.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.873
GAIL SIMMONS: He is all-knowing.

00:19:40.873 --> 00:19:41.985
SPEAKER: He's the best.

00:19:41.985 --> 00:19:43.190
GAIL SIMMONS: These are going
to fall through the grates

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.460
a little bit.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.751
SPEAKER: And he legit found it.

00:19:44.751 --> 00:19:47.250
Jared, you are a treasure.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.000
Thank you so much.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.291
GAIL SIMMONS: Thank you, Jared.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.444
SPEAKER: Works.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:55.360
GAIL SIMMONS: Perfect!

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.540
SPEAKER: It's scrappy.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.490
GAIL SIMMONS: It's sealing it.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.040
All right.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:00.748
SPEAKER: Love it.

00:20:00.748 --> 00:20:03.100
Look at the grill marks going.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.600
GAIL SIMMONS: I just want to
move these around a little bit,

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.212
make sure that all sides
get really lightly grilled.

00:20:09.212 --> 00:20:11.170
You know, the radicchio
does change color a bit

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.880
from that really vibrant purple.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.877
It'll get a little brown,
but it doesn't matter.

00:20:16.877 --> 00:20:17.710
And then we're good.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:21.210
Any questions so
far about anything?

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.130
Me, I'm an open
book, except if you

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.840
want to know the
winner of this season.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.370
Yes?

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.840
AUDIENCE: Do you have
one child, one daughter?

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.520
GAIL SIMMONS: I
have one daughter.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.770
SPEAKER: She has one daughter.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.690
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes,
she's almost four.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.052
She was a princess
kitty cat last night,

00:20:35.052 --> 00:20:36.260
in case anyone was concerned.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.601
SPEAKER: I think that was
a pretty popular costume,

00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:40.100
in fact.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:40.940
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah,
it's a hybrid.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.660
It's a mash-up.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.750
SPEAKER: Princess kitty.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.041
GAIL SIMMONS: Princess-- she
had her kitty [? parade ?]

00:20:45.041 --> 00:20:45.890
doll with her.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:46.970
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.810
GAIL SIMMONS: And yeah,
she was rocking it.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.350
Apparently, she got a good haul.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.396
I was sadly not there.

00:20:52.396 --> 00:20:54.770
SPEAKER: Yeah, well, I will
ask you a question selfishly.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.029
What was your favorite
season of "Top Chef"?

00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:58.070
GAIL SIMMONS: Oh, my god.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.230
I mean, it's hard to say.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.504
Because we've been able to--

00:21:01.504 --> 00:21:03.920
I mean, there's sort of like
two things about each season.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.540
There's the talent and then
there's the city, you know?

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.450
And both are so
important to the season.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:12.290
So I think of--

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.060
I think of those
as separate things.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:14.990
SPEAKER: OK, so
separate things, then.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.115
GAIL SIMMONS: I would say--

00:21:16.115 --> 00:21:18.380
I would say season
six in Las Vegas

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.170
was my favorite season in
terms of the challenges

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.889
and the chef talent and sort
of the magic of that cast.

00:21:25.889 --> 00:21:27.680
SPEAKER: And remind us
who was in that one.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.890
GAIL SIMMONS: That was Michael
Voltaggio, Bryan Voltaggio.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.514
SPEAKER: Oh, that's
my favorite season!

00:21:30.514 --> 00:21:32.610
Jen and Kevin.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.370
Yeah, that was the season.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.770
GAIL SIMMONS: They
were feisty, man.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:37.820
SPEAKER: They still are.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.195
GAIL SIMMONS: They
certainly are.

00:21:39.195 --> 00:21:40.160
They certainly are.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.701
And they've all done
incredibly well.

00:21:41.701 --> 00:21:42.750
SPEAKER: Yeah, they have.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.500
GAIL SIMMONS: I was
at Vice the other day.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.211
And they were talking about
how Kevin Gillespie had--

00:21:47.211 --> 00:21:49.460
he's an Atlanta chef who has
done really, really well.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.000
He's brilliant!

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.740
Really, really one of
the smartest guys I know.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.614
SPEAKER: I thought he
was going to win, yeah.

00:21:53.614 --> 00:21:57.320
GAIL SIMMONS: You know, we all--
you know, it's anybody's game.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.720
So they were talking
about how he was coming in

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.305
to do something the next day.

00:22:01.305 --> 00:22:02.930
And they're like, do
you know that guy?

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:03.860
Do you know know who
Kevin Gillespie is?

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.901
Asking as if they were,
like, breaking news to me

00:22:05.901 --> 00:22:07.610
about this rising star chef.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.170
And I was like Kevin
Gillespie, yeah!

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.170
I fucking made that guy.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:10.795
SPEAKER: Right?

00:22:10.795 --> 00:22:12.035
You're, like, do I know him?

00:22:12.035 --> 00:22:13.410
GAIL SIMMONS: I'm
totally joking.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.780
I didn't swear, either.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.360
And that can be bleeped
out in the stream.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.480
SPEAKER: It's certainly
not going to be!

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.860
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes, not that
I did, because it's all him.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.110
I mean, he's amazing.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.550
So that was an incredible cast.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.070
SPEAKER: That
season was special,

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.890
I feel like, with the cast.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:28.740
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah,
it really was.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.660
That was the season we won
our Emmy and for good reason.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.534
Because there was
something about the casting

00:22:32.534 --> 00:22:34.580
of that season that was
just amazing, the talent.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.240
SPEAKER: I think that I always
felt that season had the most

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.847
chefs of the same caliber.

00:22:39.847 --> 00:22:41.930
Usually there's-- usually
there's a couple who are

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:42.320
amazing.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.420
That one was, like-- it really
could have been any of them.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.086
GAIL SIMMONS: It
really could have been.

00:22:46.086 --> 00:22:47.090
So that was incredible.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.090
SPEAKER: Then city-wise?

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.256
GAIL SIMMONS: Favorite city?

00:22:49.256 --> 00:22:52.730
Probably New Orleans, season 11.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.340
We were there-- it was the
longest season we ever had.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.039
It was an 18 or
19 episode season.

00:22:57.039 --> 00:22:59.330
SPEAKER: An excuse to hang
out in NOLA a little longer.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.620
GAIL SIMMONS: We were
like, no problem!

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.203
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:23:01.203 --> 00:23:03.680
GAIL SIMMONS: We were there
for like, I don't know,

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.775
eight or 10 weeks, and it was,
by the way, May through July.

00:23:08.775 --> 00:23:10.009
SPEAKER: Oh, wow.

00:23:10.009 --> 00:23:11.300
GAIL SIMMONS: So it was swampy.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.236
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:23:12.236 --> 00:23:13.610
GAIL SIMMONS: But
it was amazing.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.526
I was pregnant, so I was
the only sober person

00:23:15.526 --> 00:23:16.695
in the town of New Orleans--

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:17.320
SPEAKER: Oh no!

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.023
GAIL SIMMONS: --for 10 weeks.

00:23:18.023 --> 00:23:18.910
Yeah.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.390
And I had the best time ever.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.100
I ate snowballs
every single day.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.600
You guys know New
Orleans snowballs?

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.420
They're like shaved ice.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:31.970
There's actually a recipe in my
book for a satsuma and ginger

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.280
granita that I discovered.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.070
I use mandarins or
tangerines in the recipe,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.432
because it's hard to get
satsumas in all of the country.

00:23:40.432 --> 00:23:41.390
in the dessert section.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:47.030
It's a ginger and mint
and tangerine granita

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.130
with condensed milk
drizzled on top.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.450
SPEAKER: Sounds amazing.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.470
GAIL SIMMONS: That was my
order every single day.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.344
And you ask if my daughter
has a sweet tooth.

00:23:53.344 --> 00:23:55.839
Like, literally, it's all
I ate for a long time.

00:23:55.839 --> 00:23:57.380
SPEAKER: I mean, it
sounds fantastic.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.270
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.270
It was a special season.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:04.220
I had spent time in New
Orleans before, but never

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.250
for that amount of time.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.370
And the city is just an
incredible, generous,

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.232
fascinating place, and
I think so, so different

00:24:11.232 --> 00:24:12.440
than the rest of the country.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:12.660
SPEAKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.790
GAIL SIMMONS: It's a
very unique, cultural--

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:14.300
SPEAKER: Very unique, yeah.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.690
GAIL SIMMONS: --place to live.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.392
It's beautiful.

00:24:16.392 --> 00:24:17.600
SPEAKER: So how's your salad?

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.290
GAIL SIMMONS: It's going great.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.330
We're going to take
the beautiful radicchio

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.070
off the grill.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.240
You can see it's nice
and charred on the edges,

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.710
but not too burned.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:31.530
I think the onions can still
survive another moment or two.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.197
I'm going to let them
soften a little bit.

00:24:34.197 --> 00:24:35.780
Turn this side off,
and I'm just going

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.390
to chop these up very loosely.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.240
I'm going to cut off the core,
because they're kind of hard.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.870
And then I'm just going to
chop it roughly like that.

00:24:45.882 --> 00:24:48.090
SPEAKER: Did you test these
recipes on your daughter?

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.880
GAIL SIMMONS: Many
of them, actually.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.397
She is a very particular critic.

00:24:53.397 --> 00:24:54.480
SPEAKER: Is that all kids?

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:54.930
Because mine sure are.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:56.790
GAIL SIMMONS: As three
year olds are, yeah.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.260
If anyone has
toddlers, they know

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.290
exactly what I'm talking about.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.640
She was great with a lot
of the recipes, actually.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.170
There's a few recipes
that were inspired

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.150
by things we cooked together.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.130
Pancakes that are
in there, certainly

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.320
a couple of the egg dishes.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.539
She totally got into the
desserts-- go figure.

00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:16.830
SPEAKER: It's a terrible thing.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:17.820
GAIL SIMMONS: But
even the things I

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.980
didn't think she would love.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.605
There's a spaghetti
pie recipe in there

00:25:20.605 --> 00:25:23.190
that sort of this amazing,
monstrous, delicious,

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.352
serves 25--

00:25:24.352 --> 00:25:24.935
SPEAKER: Sold.

00:25:24.935 --> 00:25:26.310
GAIL SIMMONS:
--weighs 40 pounds.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.900
SPEAKER: Sold.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.380
GAIL SIMMONS: It's
[INAUDIBLE] of course.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.421
I mean, there was no
surprise that she was really

00:25:30.421 --> 00:25:34.970
into the spaghetti pie.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.920
But she also loved the banana
cardamom cake, which I thought

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.960
would be a little
bit spiced for her.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.190
And she totally loved
it and ate it up.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.730
And she's a pretty
good eater, overall.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.610
She's a toddler, so every day
is a little bit different.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.344
What she liked yesterday, she
will bluntly refuse today.

00:25:55.344 --> 00:25:57.260
SPEAKER: How dare you
insult her by thinking--

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:57.590
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.470
SPEAKER: --that she
was going eat it again.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:59.550
GAIL SIMMONS: Throw
it across the room.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.250
SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah, been there.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.125
GAIL SIMMONS: But mostly
she's a great eater,

00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:04.700
and I feel lucky about that.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.300
So we cook together
a lot and she

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.554
loves to get in the kitchen,
and I think that helps.

00:26:08.554 --> 00:26:09.470
SPEAKER: Oh, for sure.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.780
I mean, I have a
daughter who's 12,

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.160
and she just started cooking
dinner for us once a week,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.175
which is the best
thing ever, by the way.

00:26:16.175 --> 00:26:18.050
GAIL SIMMONS: I would
pay big bucks for that.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:19.575
If she's looking
for more clients.

00:26:19.575 --> 00:26:20.241
SPEAKER: I know.

00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:22.160
Well, we started doing
the meal delivery thing

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:22.910
and trying it out.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.460
And then that demystified
it enough for her

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.280
that she was like,
I want to try this.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.330
GAIL SIMMONS: I can do this.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:27.860
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:28.450
GAIL SIMMONS: That's amazing.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:28.910
I mean, that's cool.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:30.260
SPEAKER: But talk
about game changer.

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:30.560
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.260
SPEAKER: But yeah, having her
just comfortable in the kitchen

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.520
now, it's really resulting
in benefit to my busy life.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.020
GAIL SIMMONS: That's
the end result.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.061
SPEAKER: And ultimately--

00:26:38.061 --> 00:26:40.280
GAIL SIMMONS: How
does this benefit me?

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.960
SPEAKER: Well, and
I also told her,

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.400
think about the life skills.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:43.870
GAIL SIMMONS: Oh, 100%.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:44.790
SPEAKER: I didn't start
cooking like that.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.160
GAIL SIMMONS: And the
math and the science.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:46.940
SPEAKER: Right?

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:47.720
All of it.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.261
GAIL SIMMONS: It's
useful, but I also

00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:52.310
think ownership allows
them to have confidence.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.470
I mean, my child at
three is much more

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.305
likely to eat her dinner
if she played a hand in it.

00:26:57.305 --> 00:26:58.420
SPEAKER: 100% agree.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.930
The things that
she will try now,

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.750
or that she'll
fully eat and enjoy

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.510
because she made it
herself is really powerful.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.230
And I just taught
my son this weekend

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.688
how to make chocolate
chip cookies,

00:27:08.688 --> 00:27:10.750
so we're going to set
the stage correctly.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:12.200
GAIL SIMMONS: So she's got
dinner and he's got dessert

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.280
and you're sold.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.310
SPEAKER: And I get to sit down--

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.400
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah, wow.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.610
SPEAKER: --which doesn't
happen very often.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:19.776
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:19.776 --> 00:27:22.017
Can you get your partner
or spouse to do the dishes?

00:27:22.017 --> 00:27:22.600
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.560
GAIL SIMMONS: That's
what you need to do.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.150
SPEAKER: I think that's one
of those things where it's not

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.890
as intimidating to,
yeah, let's clean up,

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.450
if I didn't have to
do all the things that

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.810
come before that, right?

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.268
GAIL SIMMONS: You're
totally right.

00:27:31.268 --> 00:27:35.840
My husband is not a cook, but
he is an excellent dish washer.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.150
SPEAKER: Hey, it
takes all kinds.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.090
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah,
he's a little bit OCD.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:44.039
Like, he really is very
particular about cleanliness.

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:45.830
SPEAKER: So I would
pay big bucks for that.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.100
So we should work out a trade.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:47.970
GAIL SIMMONS: He's
available for hire.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:48.511
SPEAKER: Yes!

00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:49.570
We will work out a trade.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.028
My daughter will make dinner
and your husband can clean up.

00:27:52.028 --> 00:27:53.030
GAIL SIMMONS: Done.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.244
So I have my grilled onions.

00:27:54.244 --> 00:27:55.410
SPEAKER: They smell amazing.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:56.972
GAIL SIMMONS: They're going in.

00:27:56.972 --> 00:27:58.430
SPEAKER: Sorry,
livestream friends.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:59.270
They smell amazing.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.350
GAIL SIMMONS: They do.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:03.787
The thing about onions is that
they're full of sugar, right?

00:28:03.787 --> 00:28:04.370
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:05.870
GAIL SIMMONS: And
so that's when you

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.810
say "caramelizing" onions
is really cooking them

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.780
so that the natural
sugars come out.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:15.150
The char is from
the sugar content.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:18.260
And so that's what
you want-- sweetness.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.180
They really add a
lot of sweetness.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.000
How much time do we
have on the lentils

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.120
SPEAKER: Yeah, I was just going
to say, Laura, how we doing?

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.200
GAIL SIMMONS: We're
going to fake it anyway.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.715
AUDIENCE: Eight minutes.

00:28:24.715 --> 00:28:25.310
GAIL SIMMONS: OK, great.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.150
SPEAKER: Eight
minutes on our timer.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:27.700
We got 30 minutes
left on our cook.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.070
GAIL SIMMONS: I'll
show you what to do,

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.740
but I'm still going to just
put together the salad.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.690
Because I happen to
have, through the magic

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.630
of television, some
cooked lentils.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.820
So basically all you do
when the lentils are cooked

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.720
is you strain them out,
pull out the bay leaf,

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.260
pull out the garlic, and then
lie them out on a sheet tray

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:45.970
to cool.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.540
And you want them
to cool completely,

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.700
because they'll continue
to cook if you keep them

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.910
in pot or in a bowl together
because of the heat being

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:53.720
retained.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.520
So if you spread them out,
they'll cool much faster

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.600
and that will stop the cooking.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:56.930
SPEAKER: That's a good tip.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.013
GAIL SIMMONS: And then you
just add them right in.

00:28:59.013 --> 00:29:00.950
I'm also going to add
some sliced fennel.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.115
SPEAKER: Mm.

00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:03.240
GAIL SIMMONS: Which I love.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:09.160
I think fennel is an underrated
and delicious vegetable that I

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.520
put in a lot of my salads.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.689
SPEAKER: Totally agree.

00:29:11.689 --> 00:29:13.730
And we just had some on
the breakfast line at MP1

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:14.810
this morning if were over there.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:15.810
GAIL SIMMONS: Delicious.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:20.290
Oh, fennel fronds.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:21.720
Do you guys have
a little of them?

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.100
SPEAKER: Yep, right there.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.720
We gotcha.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.969
GAIL SIMMONS: Just a tiny bit.

00:29:24.969 --> 00:29:27.620
So I'm going to dress--
thank you so much, Jared--

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.480
I'm going to dress this
salad at this point

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.560
before I put in the arugula,
because I want all of this

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.940
to absorb the dressing.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.280
If I put the arugula in too
it will wilt really quickly.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.767
And this way it will be better--

00:29:38.767 --> 00:29:40.850
like, if you're making a
dinner party or something

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.670
and you want to dress it to
let all the dressing absorb

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:47.225
but you don't want to wilt the
lettuce too far in advance.

00:29:47.225 --> 00:29:51.300
So I'm just going to pour
that dressing right over top,

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.301
and I'm going to give
that a little spin.

00:29:55.301 --> 00:29:56.800
Another good tip
about making salads

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.844
that people don't think about so
much is use a really big bowl.

00:29:59.844 --> 00:30:02.510
SPEAKER: So you can toss it well
and really get it all in there.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.050
GAIL SIMMONS: So you can
toss it really easily.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.020
Because so many times
you put your salad

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.150
in this tiny salad
bowl, and then it's

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.200
so difficult to sauce.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.350
You know exactly what
I'm talking about, right?

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.850
Right.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.150
Then I'm just going to add in--
and there's enough dressing

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.950
that it'll coat the
arugula, so you really

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.860
don't need to worry about that.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.980
SPEAKER: A little
bit of fennel frond.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.090
GAIL SIMMONS: And
some fresh basil.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.740
And then the fronds
from the fennel

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.450
that you sliced earlier,
save those fronds,

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:33.190
they are so full of flavor, and
just add a little bit there.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.750
Thank you, chef.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.510
And then you give it
all a toss together.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.270
And you can do this
stage a little bit later.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.970
If you're having a dinner
party or something,

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.942
you can make the
salad up to the point

00:30:44.942 --> 00:30:46.900
where you've dressed the
lentils and the onions

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.020
and the radicchio together and
let them sit for a little bit.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.290
And then add the arugula
at the really last minute.

00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:01.010
SPEAKER: It looks
beautiful, too.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:03.964
The color's great,
super vibrant.

00:31:03.964 --> 00:31:04.880
GAIL SIMMONS: Totally.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.404
SPEAKER: Dressing
smells amazing.

00:31:07.404 --> 00:31:09.530
AUDIENCE: What's your
favorite dish from the book?

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.130
SPEAKER: What's your
favorite dish from the book?

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:12.542
GAIL SIMMONS: God, it's so hard.

00:31:12.542 --> 00:31:14.250
SPEAKER: See, with
one kid you don't have

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.565
to be asked your favorite kid.

00:31:15.565 --> 00:31:16.130
GAIL SIMMONS: I never have
to answer that question.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.296
SPEAKER: This is like a
derivative of that question.

00:31:18.296 --> 00:31:19.470
GAIL SIMMONS: It's true.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:20.220
They're my babies.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.650
They're my babies.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.652
I would say there's so
many, because they're all

00:31:25.652 --> 00:31:27.360
so different and the
recipes-- as I said,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.400
I'm just putting a little bit
of fresh herbs right on top

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:30.900
like that.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.010
AUDIENCE: Or, what would
you eat most often?

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.051
SPEAKER: Yeah, what would
you eat again and again

00:31:35.051 --> 00:31:36.027
and again and again?

00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:37.860
GAIL SIMMONS: I'm going
to give that to you,

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.580
and we have some extra
salad here if you want it.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.050
What can I eat most often?

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.030
I mean, I could eat that
spaghetti pie all day.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.106
It makes the best
leftovers of all time.

00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:49.980
I mean, it can sit in
your fridge for a week.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.780
So don't be shy to make it.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.119
If you think you can't--

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:55.410
SPEAKER: Maybe you don't have
25 people too feed it to,

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:56.100
still make it.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.016
GAIL SIMMONS: Exactly.

00:31:57.016 --> 00:31:58.410
Still make it.

00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:59.580
It's like cold pizza.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.022
It's the best thing ever.

00:32:01.022 --> 00:32:02.730
I'm also just going
to give these to you,

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.830
Jared, if you don't mind.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.640
Thank you so much.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:09.900
I love that.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.930
I love the banana
cardamom upside-down cake.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.105
I love the black
licorice chocolate cake.

00:32:18.307 --> 00:32:19.140
SPEAKER: We got you.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.600
GAIL SIMMONS: I mean, we're
good with the lentils,

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.725
but I do want to finish
them and show you guys just

00:32:22.725 --> 00:32:25.920
for the sake of showing you.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.360
I love-- I don't know.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.820
There's so many things
that I love in the book.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.470
I love the lamb chops
a la [? friettes. ?]

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.000
Sort of a Spanish inspired dish.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.630
Lamb chops grilled with
roasted grapes and sweet onions

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:43.494
and lemon, and I drizzle smoked
paprika honey all over it.

00:32:43.494 --> 00:32:44.035
SPEAKER: Yum.

00:32:44.035 --> 00:32:46.680
GAIL SIMMONS: Easiest, great
entertaining main course.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.230
SPEAKER: Smoked paprika honey
is now burned into my brain.

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.570
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.420
SPEAKER: I will not be able
to stop thinking about that.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:51.560
GAIL SIMMONS: It's so easy.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:51.870
SPEAKER: --until
I read the book.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:53.130
GAIL SIMMONS: I mean,
literally, I just take honey,

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:54.840
put a little bit of paprika
in, stir it up, put it

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.850
in the microwave for five
seconds so it's a little warm

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.519
and it thins out,
and you drizzle it

00:32:58.519 --> 00:32:59.560
on top of the lamb chops.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.726
SPEAKER: What is this, Gail?

00:33:00.726 --> 00:33:02.670
You are blowing
my mind right now.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.260
GAIL SIMMONS: It's so good.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.460
All right, fish soup--

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.297
everybody ready?

00:33:06.297 --> 00:33:06.880
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.390
GAIL SIMMONS: This is a
really simple fish soup

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.420
that is also really
great for a dinner party,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.489
because it can be made almost
completely ahead of time.

00:33:19.489 --> 00:33:21.780
And then the fish itself you
put in at the last minute,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:22.920
and it takes two
minutes to cook.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.795
SPEAKER: Oh, perfect.

00:33:23.795 --> 00:33:25.980
GAIL SIMMONS: If you
are having people over

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.510
and you make the
dish in advance,

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.426
literally the whole thing
takes a half an hour

00:33:29.426 --> 00:33:30.281
to make in advance.

00:33:30.281 --> 00:33:32.530
Put it on the side of the
stove, don't think about it.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.384
And then people come
over or dinner is ready

00:33:35.384 --> 00:33:37.050
and you put the fish
in for two minutes.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.150
You bring it up to
temperature, put the fish

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.820
in for two minutes, and you have
the most beautiful, elegant,

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.590
really impressive dish.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.957
And it's hardy, and it's
tasty, and it's really yummy.

00:33:45.957 --> 00:33:47.040
SPEAKER: So what do we do?

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:54.112
GAIL SIMMONS: So, I'm going to
start with onions, some garlic,

00:33:54.112 --> 00:33:55.320
some celery, and more fennel.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.420
SPEAKER: All good things
start with onions and garlic.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.530
I feel like that's
just rules of life.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.270
GAIL SIMMONS: I
totally agree with you.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.396
Making soup is something
I'm sort of geeky

00:34:02.396 --> 00:34:03.270
and passionate about.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.529
There's a lot of
soup in the book.

00:34:05.529 --> 00:34:07.320
There's a whole chapter
of soups and stews,

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.570
because I spend a lot of
time making soups and stews.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.040
SPEAKER: Well, it's about
to be soup and stew weather.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.655
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:34:11.655 --> 00:34:12.800
SPEAKER" Although maybe
in New York it already is.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.650
GAIL SIMMONS: I don't believe
that that happens here,

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:14.810
but whatever you say.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.820
SPEAKER: She's from Canada
where it gets really cold.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.725
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:34:18.725 --> 00:34:19.350
SPEAKER: Right?

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.897
We adhere very strongly to
the 50 to 80 is really--

00:34:21.897 --> 00:34:22.980
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes, I know.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.156
I feel real bad
for you about that.

00:34:25.156 --> 00:34:26.489
SPEAKER: I do like coats though.

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:27.040
I don't get a chance
wear them very much.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.123
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes, I know.

00:34:28.123 --> 00:34:29.009
Well, come visit.

00:34:29.009 --> 00:34:30.550
I'll give you an
excuse to wear them.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.139
SPEAKER: Sold.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.799
GAIL SIMMONS: Actually there's
a couple of chilled soups

00:34:33.799 --> 00:34:36.090
also in the book, which I
love and make all year round.

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:38.250
There's a Romesco
style gazpacho,

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:41.460
which is a Spanish gazpacho
but with walnuts and roasted

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.570
peppers.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.679
But it's very quick.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.012
SPEAKER: Super fast [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:45.012 --> 00:34:47.400
GAIL SIMMONS: I make a chilled
corn soup, which is also

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.810
really beautiful for summer.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:51.300
But I do a lot of
soups and stews

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.389
from a riff on my
mom's matzo ball soup

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:57.120
and my grandmother
matzo ball soup to I

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.690
do a big pork and bean soup
with maple cream from Quebec

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:03.810
because I lived in
Montreal for a long time.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:08.220
And then I have this rustic fish
soup which is sort of Italian

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.540
inspired-- it's a hot pan--

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.480
and really simple and flavorful.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.200
I'm starting with some
fennel and onions.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.279
I'm going to grab
a wooden spoon.

00:35:26.279 --> 00:35:27.320
SPEAKER: Ya ta ta, Jared!

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.240
GAIL SIMMONS: Thank you so much.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.920
Magic.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.329
SPEAKER: Magic of Jared.

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:33.870
GAIL SIMMONS: So I put a little
oil in the bottom of the pan,

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.146
let it heat up for a minute.

00:35:36.146 --> 00:35:37.770
And then I added the
onions and fennel,

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.410
and I'm going to
let them cook down.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:41.640
You want to hear that sizzle.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.473
That's a good thing.

00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:45.750
People always ask about how
you know when pans are hot,

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.370
and people worry about burning.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.453
But the most important
thing I think about cooking

00:35:49.453 --> 00:35:51.690
is that it really uses
all five of your senses.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:55.890
It's the only art that I
can think of that does that.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.380
You need to hear that sizzle
to know your pan is hot.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.480
And you also can tell
if it's too high pitched

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.710
that it might be too hot.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.251
If you're not hearing that when
you put something on a grill,

00:36:04.251 --> 00:36:08.310
or when you put something
into fat in a pan or a pot,

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.270
then it's not ready.

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:12.990
And you want the integrity
of it hitting the pan

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.900
and caramelizing, or
getting color and being hot.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.340
So I'm going to put that in.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.840
And you can't
really see into it,

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.880
but you'll start
smelling it soon--

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.414
unless you're
watching this online.

00:36:23.414 --> 00:36:25.080
SPEAKER: Smells
amazing, online friends.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.090
Thanks for watching
the livestream.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.715
GAIL SIMMONS: And
then I'm going to add

00:36:28.715 --> 00:36:33.065
some celery, chopped celery,
and then a little bit of garlic.

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:39.970
You know, maybe a
little more garlic.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.136
SPEAKER: I was going to say.

00:36:43.772 --> 00:36:46.230
GAIL SIMMONS: I'm going to let
that cook for a few minutes.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:50.750
I don't want it to get too brown
and take on too much color.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.632
Because the downside
of caramelizing

00:36:52.632 --> 00:36:54.590
anything is that there's
a moment where it then

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.207
gets bitter.

00:36:55.207 --> 00:36:55.790
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:58.239
GAIL SIMMONS: It goes from
sweetness and lovely smokiness

00:36:58.239 --> 00:37:00.530
to bitterness, and I don't
want any of that in my soup,

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.030
of course.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.030
So I'm going to let that
cook for just a sec.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.140
Is the time up on the lentils?

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:06.973
SPEAKER: Yes, it is.

00:37:06.973 --> 00:37:07.880
GAIL SIMMONS: Cool.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.808
Let's just show you how that's
done, in case you're wondering.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.130
I'm just going to--

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:16.510
ooh.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.375
All good.

00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:21.035
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:21.035 --> 00:37:21.701
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:37:21.701 --> 00:37:22.700
It's the life of a chef.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.350
AUDIENCE: Who's your
favorite guest [? judge? ?]

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:25.920
SPEAKER: Oh, who's
your favorite guest

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.070
judge who works at [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:27.740
GAIL SIMMONS: That's
a good question.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.450
SPEAKER: Let's post this online
after you answer this question.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.408
GAIL SIMMONS: That's a
hard question, actually.

00:37:32.408 --> 00:37:34.034
I'm trying to think.

00:37:34.034 --> 00:37:35.450
SPEAKER 1: Do you
need some hands?

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:39.030
GAIL SIMMONS: We've worked
with so many amazing people

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.769
over the years.

00:37:39.769 --> 00:37:40.310
No, I'm good.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:41.260
I'm just going to--

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:41.730
SPEAKER: Oh, right
on your sheet pan.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:44.355
GAIL SIMMONS: --shake it out and
put it right on the sheet pan,

00:37:44.355 --> 00:37:47.122
and that way that will
cool off really quickly.

00:37:47.122 --> 00:37:47.830
SPEAKER: Perfect.

00:37:50.299 --> 00:37:51.840
GAIL SIMMONS: Let
me think for a sec.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.480
There The Foo Fighters--

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.894
they were kind of amazing.

00:37:55.894 --> 00:37:57.060
AUDIENCE: The Food Fighters.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.500
GAIL SIMMONS: The
Food Fighters--

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.790
who, by the way, are great
cooks and super exciting.

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.190
And they were awesome about
being on the show with us.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.900
We did a challenge where we
made our chefs cook for them

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.695
backstage right before
a concert and then

00:38:10.695 --> 00:38:11.970
we all went to the concert.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:12.870
That was awesome.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.210
SPEAKER: It's a good excuse
to go to the concert.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:20.550
GAIL SIMMONS: I remember
I'm standing backstage

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:26.380
and we're about to go on, and
the lead singer of the Foo

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.112
Fighters, like Dave--

00:38:28.112 --> 00:38:30.570
I'm just going to call him
Dave, because he's my buddy now.

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.050
SPEAKER: Because you're
buddies and you should.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.466
GAIL SIMMONS: Turns
to me and he's

00:38:33.466 --> 00:38:35.620
like, I can't believe
I'm on "Top Chef."

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:40.730
And I'm like, I can't believe
you're the Foo Fighters.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:41.810
SPEAKER: Win-win!

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.134
High five!

00:38:43.134 --> 00:38:44.800
GAIL SIMMONS: That
was kind of exciting.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.675
SPEAKER: That is fun.

00:38:48.606 --> 00:38:50.480
GAIL SIMMONS: Joel
Robuchon came on the show.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.629
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:38:51.629 --> 00:38:52.670
That was pretty exciting.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.990
GAIL SIMMONS: That was
really amazing for us

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.280
in our Vegas season.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.880
Because as much as we've had
the best chefs in this country,

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.772
it was rare to get one of
the real old school, French--

00:39:02.772 --> 00:39:04.230
SPEAKER: Real,
real, upper-echelon.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:06.140
GAIL SIMMONS:
--upper-echelon chefs.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.150
That was a real
highlight for all of us.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.912
Even Tom was
intimidated that day.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:14.836
Natalie Portman was a
really fun challenge.

00:39:14.836 --> 00:39:15.960
That was a vegan challenge.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.030
SPEAKER: Yeah,
because she's vegan.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.290
GAIL SIMMONS: And that
was sort of exciting,

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:21.320
because it was not only her and
she was obviously a delight,

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.519
but that was really
when we could

00:39:23.519 --> 00:39:25.310
do a vegan challenge
which people have been

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:26.520
asking us to do for a while.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:30.620
And this was, again, five
or six years ago when

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.980
the chef world was like, vegan
challenge, that's ridiculous.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:37.004
But it was a true challenge,
and we made beautiful food.

00:39:37.004 --> 00:39:38.420
They made beautiful
food that day.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.537
SPEAKER: We talk
about the complexity

00:39:41.537 --> 00:39:43.870
of cooking really delicious
vegan food here quite a bit.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:45.177
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah, I bet.

00:39:45.177 --> 00:39:47.260
SPEAKER: Our chef community
feels pretty strongly.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.060
It's actually more difficult
to cook vegetables perfectly,

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:51.560
right?

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:51.680
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.930
SPEAKER: And then to create
a really robust vegan

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:55.430
meal that feels like a meal--

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.820
GAIL SIMMONS: Right.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:56.580
And satisfying.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.890
SPEAKER: Right, exactly.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:00.350
GAIL SIMMONS: And balanced,
and all those things.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:02.644
My father at the age
of 75 became a vegan

00:40:02.644 --> 00:40:03.560
a couple of years ago.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.330
SPEAKER: Really?

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:08.400
GAIL SIMMONS: Damn him.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.620
It drives my mother and I crazy,
but I'm really proud of him

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.160
about it.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.040
I mean, I really admire
him for doing it.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.160
And it has challenged me
a lot when he comes over

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.110
and when I cook for him.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.860
And also, taking
him out for dinner,

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:26.200
which is a little bit more
difficult than it used to be,

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.984
but that's OK.

00:40:27.984 --> 00:40:30.400
So there's actually a couple
of vegan recipes in the book,

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.900
specifically made for my dad.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.066
SPEAKER: Oh, that's awesome.

00:40:33.066 --> 00:40:34.250
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:35.220
Wine.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.316
Oh, actually I'm
going to use this one.

00:40:38.316 --> 00:40:39.740
Half a cup of white wine.

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.350
If you have pernod
around, pernod

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:43.735
is also great to
use in this dish

00:40:43.735 --> 00:40:45.860
because it has a little
bit of an anise note to it.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.525
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:40:47.525 --> 00:40:50.660
GAIL SIMMONS: I'm going to
add about a half a cup of wine

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.580
in there.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.600
And I'm going to let that
reduce out a little bit

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.550
until it's almost
completely gone.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.930
So I've taken all the alcohol
away and all that's left

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:02.864
is the flavor of that wine.

00:41:02.864 --> 00:41:04.856
AUDIENCE: What are three
favorite or must-go-to

00:41:04.856 --> 00:41:06.350
restaurants in New York?

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:08.770
SPEAKER: Oh, three favorite
restaurants in New York.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.104
GAIL SIMMONS: You guys are
really hard balling it today.

00:41:11.104 --> 00:41:13.478
SPEAKER: People have been
thinking about these questions.

00:41:13.478 --> 00:41:15.640
Usually they're a lot
more like a riff off.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.520
These are good,
calculating questions.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.270
I appreciate that.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:19.660
GAIL SIMMONS: But no, I do, too.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.420
So here's my rule about giving
restaurant recommendations

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.860
in New York.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:27.609
You need to give me
either a cuisine or--

00:41:27.609 --> 00:41:29.025
SPEAKER: Narrow
the playing field?

00:41:29.025 --> 00:41:29.450
GAIL SIMMONS: --a neighborhood.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.790
SPEAKER: Yeah, you got to narrow
the playing field a little bit.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.320
GAIL SIMMONS: Because
it's overwhelming,

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.520
as it is in San Francisco.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.170
And also, I can't even keep up
anymore, there's just so many.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.420
SPEAKER: So many all the time.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.440
GAIL SIMMONS: And
there's so many I love.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.180
And I rarely get to
go to a restaurant

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.485
more than once or twice.

00:41:41.485 --> 00:41:41.985
So--

00:41:41.985 --> 00:41:43.240
AUDIENCE: West Village?

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:43.790
GAIL SIMMONS: West Village.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:44.706
SPEAKER: West Village.

00:41:44.706 --> 00:41:46.600
GAIL SIMMONS: OK,
I can do that one.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.450
No, I'm pretty good
at doing them all.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.570
I would say in the West
Village I am in love

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:57.760
with Buvette, which is a
beautiful little French cafe

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.960
with amazing small plates, great
breakfast, beautiful coffee.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.050
And it just has that
way of transporting you.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:07.600
Right across the street, the
same owner and her partner

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.660
have an Italian restaurant
called Via Carota,

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.940
and it's also really delicious.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:16.090
I'm an old school fan of
Mary's Fish Camp, which

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:19.690
is like a classic lobster roll
place in New York which still

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:21.770
has lineups out the
door for two hours,

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:23.860
even though it's been
open for 15 years.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.306
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:42:25.306 --> 00:42:26.430
That's testament in itself.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:27.471
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes, it is.

00:42:27.471 --> 00:42:28.450
I mean, it's tiny.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:30.280
The West Village
is known for having

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.955
a lot of tiny great spots.

00:42:32.955 --> 00:42:35.086
AUDIENCE: Favorite in Chelsea?

00:42:35.086 --> 00:42:36.460
SPEAKER: Oh,
favorite in Chelsea,

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.930
which is where our new
Google office is going.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.513
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah,
I have been there.

00:42:39.513 --> 00:42:43.570
I lived on 16th Street for
10 years, 16th and 7th,

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:45.800
and Google's at 16th
between 8th and 9th, right?

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.680
SPEAKER: And we're building out
a whole new thing in Chelsea.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.230
GAIL SIMMONS: Well, there
you go, I'll go check it out.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:50.190
SPEAKER: The pier.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:51.170
We're taking that whole thing.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.211
GAIL SIMMONS: Oh, right,
you're taking that pier.

00:42:53.211 --> 00:42:55.105
So that's intimidating.

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:57.480
That part of the city did not
have a great day yesterday.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.063
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:42:58.063 --> 00:43:00.174
GAIL SIMMONS: But we will rise.

00:43:00.174 --> 00:43:00.840
SPEAKER: Always.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.410
GAIL SIMMONS: Again.

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:06.020
So Chelsea, that was my
hood for a really long time.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.220
I love a lot of
restaurants in Chelsea.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.080
Chelsea's a funny neighborhood.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.890
The food has changed a lot
in a very short time there.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:20.030
There's a really amazing
spot called Haven's Kitchen

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.470
on 17th Street.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.530
It's a coffee shop and
little cafe by day,

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.640
and their food is really great.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:33.490
And then they have a
cooking and teaching

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.980
space and a catering company,
and they do cooking classes,

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.080
and they have a beautiful
private event space.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.050
I am adding some
fish stock to this.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:44.470
If you don't have fish stock
or not up to making fish stock,

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:47.800
which you don't have to do,
you can use some clam juice.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.080
Just a bottle of clam
juice, like eight ounces

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.627
of clam juice, and that's going
to be the basis of this soup.

00:43:52.627 --> 00:43:55.210
SPEAKER: Our beautiful leader's
telling us we have 10 minutes.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:55.918
SPEAKER: Perfect.

00:43:55.918 --> 00:43:58.852
AUDIENCE: OK, so what
about your favorite vegan

00:43:58.852 --> 00:43:59.810
restaurant [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:01.643
SPEAKER: Oh, your
favorite vegan restaurant.

00:44:01.643 --> 00:44:02.530
GAIL SIMMONS: Sure.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.020
Superiority Burger
is sort of amazing.

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.430
SPEAKER: Superiority Burger?

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:07.326
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:44:07.326 --> 00:44:08.200
It's not [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.810
SPEAKER: That is the most
vegan thing I've ever heard.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:12.810
GAIL SIMMONS: They are
the most amazing burgers.

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:13.701
AUDIENCE: They are.

00:44:13.701 --> 00:44:14.950
GAIL SIMMONS: They're awesome.

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:15.730
In with the stock.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:17.460
SPEAKER: That's the best
name for a vegan restaurant.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.490
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:20.480
In with the stock is
a can of tomatoes.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.450
You can get whole and
just mash them up,

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:24.820
or buy crushed
tomatoes if you want.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:29.710
And then I'm going to
add some chili pepper,

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.710
some grated orange zest.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:37.480
I put citrus zest in general
in almost all of my food,

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.130
because I find it so delicious.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:39.580
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.340
GAIL SIMMONS: And it
brings so much to it.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.131
SPEAKER: Greatness.

00:44:42.131 --> 00:44:43.180
Yeah.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.150
GAIL SIMMONS: And
then some fresh thyme.

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:48.659
You can just add the
whole stem if you want to.

00:44:48.659 --> 00:44:50.200
SPEAKER: Because
picking thyme leaves

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.700
is the most annoying
kitchen task.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:52.520
GAIL SIMMONS: Well,
except I'm going

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.430
to show you a little tip
about the thyme leaves.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:55.330
SPEAKER: Please make
it a easier for me.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.538
GAIL SIMMONS: The fastest
way to pick a thyme leaf is

00:44:57.538 --> 00:44:59.300
to turn it down like this.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.240
So, the leaves
are all facing up.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.081
If you put your hand at the
top and then just go down,

00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:06.580
all of them are off and then
you don't have to worry about--

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:07.810
SPEAKER: With the
strong stems, yes.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.400
And when the stems are
weak they break on you

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.270
and it's the most
annoying thing.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.930
GAIL SIMMONS: That's true.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:11.710
It is annoying.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:13.360
That's why I say,
if you're going

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.540
to put the whole thing in,
remember to take it out

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.690
because it's not
so nice otherwise.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.440
SPEAKER: Spoon that
right into your mouth.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.000
GAIL SIMMONS: I'm going
to season this up just

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.890
a little bit with some
salt. And then I'm

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.200
going to bring this
to a boil, and I'm

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.230
going to let it simmer
for about 25 minutes.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:31.340
And then that'll be
the base for your soup.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.220
And if you want to
turn it off right there

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:37.660
and put it inside of your stove
until you're ready to cook

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.610
the fish, that's done.

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:41.680
And then you're going
to cook the fish in it.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.910
And I, through the
magic of television,

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:45.405
have some done right here.

00:45:45.405 --> 00:45:46.030
SPEAKER: Ta-da!

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.624
AUDIENCE: Will we see
a successful risotto

00:45:52.624 --> 00:45:54.251
on this season?

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:56.250
SPEAKER: Do they make a
successful [INAUDIBLE]??

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:57.960
It's only happened one time.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.660
GAIL SIMMONS: It has happened,
and it is a hard thing to do.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.140
It's like, they can't
help themselves.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.660
SPEAKER: That's my thing--
they keep doing it.

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.400
They just keep going back to it.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.980
GAIL SIMMONS: It is a
very competitive field,

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.125
and they all think they're
going to take it down,

00:46:12.125 --> 00:46:13.417
like they are going to conquer.

00:46:13.417 --> 00:46:15.166
SPEAKER: Well, someone
I feel like did one

00:46:15.166 --> 00:46:16.370
in one of the later--

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.115
towards the end--
and Tom actually--

00:46:18.115 --> 00:46:19.490
GAIL SIMMONS:
Right, that's true.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:23.210
Because when you only
have to cook for a smaller

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:26.530
amount of people and you're
not one of 15 cooking,

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:27.582
you're more likely.

00:46:27.582 --> 00:46:29.790
SPEAKER: But I feel like it
was even maybe the finale

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:30.350
or right before.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:31.320
GAIL SIMMONS: I think
it was right before.

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.140
SPEAKER: Right before, yeah.

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:32.870
GAIL SIMMONS: I kept
forgetting, because truthfully--

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.619
SPEAKER: It was just
a small dinner party.

00:46:34.619 --> 00:46:37.257
GAIL SIMMONS: I have no memory
of eating [INAUDIBLE] dishes.

00:46:37.257 --> 00:46:38.840
SPEAKER: Well, you've
done 15 seasons?

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:39.631
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:46:39.631 --> 00:46:40.460
And five spin-offs.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:43.189
I mean, there's just no
way to remember it all.

00:46:43.189 --> 00:46:44.730
SPEAKER: Right, so
what kind of fish?

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:47.030
GAIL SIMMONS: So
this is sea bass,

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:51.110
but you can really use any
firm, white fish that you want.

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:55.715
If you see halibut or tilapia--

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.390
cod would be great.

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:03.820
It all cooks really quickly,
and it's all really good for you

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.030
and delicious.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:08.630
I'm just going to
slice it up very gently

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.630
and cube it into
one-inch pieces.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:16.190
And then I'm putting it
right into the pot that

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.090
should be lightly simmering.

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:19.670
And it'll cook in
about two minutes,

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.253
and then you're
literally done and you

00:47:21.253 --> 00:47:23.190
can serve the whole
thing, which I will do.

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.050
[? Skip-- ?] oh,
that's hot already.

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:29.482
AUDIENCE: Is there
a genre of food

00:47:29.482 --> 00:47:35.245
that you prefer not to cook or
find particularly challenging?

00:47:35.245 --> 00:47:37.120
SPEAKER: What type of
genre food to not cook?

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:37.730
GAIL SIMMONS: You know, that's
an interesting question.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:38.860
That's a question I've
have never had before,

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.490
because everyone ask me
what's your favorite cuisine

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.260
or genre to cook in or eat.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.080
And my answer is
always that, because we

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.850
live in the amazing
places we live,

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:50.370
I can eat and cook a different
cuisine every single day.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:50.685
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:47:50.685 --> 00:47:52.643
GAIL SIMMONS: I could
eat Mexican for breakfast

00:47:52.643 --> 00:47:55.650
and Filipino for lunch
and Vietnamese for dinner,

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:59.430
and then go out for incredible
sushi as a midnight snack,

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:00.360
or whatever I want.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.820
For cooking purposes,
I would say Japanese

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:07.452
beyond making simple
ramen or udon,

00:48:07.452 --> 00:48:09.660
because it's hard to get
the quality of ingredients--

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:13.850
like, if I want to do really
elaborate Japanese food.

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:18.540
And it's also the training,
which is at a different level.

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:20.910
I don't cook it at
home, but that's not

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:24.060
to say I don't use the
flavors that I love

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:28.710
from Japanese food-- really good
soy, and yuzu, and togarashi,

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:33.640
and that kind of thing that
I love to put into my food.

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:38.010
I love cooking other food
that uses similar flavors.

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:40.710
I love Indonesian food, and
Vietnamese food-- both of which

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:46.650
there's a lot of in the book, a
couple of dishes from Singapore

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:48.330
from our time spent
there when we shot

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:51.940
the seventh season of the show.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.440
But I don't cook classic,
really elaborate Japanese food

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.840
at home that much.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.677
Oh, we got a rapid boil.

00:48:58.677 --> 00:48:59.510
I love this kitchen.

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:00.600
SPEAKER: It's an
induction, I tell you.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.391
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:49:04.874 --> 00:49:06.846
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:10.160
GAIL SIMMONS: Never.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.190
I cannot speak for
other food shows,

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:17.480
but on our show we realized
very quickly that obviously it

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.420
affects the quality of the
food and how we judge it,

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:23.740
and we never wait for food.

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:24.890
So it doesn't matter--

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:26.390
I'm trying to wash
my hands quickly.

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:29.720
It doesn't matter if
my dress isn't done up

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:34.220
or my makeup's not on or my
mic is improperly positioned

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.570
or anyone's running late.

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:37.250
When the food is hot, we eat it.

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:38.330
SPEAKER: Good.

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:40.450
GAIL SIMMONS: And our
associate director--

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:40.790
SPEAKER: That's good to hear.

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:43.190
GAIL SIMMONS: --who runs
the stage is very adamant

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:44.510
about that, and rightly so.

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:47.067
Because that's
the nature of what

00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:48.650
we do, and we want
to give these chefs

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:50.070
the respect that they deserve.

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:51.920
SPEAKER: And if it's going to
be a real cooking show, right?

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.195
GAIL SIMMONS: That's right.

00:49:53.195 --> 00:49:54.320
They're professional chefs.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.990
These are not amateurs who think
it would be cool to be a chef.

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:59.210
These are all guys and
girls who have been cooking

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:01.187
for 10-plus years at
the highest level,

00:50:01.187 --> 00:50:03.770
and so we really want to respect
the food that they're cooking

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:05.129
and eat it as hot as we can.

00:50:05.129 --> 00:50:07.670
What you don't see on the show
which makes that a lot easier,

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:09.350
is that the chefs
cook in a stagger.

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:09.860
SPEAKER: Ah.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.900
GAIL SIMMONS: So everyone
often thinks that they're all

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.870
cooking at the same time.

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:14.450
So the last person
cooking, of course

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.575
their food's going to be
cold by the time it gets--

00:50:16.575 --> 00:50:19.220
or the last person whose
food is presented for eating.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:22.670
But actually they cook in
staggers usually of three.

00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:25.070
So let's say it's
a two-hour cook.

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:27.890
The first three will go, and
they'll cook for 20 minutes,

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:29.540
and then the next
three will start.

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:31.940
So there's a 20-minute
gap between them.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:34.460
So that when we're
eating, we eat the first

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.560
and we have 20 minutes to
eat it and talk about it

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.730
before the next comes out.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:38.450
SPEAKER: Editing, right?

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.630
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:40.040
SPEAKER: It's all
in the editing.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.415
GAIL SIMMONS:
Well, and that also

00:50:41.415 --> 00:50:44.154
allows us to eat, have a
discussion about it, clear.

00:50:44.154 --> 00:50:46.070
Sometimes it's been a
half an hour, 20 minutes

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:47.660
to half an hour, but
it also makes sure

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.320
that we're getting their
food as soon as it comes off

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:49.540
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:49.830
SPEAKER: That makes
a ton of sense.

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:50.330
Yeah.

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:51.890
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah, exactly.

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:52.390
Pardon?

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:53.960
SPEAKER: Even the quickfire?

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.110
GAIL SIMMONS: Quickfire's
a little different.

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:57.620
So quickfire, they all have
to be done at the same time,

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.450
but they go through
them really quickly.

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:06.440
Padma speaks to them with the
guest chef for three minutes

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.750
each, and they move on.

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:10.070
So they go really quickly
around that kitchen.

00:51:13.827 --> 00:51:15.660
SPEAKER: Other questions
while she's plating

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.040
this amazing smelling soup?

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.930
AUDIENCE: So the
holidays are coming up.

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:19.530
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:23.338
AUDIENCE: Do you recommend
certain things [INAUDIBLE]??

00:51:23.338 --> 00:51:25.870
SPEAKER: Ooh, what shall we
make this holiday season?

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:27.990
GAIL SIMMONS: Absolutely.

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:31.380
I sort of regret that there's
not a traditional turkey

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:32.730
in my book.

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:33.990
There is a turkey.

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:36.090
It's a pastrami turkey.

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:41.010
So I've roasted the turkey
with the flavors of pastrami,

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:44.070
and it's really delicious, and
it's sort of rolled and sliced,

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:45.830
boned out.

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:48.330
So it's an untraditional turkey,
and if you want to make it,

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:50.530
I guarantee you'll
be happy about it.

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:53.970
And the flavor is awesome
because sometimes turkey flavor

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:55.636
is pretty bland.

00:51:55.636 --> 00:51:57.010
But there's lots
of other things.

00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:00.270
So for Thanksgiving there is
an amazing salt and vinegar

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:02.820
smashed potatoes, which is
actually in "People" magazine--

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:05.310
I just saw it today, so I guess
it's in this week's issue--

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:08.480
that I did in the book.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.230
There's a lot of holiday
baking, you said.

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:12.900
So the black licorice chocolate
cake I mentioned before I think

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:13.930
is amazing.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:16.210
There's two tarts in the book--

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:19.420
one is a very traditional
Canadian tart called

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:26.850
a [? tarto ?] [? sook, ?] and it
is a maple sugar tart which is

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:30.570
a very traditional dish that
you eat at sugar shacks all over

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:33.150
Quebec when sugaring
season happens,

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:35.310
which sort of starts now
and goes through March.

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:40.590
And it has a hazelnut
crust, and it's insanely

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.587
delicious and addictive.

00:52:42.587 --> 00:52:44.670
The first time I ever made
the soup in the States,

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:46.440
I made it for Marcus
Samuelsson, who's

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.020
a chef in New York who
is a good friend of mine.

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:54.330
And we had a show together
for a brief time on a network

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:55.220
called FYI.

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.690
And I made it for him on
the show, and he sat--

00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:59.250
I mean, he's a little man--

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.772
and he ate an entire
half of a pie.

00:53:01.772 --> 00:53:03.900
SPEAKER: And then you
bounced around the room

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.250
on a sugar high?

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:05.416
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah, exactly.

00:53:05.416 --> 00:53:06.810
Delicious.

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:09.930
And then there's a banoffee
pie, which if you're not a baker

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:12.000
I highly recommend, because--

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.040
do you have any more
of those fronds?

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:15.850
Thank you.

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:18.597
Because it requires
no actual baking.

00:53:18.597 --> 00:53:20.305
SPEAKER: It's an
assembly of ingredients?

00:53:20.305 --> 00:53:21.055
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes.

00:53:21.055 --> 00:53:23.410
The only thing you have
to do is make or buy--

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:25.810
but I do teach you how to make--

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:28.440
dulce de leche out of a
can of condensed milk.

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:28.990
SPEAKER: Oh.

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:32.070
GAIL SIMMONS: And the
dulce de leche then

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:35.110
gets spread on the bottom of
a chocolate wafer crust, which

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:37.900
is just really chocolate wafers
that you buy in the grocery

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.930
store mixed with butter and
pressed into a pie plate.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.230
And then layers
of sliced banana,

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:47.140
lots of whipped cream, chocolate
shavings and roasted peanuts.

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:47.680
SPEAKER: It sounds gross.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.888
GAIL SIMMONS: And it is like
the most killer dessert.

00:53:49.888 --> 00:53:51.820
SPEAKER: It doesn't
sound good at all.

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:53.986
GAIL SIMMONS: There's a
couple of good cookies, too.

00:53:53.986 --> 00:53:58.660
There's a cookie in there
that is a vanilla cookie,

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:01.390
but it's a sandwich cookie with
dulce de leche in the middle

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:03.490
and dipped in chocolate
with a little sea salt,

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:07.185
and those are really
good holiday cookies.

00:54:07.185 --> 00:54:07.685
Yeah.

00:54:07.685 --> 00:54:10.570
SPEAKER: Yes, Gail.

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:11.560
So there you are.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.040
GAIL SIMMONS: There you are.

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.300
So that's my fish stew.

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.866
It came together in moments.

00:54:14.866 --> 00:54:15.990
SPEAKER: Really fast, yeah.

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:17.730
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah, and my
grilled radicchio salad.

00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:19.612
Thank you guys so much
for cooking with me.

00:54:19.612 --> 00:54:20.403
SPEAKER: Fantastic.

00:54:20.403 --> 00:54:21.456
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:27.320
And because we're so spoiled and
Googlers eat all of the things,

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.722
everybody gets to taste
these delicious dishes.

00:54:30.722 --> 00:54:32.180
And do you want to
do a little Q&amp;A?

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:32.500
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:34.374
If you guys have questions,
keep them coming.

00:54:34.374 --> 00:54:35.570
I'm happy to answer.

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.790
I have a question for you guys.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:40.100
Where should I eat
breakfast tomorrow morning

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:41.557
in San Francisco?

00:54:41.557 --> 00:54:42.870
AUDIENCE: Our office?

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:43.760
GAIL SIMMONS: Right.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.010
Could do that.

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:47.951
Any other favorites--
breakfast, brunch?

00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:49.200
AUDIENCE: Tartine Manufactory.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:49.660
GAIL SIMMONS:
Tartine Manufactory.

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.432
SPEAKER: Yeah,
Tartine Manufactory.

00:54:51.432 --> 00:54:52.640
GAIL SIMMONS: Where is Elise?

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.840
Noted, we're going to
Tartine Manufactory.

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:54.590
I forgot about it.

00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:55.490
Of course.

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:56.390
Thank you very much.

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:58.016
AUDIENCE: Porcini
breakfast sandwich.

00:54:58.016 --> 00:55:00.273
GAIL SIMMONS: Did you say
porcini breakfast sandwich?

00:55:00.273 --> 00:55:00.980
Done.

00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:01.680
Check and check.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.917
SPEAKER: That place
is super delicious.

00:55:03.917 --> 00:55:04.750
GAIL SIMMONS: Great.

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:04.990
Great.

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.870
AUDIENCE: Bread bowl?

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:08.500
GAIL SIMMONS: Oh,
yeah, that's a given.

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.310
SPEAKER: She ate at
[? Lavonne ?] earlier.

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:11.340
GAIL SIMMONS: I did,
I had my breakfast.

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.590
We got here really
early, and I had

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:14.506
breakfast at [? Lavonne ?]
which is delicious.

00:55:14.506 --> 00:55:18.122
I had a trumpet mushroom strata.

00:55:18.122 --> 00:55:19.455
AUDIENCE: Mr. Holmes Bakehouse.

00:55:19.455 --> 00:55:21.080
SPEAKER: Oh yeah,
Mr. Holmes Bakehouse.

00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.100
GAIL SIMMONS: I love--

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:24.220
I mean, that place is bananas.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.480
So cool.

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.950
That will probably be like
a mid-afternoon snack.

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:28.866
SPEAKER: There you go.

00:55:28.866 --> 00:55:31.220
GAIL SIMMONS: I'm going to
try to start with something

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:32.387
with some nutritional value.

00:55:32.387 --> 00:55:33.970
SPEAKER: Yeah, put
a little base down.

00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:36.310
GAIL SIMMONS: And then
I'll go to Mr. Holmes.

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:36.490
SPEAKER: I love it.

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:36.950
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah?

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:38.396
AUDIENCE: I'm going to
be in Queens next week.

00:55:38.396 --> 00:55:39.360
Any recommendations?

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.000
GAIL SIMMONS: In Queens?

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.333
SPEAKER: Queens recommendations?

00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:43.760
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes, absolutely.

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:49.640
I mean, you should go to
PS1 to M. Wells, if you can.

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:55.490
A guy from Quebec actually who
cooks at the museum, the Modern

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:57.797
Art Museum at PS1
and gallery, and he

00:55:57.797 --> 00:55:58.880
has an awesome restaurant.

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:01.760
It's in Long Island City.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.430
Are you willing to
come to Brooklyn?

00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:05.240
It's not far.

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.531
There's not even a real border.

00:56:06.531 --> 00:56:07.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:11.840
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah, I mean,
come to Brooklyn, I say.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.510
Let's see, if you're going
to drive a little bit,

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:16.940
you don't even need to go
into Manhattan these days.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:21.980
I say go to Larina,
L-A-R-I-N-A, in Fort Greene.

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.470
If you guys watched our
last season of "Top Chef,"

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:29.212
there was an Italian chef named
Silvia Barban on the show.

00:56:29.212 --> 00:56:31.670
She's so lovely, and she opened
this restaurant a year ago.

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:33.140
My mother-in-law went
last night actually

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.220
and said it was amazing.

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:36.860
But I went over the summer
and just blown away.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.447
It's simple, beautiful,
Italian food.

00:56:39.447 --> 00:56:40.530
SPEAKER: She was so sweet.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.660
GAIL SIMMONS: She
was very sweet.

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:43.955
SPEAKER: Edited to seem sweet.

00:56:43.955 --> 00:56:44.830
GAIL SIMMONS: No, no.

00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:46.130
SPEAKER: Now I'm suspicious.

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:48.796
GAIL SIMMONS: That is their true
selves, just like it's also me.

00:56:48.796 --> 00:56:51.170
It's just a bit of
a curated version.

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:53.480
I wear more cocktail dresses
in my "Top Chef" life.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.590
SPEAKER: You have the best
cocktail dresses on that show.

00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:55.590
GAIL SIMMONS: Thank you.

00:56:55.590 --> 00:56:58.640
I will tell the woman who's
in charge of that job,

00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.710
because it's not me.

00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:00.530
SPEAKER: Please do.

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:02.238
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes, I
would fail miserably

00:57:02.238 --> 00:57:05.535
if I had to do that job myself.

00:57:05.535 --> 00:57:06.910
SPEAKER: You guys
like the salad?

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:07.120
EVERYONE: Yeah.

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.960
GAIL SIMMONS: So is
everything, yeah, good?

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.584
Thank you, Chef
[? Didi, ?] by the way,

00:57:10.584 --> 00:57:13.087
and both Alma and Jared, they
did such an amazing job today.

00:57:13.087 --> 00:57:14.420
SPEAKER: Thank you guys so much.

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:16.520
Usually what happens is
we're talking and talking,

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.190
and then everybody
gets real quiet.

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:22.210
And that's how we know
everything is super delicious.

00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:24.496
AUDIENCE: The grilled
radicchio [INAUDIBLE]..

00:57:24.496 --> 00:57:26.120
SPEAKER: Grilled
radicchio, next level?

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.480
AUDIENCE: I'm obsessed now.

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:28.490
GAIL SIMMONS: I agree.

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:31.160
SPEAKER: So [? Didi, ?] we need
to do a grilled salads class.

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.140
GAIL SIMMONS:
Grilled salads class.

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:33.680
Oh!

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.390
I'd come, totally.

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:37.414
SPEAKER: So we were
speaking earlier about--

00:57:37.414 --> 00:57:39.080
GAIL SIMMONS: I was
think I'm moving in.

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.788
SPEAKER: --the classes
that we have here,

00:57:40.788 --> 00:57:42.837
and she wants to come and
do a series of classes.

00:57:42.837 --> 00:57:45.170
And I think we would all
support that whenever she could

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:46.462
make time in her busy schedule.

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:48.753
GAIL SIMMONS: I'm going to
be like artist-in-residence,

00:57:48.753 --> 00:57:49.890
just right in this kitchen.

00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:51.140
I'm going to sleep under the--

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:52.770
SPEAKER: You can be a member
of the Google Food Team.

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:53.561
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:57:53.561 --> 00:57:55.430
SPEAKER: We'll make
you an honorary member.

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.013
GAIL SIMMONS: The
thing about the book

00:57:57.013 --> 00:57:59.870
that I really tried to
do with every recipe is

00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:00.800
make it super simple.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.007
Ultimately it's a lentil
and lettuce salad, right?

00:58:03.007 --> 00:58:03.590
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:04.970
GAIL SIMMONS: And
if you take out

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:06.470
the grilling of
the radicchio, it's

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:08.570
a salad that you can
probably get anywhere.

00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:11.762
But that one extra step of
grilling the radicchio I think

00:58:11.762 --> 00:58:13.220
really changes the
salad, makes you

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:17.150
think a little more about
cooking and pumping up

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:19.684
the flavor in your dish,
and using maybe a technique

00:58:19.684 --> 00:58:20.600
that you wouldn't use.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.050
So all the recipes in the
book I think have that.

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:24.050
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:26.210
That's that special thing
that makes it really

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:29.600
value add, like learn
something besides just

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.940
getting inspiration,
which is always good.

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.320
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah, exactly.

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:36.350
I want people to not just follow
a recipe verbatim, but actually

00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:38.930
start to understand the reasons
that a recipe are written

00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:41.330
the way that they're
written, and feel confident

00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:44.600
following the recipe so much
so that then they can move away

00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:47.570
from the recipe and start
really cooking spontaneously,

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:49.970
but based in the
proper technique.

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:51.730
AUDIENCE: If you weren't
a cook-- a chef--

00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:52.610
or in the food industry--

00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:53.870
GAIL SIMMONS: I'm not a chef.

00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:55.512
She's a chef.

00:58:55.512 --> 00:58:57.710
AUDIENCE: --what
would you want to be?

00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:58.460
What would you do?

00:58:58.460 --> 00:58:59.751
SPEAKER: What's your dream job?

00:58:59.751 --> 00:59:01.657
GAIL SIMMONS: You
know, I love my job.

00:59:01.657 --> 00:59:02.990
SPEAKER: It's a pretty good one.

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:07.340
GAIL SIMMONS: But
my answer is always

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:10.590
that I would want to be a
primatologist, a zoologist.

00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:11.840
SPEAKER: Really?

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.360
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah, I
really love monkeys.

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.370
I studied anthropology--
physical and cultural

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:20.620
anthropology-- in
college, because my way in

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.010
was I really love monkeys.

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:27.110
Like, I'm fascinated by
primates, which we all are,

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:28.580
technically.

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.254
Yeah, I think I would be
a zoologist, if I could.

00:59:31.254 --> 00:59:32.420
SPEAKER: That's fascinating.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:33.800
GAIL SIMMONS: Probably an
assistant to a zoologist

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:35.175
because no one
would really trust

00:59:35.175 --> 00:59:38.527
me to be the head zoologist.

00:59:38.527 --> 00:59:39.860
SPEAKER: I mean, you never know.

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.330
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes?

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:41.830
Yeah?

00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:43.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.860
SPEAKER: Oh, what spices
are low key overlooked?

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:47.171
GAIL SIMMONS: Definitely.

00:59:47.171 --> 00:59:47.670
A lot.

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:52.430
And I use a lot of spices in
this book in very subtle ways.

00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:56.930
Ground ginger, ground
cardamom, certainly,

00:59:56.930 --> 01:00:00.090
paprika, I use a lot of smoked
paprika and sweet paprika.

01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:01.340
SPEAKER: Smoked paprika honey.

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.798
GAIL SIMMONS: Smoked
paprika honey.

01:00:02.798 --> 01:00:04.264
SPEAKER: Locked in.

01:00:04.264 --> 01:00:05.930
GAIL SIMMONS: A lot
of different chilies

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:07.790
that you'll see in the book--

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:11.139
aleppo pepper, obviously
chili flakes are a staple.

01:00:11.139 --> 01:00:12.680
They come up all
the time because you

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.500
can use them in everything.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.140
But Aleppo pepper
and other dried

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:22.220
peppers I really
love cooking with.

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.957
Zaatar, which is a spice
blend, I use a lot.

01:00:24.957 --> 01:00:26.540
It comes up again
and again in my book

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.900
because I'm just so drawn to
those Middle Eastern flavors.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:35.090
Traditionally zaatar is a spice
blend of sesame and thyme,

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.610
sometimes there's
sumac in there.

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:40.490
Sumac is another spice
that actually comes up

01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:41.780
again and again in my book.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:46.820
I put it with chilies and
salt and lime over just

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.580
cut up vegetables and fruit.

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.840
I use sumac in salad
dressings with tahini,

01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:01.270
in Moroccan dishes in addition
to or instead of harissa.

01:01:03.978 --> 01:01:05.890
So our lovely cameraman
is reminding me

01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:07.640
that we have to finish
the livestream now.

thank you so much for coming.

01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:12.552

GAIL SIMMONS: Thank you.

01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:15.450
