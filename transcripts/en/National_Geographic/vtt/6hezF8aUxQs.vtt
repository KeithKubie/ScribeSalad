00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:21.100
HOST: In East LA, this
would be a body shop.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.767
In Balochistan, it's a beach,
an illegal chop shop for dhows.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.233
HOST: But Razul's boats
don't go the whole distance.

00:00:58.233 --> 00:00:59.433
The reason?

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:02.600
Dhows in the Indian Ocean
attract too much heat.

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.300
Western navies are now
fighting the war on drugs.

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:19.100
And, due to their
reputation for smuggling,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.166
dhows are the prime target.

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:29.500
The 9,000 kilograms of
narcotics that we've taken off

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.133
the ocean would provide
a hit for each individual

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:33.867
in the United States.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.800
The smugglers are very clever.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.300
They learn how we operate.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.867
We learn how they operate, and
the game is always changing.

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:33.533
HOST: With the
Navy on the prowl,

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:38.333
Razul offloads to other ships
in international waters.
