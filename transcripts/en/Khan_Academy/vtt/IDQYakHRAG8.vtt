00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:02.911
- I'm guessing that you've
had the experience of rubbing

00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:04.881
a balloon against your
hair and then when you take

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:09.818
the balloon away from your
hair, your hair sticks up.

00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:11.200
And if you haven't had that experience,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.211
you might think about trying to lead

00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:15.568
a more rich and fun life,

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:18.456
but I'm guessing most of
you all have done that.

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:21.382
And you had a sense that it
had something to do with the

00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:26.034
balloon or your hair, somehow
exchanging charge or now

00:00:26.034 --> 00:00:28.810
one is going to be more positive
or negative than the other,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.825
and so now they are somehow attracted.

00:00:31.825 --> 00:00:33.206
And if you were thinking of those things,

00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:34.669
you are generally right.

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:37.046
What you just experienced
after you rubbed the balloon

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:40.358
on your head, and then
your hair is now attracted

00:00:40.358 --> 00:00:42.085
to the balloon, that's actually called

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:46.697
the triboelectric effect,
let me write that down,

00:00:46.697 --> 00:00:51.697
tribo, triboelectric, electric effect.

00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:55.534
And human beings have been observing this

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:57.891
for a long long time,
and it wasn't necessarily

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.431
with balloons at birthday
parties or whatever,

00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:03.214
it's with other things, they
rub a silk cloth on a piece

00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:05.002
of glass and then they'll
see that there's some type

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.623
of attraction, or they
might see that if they

00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:10.163
do that enough, one of the
objects might discharge

00:01:10.163 --> 00:01:11.829
when it touches another object.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.759
People have observed
things like lightning,

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.055
where it looks like there's
some type of a buildup

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:17.761
and some type of a potential
and then all of a sudden

00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.556
it discharges and you have
this lightning and then this

00:01:20.556 --> 00:01:24.588
thunder blast sound that happens too.

00:01:24.588 --> 00:01:26.640
So this is something
that humans have observed

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.073
for a long long time, and
scientists or people with a,

00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:32.613
I guess you could say a
scientific mind have been trying

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:34.767
to understand it for a long
long time, and trying to come up

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:38.450
with a framework for what
exactly is happening.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.375
Well lucky for us, we now
have a framework for it

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:43.549
that explains it quite well.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.540
And that framework for what is going on

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.491
with that triboelectric effect,

00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.518
is a framework around charge.

00:01:50.518 --> 00:01:54.724
Is a framework that we
now have around charge.

00:01:54.724 --> 00:01:57.792
And this tells us, this way
of looking at the world,

00:01:57.792 --> 00:01:59.844
says look, there's some things

00:01:59.844 --> 00:02:03.054
that just have a property called charge.

00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:05.593
Some things have a positive charge,

00:02:05.593 --> 00:02:07.483
Some things have a positive
charge, and it's somewhat

00:02:07.483 --> 00:02:10.063
of an arbitrary name, we just
happen to call it positive.

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.745
And some things have what we
say is an opposite charge,

00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:16.057
or a negative charge, a negative charge.

00:02:16.057 --> 00:02:18.109
We could have called
this the magenta charge,

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.775
and this the green charge,
we could have called this

00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:22.680
the hippopotamus charge and
this the ostrich charge.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.232
And we could have said that
hippopotami, I believe plural

00:02:26.232 --> 00:02:29.364
for hippopotamus, they're
always attracted to ostriches,

00:02:29.364 --> 00:02:32.859
but they always repel other
hippopotami, and likewise.

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.651
The like charges repel or like hippo...

00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:38.608
You get the general idea.

00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:41.453
But I'll stick to the words
that people are used to using.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:44.135
And so if we say something has a charge,

00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:45.079
say a positive charge,

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.348
and something else has a negative charge,

00:02:47.348 --> 00:02:49.986
then in our framework
that we're setting up,

00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:53.765
these two things are going to attract.

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:56.548
So opposite charges are going to attract,

00:02:56.548 --> 00:02:59.007
while like charges are going to repel.

00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:00.957
So if you have a positive charge,

00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:02.562
and you have a positive charge,

00:03:02.562 --> 00:03:06.097
these things are going to accelerate,

00:03:06.097 --> 00:03:08.921
are going to accelerate
away from each other.

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:10.892
And that's not just true
for positive positive,

00:03:10.892 --> 00:03:14.996
that's also true for
negative and negative,

00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:17.170
these two things are going to repel

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.766
because they are like charges.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.148
Now it's very interesting
to think about this

00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:24.545
because we are so used to
thinking in terms of charge,

00:03:24.545 --> 00:03:26.475
even you know if, especially
in kind of the world

00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:28.913
of electricity you have the
positive and negative terminal.

00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:32.388
You think of charging up
your phone or whatever else.

00:03:32.388 --> 00:03:36.288
That it seems like, we completely,
charge is just something

00:03:36.288 --> 00:03:37.995
that is fundamental about the universe,

00:03:37.995 --> 00:03:40.711
and that's true to some, that's true,

00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:43.724
but you'd have to appreciate
that these are arbitrary words

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:46.406
and they're really just
to describe a property

00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:48.660
that we have observed in the world.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.506
And if you go down to the
atomic level, we can get to

00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:54.431
a fundamental level of where
the charge is happening.

00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:56.626
But once again, these are really models

00:03:56.626 --> 00:04:00.189
for our brain to describe,
these are frameworks and models

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.761
for our brain to be able
to predict and describe

00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:04.996
what we observe in the world.

00:04:04.996 --> 00:04:06.358
But if we run with this model,

00:04:06.358 --> 00:04:08.613
we can imagine at the atomic scale,

00:04:08.613 --> 00:04:13.613
the nuclei of atoms are composed
of protons and neutrons.

00:04:15.907 --> 00:04:20.375
So if you have some
protons, and then you have

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:24.521
some neutrons, I'll do two of
each, you have some neutrons,

00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:29.521
and based on this framework,
protons have a positive charge.

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:31.408
Protons have a positive charge.

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:34.192
Now once again, this convention
of calling them positive

00:04:34.192 --> 00:04:36.466
and putting a plus on it,
it's not like protons have

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:40.145
a little plus sign
tattooed onto them somehow.

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:41.332
We could have called
those, we could have said

00:04:41.332 --> 00:04:44.147
they have a red charge, or
we could have even said,

00:04:44.147 --> 00:04:47.113
we wouldn't of had to
even use the word charge,

00:04:47.113 --> 00:04:50.547
this is just a convention
that we have decided to use.

00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:54.062
And so we say protons have
positive charge and then,

00:04:54.062 --> 00:04:57.313
kind of buzzing around the
nucleus of an atom, you often,

00:04:57.313 --> 00:05:00.746
or usually, or often have electrons.

00:05:00.746 --> 00:05:02.514
Electrons have a lot less mass.

00:05:02.514 --> 00:05:04.484
Mass is another interesting thing.

00:05:04.484 --> 00:05:06.415
We associate mass as just,
oh this is just something

00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:09.015
that we get, we understand
it in our everyday life,

00:05:09.015 --> 00:05:13.282
but even mass, this is
just a property of objects,

00:05:13.282 --> 00:05:15.374
it's just a property of matter,

00:05:15.374 --> 00:05:17.731
and we feel like we understand
it because on our scales

00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:20.596
we understand notions of
things like weight and volume,

00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:22.831
but even mass can get quite exotic.

00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:24.526
But anyway, the whole
point of this video is

00:05:24.526 --> 00:05:26.528
not to talk about mass,
it's to talk about charge.

00:05:26.528 --> 00:05:28.478
But all of these things that
we talk about in physics,

00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:31.242
these are just properties
that will help us deal

00:05:31.242 --> 00:05:35.082
with these notions, these
behaviors in different frameworks.

00:05:35.082 --> 00:05:36.728
But anyway, let's get
back to this little atom

00:05:36.728 --> 00:05:37.601
that I was constructing.

00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.791
So this atom, let's say
it has two electrons,

00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:43.432
and obviously this is not drawn to scale,

00:05:43.432 --> 00:05:46.398
and each of these electrons
have a negative charge,

00:05:46.398 --> 00:05:48.207
and they're kind of jumping around here,

00:05:48.207 --> 00:05:51.478
buzzing around this nucleus of this atom.

00:05:51.478 --> 00:05:54.932
And the reason why, this
model, even going down

00:05:54.932 --> 00:05:56.923
to the atomic scale and thinking
in protons and electrons

00:05:56.923 --> 00:06:00.336
is interesting, is that it
allows us to start explaining

00:06:00.336 --> 00:06:03.993
what is happening in the
triboelectric effect.

00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:06.959
What is happening in the
triboelectric effect is when you

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:09.661
rub that balloon on your
hair, because of the property

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:12.160
of the balloon, the
material of the balloon,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.420
and the materials of your hair,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.350
when they come in contact and they rub,

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.332
the balloon is grabbing
electrons from your hair.

00:06:19.332 --> 00:06:23.416
So the balloon is grabbing
electrons from your hair,

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:26.687
and so it is getting
more negatively charged,

00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:28.841
it is getting more negatively charged,

00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:31.766
and your hair is getting
more positively charged,

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:34.975
or essentially it's lost these electrons.

00:06:34.975 --> 00:06:39.975
And so when you put the
balloon now close to your hair,

00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:43.652
remember like charges repel each other,

00:06:43.652 --> 00:06:46.516
so the electrons in your
hair try to move away

00:06:46.516 --> 00:06:49.043
from these other electrons,
the negative charge tries to

00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:51.494
move away from the negative charge,

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:52.794
and I guess you could say that

00:06:52.794 --> 00:06:57.081
the tips of your hair will
then become more positive.

00:06:57.081 --> 00:06:59.702
Are more positive and
they will be attracted,

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:03.175
and they will be attracted to the balloon.

00:07:03.175 --> 00:07:05.410
So we can think about
what's happening in terms

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.906
of transfer of electrons,
that's exactly what's happening.

00:07:08.906 --> 00:07:10.997
And so when you think
that way, it's like ok,

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:14.838
we are scientists, this is a nice model,

00:07:14.838 --> 00:07:16.504
we can start to think about
what's happening here.

00:07:16.504 --> 00:07:18.861
This model actually explains
a whole ton of behavior

00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:22.553
that we've observed in the
universe, including things like,

00:07:22.553 --> 00:07:25.728
lightning and whatever else,
you know the static shock

00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:27.200
that you get when you
might touch a doorknob

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.320
after rubbing your shoes along the carpet.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.595
But we like to start, we
like to quantify things,

00:07:32.595 --> 00:07:36.171
so we can start seeing how much they repel

00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:38.101
or how much they attract each other.

00:07:38.101 --> 00:07:41.393
And so the fundamental unit of charge,

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:43.445
or one of the fundamental units of charge,

00:07:43.445 --> 00:07:45.862
or I guess you could say the
elementary unit of charge

00:07:45.862 --> 00:07:48.626
is defined in terms of the charge

00:07:48.626 --> 00:07:51.043
of a proton or an electron.

00:07:51.043 --> 00:07:53.330
So the fundamental, or I
guess you could say the

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.504
elementary unit of charge
is denoted by the letter e,

00:07:57.504 --> 00:07:59.739
and this is the charge of a proton,

00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:04.739
this is e for elementary,
charge of proton.

00:08:05.468 --> 00:08:07.317
And the charge of an electron,
even though an electron has a

00:08:07.317 --> 00:08:10.283
much, much, much, much
smaller mass than a proton,

00:08:10.283 --> 00:08:13.209
most of the mass of an atom is

00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:14.753
from the protons and the neutrons.

00:08:14.753 --> 00:08:16.582
So an electron has a
much, much smaller mass

00:08:16.582 --> 00:08:18.227
than the protons and the neutrons,

00:08:18.227 --> 00:08:22.778
but it has the same but
opposite charge as a proton.

00:08:22.778 --> 00:08:26.090
So sometimes the convention
is to write negative e,

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.508
or maybe even negative one
e, sometimes depending on

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.966
whether you view this as a
kind of the actual charge

00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:32.652
or whether you view this as a unit,

00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:34.136
but here I'll view this
as the actual charge.

00:08:34.136 --> 00:08:36.797
You could view negative e as the charge,

00:08:36.797 --> 00:08:40.495
as the charge of an electron.

00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:41.897
And something that has no charge,

00:08:41.897 --> 00:08:43.908
like a neutron, we say they're neutral,

00:08:43.908 --> 00:08:48.642
and actually that is why
they are called neutrons,

00:08:48.642 --> 00:08:51.547
because they are neutral,
they don't have charge.

00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:56.547
So that right over there, that
over there is, is a neutron.

00:08:57.866 --> 00:09:00.507
Now when we start to get
on kind of a larger scale,

00:09:00.507 --> 00:09:02.559
not on a sub-atomic scale anymore,

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:06.297
talking about electrons and
protons, the unit of charge,

00:09:06.297 --> 00:09:09.284
in general the unit of
charge that we typically use

00:09:09.284 --> 00:09:13.815
is the coulomb, is the coulomb.

00:09:13.815 --> 00:09:18.815
Coulomb, it's named for
Charles Augustin de Coulomb,

00:09:18.894 --> 00:09:21.941
so if we're talking
about the guy, and he was

00:09:21.941 --> 00:09:25.314
an 18th Century French physicist,
we would use capital C,

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:26.553
but if we're talking about the units,

00:09:26.553 --> 00:09:31.553
we would use lowercase c,
the coulomb, the coulomb.

00:09:31.836 --> 00:09:35.818
And the coulomb is
defined, so one coulomb,

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:38.567
let me write it right
over here, one coulomb

00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:43.055
and it uses the abbreviation
uppercase C, is equal,

00:09:43.055 --> 00:09:45.062
or I'll say approximately equal to,

00:09:45.062 --> 00:09:48.210
we're going to round here,
it's approximately equal to

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.210
6.24, 6.24 times 10 to the
eighteenth e, or you could say,

00:09:55.444 --> 00:09:58.329
in magnitude wise, it's
equal to the charge

00:09:58.329 --> 00:10:02.250
of 6.24 times 10 to
the eighteenth protons,

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.773
or magnitude wise,

00:10:03.773 --> 00:10:05.397
it would be the opposite if
you're talking about electrons,

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:10.174
it would be 6.24 times 10
to the eighteenth electrons.

00:10:10.174 --> 00:10:11.515
Now if you want to go
the other way around,

00:10:11.515 --> 00:10:14.055
what is the charge of, the
magnitude of the charge

00:10:14.055 --> 00:10:16.574
of say a proton in terms of coulombs,

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:18.341
well you would just take
the inverse of this.

00:10:18.341 --> 00:10:23.341
So you could say that e
is approximately equal to

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.680
the inverse of this which is 1.60,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.390
I guess you could say
the reciprocal of this,

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:34.390
1.60 times 10 to the negative 19,

00:10:34.981 --> 00:10:38.658
times 10 to the negative 19 coulombs.

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:40.670
So hopefully this gives
you an appreciation for,

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.702
I guess at a base level, what charge is.

00:10:42.702 --> 00:10:44.388
And in some ways it's like
it's this everyday thing,

00:10:44.388 --> 00:10:46.237
you're used to it, we're used
to dealing with electricity

00:10:46.237 --> 00:10:48.350
and we'll talk much more
about that in depth.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.255
But at some levels it is this thing,

00:10:51.255 --> 00:10:52.494
one of the mysteries of the universe,

00:10:52.494 --> 00:10:55.704
how did these two particles
know to attract each other,

00:10:55.704 --> 00:10:56.761
you know it looks like
they're at a distance,

00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:59.362
how do they immediately
exert a force on each other.

00:10:59.362 --> 00:11:02.103
how do these particles know
immediately to repel each other,

00:11:02.103 --> 00:11:03.689
it's not like they have
a wire connecting them

00:11:03.689 --> 00:11:05.233
that they're communicating somehow,

00:11:05.233 --> 00:11:07.850
or I guess once you get
to quantum mechanical,

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.865
an argument can be made that
they are communicating somehow.

00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:11.670
But in our everyday,
kind of logical sense,

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.941
it's like well at a distance,

00:11:12.941 --> 00:11:15.345
how do these things actually
know to repel or attract,

00:11:15.345 --> 00:11:16.717
and what is this charge anyway?

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:18.399
You know we've put all
these names around it

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:21.202
but to kind of help us think
about it and have a framework

00:11:21.202 --> 00:11:22.401
and predict what will happen.

00:11:22.401 --> 00:11:26.017
But do we really know
what this charge thing is.

00:11:26.017 --> 00:11:28.171
So on one level it's kind
of plain and mundane,

00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:29.756
and it deals with balloons and hair,

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:31.340
but on another level it's this deep thing

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.932
about this universe, it's
a deep property of matter

00:11:35.932 --> 00:11:40.280
that we can manipulate and we
can predict, but it is still

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.926
this very fundamental and
somewhat mysterious thing.
