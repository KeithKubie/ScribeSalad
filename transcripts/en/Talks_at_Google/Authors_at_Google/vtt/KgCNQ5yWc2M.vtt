FEMALE SPEAKER: Please join me
in welcoming Chris McDougall.

00:00:02.499 --> 00:00:04.057
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.057 --> 00:00:05.640
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
That was great.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.264
Thank you.

00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:08.228
Thank you.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.930
Yeah, thank you so much.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.376
It's really nice to
get a chance to discuss

00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:17.750
this book with
people who already

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.940
know where it came from.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.815
And most of the people
I've been bumping into

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:22.190
are familiar with "Born to Run."

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.350
And that adventure,
"Born to Run,"

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.370
really fed into this one for
a couple different reasons.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.750
One was just the research.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.520
When I first began looking
into the story of "Born to Run"

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.870
I didn't realize there was such
this amazing trove of running

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.490
and physiological history which
had been kind of forgotten,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.600
things about Emil Zatopek,
and Percy Cerutty,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.290
and Arthur Lydiard, all these
great masters of the past

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.430
who had uncovered
this profound wisdom.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.930
And then we forget about it.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.110
And then we try to reinvent
it again and again.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.260
And it was while doing
that research that I first

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.850
heard about the Cretan Runner,
who I originally thought

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.200
was some kind of runner or some
kind of marathoner or ultra

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.000
marathoner, and then
discovered, no, he

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.416
wasn't that kind
of runner at all.

00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:08.811
He was a foot messenger
during World War II.

00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:09.810
It sort of intrigued me.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.018
But it didn't really fit
the scheme of "Born to Run,"

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:13.546
so I put aside.

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:14.920
But then something
else happened.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.800
And if you've read
"Born to Run,"

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.850
you're familiar with
Caballo Blanco, Micah True,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.500
who lived most of his life out
at Matt's home town of Boulder,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.312
that and the Nederland
region, and then

00:01:25.312 --> 00:01:27.020
went down to the Copper
Canyons of Mexico

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.530
to spend his time with
the Tarahumara Indians.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.810
Well, a few years after
the book came out,

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.500
I was in Los Angeles for a
speaking event like this.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.860
And when I arrived
at the venue--

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.880
my phone had died a
couple hours earlier.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.810
The battery had died--
so when I showed up,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.670
the host came up to me
and said, oh, Maria's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.480
been trying to reach you.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.438
Maria Walton's desperately
trying to reach you.

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:47.834
That's Caballo's girlfriend.

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:49.750
So I borrowed her phone
and called Maria back.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.040
And she said, I
think we need help.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.920
Micah's missing.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.732
He went for a run and
he didn't come back.

00:01:54.732 --> 00:01:57.190
And I'm like, well, that's what
the dude does all the time.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.890
It's like the story of his life.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.820
And she said, no, no, he left
Guadajuko tied up overnight.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.520
Now Guadajuko was this
mangy half-coyote mutt

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.960
that Micah had found down
in the Copper Canyons.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.920
This is like a scary,
wild canyon dog.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.565
And naturally, he
adopted it and tried

00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:16.690
to turn it into a pet who
did not want to be a pet.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.181
And it's this, snarly,
mangy, lesioned thing.

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.930
But Caballo treated
this thing like a baby

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.650
and cared for it
down in the canyons.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.300
And wherever he
went-- he actually

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.450
was back in Boulder, Matt.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.310
And you imagine him walking
down the streets of Boulder

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.280
carrying this dog in
his arms like a baby.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.410
And this thing's snarling.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.364
And the one time
he put him down,

00:02:33.364 --> 00:02:35.530
this thing runs in the
street and gets hit by a bus,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.390
breaks its leg.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.140
And so now he's got this
gigantic plaster cast

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.052
on its leg while
Micah-- this thing's

00:02:41.052 --> 00:02:42.510
like the size of
a German shepherd.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.920
He's walking around
with this thing.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.960
He would site down for a
burger and a beer outside.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.770
And he's trying to eat his
burger over the dog's back

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.186
while the dog's
trying to bite it.

00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:50.269
So this is his dog.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.060
But the bond between
them was really tight.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.230
And one thing you
knew for sure was

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.130
that Caballo would
never ever leave

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.350
the dog tied up overnight.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.010
So what Maria told
me had happened was,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.180
in 2013, that race
which he had begun down

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.500
the canyon a few years
before-- and the year we

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.275
went there, the year I wrote
about, seven of us showed up.

00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:11.030
Well, over time,
it began to grow.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.550
It went from seven to
about 15 to about 50,

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.620
until that year, 2013, it
had gone from seven to more

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.970
than 700 runners were turning
up at the bottom of this canyon

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.700
for this crazy
cross country race

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.486
that he had created as a way of
trying to blend the cultures,

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:28.360
trying to bring people
from the outside world

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.193
down to the canyons to
let them realize what

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:32.820
the Tarahumara knew and letting
the Tarahumara know that there

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.120
were people in the outside world
who valued and respected what

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.036
they could do.

00:03:37.036 --> 00:03:38.160
So it's this gigantic race.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.070
And it was Caballo's
masterpiece.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.144
It was, finally, his
dream had come true.

00:03:42.144 --> 00:03:43.310
Everyone's getting together.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.020
They're running, they're
racing, they're drinking,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.686
they're dancing.

00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:47.290
They're having a
big old festival.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.650
And so after the race,
Maria was up in Arizona.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.270
And so Caballo
was driving north.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.707
And he stopped
off in New Mexico.

00:03:53.707 --> 00:03:55.790
He always liked to hang
out in the Gila wilderness

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.320
wherever possible,
because that's

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.960
where Geronimo had run free.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.350
And it was a kind of
spiritual home for Micah.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.130
So he stopped off
at a friend's place,

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.559
tied up Guadajuko,
went for a little run,

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:07.850
expected to be back in an hour.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.016
And then he never came back.

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:12.850
So that was kind of distressing.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.759
Something was definitely wrong.

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.050
So again, I was in Los Angeles.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.959
I called Luis Escobar,
the photographer

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.250
who'd been with us on the trip.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.720
And he lives in Santa Barbara.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.850
And I said, have you
heard about this?

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.940
And I could hear traffic
around him on the phone.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.090
He's like, dude, I'm
already in the car.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.690
I'm coming down.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.340
He goes, where are you?

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.110
I said, I'm in Los Angeles.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.740
He's like, I'll be
there in two hours.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.290
So I came in for the event
like this and said, I can talk.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.331
But I can't answer questions,
because I gotta go.

00:04:33.331 --> 00:04:35.880
So I gave a 1-hour talk, went
out the door, grabbed my bags.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.100
Luis picked me up out front.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.320
And we're on our way
down to New Mexico.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.090
And the whole drive
down-- we finally

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.970
had to yank him out of the front
seat and put him in the back.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.190
Because the dude was driving
and texting and calling.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.240
And he's mounting this all
points bulletin gathering

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.699
people to come for the search.

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.740
And every step along the
way, every couple hours,

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.280
we'd have to pull
over and meet someone

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.738
by the side of the road who
dropped their car, hop in ours,

00:04:55.738 --> 00:04:56.960
and keep going.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.636
And at 2 o'clock in the morning,
we stopped off to get gas.

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:01.010
And I was reaching
for my wallet.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.093
And Luis was like, no,
it's already been paid for.

00:05:03.093 --> 00:05:06.160
Someone had Paypalled him money
to pay for gas on the way down.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.102
So we get down there.

00:05:08.102 --> 00:05:09.685
And even though we
had driven straight

00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:11.351
through like a bullet
through the night,

00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:13.350
we were not the first to arrive.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.690
Other people had come.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.296
Scott Jurek had
flown in from Denver.

00:05:17.296 --> 00:05:20.490
The Scaggs brothers, two ultra
runners who lived in New Mexico

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.899
had driven out there.

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:24.190
A guy from Canada, Simon
Donato, had hopped on a plane.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.740
He was flying down.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.870
The actor Peter Sarsgaard,
who had met Micah one time

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.980
and actually didn't get
along with him at all--

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.290
found him really insulting and
condescending-- he flew out.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.420
So very quickly, out of
the middle of nowhere,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.110
this search party
began to grow and grow.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.144
And I sort took a step
back as it was happening,

00:05:43.144 --> 00:05:45.060
thinking, you know, it's
really kind of weird.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.150
Because this guy did
not try to make friends.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.847
He was a surly-- did you
ever actually meet him, Matt?

00:05:50.847 --> 00:05:51.930
Did you ever run into him?

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.880
AUDIENCE: No, never met him.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.370
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: OK.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.070
But you know the type, right--
the Boulder type, just sort

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.260
of a holier than thou,
ex-hippie kind of dude.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.540
And yet he really
struck things in people

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.720
so much that people who barely
knew him or didn't know,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.260
when they thought he
was in trouble, they all

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.104
came rushing down to help.

00:06:10.104 --> 00:06:11.270
We didn't get there in time.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.690
I don't think there was
any time to get there.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.050
And then, the irony
of it was that he

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.590
been definitively spotted
heading northeast,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.529
into the woods.

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.070
They knew exactly
where he had to be.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.467
There's a quadrant there.

00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:25.050
Absolutely, to a
scientific certainty,

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.680
he had to be in the
northeast quadrant.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.695
And we spent five days
searching that quadrant

00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:30.570
until, finally, somebody
like, you know what,

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.160
if he absolutely has to be
here, then he's probably there.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.118
And he turned around and
went to the southwest,

00:06:35.118 --> 00:06:36.390
and there he was.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.030
He had died by the
side of a creek.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.470
Still unclear why,
exactly what happened.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.150
The autopsy revealed
an enlarged heart,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.530
which really isn't a cause
of death for an ultra runner.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.530
He had an enlarged heart because
he was running like 200 miles

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.050
a week.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.800
But it's more likely
that he had developed

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.250
some kind of parasitic
disease which had

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.000
weakened the walls of his hard.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.290
But again, I was struck
by this thought of,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.820
man, when Simon got on
that plane in Canada,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.320
he had to know that
there was no way

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.778
that this guy was going to be
alive by the time he arrived.

00:07:05.778 --> 00:07:06.780
And yet he want anyway.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.490
And the same with Scott,
when he flew in from Denver,

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.730
he knew that he was not
going to find a living guy.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.950
And yet that need to just move
and do something really stayed

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.390
with me.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.990
And I wanted to find
out more about it.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.490
And that was one
of the things, that

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.590
was one of the impulses
that had me circle back

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.330
to this idea of
the Cretan Runner.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.200
Because one of
the things I never

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.000
really understood about
resistance fighters

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.350
is, why do you bother.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.706
When German forces come
and occupy your country,

00:07:34.706 --> 00:07:35.580
you have two choices.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.940
You can keep your head
down, wait for better days.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.640
Or you can do what these guys
do, which is rush out there

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.380
and fight what you know
is a losing battle.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.820
And then I started to think
about something else, too.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.795
Even physically--
not even mentally,

00:07:48.795 --> 00:07:50.620
why did you make this choice--
but physically, how do you

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.578
actually pull this off?

00:07:51.578 --> 00:07:53.550
Because when I
started to look back

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.550
into this guy known as
the Cretan Runner, George

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.230
Psychoundakis, and questioned
what he did, what he was doing

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.530
was physically impossible.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.620
So let's begin at the
beginning of the story.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.530
So what happened
on Crete was this.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:08.200
When Hitler began
rolling into Poland

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.200
at the beginning of World War
II, what he was up against

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.060
were armed forces across
Western Europe which

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.180
has devoted to previous 30 years
to doing only one thing, which

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.097
was keeping all the
Germans in Germany.

00:08:20.097 --> 00:08:22.180
They know, at some point,
Germany was going to try

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.210
and bust out.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.760
So all that France, and Belgium,
and Luxembourg, and the UK

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.010
were doing was creating
defenses, both physically

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.640
and in terms of manpower, to
just bottle up the Germans.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.514
Because at some point,
you know they're going

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:35.336
to play some shenanigans again.

00:08:35.336 --> 00:08:36.710
So that's what
Hitler was facing.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.650
He was facing an
entire continent

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:39.840
devoted to stopping him.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.510
And they were extremely
effective for like a half

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.270
an hour.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:44.690
And after that he just
blazed on through.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.606
He destroyed every army
in a matter of months.

00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:49.140
I mean, he knocked
over nine major armies

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.340
in a matter of months.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.810
It was an astonishing
military performance.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.180
He was extremely close to
winning the entire war.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.570
All he had to do now, after
Western Europe was conquered,

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.611
is get to Eastern Europe.

00:08:58.611 --> 00:09:00.490
You knock off the
Russians, you win.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.031
There's no way the US is going
to get involved at that point.

00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.020
There's no interest
in the US being

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.675
a combatant in a
war against someone

00:09:06.675 --> 00:09:09.700
who controls all of
Eastern and Western Europe.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.610
But the path to Eastern
Europe leads through Crete.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.590
And Crete is otherwise
pretty insignificant.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.080
It's a small island off the
coast of mainland Greece,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.432
not strong, not big.

00:09:19.432 --> 00:09:20.640
There are no resources there.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.473
The only thing that it
is useful for is it's

00:09:22.473 --> 00:09:24.350
a convenient stepping
stone across the river.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.090
So you step on Crete
on your way there.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.740
It's a nice transit spot.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.820
So you know, Germans had
knocked off France in five days.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.090
So they figure, OK, 24 hours.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.556
We can win, lock down Crete.

00:09:34.556 --> 00:09:36.930
We store all of our equipment,
our supplies, our manpower

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.429
there.

00:09:37.429 --> 00:09:42.120
We use it as our big Costco
warehouse en route to Russia.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.070
So that's what he did.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.970
They launched the biggest air
invasion in military history

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.589
on Create, 80,000 soldiers
dropping from the sky.

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:50.130
So if you were a
Cretan that morning,

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.630
you would notice the
sky getting dark.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.046
And you would look
out and see, it

00:09:53.046 --> 00:09:54.810
was absolutely
blanketed by parachutes

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.560
and gliders and planes coming in
for a quick, massive blitzkrieg

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.200
aerial assault to
conquer the island.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.140
But what the Cretans
did was unique.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.680
Because unlike anywhere
else in the world,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.080
the Cretans resisted
immediately.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.280
It was the only place where
the resistance sprang up

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.026
before the Germans
even hit the ground.

00:10:12.026 --> 00:10:14.150
So these guys were strapping
steak knives on brooms

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.710
and running out the door, as
a unified body, to fight back,

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.660
which sounds
stirring and heroic.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.910
But when you think about it
too, it's such an anomaly.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.070
Because right now, if there's
a big bang outside that door,

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.724
I guarantee you,
all of us are not

00:10:25.724 --> 00:10:26.890
going to react the same way.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:27.230
You know?

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.646
We're not going to grab chairs
and go rushing to the door.

00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:31.150
These guys did.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:35.430
And they put up a fight that was
so determined that the 24 hour

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.550
deadline came and went.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.100
And the Germans could not
get control of the island.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.356
So that was day one through
two, three, four, five.

00:10:42.356 --> 00:10:43.730
Day five, Hitler
sends a telegram

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.355
to Kurt Student, head
of the Luftwaffe,

00:10:45.355 --> 00:10:47.210
and says, what's
going on in Crete.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.420
France fell in five days.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.570
Why is this island with no
standing army still fighting?

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.680
It took Student 10 days
to finally get control

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.040
of the perimeter of the island.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.430
And so what this civilians did
was, OK, you got the perimeter.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.740
We'll head up into
the mountains.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.198
And they went up
into the mountains

00:11:01.198 --> 00:11:02.200
to keep fighting back.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.400
So at that point, Hitler
was out of patience--

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.060
not a particularly patient
man in the first place.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.300
And so he sent this guy along.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.520
This is general Kurt Student--
hang on-- it's General

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.257
Friedrich Mueller.

00:11:13.257 --> 00:11:15.590
I think, around his neck, as
you know, is an iron cross.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.410
I learned the sign language
for badass recently,

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.760
which is this, if you
ever want to know.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.720
But he is a notorious badass.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.770
You win one of those things
for distinguished service

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.679
in the German army, which is
pretty distinguished service.

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:31.720
He was one of Hitler's
most experienced generals.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.890
So he puts him on Crete.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.306
He's like, you know what, no
more messing around on Crete.

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:37.166
You rule this island
with extreme brutality.

00:11:37.166 --> 00:11:39.540
Anybody gets out of line, you
put a bullet in their head.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.600
You see any village
up to any nonsense,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.920
you burn it to the ground.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.200
I want this place secure.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.280
I want to get my troops in,
and out, and off to Moscow.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.960
So that was General
Mueller's mandate.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.210
Do whatever the hell you want.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.460
Ignore the Geneva Conventions.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.940
Control this island
any way you can.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.500
And he had 80,000 armed
troops at his disposal.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.490
But he was up
against forces which

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.660
might be pretty formidable.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.670
Because up against
General Friedrich Mueller,

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.961
who became known as The
Butcher of Crete, was this guy.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.040
That's George.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.730
So George is the guy who
became known as the Cretan

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.900
Runner, George Psychoundakis.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.140
He was a shepherd.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.680
He had never served in
the military at all.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.960
He was pretty small.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.110
He was pretty shabby.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.760
Didn't own a gun.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.000
Had a nickname as well.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.760
The Butcher of
Crete was one guy.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.910
He was up against a
guy known as The Clown.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.600
The Clown got his name because
he liked to play pranks.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.767
He liked the write long rhyming
odes to things, like "Ode

00:12:37.767 --> 00:12:40.690
to an Inkspot on a
Schoolteacher's Skirt."

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.062
But when the war began, George
ran up into the mountains.

00:12:44.062 --> 00:12:46.020
And because he couldn't
really fight, or shoot,

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.832
or anything, he
just ran messages.

00:12:47.832 --> 00:12:50.290
And that was the thing that I
started to really dial in on,

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.190
is, how on earth does
this guy do what he does.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.810
So Matt, you've run
some long races.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.740
Have you run the
London marathon?

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.360
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.315
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
Pretty hard?

00:12:58.315 --> 00:12:58.770
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:12:59.080
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: OK.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.580
Pretty hard.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.648
Did it look like this?

00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:03.790
OK.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.248
This is the kind of landscape
that this guy's operating on.

00:13:06.248 --> 00:13:09.660
So without exaggerating, what
he would do is-- resistance

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.160
would be holed up
in a cave up here.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.540
And they wold say, OK,
tomorrow morning at dawn, we

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.914
are going to go
down to the coast

00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:16.227
and blow up some German ships.

00:13:16.227 --> 00:13:17.060
Tell the other guys.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.334
He'd say, OK.
[RUNNING SOUND EFFECT]

00:13:19.334 --> 00:13:21.250
Tomorrow at dawn, we
blow up the German ships.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.040
Ah, dawn's early.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:22.840
Tell them 9:00.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.280
OK, 9:00.
[RUNNING SOUND EFFECT] Nine.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.180
And so back and forth,
back and forth, that's

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.346
the only way to communicate.

00:13:28.346 --> 00:13:30.450
No radios, no walkie talkies.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.490
Only George running up
and down these mountains.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.216
A typical journey for
George, because he

00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:37.340
wanted to spread the
resistance as far as possible,

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.090
would be 50 miles.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.840
50-mile trek, deliver a message,
get a reply, 50 miles back.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.740
Two ultras, one weekend, no
aid stations, no Clif Bars,

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.260
no Powerade, no little
silvery blanket at the end.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.722
On top of it,
remember, you've got

00:13:50.722 --> 00:13:52.180
a guy called The
Butcher who's been

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.397
told to put a bullet in
your head if he sees you.

00:13:54.397 --> 00:13:55.730
So you're staying off the trail.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.521
You're going off-trail
as much as possible.

00:13:57.521 --> 00:13:59.430
You're trying to be invisible.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.200
So these 50 miles are 50 rugged
trail miles with no ground

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.780
support whatsoever.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.590
Again, you're a fit dude, Matt.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.114
If I asked you to do this,
you'd tell me to go fuck myself.

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:11.090
AUDIENCE: I wouldn't use
that language though.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.310
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
You'd say no way.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.120
No way am I doing double ultras
in a weekend with no support

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.710
and no navigation skills.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.480
And yet this guy did this
again, and again, and again.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.790
And he not only pulled it off,
but he survived and thrived.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.140
And the common story about
him is he'd burst into cave.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.639
He'd have a smile on his face.

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:28.680
He'd deliver the message.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.720
He'd have a little shot of
moonshine and be on his way

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.120
again.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.560
Not only is the guy doing
it, but it doesn't seem

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.400
to be having any physical toll.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.090
So you come across an outlier
like this, it's only one

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.060
of two possibilities.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.802
Either this dude is
Wolverine, you know,

00:14:40.802 --> 00:14:43.662
with a titanium spine,
and regenerates cells,

00:14:43.662 --> 00:14:45.370
and there's nothing
to be learn from him.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.107
Or he is just a normal dude,
which he seems to look like,

00:14:49.107 --> 00:14:51.440
who has learned something
that the rest of us can learn.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.110
And that became
my question-- what

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.020
exactly is this guy up to that's
different than the rest of us?

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.540
So again, the fact that
this happened on Crete

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.160
was not a coincidence.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.240
Crete is one of these places,
much of the Copper Canyons,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.930
which has remained
frozen in time.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.540
It has tapped into a way of life
dating back thousands of years

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.310
that the rest of us have
moved beyond but they've never

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.290
forgotten.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.770
And the thing about Crete is,
because it was this isolated

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.930
island that was constantly
under occupation and invasion

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.380
by outside forces, these
guys were basically still

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.840
doing the same
things in the 1940s

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.960
that they were doing
back in the 1440s.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.640
They had essentially
never changed,

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.130
the same kinds of traditions.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.110
And the main tradition was
this Greek art of the hero.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.770
All the stuff we read about
Greek folklore and mythology,

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.400
these were not fantasy stories.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.730
These were kind of
like survival tips.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.550
This is how you survive
in ancient Greece.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.470
And the whole idea
of those Greek myths

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.001
is to tell people
that you can actually

00:15:48.001 --> 00:15:49.500
do a lot more than
you think you can

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.920
if you learn these techniques.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.050
So the art of the hero,
again, was not this thing

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.840
like picking the right guide.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.636
The art of the hero was
assuming everybody's capable

00:15:58.636 --> 00:16:00.010
and figuring out
what they can do

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.468
and trying to raise
up their level.

00:16:01.468 --> 00:16:03.270
So what am I talking about?

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.810
One thing in particular
was strength.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.340
We have this notion, now, of
strength being about size.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:08.840
Right?

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.040
You go to the gym, you
press some weights.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.380
You keep doing this even though
there's no reason whatsoever

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.242
that you would ever
have to do this.

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:18.700
Yet you go to any
gym in the world,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.241
I guarantee you'll
see somebody doing

00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:21.637
this for absolutely no reason.

00:16:21.637 --> 00:16:24.220
You will never in your life have
to do this other than picking

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.690
up your groceries, maybe.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.040
And yet people are always
doing this all the time.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.370
Yet it serves no purpose.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.040
We've also got
this sense, again,

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.107
bigger, bulkier, more
muscled is stronger.

00:16:34.107 --> 00:16:36.440
Yet if you were trying to
survive out in the wilderness,

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.659
I have to ask you a question.

00:16:37.659 --> 00:16:40.200
Would you want a guy who looks
like The Rock to be out there?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:45.315
Or would you want someone
who looks more like this?

00:16:45.315 --> 00:16:45.981
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:49.348
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:49.348 --> 00:16:50.791
-Don't know why my legs hurt.

00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:52.234
It's not even that long.

00:16:52.234 --> 00:16:55.120
-Why wasn't he just scared
to do it [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.470
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.970
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: So those
are Fizz, Anti, and Shirley.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.680
They actually train here, in
London, over at The Chainstore.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.220
They're part of an
all-female parkour crew.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.589
But what I think was really
intriguing about this is,

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:10.760
you know, parkour developed from
this thing called the natural

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.359
method that began
back in the 1900s.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.365
And where it sprang
from was, there

00:17:15.365 --> 00:17:18.050
was a French naval officer
named Georges Hebert who

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.930
was stationed on
a troop ship just

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.640
off the island of Martinique.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.819
And when the volcano on the
island began to explode,

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.460
Georges Hebert hops
in his life raft.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.084
And he starts steaming
in towards shore

00:17:27.084 --> 00:17:28.319
trying to save lives.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.387
And what he saw were
tens of thousands

00:17:30.387 --> 00:17:32.470
of people-- one of the
greatest natural disasters,

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.470
at that time, in history--
tens of thousands

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.080
of people dying
right in front of him

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.360
because they just couldn't do a
couple of simple, basic animal

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.675
movements-- a movement that
any kind of little dog,

00:17:41.675 --> 00:17:43.820
or kitten, or cat
could do, but humans

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.470
couldn't do it-- like
swim a few yards offshore,

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.060
or pull themselves up off the
ground, or pick up a child.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.060
Any cat can pick up a
kitten and run for it.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.210
Yet humans trying to
pick up a 40-pound child

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.760
were struggling, not because
the weight was very much.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.020
I could give you a
40-pound box, you'd

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.144
pick it up with no problem.

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:01.990
But a 40-pound kid,
they're awkwardly balanced

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.290
and they don't have handles.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.450
They're difficult to grip.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.090
So if you haven't done it, for
the first time, it's awkward.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.900
So what Georges
Hebert is looking at,

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.870
again, are these
needless deaths.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.860
And he's asking himself,
what has gone wrong with us,

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.820
as a species, where we cannot
even save ourselves with very

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.170
simple motions?

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.964
So he went back to
France after this.

00:18:22.964 --> 00:18:24.130
And he decided to do a test.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.550
He took a bunch of his
fellow naval officers

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.700
and he decided to test them
in some basic human movements,

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.170
basic human animal movements.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.930
And he identified 10 movements.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.330
Can you run, walk, and hike?

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:35.720
Can you throw and catch?

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.380
Can you defend?

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.560
Can you pursue?

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.480
Can you climb?

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.042
Can you leap?

00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:39.750
And can you land?

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.000
Things like that.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.890
And he tested his
naval officers,

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.950
guys who were supposed
to be physically

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.920
fit and ready to
defend the nation.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.450
And he found that most of them
could barely do at least half

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.060
of the movements.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.630
And the ones who could do them
couldn't do them well at all.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.760
So he began to train them.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.960
What he decided to do was strip
them right down to basics.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.520
And by strip them,
being French, he really

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.436
meant strip them down.

00:19:01.436 --> 00:19:03.260
He had them in these
little thongy things.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.870
And he created these big
outdoor obstacle courses,

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.380
the kinds of things you
see now with Spartan races.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.510
And he turned it into play.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:13.080
The number one rule of
parkour is no competition.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.280
You can never win.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.430
No parkour games.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.670
No competition.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.520
Secondly, it's got
to be outdoors.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.340
Thirdly, it's got to
be in all conditions.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.177
You don't do parkour
on a sunny afternoon.

00:19:22.177 --> 00:19:24.510
You do it at 3:00 in the
morning, you do it in the rain,

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.830
you do it in the
snow-- any conditions.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:30.720
And the last thing was, always
and ultimately collaborative.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.040
The goal is to help other
people, to push them along.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.200
And what you saw in that
video right there, to me,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.730
is exactly what Georges
Hebert was talking about.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.300
We've developed this
unfortunate inflated notion

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.340
of what strength is.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.720
And it all sort of dates
back to the unfortunate debut

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.090
of this film in 1972
called "Pumping Iron."

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.400
You guys ever seen
"Pumping Iron?"

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.900
If you haven't seen it, or
even if you have seen it,

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.745
it is a crazy psychodrama.

00:19:55.745 --> 00:19:56.870
You've got to check it out.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.381
It is a bizarre movie.

00:19:58.381 --> 00:20:00.630
You saw two things there
which we'd never seen before.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.800
One was these dudes
in panties and oil

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.480
just all conspiring
behind each other's backs

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.350
about how they hate
each other and about

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.420
how they're going to beat each
other and sort of whispering.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.110
And it's a little
like a cat fight

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.010
among giant, inflated humans.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.760
But the second thing
you saw was something

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.190
we'd never seen before,
which is the largest

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.670
humans in human history.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.600
I think nobody had ever
been the size of all

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.530
those guys for a simple reason.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.210
We just never had the
technology before.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.790
We never actually had drugs.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.680
And so by the time
we had synthesized

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.580
testosterone and created
anabolic steroids,

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.800
we now had the drugs which
could supersize humans.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.110
You combine that
with this exercise

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.710
we talk about now, too,
where you isolate a muscle.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.556
And you just keep
doing repetitive motion

00:20:43.556 --> 00:20:44.555
until that muscle tears.

00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:48.500
And when it tears, it will swell
with blood to immobilize it.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.800
So what we created were these
gigantic immobile people

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.300
with damaged muscles.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.090
Again, the way you get big is
you shoot something, isolate

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.690
something, and damage it.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.539
And it will swell with blood.

00:20:59.539 --> 00:21:02.080
So we created the opposite of
what we should have been doing.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.038
We were trying to get
people like Fizz and Anti

00:21:04.038 --> 00:21:07.600
and Shirley who could move,
and adapt, and flow, and laugh

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.870
while they're doing it.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.050
And instead, we created
these big immobile creatures,

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.012
which, in a natural
survival setting,

00:21:15.012 --> 00:21:16.720
is exactly the opposite
of what you want.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.780
You take someone like
The Rock or Arnold

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.990
and you put them in the
jungle, they become lunch.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.670
You're big and
immobile, you're dead.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.030
Something's going to eat you.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.380
But if you put someone
like Fizz and Anti

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.440
and Shirley in the jungle,
I'd say my money's on them

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.260
to actually get out of there
and get out of there alive.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:30.730
They're quick.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:31.380
They can adapt.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.052
They can adjust to any
kinds of circumstances.

00:21:34.052 --> 00:21:35.510
So what Georges
Hebert wanted to do

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:40.290
was reverse this idea
of muscular strength

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.150
as being the gold
standard and get back

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.550
to the natural idea of
suppleness and adaptability.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.060
The only problem was
he developed this just

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.900
before the beginning
of World War I.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.820
So all these people he
trained in the natural method

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.389
were obviously fantastic
as front line soldiers.

00:21:55.389 --> 00:21:56.930
So they all got into
the front lines.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.330
His entire teaching
class got wiped out.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.300
And the natural method
that Georges Hebert

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.170
debuted in the early 1900s
was essentially gone.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.550
But little vestiges lived on.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:12.506
And there's a guy named
Erwan Le Corre who I heard

00:22:12.506 --> 00:22:13.630
about a couple years later.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.530
And he went down to-- and that's
a cool female parkour crew.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.240
So Erwan Le Corre--
hang on a second.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.224
Hang on.

00:22:21.224 --> 00:22:24.920
Hang on-- he read up
on Georges Hebert.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.750
And this is a guy selling
trinkets and glow necklaces

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.364
on beaches in Corsica.

00:22:30.364 --> 00:22:32.280
But he became intrigued
by the natural method.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.280
And so he went down to
Brazil and hooked up

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.930
with mixed martial
arts fighters.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.100
And they basically
camped out in the woods

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.492
and started exploring Georges
Hebert's old techniques,

00:22:41.492 --> 00:22:43.950
trying to figure out whether
they could actually bring them

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:44.930
back to life.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.060
And this is Erwan in action.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.530
And the kind of these he's
doing right now-- he's

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:50.410
a well built guy.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.970
But he's not particularly big
or muscular, but extraordinarily

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.772
adept and agile.

00:22:55.772 --> 00:22:58.230
So I met him and trained with
him in the woods for a while.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.970
And what I began to
realize is this idea

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.020
of how the Cretan Runner
was able to survive

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.850
in the mountains
began to make sense.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.780
Because what Erwan
is doing is just

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.580
using all of the
elastic recoil strength,

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.600
all the elasticity
of his body as

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.009
opposed to using muscular force,
which is a big energy drain.

00:23:16.009 --> 00:23:17.800
You can see how relaxed
he is at all times,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.370
just flowing across
his landscape.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.845
And so what I think
the Cretan Runner would

00:23:22.845 --> 00:23:25.450
have been able to do, what
the Cretan resistance was

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.740
able to do, was tap
into this legacy

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.350
of elastic recoil strength,
the same thing a boxer uses

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.630
when he's in the ring, real
light, and loose, and bouncy.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:37.860
And that was what made the
difference between death

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.060
and survival was adapting
to the landscape as opposed

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.100
to trying to dominate
it and overcome it.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.930
So my question then was,
well, how can the rest of us

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:46.430
learn this.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.090
And what's the benefit of this?

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.520
The second thing, too-- so
that was the strength element--

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.320
the second thing had to
do with energy input.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.610
So even if you are as skillful
as Erwan and the parkour girls,

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.020
the question then is, well,
how do you fuel this thing.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.603
And it led me down
another avenue too,

00:24:04.603 --> 00:24:07.710
looking at, fat is
fuel, fat adaptation.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.257
So most of us are on
this constant sugar cycle

00:24:10.257 --> 00:24:11.590
whether we call it sugar or not.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.173
But you get up in the morning,
you have a bagel, that's sugar.

00:24:14.173 --> 00:24:18.170
If you have salad dressing
on your salad at lunch,

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.370
that's sugar.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.640
Bowl of pasta, rice,
bread-- that's all sugar.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.180
These are fast-burn fuels
that go through your body

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.074
very quickly.

00:24:25.074 --> 00:24:26.490
If you do a marathon
and you start

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.200
taking any kinds of those goos,
that in just a pure sugar shot.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.570
That is a Mars
bar to your belly.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.070
So most of us, all the time,
we are constantly replenishing.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.480
We are on a three
to four hour cycle

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.100
of throwing things down our hole
in order to fuel the furnace.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.560
But I met a guy
named Tim Noakes.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.060
Does anybody know
who Tim Noakes is?

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.351
You must-- you don't know that?

00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:49.520
So Time Noakes is a sport
scientist from South Africa.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.550
He's the guy who created the
whole carbohydrate loading

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.170
model in the first place.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.820
Back in the '70s, he
was studying the data.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.040
And he realized that the best
way to perform endurance sports

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.512
was to load up on
carbohydrates, fast-burn fuel.

00:25:02.512 --> 00:25:04.720
And then the next day, you'd
be able to just burn out

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.740
all this fuel.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.150
So all of these
pasta dinners you

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.390
have before a marathon,
and the pancake breakfast,

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.170
and the oatmeal, that is
all because of Tim Noakes.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.740
It became worldwide.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:17.210
It became a keystone of
all endurance sports.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.130
You gotta carbo-load.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:23.080
The problem was Tim Noakes,
about four years ago,

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.230
suddenly realized that after
running 70 marathons and 15

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.559
Comrades ultramarathons,
he was diabetic,

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:31.600
which really alarmed him.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.920
Because his dad had died
of diabetes and his brother

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.020
had died of diabetes.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.061
And he's like, I am the
fittest guy in the world,

00:25:37.061 --> 00:25:39.380
I am the most esteemed
sports scientist,

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.915
and I am dying of diabetes.

00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:42.975
So he went back
into the research.

00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:45.667
He spent two years
analyzing nutritional data.

00:25:45.667 --> 00:25:47.250
And then he called
a press conference.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.270
And keeping in
mind, this guy has

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.103
written a book called
"The Lore of Running."

00:25:50.103 --> 00:25:52.810
He is the go-to researcher
for sports scientists

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.540
around the world and he has
been for more than 40 years.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.850
He calls a press conference.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:58.516
And he gets in front
of the microphones.

00:25:58.516 --> 00:26:01.560
And he goes, I've
hurt a lot of people.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.680
I may have kill people.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.370
And I'm very, very
sorry, I was wrong.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.770
And what he was wrong
about was carbohydrates.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.373
He realized that
the very thing he'd

00:26:09.373 --> 00:26:10.560
been telling people
they needed to eat

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.650
was the absolute worst
thing they could be eating.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.100
It was a poison.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.760
He had prescribed
this for years.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.660
And now he was paying
the price for it.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.230
And since then, he's
become one of the world's

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.750
most aggressive and
zealous spokespeople

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.390
against this
constant sugar cycle,

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.305
not only because it
damages lives, but also

00:26:29.305 --> 00:26:30.680
because it's the
opposite of what

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.280
we were trying to accomplish.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.432
What George Psychoundakis
was able to do up

00:26:34.432 --> 00:26:36.640
in the mountains-- at one
point, George Psychoundakis

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.175
went for three days on a
diet of only boiled hay.

00:26:40.175 --> 00:26:42.440
He put hay in water,
and he boiled it,

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.440
and he drank the water.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.749
Well, there are no
calories in boiled hay.

00:26:45.749 --> 00:26:46.290
It's nothing.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:47.290
He just drank some brown water.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:48.039
That's all he did.

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:50.790
Yet for three days, this guy is
running through the mountains.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.060
I ask Tim Noakes about this.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.434
And he said, yeah,
the reason why

00:26:53.434 --> 00:26:55.780
is because you have
enough stored fat

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.330
on your body to go for weeks
without another bite of food.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.484
You could put a guy on
a raft in the Atlantic

00:27:01.484 --> 00:27:02.650
and then set him off to sea.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:04.040
And then three months
later, they'll rescue him.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.150
And he's pretty much fine.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.899
He'll be pretty skinny,
but he'll be fine.

00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:08.690
He'll be able to stand
up and walk around.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.570
And the reason is just that.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.354
Your body, at all times,
is making a quick choice.

00:27:13.354 --> 00:27:15.020
It's either going to
burn what's readily

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.825
available in an
emergency situation

00:27:16.825 --> 00:27:18.450
or, if there's no
emergency, it'll say,

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.080
OK, we'll store this for later.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.330
Let's use the body fat that
we've already got here.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.320
We don't need the
quick burn stuff.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.980
So let's leave that for later.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.780
Your body's going to go to
whatever it needs in a crisis.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.530
So if you go out for a run
and there's sugar available

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.350
and your heart rate
starts to go up,

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.220
your body interprets this
as an emergency situation.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.450
OK, my heart rate's going up.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.960
Somebody must be chasing me.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.940
What can I burn really quick
that will get me some energy?

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:42.800
Oh, there's some sugar here.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.630
Let's burn the sugar.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:44.230
And that's what happens.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.688
So we're on a
constant sugar cycle.

00:27:45.688 --> 00:27:47.410
And then when the
sugar is depleted,

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.657
your body is thinking,
OK, you know what, we just

00:27:49.657 --> 00:27:50.740
went through an emergency.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.750
We don't know when the next
emergency's going to arrive.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:53.640
Let's store this fat.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.870
Let's not use this fat.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.170
Let's look for some more sugar.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:58.350
And your body starts
to crave that sugar.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.140
So what guys like Tim Noakes
did was go back in the research.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.970
And they realized that,
throughout history,

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:07.240
endurance athletes have
found effective ways

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.730
of training their bodies to
burn fat first, sugar last.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.810
And it's called fat adaptation.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.250
And so Noakes went back to
a guy named Phil Maffetone.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:15.880
Crazy story.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.380
It's too long to
get into right now.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.980
But Phil Maffetone was this
chiropractor from upstate New

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.145
York who became
the go-to trainer

00:28:22.145 --> 00:28:24.700
for the top Ironman
triathletes in the world, guys

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.270
like Mark Allen and Mike Pigg.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.970
And the reason why
was because this

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:32.154
is predating all of the
endurance products we have now.

00:28:32.154 --> 00:28:33.820
So if you're doing
an Ironman and you're

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.907
looking at like 12
hours of effort,

00:28:35.907 --> 00:28:37.240
well, you didn't have Clif bars.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.372
You didnt' have power bars.

00:28:38.372 --> 00:28:39.830
So what are these
guys going to do?

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:41.560
So they became fat adapted.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.400
And these guys set records
back in the late '80s and '90s

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.280
which weren't broken
for the next 15 years.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.565
Nobody could touch these guys.

00:28:47.565 --> 00:28:48.940
Because the stuff
they were doing

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.240
on body fat was
superior to what anybody

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.190
was doing on the sugar cycle.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:57.760
What Noakes found most
compelling about becoming

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.660
fat adapted is it
begins to reverse

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.060
metabolic syndrome, which
is one of the biggest

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.760
killers in the Western world.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.550
Metabolic syndrome is where
your body is no longer

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:08.870
processing the sugars anymore.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.420
And your insulin
levels are spiking.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:14.880
And that causes diabetic
related illnesses.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.012
So he became a firm
believer in this.

00:29:17.012 --> 00:29:18.470
But again, where
I became intrigued

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.620
was all these pieces
of the puzzle started

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.160
to come together for me.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.077
I began to see how a guy like
Psychoundakis could physically,

00:29:26.077 --> 00:29:28.160
with the strength, run
through the mountains using

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.220
the same kind of natural
method activities

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.450
as Erwan Le Core
and Georges Hebert.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.230
I started to see this
whole fat adaptation

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.860
model where you get
off the sugar cycle

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.640
and you get onto a fat model.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.620
When I actually
met Noakes in DC--

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.582
the dude's pushing
70 years old--

00:29:42.582 --> 00:29:44.290
and I offered to take
him out for lunch--

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:45.880
and he'd just come out of
a long conference, three

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.130
hours of talking-- and I
offered to take him to lunch.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.588
And he was like,
no, no, that's OK.

00:29:49.588 --> 00:29:50.330
I ate yesterday.

00:29:53.204 --> 00:29:53.870
What'd you have?

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.828
He said, oh, you Americans
have the best bacon.

00:29:55.828 --> 00:29:57.790
I ate a lot of bacon
and sausages and eggs.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:58.630
And that was it.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.640
He hadn't eaten in 48 hours,
wasn't hungry, didn't care.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.015
He was about to get on a plane
to Cape Town, didn't care.

00:30:03.015 --> 00:30:06.682
But that's how slow his
metabolic cycle was, how slowly

00:30:06.682 --> 00:30:08.880
he was processing his foods.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.400
So where this left me was
with an adventure story,

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.046
looking at something that
The Clown and his colleagues

00:30:16.046 --> 00:30:17.420
on Crete did which
had never been

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.760
done anywhere else in the world
in modern military history.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.660
These guys came up with
a perfectly brilliant

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.280
ancient Greek
strategy of, you know

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.544
what, if we can't
defeat 80,000 soldiers,

00:30:28.544 --> 00:30:30.210
maybe we've just got
to get one of them.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.390
You know, it's a very
Trojan Horse kind of thing.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.770
Let's just use our brains and
then reverse the whole power

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:36.860
dynamic.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.510
So they decided to do something
which had never been done.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:41.220
They decided they
would go and grab

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.840
the commanding
general on the island.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.660
Let's go kidnap
The Butcher and go

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.590
on the run, which is a
really fucking stupid idea.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:51.480
Because you're on an island.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.904
There is nowhere to go.

00:30:52.904 --> 00:30:54.820
And on top of that, the
reason why nobody ever

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.190
tried this before is, to
actually get at this guy,

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.380
you've got to get your way
through 80,000 soldiers,

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.200
grab him, get him back
through 80,000 soldiers.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.390
And then you're running.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:04.350
And where do you run?

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.910
Because you have
planes overhead.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:07.385
You have boats
circling the island.

00:31:07.385 --> 00:31:08.260
You have search dogs.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.550
You have troops fanning out.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.860
You got Hitler, who's
already pissed off at Crete

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.559
and done with the nonsense.

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:15.350
That's the situation
you put yourself into.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:16.360
And that's what
these guys tried.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.651
And that's what they attempted.

00:31:17.651 --> 00:31:20.960
And where it left them
was, at the end of the war

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.460
when General Wilhelm
Keitel, who was

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.370
the architect of the
German war machine,

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.320
was on trial at Nuremberg,
before they took him

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.030
out and hanged him
for war crimes,

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:32.500
they asked him to make
a final statement.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:37.700
And he said, if it wasn't
for what happened on Crete,

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.290
I wouldn't be
sitting here today.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:40.800
Other people would
be in this chair.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.310
It's because of the
Greek resistance

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.042
that we lost the war.

00:31:44.042 --> 00:31:45.000
He didn't blame Hitler.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.833
Didn't blame Stalin.

00:31:45.833 --> 00:31:46.840
Didn't blame Churchill.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.950
Didn't blame the
invasion of Normandy.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.540
The people he blamed
were those guys

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.581
who tapped into that
ancient art of the hero that

00:31:52.581 --> 00:31:54.810
were able to tap
into these resources

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.834
and hold up the Germans just
long enough so that by the time

00:31:58.834 --> 00:32:00.750
they finally got off
Crete and finally started

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.291
heading into Russia,
it was too late.

00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:03.980
It had already started to snow.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.070
The winter had come down.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:06.486
And as you know,
in Russia, you've

00:32:06.486 --> 00:32:08.150
got to get in and
out before winter.

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:10.450
The Germans were
just a step too late.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:12.870
And they lost the war.

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.610
You know, when we
ask ourselves, why

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.630
does any of this
stuff matter, there

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.774
are no Germans outside
invading-- but to me,

00:32:18.774 --> 00:32:20.940
the reason why it's important
is because-- you know,

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.011
imagine you can go through
life one of two ways.

00:32:23.011 --> 00:32:25.510
You can be sort of sedentary
and, I'm going to get in shape,

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:26.880
I'm going to get ready.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.490
Or you can be the kind of person
that is ready all the time.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:32.530
And that were Georges Heberts
thought is, be useful.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.580
If you could only accomplish
one thing in your life,

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.904
it's just to be useful.

00:32:36.904 --> 00:32:39.320
If you need to do something,
if someone's counting on you,

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.236
can you actually stand
up on your own two feet

00:32:41.236 --> 00:32:42.610
and step in there and help?

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.080
And that, to me, was what
the real crowning achievement

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.657
of Crete was-- not that they
killed Germans, not that they

00:32:47.657 --> 00:32:48.740
ran through the mountains.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.750
But the fact was that
they knew themselves.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:53.230
And in a crisis, and
when someone needed them,

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.380
they could actually step
forward and be useful.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.539
Guys, I know that was a
long burst of information.

00:32:58.539 --> 00:32:59.830
So I appreciate your attention.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.170
And I'd be happy to take
any of your questions.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:02.140
Thanks very much.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:02.640
Thanks.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.965
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.740
MALE SPEAKER: Let's
ask questions.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.933
Could you unplug the-- I think
there's some sound if you

00:33:12.933 --> 00:33:13.920
unplug this sometimes.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.114
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: Sure.

00:33:15.114 --> 00:33:18.066
MALE SPEAKER: And
who's got questions?

00:33:18.066 --> 00:33:19.050
No questions at all.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:21.350
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
Strangely incurious for Google.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.630
MALE SPEAKER: Let's swap mikes,
because this one is fine.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.005
CHRISTOPHER
MCDOUGALL: All right.

00:33:24.005 --> 00:33:26.684
It's a strangely
incurious crowd.

00:33:26.684 --> 00:33:27.850
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:28.240
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
There you go.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.598
Verity stepping up.

00:33:29.598 --> 00:33:30.076
AUDIENCE: It's a
really quick one.

00:33:30.076 --> 00:33:30.554
CHRISTOPHER
MCDOUGALL: All right.

00:33:30.554 --> 00:33:32.679
AUDIENCE: I'd just like to
understand what happened

00:33:32.679 --> 00:33:34.380
to The Clown in the end.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.250
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
Oh, you know something?

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.625
I have a little
slide about that.

00:33:36.625 --> 00:33:38.700
It's really-- see if
I can find it here.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.480
That's what happened
to The Clown.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.990
But the fact was-- you
know what though, if you're

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.610
going to go out, have a little
monument to you for what you

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:46.572
did.

00:33:46.572 --> 00:33:48.280
There's a lot more
about him in the book,

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.655
so I won't go into
that in depth.

00:33:49.655 --> 00:33:54.124
But the guy went out in
a blaze of glory, yeah.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:58.780
MALE SPEAKER: In
researching the book,

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.577
did you learn anything
which you've now taken on

00:34:02.577 --> 00:34:05.994
and do daily?

00:34:05.994 --> 00:34:08.219
What's the biggest thing
you've taken away from it?

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:10.177
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
My favorite thing I took

00:34:10.177 --> 00:34:11.304
away is this.

00:34:11.304 --> 00:34:13.389
This is Colette.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.465
She's a middle school
science teacher in Florida.

00:34:15.465 --> 00:34:17.840
When we start talking about
natural movement, one of them

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.040
is throwing.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.750
And one thing we all know about
throwing is half of the species

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:22.769
can't do it.

00:34:22.769 --> 00:34:24.310
Do we know which
half that is Verity,

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.588
which half of the
species cannot throw?

00:34:26.588 --> 00:34:30.540
AUDIENCE: Um, is this
a diversity issue?

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.260
MALE SPEAKER: Is
it the male half?

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.510
AUDIENCE: Is it the male half?

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.270
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: Is it?

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.100
Are you asking me or
are you telling me?

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.360
AUDIENCE: I'm asking.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.193
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
Well, I'm asking you.

00:34:39.193 --> 00:34:41.060
AUDIENCE: I'm telling you.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.726
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
Who cannot throw?

00:34:42.726 --> 00:34:44.550
AUDIENCE: The male half.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:46.980
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: You
ever see a female NFL player?

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.850
Anyway, I'm taunting
you a little bit.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:51.870
We have this whole conception
that girls can't throw-- throw

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.560
like a girl, girls
can't throw-- which

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.580
really flies in the face of what
natural movement's all about.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.380
As Georges Hebert
said, if it's natural,

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.460
then everybody's got to do it,
men and women, old and young

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:01.650
alike.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:03.400
It's not natural if only
half the species can do it.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.820
So why is it that we have this
conception that girls can't

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.130
throw, old people can't throw?

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.380
And the reason why throwing
is so important-- you guys

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.449
are in for another 45
minutes by the way--

00:35:11.449 --> 00:35:13.740
the reason why throwing is
so important-- it's probably

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.099
the most important movement
ever in human history.

00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:18.390
Like, the reason why you guys
have your jobs here today

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.950
is because some caveman picked
up a rock and hit an antelope.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.460
Like, that was the beginning
of all creative imagination.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.670
Because we're the only
creatures that can do this.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.450
You can pick up a rock.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.250
And it's one thing if the
antelope is right there

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.950
and you [CLUNKING SOUND].

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:30.120
OK, that's pretty easy.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.369
But if the antelope has other
plans for the afternoon,

00:35:32.369 --> 00:35:35.460
like, takes off, now suddenly,
the next thing you've got to do

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.884
is calculate a ton of
variables like that.

00:35:37.884 --> 00:35:39.800
You've got to figure out
velocity, and weight,

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:43.260
and texture, and force.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.725
Hey guys.

00:35:45.725 --> 00:35:48.100
When you have a chance to read
"Natural Born Heroes," two

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.420
of the gentleman
who probably do not

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.920
want to be pointed
to at this moment

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.470
are Chris and Pete White,
who just arrived now.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:56.890
You've got to pick up this
rock and then do something.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.900
You have to throw not
where the antelope is,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.200
but where the antelope is not.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.870
You have to think
into the future.

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:04.740
You have to actually make that
active, creative imagination,

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.910
creating a reality
in your mind that

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.587
doesn't exist yet in the world.

00:36:08.587 --> 00:36:09.920
And that led to everything else.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.300
That created language, and
literature, and technology,

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.399
and engineering.

00:36:13.399 --> 00:36:14.940
So I became really
intrigued by this.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.100
So again, if throwing so
fundamentally important,

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:18.850
what has happened?

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:20.391
So that's one of
the things I started

00:36:20.391 --> 00:36:23.780
practicing was-- I saw these
videos of Colette chucking

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.580
knives.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.179
And she set this
up in her kitchen.

00:36:26.179 --> 00:36:27.970
So when she was doing
the dishes and stuff,

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:31.081
she would just grab steak knives
and just start winging them.

00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:33.580
But I became intrigued by, first
of all, how relaxed she is.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.580
She's spinning around,
flinging her hair

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.162
and having a good time,
chucking underhand, and sidearm,

00:36:38.162 --> 00:36:39.120
and that kind of thing.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.952
That's a dangerous look.

00:36:46.952 --> 00:36:48.660
And so that's what I
started to research.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.365
So yes, if I learned
something-- so one thing

00:36:50.365 --> 00:36:51.930
I started getting into is this
whole thing about throwing.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.070
So I started practicing
throwing knives myself.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.410
And you do this whole
thing of no-spin technique.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:58.834
And then I went to
see whether I could

00:36:58.834 --> 00:37:00.250
teach other people
to throw knives

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:01.541
So I started with my daughters.

00:37:01.541 --> 00:37:03.500
I've got a 14-year-old
out there, dating age.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.960
And I put some
knives in her hand.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.380
And I have no concerns
about her anymore.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.880
But one of the
things about it, too,

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.560
is-- I've just got one
quick, little demonstration

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.820
about throwing technique.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.470
So we know where throwing
all comes from-- actually,

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:15.600
since I've already
embarrassed you once,

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.620
Verity-- so here's
this really cool thing

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.740
about throwing technique.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.560
We have this idea of aim
being a cerebral process where

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.280
you stop, and you
look, and you profile,

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.100
and you do all
this kind of stuff.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.039
But actually-- here's
what we're going to do.

00:37:28.039 --> 00:37:29.330
So here's where aim comes from.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:31.340
If you'd just put your hands on
top of my hands, just lightly.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.760
Now I'm going to
move my hands around.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.080
OK?

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.630
And you're just going
to follow my hands.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.170
All right.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:35.710
I'll move them around here.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.070
And I'm going to try
and go faster and faster

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:37.920
and try to shake you off.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.470
All right?

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:39.374
All right?

00:37:39.374 --> 00:37:40.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
not going to happen.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:40.350
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: OK.

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.361
It can't happen, right?

00:37:41.361 --> 00:37:43.610
Now let's do this, let's
move them apart a little bit,

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:45.460
separate our hands by
about an inch or two.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.250
Same thing, OK?

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.916
Follow my hands.

00:37:46.916 --> 00:37:48.058
Ready?

00:37:48.058 --> 00:37:48.910
Good.

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:49.410
Good.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:49.800
Whoop.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.060
Whoop.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:50.310
Whoop.

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.810
Whoop.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.219
Whoop.

00:37:52.219 --> 00:37:54.010
You actually have to
use your brain, right?

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.060
There's a disconnect.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.430
You're using your brain
and your eye disconnects.

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:59.240
But if I asked you right know,
where's-- point to my hand.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.238
Point to the screen.

00:38:01.238 --> 00:38:02.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: Which screen?

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.235
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
Yeah, two fists.

00:38:04.235 --> 00:38:04.940
Yeah, two kinds.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.980
But the idea is your brain
actually instinctively knows

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.680
where it wants to go.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.520
Your finger automatically
knows where to go.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.030
So to actually turn yourself
into a throwing machine,

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.750
this whole idea of natural
movement is your body already

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:16.650
knows how to do it.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.180
Where we get into
trouble is we try

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.760
to rationalize
everything and turn it

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.920
into a cerebral process instead
of just a purely instinctive

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.500
process.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.990
So if we worked
for like 10 minutes

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.364
and had some knives
in your hand,

00:38:26.364 --> 00:38:29.120
you would be sinking them in
that wall like no problem.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.784
Do we have knives?

00:38:31.784 --> 00:38:32.670
OK.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.107
So thanks, Verity.

00:38:34.107 --> 00:38:35.690
Yeah, there was a
question in the back

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:37.174
there too, wasn't there?

00:38:37.174 --> 00:38:37.978
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:37.978 --> 00:38:39.311
AUDIENCE: I think we need a mic.

00:38:43.477 --> 00:38:45.477
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask
you a similar question

00:38:45.477 --> 00:38:47.914
about takeaways, more
about what you eat.

00:38:47.914 --> 00:38:50.330
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: Oh,
well first, I want to bring up,

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.630
when you have an opportunity
to read the book,

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:55.490
the reason why there's a book
is because of this gentleman,

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.219
Chris White, who I
think-- I don't think

00:38:57.219 --> 00:38:59.135
there's any way I can
put you more on the spot

00:38:59.135 --> 00:38:59.910
than I am right now.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:00.960
CHRIS WHITE: No, that's fine.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.570
Hello.

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:03.778
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: So
Chris White is from Oxford.

00:39:03.778 --> 00:39:06.845
And early on-- I'll get back
to your question in one second.

00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:08.970
I just wanted to introduce
Chris a little bit more.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:11.677
So when I first
begin this process

00:39:11.677 --> 00:39:13.760
I heard about a guy named
Patrick Leigh Fermor who

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.650
had been on Create and had
been involved in the abduction.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:17.632
And he was still alive.

00:39:17.632 --> 00:39:18.590
And I knew his address.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.923
I knew where he lived in Greece.

00:39:19.923 --> 00:39:23.020
And I'd written him several
letters and didn't get replies.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.247
And so in the
newspaper business,

00:39:25.247 --> 00:39:27.080
as a journalist, the
next thing you do then,

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.080
you just door stop them.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.996
You show up at a door
and you bang on the door

00:39:29.996 --> 00:39:30.850
until they come out.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:32.370
And so that was my plan.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.030
But on the way there
I had this twinge of,

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.720
this is probably a bad idea.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.060
So I was able to contact Artemis
Cooper and Antony Beevor,

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.760
husband and wife historians
who knew Paddy very well.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.210
And I was able to contact them.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.630
And they said, that
is a really bad idea.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.410
If you go to see
him, essentially,

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.549
anybody who knows him is
going to shut you out.

00:39:51.549 --> 00:39:52.590
It is a really bad thing.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.960
Don't do it.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.464
And for very good
reasons, they were right.

00:39:56.464 --> 00:39:58.880
But what they ended up doing
was actually putting in touch

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.100
with Chris and his brother
Pete, who probably, I would say,

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.790
know more about every step
of this journey than anybody

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:05.429
else alive.

00:40:05.429 --> 00:40:06.220
CHRIS WHITE: We do.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.080
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: They do.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.870
And so I'd like to
introduce-- so I'll answer

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:09.710
your question very briefly.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:10.990
And then I'd like to
turn it over for Chris.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.236
Do we have time, Christina?

00:40:12.236 --> 00:40:13.110
OK.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.240
So your question, what
do I eat now, it's funny.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.370
You hear a lot of buzz
about the paleo diet

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.177
and a lot of advocates
of the paleo diet.

00:40:21.177 --> 00:40:23.010
Essentially, basically
I eat the paleo diet.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.760
I think if you cut
out processed foods,

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.560
you cut out anything
high glycemic,

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.525
and you stick to things which
are high in saturated fats

00:40:29.525 --> 00:40:31.900
and vegetables-- kind of
like Michael Pollan said,

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.720
eat real food, mostly
vegetables, not too much.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.050
And to me-- and I keep hearing
it over and over again--

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:41.370
anybody who shifts to an
unprocessed, low glycemic diet,

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.261
the change is quick
and very long-lasting.

00:40:44.261 --> 00:40:46.260
So I'd like to introduce
Chris White to tell you

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.010
a little bit more about
his journey, which

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:49.636
actually became mine.

00:40:49.636 --> 00:40:50.594
CHRIS WHITE: All right.

00:40:50.594 --> 00:40:51.035
OK.

00:40:51.035 --> 00:40:51.480
CHRISTOPHER
MCDOUGALL: Thank you.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:51.780
CHRIS WHITE: It's OK.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:52.320
You have that.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:52.945
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: OK.

00:40:52.945 --> 00:40:54.403
CHRIS WHITE: Well,
this is unusual.

00:40:54.403 --> 00:40:56.500
I was in Crete until Saturday.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.715
So I just arrived back
having-- Peter and I,

00:40:59.715 --> 00:41:02.603
we've walked the
route four times now.

00:41:02.603 --> 00:41:04.567
Paddy only did it once.

00:41:04.567 --> 00:41:08.495
But he did lots of other trips
as well, as you might imagine.

00:41:08.495 --> 00:41:12.280
And what we've done is we've
found all the caves that

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.560
were used by Paddy
and with the general,

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.665
but also some of the other
places that he stayed.

00:41:19.665 --> 00:41:23.593
And we've helped write
a book, Paddy's account.

00:41:23.593 --> 00:41:26.048
It's called
"Abducting a General."

00:41:26.048 --> 00:41:30.467
And it's on sale, or
has been on sale--

00:41:30.467 --> 00:41:33.413
it is on sale-- coming
up, in fact, next month.

00:41:33.413 --> 00:41:34.886
And we helped edit that.

00:41:34.886 --> 00:41:39.590
And we wrote an account
of how to walk the route.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:43.494
And we've just had feedback
from some folk from Oxford

00:41:43.494 --> 00:41:46.010
who have followed
our guide and said

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:50.688
that it worked very well
as far as they can tell.

00:41:50.688 --> 00:41:53.520
So we've found lots
of caves and things.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.217
And I could show you those now.

00:41:55.217 --> 00:41:56.800
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
Do we have time

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.160
to show some caves and things?

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.209
MALE SPEAKER: We have
'til about half past.

00:42:00.209 --> 00:42:01.625
You have about
eight minutes left.

00:42:01.625 --> 00:42:03.870
CHRIS WHITE: Well, I've got to
get a memory stick and plug it

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:04.030
in.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.160
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: OK.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.118
But maybe for another--

00:42:06.118 --> 00:42:08.370
MALE SPEAKER: We can email
them around afterwards.

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:09.328
CHRIS WHITE: All right.

00:42:09.328 --> 00:42:11.224
I could talk to you
about it another day.

00:42:13.951 --> 00:42:16.200
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: But
I became intrigued by Chris

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.490
because-- it also gave me a
mnemonic, like when in doubt,

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:21.050
find a Brit.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:24.390
Because whatever you're
interested in, somewhere,

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:27.160
there is someone in the UK who's
been doing this for 15 years

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.180
and has been studying everything
for no apparent reason.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:34.420
And that's what-- so I
was-- am I wrong about that?

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.276
CHRIS WHITE: No, no.

00:42:35.276 --> 00:42:36.560
It was very good to do.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.682
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: Yeah.

00:42:38.682 --> 00:42:41.382
And so that basically
became, to me-- because

00:42:41.382 --> 00:42:42.840
as Chris pointed
out, Paddy himself

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.240
didn't know exactly
where he had gone.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.800
You know, he's running
through the mountains running

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.360
for his life.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.140
He's not actually
stopping and checking

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.140
GPS coordinates
and mapping things.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.660
So what Chris was able to do
was recreate this entire thing.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.910
So if you're going to talk
about a physical challenge,

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.220
you gotta know what
the challenge is.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.820
Like, where exactly did they
go and how did they survive?

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:03.030
And that, to me, became the
map that the whole story

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:06.110
was based upon.

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:07.780
Are there any other questions?

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:08.280
Yes.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.100
AUDIENCE: If you wanted to
do that walk, what time, what

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.177
season would be best to go?

00:43:13.177 --> 00:43:14.760
CHRIS WHITE: The
spring is delightful.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.444
And that's when they were
doing it, from April 26 to May

00:43:19.444 --> 00:43:22.360
the 14th was the time
they were doing it.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.276
And in fact, we do
it in April-May.

00:43:25.276 --> 00:43:26.882
And that's when Chris did it.

00:43:26.882 --> 00:43:28.590
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
How long would you

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:29.450
think it would take
if someone's going

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.160
to do it on a recreational--

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.350
CHRIS WHITE: I think you should
give yourself eight days.

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.800
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
Just in time.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.862
AUDIENCE: And no gels.

00:43:39.862 --> 00:43:40.570
CHRIS WHITE: No--

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.202
AUDIENCE: Don't take any gels.

00:43:42.202 --> 00:43:43.035
CHRIS WHITE: --gels.

00:43:43.035 --> 00:43:44.982
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
Like marathon goo gels.

00:43:44.982 --> 00:43:48.206
Yeah, you don't
know about those?

00:43:48.206 --> 00:43:48.706
Yeah.

00:43:52.073 --> 00:43:53.997
CHRIS WHITE: It's
delightful in the spring.

00:43:53.997 --> 00:43:56.402
AUDIENCE: We've got a question.

00:43:56.402 --> 00:43:58.358
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hi, Chris.

00:43:58.358 --> 00:44:00.430
Through "Born to
Run," you popularized

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:03.394
the recent phenomenon
of barefoot running

00:44:03.394 --> 00:44:05.864
and also the introduction
of chia seeds.

00:44:05.864 --> 00:44:11.430
Did you come across
a similar food item

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.180
that the Cretan Runner used?

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.138
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL:
Not so much a food item,

00:44:15.138 --> 00:44:16.550
but a food approach.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:20.090
And it's funny, I
thought about this.

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:22.070
I thought, I tell ya,
if you took the Cretans

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:23.280
and you put them in
the Copper Canyons,

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.890
they would probably
eat and act the same

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:25.510
as the Tarahumara Indians.

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:27.301
And if you took the
Tarahumara and put them

00:44:27.301 --> 00:44:28.224
on Crete, same thing.

00:44:28.224 --> 00:44:29.640
I think what I
became intrigued by

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.930
was seeing this
consistency of behavior

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:36.930
and eating patterns throughout
history and throughout regions.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:40.280
Basically, what chia does is it
acts as a nice slow-burn fuel

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.240
that allows you to
both hydrate and give

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:47.180
yourself caloric density
pretty efficiently.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.910
But on Crete, I think
it was actually,

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:51.030
the Cretan diet became
the Mediterranean diet,

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:55.030
and this idea of
nuts, olives, bit

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:56.779
of meet, lots of foraged greens.

00:44:56.779 --> 00:44:58.570
The other thing I
started looking into too,

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:01.640
I found a woman in Brooklyn who
actually prospects-- or sorry,

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.090
forages-- for food in
Brooklyn, which you would think

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:06.474
would be the desert
of nutrition.

00:45:06.474 --> 00:45:07.890
And yet what she
was finding was--

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:09.030
one of the cool
things she found--

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.010
I forget exactly what it was.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:11.340
It was sorrel or something.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.030
But we were actually
outside the Brooklyn Coop,

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:17.240
which is this expensive,
pricey place where sorrell

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.447
sells for like $7 a pound.

00:45:18.447 --> 00:45:20.030
She's like, it's
actually growing here

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.160
in the cracks of the
sidewalk outside.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.120
But one of the things she
showed me was-- and Pete,

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:29.057
who is actually an expert
horticulturist as well,

00:45:29.057 --> 00:45:31.390
was actually able to point
out the things in the ground.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.764
And we would see people picking
up weeds and putting them

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:35.590
in these blue plastic
shopping bags--

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:39.219
but the deeper the color,
the more phytonutrients

00:45:39.219 --> 00:45:39.760
are involved.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.260
So the stuff you're plucking
from the ground for free

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.340
is actually more caloric
dense than the stuff

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.680
you're buying in the store.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.950
But again, it just
keeps circling back

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:47.741
to the same things.

00:45:47.741 --> 00:45:50.990
Like, if you lower the glycemic
level like the Tarahumara did,

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:52.549
the better off
you're going to be.

00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:54.549
There was another question
over here, I thought.

00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:55.174
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:55.174 --> 00:45:59.040
So this question related,
actually, to a few, so both

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.535
on preparing for running
and changing the diet.

00:46:01.535 --> 00:46:04.030
So is there any
research on reversing,

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:06.525
let's say, poor adaptation?

00:46:06.525 --> 00:46:08.521
So I think, like
barefoot running,

00:46:08.521 --> 00:46:10.517
people look for an easy switch.

00:46:10.517 --> 00:46:13.758
So I think it became kind
of a fad in some ways.

00:46:13.758 --> 00:46:15.507
And people flipped
that switch and did it.

00:46:15.507 --> 00:46:17.004
And if some people's
bodies aren't ready for it,

00:46:17.004 --> 00:46:18.002
they get hurt.

00:46:18.002 --> 00:46:20.329
Same thing on paleo
diet, it's just

00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:21.495
kind of flicking the switch.

00:46:21.495 --> 00:46:23.491
And it's been more of
a fad than a lifestyle.

00:46:23.491 --> 00:46:26.485
So is there any research
on people reversing rather

00:46:26.485 --> 00:46:28.905
than just, overnight, changing.

00:46:28.905 --> 00:46:31.280
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: You
know-- is this on, by the way?

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.050
Is it on?

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:32.660
No?

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:33.160
OK.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.180
I'll just put this down.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.890
The whole idea of flipping a
switch, that's the problem.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:39.840
How many years ago was it?

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.340
Six, seven years ago,
2006-- [INAUDIBLE] math

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.924
is nine years ago?

00:46:44.924 --> 00:46:47.090
Yeah, almost 10 years ago--
I was actually in London

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:48.654
for a conference on fascia.

00:46:48.654 --> 00:46:50.070
And someone
introduced to this guy

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.160
named Lee Saxby who
does run retraining.

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.950
And he changed my running gait.

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:56.180
And now I'm back here again.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.430
And I went right back to Lee
Saxby and his guys again.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:02.590
Because it's a process
of learning an art.

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:04.200
Like ballet, ballet
dancers don't go,

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.341
oh perfect, I never have
to take another class.

00:47:06.341 --> 00:47:06.840
I'm done.

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.680
You know?

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.085
So to me, a physical
skill is a skill

00:47:10.085 --> 00:47:11.674
that you need to
constantly refresh.

00:47:11.674 --> 00:47:13.840
Again, the problem is-- and
I hear this all the time

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.490
with barefoot running-- the
first question every time is,

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:17.780
how long does it take.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.280
Like, what's the minimum amount
of time I can expand on this?

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.640
And to me, there's no minimum.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.049
It's the rest of your life.

00:47:25.049 --> 00:47:26.590
But then the question
you have to ask

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:27.530
yourself is, what's the point.

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.280
What exactly are you
trying to accomplish?

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.050
Do you want the medal
from London Marathon

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.720
or do you want to actually
enjoy the physical act

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.489
for a long time?

00:47:34.489 --> 00:47:36.280
And the other thing,
too, is the whole idea

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.700
about even the question
of barefoot running

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.240
is like, why is it
even a question.

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.490
Like, you were born with feet.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.590
You were not born with
shoes on those feet.

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:44.200
So you adapted to
something else.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.430
So if you want to be
dependent, you can be.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.680
I shouldn't go into the topic.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.320
I'll start foaming at the mouth.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.580
Are there some more questions?

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think got
time for one more question.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:56.113
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: Hope it's
a good one, burning question.

00:47:56.113 --> 00:47:57.878
FEMALE SPEAKER: Anyone else?

00:47:57.878 --> 00:47:59.086
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: Uh-oh.

00:48:06.644 --> 00:48:09.079
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to ask a bit more.

00:48:09.079 --> 00:48:11.000
So you mentioned that
diet is one thing

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.356
to make yourself burn fat.

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:14.736
Was there any
other kind of thing

00:48:14.736 --> 00:48:18.404
you could take away as a runner
to try and burn fat more?

00:48:18.404 --> 00:48:19.570
CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: Yeah.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:21.111
Yeah, so the whole
fat as fuel thing,

00:48:21.111 --> 00:48:22.990
again, I find it
really interesting.

00:48:25.449 --> 00:48:26.865
Because it's so
effective and it's

00:48:26.865 --> 00:48:29.570
so simple that it's almost
nothing prescriptive about it.

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:32.030
And the guy I asked
about it, Phil Maffetone,

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:33.305
I said, I found the guy.

00:48:33.305 --> 00:48:34.430
He lives out in the desert.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:35.110
He's hard to reach.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.151
And I sit down like, OK,
now I'm going to get it.

00:48:37.151 --> 00:48:38.660
And I gave him a pad and paper.

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.910
And I actually went off to
wash the dishes from lunch.

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:43.117
And he was done before I
got away from the table.

00:48:43.117 --> 00:48:44.200
He said, it's very simple.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.450
You only do two things.

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:47.700
You do a thing called
the two-week test, which

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.780
is you strip out all
the high glycemic foods

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.196
from your diet for
just two weeks,

00:48:51.196 --> 00:48:52.700
just to see how
your body responds.

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.240
And the second thing you
do is, for your training,

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.969
you keep it below your
anaerobic threshold.

00:48:57.969 --> 00:49:00.010
You tell your body that
there are no emergencies.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:01.180
We are in a Zen state.

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:03.800
We are doing a 10-day
silent retreat.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.200
We don't need any sugar.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.300
And you combine those two
things of remove the sugars,

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.320
remove the stresses,
and train that way.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.111
So you basically wear
a heart rate monitor.

00:49:12.111 --> 00:49:14.110
And whenever it beeps
up, you chill out again.

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.660
It is really
frustrating mentally,

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.160
because you want
to go fast, and you

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.743
want to do this kind
of stuff, and you

00:49:19.743 --> 00:49:21.570
want a bowl of ice cream.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:24.530
But it's funny, in two, three
weeks, everything changes.

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:26.430
The cravings go.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:27.880
Your body feels better.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.969
And for that reason, it's
sort of self-motivating.

00:49:29.969 --> 00:49:32.510
Because you just keep feeling
better and keep feeling better.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.032
And you want to stick with it.

00:49:34.032 --> 00:49:35.490
To me, it makes
all the difference.

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:38.240
And what I love about it,
again, two, three weeks and you

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.160
got it sorted out.

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:40.660
Good?

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.120
Well, thank you all very
much for your attention.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:42.840
I really appreciate it.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.440
Thank you.

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.840
Hello, Chris.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.690
Nice to see you.
