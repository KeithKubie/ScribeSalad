00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.480
&gt;&gt;presenter: All right.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.480
Well, good morning, everyone.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.230
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.450
Today's subject is a very momentous one.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.280
It's a very powerful presentation we have
for you today.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.720
Throughout the latter part of the 20th Century,
the idea of disarmament has been one of the

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.480
chief causes and the chief focal points of
world peace.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.920
And today we have in our midst several heroes
who helped negotiate some of the landmark

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.931
agreements during the Cold War and in the
1980s and 90s.

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:41.360
The threat of nuclear terrorism still looms
today and these men are also working to help

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.460
control and contain that threat.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.230
We're joined today by Professor Phil Taubman
of Stanford University for a discussion about

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.340
his book, which is entitled "The Partnership:
Five Cold Warriors and their Quest to Ban

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.800
the Bomb."

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.079
And we're honored today to have three of the
five warriors in our midst.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.219
We have Secretary of State George Schultz,
Senator Sam Nunn, and Secretary of Defense

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.670
William Perry.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.210
We'll have time for Q and A and the end, so
please feel free to use the microphones.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.220
And for those of you who are in our six remote
offices dialing in, you can also find our

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.150
Google moderator link at “go/coldwarriors”.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.670
So, without further ado, please join me in
welcoming everyone to Google.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.730
Thanks.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.790
[applause]

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.420
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: Thank you all for coming.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.470
And thank you Larry Page and Google for hosting
us today.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.540
And my thanks to three of the five men who
are the subject of the book.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.500
So, let me begin by setting the stage briefly
for a conversation that we'll have and we'll

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.340
have with you as well about nuclear weapons.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.200
As was just noted, I think there is a sense,
a false sense, that when the Cold War ended

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.540
with the collapse of the Soviet Union and
the Warsaw Pact, that the threat of nuclear

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.380
attack also ended.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.989
And that is a misunderstanding of our history,
unfortunately.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.459
If you look at what's happened since the end
of the Cold War, I think President Obama captured

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.959
the paradox very effectively when he spoke
in Prague shortly after he was sworn-in as

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:29.959
President.

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.870
He gave a very eloquent and important speech
there in April of 2009 about nuclear issues.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.129
And in that speech he said, "Today, the Cold
War has disappeared, but thousands of those

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.579
weapons have not.

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.900
In a strange turn of history, the threat of
global nuclear war has gone down, but the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.299
risk of a nuclear attack has gone up."

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:03.470
What he's referring to, primarily, is the
risk of a nuclear 9/11, which is actually

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.950
as, far-fetched as it sounds, is a real possibility
at some point.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.359
One that's hard to imagine, but one I think
that the country has to come to grips with

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:17.790
to try to prevent.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.879
And when I was researching the book, [clears
throat] I spent some time with Bob Gates,

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:30.620
the Defense Secretary, who served in both
the Bush and Obama administrations.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.150
And I asked him a question about what essentially
keeps him up at night.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
And here's what he told me.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.200
"If you were to ask most of the leaders of
the last Administration or the current Administration

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.829
what might keep them awake at night, it's
the prospect of a weapon or a nuclear material

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.709
falling into the hands of Al-Qaeda or some
other extremists.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.819
And it doesn't have to be a weapon.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.370
It could be nuclear material with regular
explosives and producing a degree of contamination

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.169
that would be catastrophic."

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:13.120
And finally, from the book, let me read you
a comment from Henry Kissinger, who was one

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.900
of the five men that I've chronicled in this
book.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:24.450
And Kissinger is talking here about the reaction
if there were to be nuclear 9/11 or some other

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.780
kind of nuclear exchange.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.101
And what we here at Google and in the Bay
Area, and frankly, around the world, what

00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:38.750
people would be thinking at that point and
here's what he said: "Once nuclear weapons

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.250
are used, we will be driven to take global
measures to prevent it.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.170
So, some of us have said 'Let's ask ourselves,
if we have to do it afterwards, why don't

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.070
we do it now?'"

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.640
The book and this discussion that we're gonna
have really focuses on the nuclear threats

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.200
that we continue to face today, which are
quite considerable.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.500
Unbeknownst to most of us, during the Cold
War, the United States and Soviet Union distributed

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.390
research reactors to dozens of countries around
the world and provided those nations with

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.730
highly-enriched uranium to operate those research
reactors.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:31.660
For years, this material was sitting around
in poorly-secured facilities, as I say, in

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.180
dozens of countries.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.710
It's only been in recent years that the United
States and Russia had made a concerted effort

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.910
to try to secure this material, thanks in
large part to some legislation that Senator

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.540
Nunn offered with his Republican colleague,
Richard Lugar from Indiana--the so-called

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.110
Nunn-Lugar Legislation which you may have
heard of.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:00.810
But the truth is, today there is tons of highly-enriched
uranium, which is the critical component of

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.780
a crude nuclear weapon.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.690
There's still tons of it spread around dozens
of countries around the globe.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.610
And it doesn't take much highly-enriched uranium.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.830
Roughly 60 pounds to make a bomb.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.350
And the technology for that kind of uranium
bomb is very straight-forward.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:27.670
It requires some engineering skills, but it's
not beyond the capacity of a group of reasonably

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:34.030
sophisticated engineers and the kind of equipment
you can buy off the shelf to make a weapon.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:40.430
And when the United States developed the first
nuclear weapons during the Manhattan Project

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:47.120
in World War II, the first bomb that we dropped
on Japan, the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.440
was a uranium bomb.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.550
And Robert Oppenheimer and his fellow scientists
who managed the Manhattan Project were so

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:04.200
confident of that technology, which essentially
takes two pieces of highly-enriched uranium--as

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:11.190
I say, you could do it with 60 pounds--and
brings them together at very high velocity.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.630
And when the two pieces come together, you
get the criticality, the chain reaction that

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.780
releases this huge amount of energy.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.220
That was so straight-forward.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.080
They did not test that bomb before it was
dropped on Hiroshima.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.930
The bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki was
a plutonium bomb.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.490
Different, more complicated implosion technology
with plutonium.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.450
That bomb was tested in New Mexico in 1945.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:46.530
So, I think that just sets the stage here
for a discussion as was indicated when we

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.270
were introduced.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:54.950
These three men have devoted a great deal
of time in recent years, time when they could

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.290
be enjoying themselves on the golf course,
to try to deal with this issue.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:05.390
And, I think, we have to listen to them because
the three here and their two colleagues, Sid

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:11.200
Drell and Henry Kissinger, they're all men
who worked very hard to maintain America's

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.930
defenses during the Cold War.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.370
They were stalwart cold warriors.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:22.480
They were the builders, the maintainers, the
stewards of our huge nuclear arsenal during

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.480
the Cold War.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.520
At its peak, the United States and Soviet
Union, believe it or not, had a grand total

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.730
of about 70 thousand nuclear warheads.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.169
The number has come down.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:38.370
It's now around 20 thousand, but 90 percent
of those are still under the control of the

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.000
United States and Russia.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.449
These men know about nuclear weapons.

00:08:43.449 --> 00:08:49.910
They know about the damage that can be produced
by a nuclear detonation in a city.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.160
And they've devoted themselves to trying to
reduce these dangers.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.060
President Obama has embraced a lot of the
policies that they've advocated, including

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.300
their aspirational critical goal of eventually
eliminating nuclear weapons.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.359
So, if I may, Senator--.

00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:10.329
&gt;&gt; Senator Shultz: Let me interject something
that builds on what you just said.

00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:15.399
Sometimes people say, "Well, this sounds good,
but it's impossible.

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:17.730
You can't really get anywhere."

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.480
But you gave some numbers--70 thousand more
or less at the time of the Reykjavik meeting

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.410
between Reagan and Gorbachev and now.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.180
Seventy to twenty.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.170
It shows you yes, you can accomplish a lot.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.110
It's not futile to be working on this.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.199
You can get somewhere.

00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:36.850
And that's an example.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.850
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: Good.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.249
Good point, thank you.

00:09:39.249 --> 00:09:45.999
Senator Nunn, as the author of Nunn-Lugar,
when you look back over the 20 years or so

00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:52.129
since then, how would you rate what we've
been able to do in terms of preventing proliferation?

00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:57.240
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: Well, it's very hard to
quantify something that did not happen.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:03.240
But after the Soviet Union broke up, I happened
to be there when they were having the debate

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240
about breaking up.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.059
And I got on an airplane and came back with
the determination to try to do something to

00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:16.089
help the former Soviet Union, which was about
to be a controlled nuclear, not only nuclear,

00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:19.529
but chemical, biological, not only weapons,
but materials.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:22.529
'Cause huge, huge quantities of materials.

00:10:22.529 --> 00:10:27.529
We joined up, as Phil said, Senator Lugar
and I, and passed the Nunn-Lugar legislation

00:10:27.529 --> 00:10:30.910
in actually the late Fall of 1991.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.970
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: '91.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:33.970
Right.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.110
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: Right when the empire
was coming apart.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:43.829
Very fortunately, within the next couple of
years, Bill Perry, who had helped envision

00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:46.899
this idea, became Secretary of Defense.

00:10:46.899 --> 00:10:53.320
And he and his team did a superb job of implementing
what was really more of an authorization than

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.290
it was an absolute mandate.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:02.829
I score us pretty well on what's happened
in the last 20 years in terms of one of the

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:07.710
immediate outcomes that happened in the next
two or three years after legislation passed,

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.800
was that there were four countries that ended
up with nuclear weapons when the Soviet Union

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.800
broke up.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.089
Russia, of course, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.

00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:19.100
Three of those four countries gave up all
their nuclear weapons.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:24.730
And if you take the arsenal of those three,
that basically exceeds the arsenal of China,

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.040
of Great Britain and France.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.800
In fact, Ukraine alone had more weapons than
China, Great Britain and France.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.029
So, I would say on that score, I would give
pretty high marks.

00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:39.170
On the score of preventing nuclear materials
from leaking out to terrorist groups, you

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.290
don't know what you don't know.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.160
So, no one can ever exclude the possibility
that some of that happened.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.569
But I believe if terrorists groups had nuclear
materials in sufficient quantity, they would

00:11:48.569 --> 00:11:50.809
have already attempted to make nuclear weapons.

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:54.430
So, perhaps we have been successful in that
regard.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.070
But it's a continuing battle.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.970
There's still a huge amount of nuclear material
in Russia.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.230
Kazakhstan has some.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.930
Kazakhstan has probably done better than anyone
else.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:07.050
And just as, if you looked at the paper this
morning, you'll see that Ukraine as well as

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.910
Mexico in this Seoul Security Conference,
which is one of the real positive developments.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.250
So, a follow-up to a conference that was held
in Washington two years ago with over 40 heads

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.440
of state, here in Seoul, Korea.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.439
As we speak, over 50 heads of state are there.

00:12:21.439 --> 00:12:24.899
And they're concentrating on nuclear material
protection.

00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:28.860
Both Ukraine and Mexico have given up now
all their highly-enriched uranium.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.699
So, they no longer have the materials that
would be used to make a bomb.

00:12:33.699 --> 00:12:35.309
So, we're making progress.

00:12:35.309 --> 00:12:41.050
Another sign of progress; during the George
W. Bush Administration, a program passed which

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:46.019
I think was enormously important, remains
important, called Global Threat Reduction

00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:47.019
Initiative.

00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:50.959
It was funding to help get nuclear material
back from places all over the world.

00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:55.350
A few years ago, there were 40 countries that
had enough weapon-grade material to make a

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.350
bomb.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.350
Today, there are 32.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.829
And with Ukraine and Mexico, we can perhaps
say down to 30.

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:02.319
So, we're making progress.

00:13:02.319 --> 00:13:08.830
And that GTRI program has been the basis with
Nunn-Lugar in working with Russia on getting

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.569
control of nuclear materials.

00:13:10.569 --> 00:13:17.100
So, on a scale of one to ten in terms of material
protection, I think we've moved up the ladder

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.839
somewhere in the about seven neighborhood.

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:22.689
But it's a dynamic, continuing problem.

00:13:22.689 --> 00:13:25.459
And it's not a static problem.

00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:26.899
It's a dynamic problem.

00:13:26.899 --> 00:13:29.769
India's continuing to make nuclear materials.

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:31.710
Great Britain is making nuclear materials.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.910
Japan is making nuclear materials.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.230
Not for the purposes necessarily in Japan
and Great Britain of making a bomb, but the

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:43.980
dilemma is it's the same material you use
for legitimate purposes and blend it up to

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.300
about four or five percent.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:50.180
If you take it up to 20 percent enrichment,
it becomes weapons-usable.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:54.139
If you take it up to 90 percent, you got yourself
a bomb.

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:55.579
It's the same technology.

00:13:55.579 --> 00:14:01.800
But one encouraging thing in wrapping up,
this particular thought is that since 1991,

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.220
we have been working with Russia, Belarus,
Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other countries in

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.079
the former Soviet Union.

00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:14.959
During the Bill Perry Administration as Secretary
of Defense, we made a deal with Ukraine to

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:20.209
basically have their nuclear materials sent
back to Russia that was coming out of those

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:23.959
weapons--the highly-enriched uranium--blend
it down in Russia and we bought it.

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:24.959
And we're still buying it.

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:26.019
It was a 20-year deal.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:30.730
So, if you look at nuclear power in this country
today, 20 percent of our electricity is nuclear

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.750
power.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:37.879
Fifty percent of the fuel going into those
nuclear power plants is coming from a blended-down

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:40.829
highly-enriched uranium that during the Cold
War was aimed at us.

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:46.029
So, by definition, ten percent, one out of
every ten light bulbs, one out of every ten

00:14:46.029 --> 00:14:52.249
percent of any electricity in this country,
is coming from materials that were in nuclear

00:14:52.249 --> 00:14:54.189
weapons aimed at us during the Cold War.

00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:57.269
So, progress can be made, as George Schultz
said.

00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:58.550
Progress is being made.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.920
But there's a long way to go.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:06.119
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: Let me ask about progress
in a slightly different area, which is the

00:15:06.119 --> 00:15:09.389
continued presence of large nuclear arsenals.

00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:15.600
The United States has five thousand warheads
still under the New START Agreement with Russia.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.600
We'll eventually come down to 15 hundred and
50 of those warheads being on active alert,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.420
meaning the President can order them launched
on very short notice.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.540
The rest are in reserve.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.230
Russia has agreed to come down to that level,
too.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:40.860
In South Korea today, Secretary Perry, President
Obama said that the United States has more

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.939
nuclear weapons than it needs.

00:15:43.939 --> 00:15:49.429
If you were advising the President today or
were still Secretary of Defense, how many

00:15:49.429 --> 00:15:55.879
nuclear weapons do we need on reasonably short
alert at this point?

00:15:55.879 --> 00:15:56.879
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:15:56.879 --> 00:16:02.439
William Perry: I don't think we need any on
short alert.

00:16:02.439 --> 00:16:07.750
We're not faced with that kind of threat today
as we thought we were during the Cold War.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:16.220
How many we need to give us a level of deterrence
is to stop any other country who has nuclear

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.800
weapons from thinking they could attack us,
is measured in the hundreds, not in the thousands--a

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.580
few hundred, I would say, at the most.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.089
Getting down to that number is a huge political
problem.

00:16:28.089 --> 00:16:32.449
It has nothing to do with the need for deterrence.

00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:36.790
It has to do with the fact that many people
in this country, maybe most people in this

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:42.439
country, would be reluctant for us to come
down to a few hundred nuclear weapons if Russia

00:16:42.439 --> 00:16:45.009
still had a few thousand.

00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:48.730
Whether that's a rational judgment or not,
that is a judgment, I think, which would be

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.279
made.

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:54.699
And so, other Administrations, this Administration,
the previous Administration that worked this

00:16:54.699 --> 00:17:00.889
problem have always tried to work nuclear
disarmament in a bi-lateral way, that we come

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:07.050
down arm in arm with the Russians, either
through agreements or more typically, through

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.050
treaties.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:14.069
So, the question then is if we did conclude
we come down to a few hundred, could we get

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:16.880
Russia to come down with us?

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.689
And the answer to that is probably not at
this time.

00:17:19.689 --> 00:17:22.650
I just, matter of fact, just came back from
Russia.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:28.610
I was there Friday and Saturday discussing
these issues.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:35.840
The problem is that there's a dramatic asymmetry
between the United States' security position

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.149
and the Russian security position.

00:17:38.149 --> 00:17:46.240
They believe that they are surrounded by instability,
unstable countries, and some hostile countries.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.400
They believe correctly that their conventional
military forces are very weak.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:56.970
And therefore, they lean on their nuclear
forces as an offset to that weakness.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:04.899
And they did agree with us on the New START
Treaty to come down a modest decrease of what

00:18:04.899 --> 00:18:09.970
they have, but they're gonna be very, very
hard to persuade to go down to levels of a

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.539
few hundred because they feel that their security
is very much at stake.

00:18:13.539 --> 00:18:19.710
So, the short answer to your question is we
can certainly, we can maintain a high confident

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:25.230
level of deterrence with a few hundred, not
a few thousand, nuclear weapons.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:30.269
And I doubt that we are gonna be able to get
there politically unless the Russians agree

00:18:30.269 --> 00:18:31.830
to go with us.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.480
And my present reading of the Russian view
is they're very unlikely to be able to make

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.480
major cuts.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.419
They might make a small further token cut,
but they're not willing to make major cuts.

00:18:41.419 --> 00:18:46.810
And besides, the weapons which we negotiate
in STAR Treaty was what we call and they call

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.710
strategic nuclear weapons.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:54.580
They have probably four or five thousand tactical
nuclear weapons designed, as they see it,

00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:00.019
to protect them from any problems, neighbors
on the Southern borders.

00:19:00.019 --> 00:19:02.250
So, that is the asymmetry.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.289
It's a real asymmetry.

00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:06.720
And that's a real impediment in moving forward.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.880
I'm not totally discouraged about the prospects,
but we have to recognize that that is a major

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.610
obstacle, that they look at the- their nuclear
weapons much differently than we look at them.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:21.360
So, either we have to find a way of persuading
them that it's safe to come down, or we have

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.090
to be prepared to go down, laterally, to those
numbers only hoping that they will follow

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.090
in time.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.090
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: You know, it's--.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.090
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.580
George P. Schultz: Let me underline something
that Bill said at the beginning of his remarks.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:39.120
He said we don't need any deployed on short-term
alert.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.289
Think of it.

00:19:40.289 --> 00:19:47.510
We and Russia have a thousand or so nuclear
weapons pointed more or less at each other

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:52.830
on an alert system whereby if you have a warning
about a missile coming at you, you've got

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:58.490
only a matter of minutes to decide whether
to retaliate.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.899
It is an insane arrangement.

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:08.090
I can't think of any conceivable dispute we
could have with Russia that warrants the risk

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.880
of a nuclear exchange.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:16.070
And this kind of short-term alert status--Sam
has talked about this a lot--just doesn't

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.690
make any sense at all in this circumstance.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:24.289
So, I should think that's something that could
be pointed to.

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:32.659
Early in his Administration, President Reagan
asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to tell him

00:20:32.659 --> 00:20:39.130
what would be the result if there were a Soviet
attack on us with nuclear weapons.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.130
And they took their time.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:46.940
And they came back with the answer, "Initial
casualties, 150 million."

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.289
And cascading casualties after that 'cause
we'd have no infrastructure left.

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:53.769
Would he retaliate?

00:20:53.769 --> 00:20:54.769
Yes.

00:20:54.769 --> 00:20:59.980
Result in Russia, or Soviet Union then, something
similar.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.760
So he always said, "What's so good about maintaining
the peace by inability to wipe each other

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.760
out?"

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.559
What have you won if you both wiped out?

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:15.600
But the system of the short-term trigger points
still is there.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.110
And it's just insanity.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:24.220
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: So, Secretary Schultz is
the only person in this room who actually

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:29.360
sat at a bargaining table with the leader
of the Soviet Union and discussed eliminating

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.740
nuclear weapons entirely.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:37.059
That was at the Reykjavik Summit between Mikhail
Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan in Iceland in

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:38.240
1986.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:45.799
You now, along with your colleagues, have
moved the discussion about eliminating nuclear

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:53.350
weapons back into a position where it's being
seriously considered and discussed.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.340
How would we achieve that goal, Secretary
Schultz?

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.340
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.490
George P. Schultz: Well, we're working at
it.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.809
And attitudes have changed.

00:22:00.809 --> 00:22:06.169
I remember when we came back from the Reykjavik
Meeting, I was virtually summoned to the British

00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:10.929
Ambassador's residence to meet with Margaret
Thatcher, who came over.

00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:13.130
She used to carry a little stiff handbag.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.409
And I learned that there was a verb in the
British language, "to be handbagged."

00:22:17.409 --> 00:22:18.409
[laughter]

00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:21.640
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: Is that in the movie, "The
Iron Woman?"

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.640
[laughs]

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.640
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.640
George P. Schultz: I don't know.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.640
But I got handbagged.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.200
"George, how could you sit there and let the
President agree to get rid of nuclear weapons?"

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.120
"But Margaret, he's the President."

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.740
"Yes, but you're supposed to be the one with
his feet on the ground."

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.390
"But Margaret, I agree, but--."

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.390
[laughter]

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:42.809
And her reaction was fairly typical around
Washington and elsewhere that this was the

00:22:42.809 --> 00:22:46.929
kind of result you expect when two leaders
get loose on their bureaucracies and talk

00:22:46.929 --> 00:22:49.700
about what's on their minds.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:58.789
But now, after we issued our first Op-Ed about
five years ago, the atmosphere is entirely

00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:59.789
different.

00:22:59.789 --> 00:23:05.029
I don't mean that everybody's agreeing with
us, but there's much more willingness to talk

00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:06.029
about it.

00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:11.289
And in many cases, to join us in an effort
to get rid of nuclear weapons.

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:16.070
So, I think that the whole atmosphere has
changed and changed for the better.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:21.600
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: Fourteen countries, George,
to your point where former Secretaries of

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:27.779
State or Defense or top officials have basically
written and endorsed our position on this,

00:23:27.779 --> 00:23:30.390
which we call "The Vision and the Steps."

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.820
The vision being a world without nuclear weapons.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.970
The steps, all the hard things you have to
do to get there.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.809
Everybody knows you have to get there step-by-step.

00:23:38.809 --> 00:23:43.090
But nevertheless, we've had about 14 countries
that have now endorsed that.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:47.010
And there are networks, both in Asia and in
Europe, that are working on this issue now.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.010
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.279
George P. Schultz: Actually, let me point
out.

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:54.460
There's a very interesting interaction between
the vision and the steps.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:59.220
In fact, if you have a vision of where you
want to go, what does it do to you?

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.470
It calls you to say, "How do I get there?"

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:07.139
Then, you start thinking of things that are
doable that you could do.

00:24:07.139 --> 00:24:14.540
And the more you develop those, the more the
vision takes on the air of reality.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:19.549
And the interesting thing about it is at each
step that we have recommended, it's taken.

00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:25.799
For example, if this effort that's going on
now in Korea, as it becomes more successful

00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:31.340
getting control of this material, as that
is done, it makes the world safer, as Sam

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:32.610
has developed earlier.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:39.740
So, there's a nice interaction between having
a goal and the steps you need to get there.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.230
And all the steps would be positive.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.309
Excuse me, sir.

00:24:42.309 --> 00:24:43.759
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: No, no.

00:24:43.759 --> 00:24:44.759
That's fine.

00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:46.130
Let's go to questions in a minute.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:51.720
I just was gonna note that the book actually
opens with a scene at the United Nations.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:58.429
In 2009, the Security Council met--you may
remember this--it was the 50 nations on the

00:24:58.429 --> 00:25:03.490
Security Council were represented by the heads
of state from each of the nations and the

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.850
Chair that day was President Obama.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:13.690
And at that session, I think Secretaries Schultz
and Perry and Senator Nunn and Henry Kissinger

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:19.190
were actually in the Security Council chamber
that day, watching the discussion.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:25.899
And at the end of the meeting, the Security
Council voted unanimously to embrace the goal

00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:32.110
of eliminating nuclear weapons and to call
for the kinds of restraints that had been

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.570
advocated by the gentlemen here.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:38.220
So, let's begin with some questions here in
Mountain View.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.730
And I know there are people at other Google
locations.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:44.570
If you send your questions, we'll field some
of those as well.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:45.570
So, please.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:46.570
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hi.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:47.570
Thanks for coming.

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:48.570
I have two questions.

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:54.360
First, what's the best response that we should
take for the Iranian proliferation threat?

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.389
And I forgot the second one.

00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:57.720
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: OK.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.799
I think that might be a good one for Secretary--

00:25:59.799 --> 00:26:00.799
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:01.950
George P. Schultz: You remind me of Governor
Perry.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.010
[laughter]

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:09.450
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: I learned in politics
a long time ago, when you're gonna say something

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.799
about numbers, don't ever use the number.

00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:14.299
Say, "I have a few questions today."

00:26:14.299 --> 00:26:18.340
You can stop at two or three or four, nobody
knows.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.340
[laughter]

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.340
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:25.659
George P. Schultz: I think on the Iranian
issue, we're missing a very important thing

00:26:25.659 --> 00:26:33.870
that we should have been doing and could do
now that would give our diplomacy more bite.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:39.799
One of the things you learn when you try to
do diplomacy is that if you have no strength

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:42.950
when you go to the bargaining table, you're
gonna get your head handed to you.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.279
You've gotta bring strength.

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:53.200
Now, Iran has been conducting what is virtually
acts of war for a long time by their support

00:26:53.200 --> 00:27:00.049
for Osama, by their terrorist acts around
the world, by things that they are doing.

00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:08.009
This recent apprehension of somebody who was
out to assassinate on US soil a Saudi ambassador

00:27:08.009 --> 00:27:09.650
and so on.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.580
And we don't do anything about those types
of things.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.450
And I think we need to hit them back.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.240
I'll give an example.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:24.820
In the 1980s, mid-1980s, Iranians started
to play around with Kuwaiti shipping.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:29.600
So, we re-flagged the ships to our flag so
that we could guard them.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.350
And while the President of Iran was in the
United Nations, saying the last thing in the

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:40.510
world Iran would do would put a mine in the
Persian Gulf, our Navy was taking pictures

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.950
of them doing it.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:47.059
So, we boarded the ship, took off the sailors
and took off some mines for evidence, sank

00:27:47.059 --> 00:27:52.140
the ship, took the sailors to Dubai and said,
"Come and get your sailors and cut it out."

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.419
Now that was communication.

00:27:54.419 --> 00:28:04.309
And I think we need some of that hard reaction
back to these provocations that Iran is constantly

00:28:04.309 --> 00:28:05.399
doing.

00:28:05.399 --> 00:28:11.759
&gt;&gt;male #1: My second question was given that
we're not going to be able to get rid of nuclear

00:28:11.759 --> 00:28:16.620
weapons today, unfortunately, what are your
thoughts on the aging of the nuclear arsenal

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.649
and the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program?

00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:19.649
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:28:19.649 --> 00:28:20.722
William Perry: What was that question?

00:28:20.722 --> 00:28:24.519
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: It was about the aging
arsenal and the Reliable Warhead program.

00:28:24.519 --> 00:28:27.230
Bill, why don't you field that one?

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:28.230
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:36.059
William Perry: We haven't tested a bomb or
built a new bomb for several decades now.

00:28:36.059 --> 00:28:41.230
And so, this deterrence, which we have today,
comes whether we have a hundred or a thousand

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:42.230
or two thousand.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:47.440
It comes from weapons which are 30, 40 years
old and being carried by missiles which are

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.820
almost as old.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:53.770
So, the question is: “How do we maintain
confidence in our arsenal under those conditions?”

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:59.871
We have, at the laboratories, something which
actually created when I was Secretary of Defense

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:07.370
back in 1996, I believe it was, called the
Stockpile Stewardship Program, in which we

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:15.809
used the most advanced technology, the most
advanced computers for checking out the reliability

00:29:15.809 --> 00:29:20.630
of our nuclear weapons and taking corrective
actions when they need to be taken.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:28.210
This program has been enormously successful
and I have great confidence that as far as

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:37.669
I can assess, our nuclear stockpile will remain
reliable without testing, without building

00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:41.029
new weapons, for decades to come.

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:45.879
I hope that by that time we have had some
success in the endeavor we’re on, so that

00:29:45.879 --> 00:29:51.539
the question of the reliability of the stockpile
goes away because we don't have stockpiles.

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:57.080
But in any event, with high confidence I can
say that we can maintain this reliability

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.350
of our present stockpile for decades into
the future.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:05.309
And we're doing it because of very, very sophisticated,
very advanced technology including using the

00:30:05.309 --> 00:30:10.919
most powerful computers in the world to simulate
what's going on.

00:30:10.919 --> 00:30:11.960
One other comment on that.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.240
We have just a few miles from here at Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, a program called the

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.559
National Ignition Facility.

00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:28.299
The goal of that facility is to create fusion
by having almost 200 very high-powered lasers

00:30:28.299 --> 00:30:31.049
direct their energy in one very, very small
spot.

00:30:31.049 --> 00:30:38.090
It causes fusion to take place, which recreates
the energy, the temperature of the sun--higher

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.389
than the sun, actually.

00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:47.559
So, what they're doing is basically, in the
laboratory, creating the same conditions we

00:30:47.559 --> 00:30:50.000
would have when a nuclear bomb goes off.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.019
So, we will be able to simulate a nuclear
bomb with amazing fidelity in just a few years

00:30:57.019 --> 00:30:58.019
in the future.

00:30:58.019 --> 00:30:59.940
We're already doing a pretty good job of it.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.679
Short answer to your question, several decades
into the future, high confidence because of

00:31:04.679 --> 00:31:08.629
the highly qualified scientists we have in
our laboratories and highly sophisticated

00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:16.470
computers they use, all of which lead to very
high fidelity simulation, which then can be

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.980
used to correct any problems that are disclosed.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:19.980
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: Please.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:25.389
&gt;&gt;male #2: Thank you for honoring us with
your presence.

00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:28.080
I have several questions.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.880
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: Speak up a little bit,
please.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.509
&gt;&gt;male #2: I have several questions.

00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:32.509
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:34.220
George P. Schultz: Just one at a time.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:39.320
&gt;&gt;male #2: The first one is can you help me
understand the set--.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:46.789
Mr. Perry, I believe you said Russia has a
lot of instability around itself and therefore,

00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:50.970
needs to maintain a higher count of nuclear
warheads.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:58.320
But at the same time, are they not the ones
who are exporting nuclear technology to Iran?

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.590
And how does that make them more stable?

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.129
And then, my second question is we seem to
be--.

00:32:06.129 --> 00:32:12.929
I mean, there's a lot of reliance in nuclear
energy on the uranium fuel cycle, whereas

00:32:12.929 --> 00:32:19.519
we know and we have developed technology in
the United States in the '60s around the thorium

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:29.309
nuclear cycle, which has if not zero, a much
smaller amount of fission by-products.

00:32:29.309 --> 00:32:35.769
Is anybody looking at actually offering the
world who needs energy?

00:32:35.769 --> 00:32:39.980
You know, like, perhaps, a less dangerous
solution?

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.389
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: William, do you want to
talk first about Russia's position?

00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:45.389
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:49.480
William Perry: Let me ask Sam to cover that
second point, which I think is the key point.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.991
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: We were frustrated for
a number of years because Russia was, as you

00:32:52.991 --> 00:33:00.519
said, furnishing technology and so forth for
the Bashir reactor in Iran.

00:33:00.519 --> 00:33:04.440
They finally came around to a position after
a lot of discussion to taking back all the

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.809
fuel from that.

00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:13.070
So, there is a closed loop here now and that's
acceptable because Iran has a right for nuclear

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:15.429
power, nuclear resources and so forth.

00:33:15.429 --> 00:33:18.090
Where Iran is going wrong is they've been
cheating.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:21.009
They have not fulfilled their non-proliferation
objectives.

00:33:21.009 --> 00:33:22.499
They have the right to enrich.

00:33:22.499 --> 00:33:24.540
So, Russia is doing better on that count.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:29.279
Where Russia has not been nearly as forthcoming,
and China, as we would like is on tightening

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:31.009
the screws on sanctions.

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:33.620
There are a couple of--.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:38.259
Iran is basically a dark cloud, but a couple
of little light spots on it.

00:33:38.259 --> 00:33:43.429
One is that the Iranian economy is now--and
this is unfortunate for the Iranian people,

00:33:43.429 --> 00:33:48.019
but it's better than conflict--they are suffering
basically.

00:33:48.019 --> 00:33:52.899
Their currency has gone down very appreciably,
so sanctions are beginning to really squeeze.

00:33:52.899 --> 00:33:57.499
And more and more countries are joining in
those, exceptions Russia and China.

00:33:57.499 --> 00:34:01.490
But even in there, they will be negotiating
a lower oil price because the Europeans are

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:02.960
cutting off their oil purchase.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.620
So, the bright, one little bright spot is
the economy is beginning to pinch.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:13.330
And I think we may see a little more forthcoming
from the Iranians--hopefully.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:18.750
The second one is, and this is one, I think,
we need to be very careful about, is certainly

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:25.040
one that I don't put complete faith in, but
the Ayatollah keep saying that developing

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.760
a nuclear weapon or possessing a nuclear weapon
would be a sin.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.050
I think there ought to be some moral engagement,
not by our government necessarily, but by

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.369
the Vatican and other religious leaders.

00:34:35.369 --> 00:34:38.079
I think we need to engage them on a religious
basis.

00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:41.470
Now, do I believe that based on what the Iranian
government is doing?

00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:42.470
No.

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:43.470
I don't.

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:48.060
But I do think it's a place for the Iranians
to land if they ever back down without losing

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.060
face.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.700
So, those are the two very tiny bright spots
that I would point out.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.350
But let me defer to Bill on the alternative
there.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.470
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:34:56.470 --> 00:35:06.300
William Perry: I believe the Russians are
fully convinced that nuclear proliferation

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.510
poses a threat, not just the United States,
but to them as well.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:13.820
In fact, if anything, they're probably in
greater danger of a nuclear attack in their

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.560
country then we are in the United States.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.720
And I think they understand that.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.510
So, by and large, are they doing the things
they need to do in this field.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:27.050
Unfortunately, some of the things they need
to do are adverse to their economic interests.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:31.950
And so, there's a tension there that some
groups to the Russian government are pushing

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:38.900
their, including their atomic energy, which
is called Russ Atom, is more interested in

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.920
selling reactors than they are in the proliferation
issue.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.050
But the Russian government, at the highest
level, is fully aware of the proliferation

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:51.670
danger and has taken some positive actions
to deal with it.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:52.730
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: There was a question--.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:53.730
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.700
George P. Schultz: One thing we could do in
the nego--.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:01.250
There's now a negotiation taking place and
I don't see why we don't table a proposition

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.520
like this.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.850
You say that you're enriching uranium for
peaceful purposes.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:15.240
You are enriching a volume of uranium that
far exceeds anything you might possibly need

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.380
in Iran.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:22.040
Therefore, you must be doing it in anticipation
of selling it into the international market.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.040
Welcome.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:30.800
Let's set up an arrangement whereby we have
supervision of plants and we give you access

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.800
to the international market and put that proposition
out there.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.680
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: There was a question coming
in from another location about applying new

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:46.079
technologies to nuclear reactors including
the use of thorium.

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:53.200
Bill, is there some reactor technology revolution
around the corner that would help us with

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.119
this fuel cycle security issues and also safety
issues of reactors?

00:36:58.119 --> 00:36:59.119
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:03.069
William Perry: You can certainly build new
reactors with much safer technology than any

00:37:03.069 --> 00:37:05.460
of the reactors certainly exist.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:08.720
And we ought to be doing that as we get new
reactors.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.910
One candidate is something called a small
modular reactor, which is now being understudied

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.349
at our Department of Energy.

00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:23.151
But whatever we do in that regard, there's
tons and tons of high-energy uranium out there.

00:37:23.151 --> 00:37:26.620
There are countries all over the world using
reactors.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:30.490
They're going to be using them ten, 20, 30
years into the future.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:34.320
So, that high energy uranium is going to be
out there.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.700
The technology for making highly enriched
uranium is going to be out there.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:43.230
So, even if we pivot to new technologies for
the new reactors, we'll have for decades a

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:48.890
huge problem with the reactors that currently
exist, which have another 20, 30 years lifetime

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:51.010
in them and the uranium that they use.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:55.089
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: We're also trying our
best to get countries around the globe and

00:37:55.089 --> 00:37:59.079
private sector to use low-enriched uranium
instead of high-enriched uranium.

00:37:59.079 --> 00:38:04.090
In some cases, that's a very expensive process
that's gonna take a long time.

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:08.150
That's beginning to happen, slowly, not quite
surely.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.780
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: Please.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.420
&gt;&gt;male #3: Hi.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:17.130
Getting back to the Middle East, Israel has
argued that they need to attack Iran in a

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.890
year or so, or else it's too late.

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:25.510
Obama seems to temper them, but voices strong
support for Israel.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.920
I just was curious about your, anybody's analysis
of the situation.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.920
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:36.940
George P. Schultz: Well, the Israelis understandably
hear the Iranians say they wanna wipe you

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.600
out five times a day.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:44.720
If they have a nuclear weapon on the end of
the missile, they could do it.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.270
So, you believe them.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:59.140
And just when it becomes impossible to really
stop their nuclear weapon program via military

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:02.730
attack, is a question mark.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:06.369
And how good our intelligence is on this is
a question mark.

00:39:06.369 --> 00:39:11.300
The Israelis obviously feel it a lot more
than anybody else because they're closer and

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.210
more threatened.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:21.609
So, I think it's a very difficult issue for
them.

00:39:21.609 --> 00:39:28.530
President Obama did say in the last set of
meetings something very significant I thought.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:34.320
He said, "We are not talking about containing
a nuclear-armed Iran.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:39.210
We're talking about not allowing it to happen."

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.800
That's a big conceptual statement.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.599
And just where it takes him in terms of timing,
I have no idea.

00:39:46.599 --> 00:39:47.599
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:52.849
William Perry: Let me add something to that.

00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:58.319
George is explaining it quite correctly why
the Israelis are concerned, deeply concerned.

00:39:58.319 --> 00:40:03.069
In an existential way, they're concerned about
an Iranian nuclear bomb.

00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:06.730
And they have, indeed, drawn up a plan for
military attack.

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.720
The question is would they press the button
and execute that plan.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:16.680
They understand as well as we understand that
even if that attack succeeds, there would

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:20.740
be a whole host of unintended consequences.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.359
And all of those unintended consequences are
bad.

00:40:23.359 --> 00:40:26.650
So, they do not want to have to press that
button.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:31.089
The way we could help them make the decision
not to press the button, not to conduct that

00:40:31.089 --> 00:40:34.700
attack, is be more successful with our diplomacy.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.369
It has to be, as George has indicated, coercive
diplomacy.

00:40:37.369 --> 00:40:39.569
It has to get the Iranians attention.

00:40:39.569 --> 00:40:40.829
It has to--.

00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:44.220
And that means being much more successful
on sanctions.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.160
Sanctions ordinarily are not effective.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:51.620
Iran, on the other hand, is highly susceptible
to financial sanctions--cutting off their

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.670
access to international banks and so on.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:59.920
And to the extent they have been applied already,
they have really gotten their attention.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.319
But it takes fuller cooperation from Russia
and fuller cooperation from China in order

00:41:04.319 --> 00:41:06.109
to make those completely effective.

00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:10.599
So, part of our diplomacy is directed to Iran,
but another part of our diplomacy needs to

00:41:10.599 --> 00:41:14.260
be directed to Russia and China to get them
fully behind those sanctions.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.059
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: Let me add one other point
here.

00:41:19.059 --> 00:41:24.790
I think military and use of force would be
the last resort, but it is still on the table.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.480
Certainly it's on the table with Israel.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.619
It's on the table explicitly by the President
of the United States.

00:41:29.619 --> 00:41:31.890
I think Iranians need to understand that.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:35.691
I think the other thing the Iranians need
to understand and I think we also have to

00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:41.809
understand it, is it's not, in my view, just
a matter of taking out a few nuclear sites.

00:41:41.809 --> 00:41:45.230
If you're gonna fly over there, you wanna
take out the air defense systems.

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:50.260
And if you were in Israel, you wanna take
out the offensive systems that could be used

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.500
in retaliation.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:56.330
And the Iranians, it seems to me, are not
very wise in identifying the Persian Gulf

00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:01.411
as something they may target to close because
certainly would make military targeters, if

00:42:01.411 --> 00:42:05.980
not political leaders, think that we may need
to take out the Navy and parts of the Air

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.980
Force.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:12.030
So, this is not two or three planes flying
over Iran and dropping a few bombs and taking

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.030
out a site or two.

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.869
The number of sites is multiple.

00:42:14.869 --> 00:42:17.319
I do not think that would stop the Iranians
in the long term.

00:42:17.319 --> 00:42:19.240
It would set them back for a while.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.400
But they need to understand the seriousness
of what they're doing here.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.240
And I think we need to all understand this
does have, as Senator Perry said, certainly

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.131
a lot of consequences if we take it.

00:42:29.131 --> 00:42:31.150
It's not gonna be a one shot proposition.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:33.600
It's gonna go on some time.

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:38.660
The other part of the debate that goes back
and forth is whether you can really deter

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.609
the Iranians if they get a weapon.

00:42:40.609 --> 00:42:44.849
And you can argue that all day long, but you're
in Israel and you hear the threats being made

00:42:44.849 --> 00:42:49.700
over and over again, then you would not put
much comfort in the fact that you might be

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.770
able to deter them with your own capability
of retaliation.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:59.630
So, that argument, it seems to me, is not
very definitive.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:03.740
The final point I would make is it's not just
a matter of deterring the Iranians.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:08.580
Even if you assume you could deter the Iranians,
if the Iranians get nuclear weapons, it's

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.970
gonna set off a chain in the Middle East.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:14.690
I don't know how long it would take, but there's
certainly inevitably gonna be a number of

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.809
other countries that have nuclear weapons.

00:43:16.809 --> 00:43:21.110
The more we have of nuclear weapons, nuclear
programs, enrichment, as we've already discussed,

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:25.520
the more danger we have of--even if they're
not used by a nation--they could be used by

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.420
a terrorist group that doesn't have a return
address if they get the material.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.030
It increases the likelihood of that.

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.270
So, this is not simply about deterrence.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:35.750
It's also a matter at the heart of proliferation.

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:40.900
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: So, there are two questions
from remote locations that are very similar.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.250
I'll read you the one that's currently visible.

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:48.420
"How could we best make the average citizens
aware of the current threat of the need for

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.569
disarmament?

00:43:49.569 --> 00:43:55.180
It seems that the need is clear upon investigation,
but how do we take this message to the masses?"

00:43:55.180 --> 00:44:02.640
Or, as the other questioner said, "How do
we convey this and get ordinary citizens to

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.849
do something about this?"

00:44:03.849 --> 00:44:10.069
And I think Senator Nunn, you've been leading
this effort through an organization that he

00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:12.599
co-chairs called the "Nuclear Threat Initiative."

00:44:12.599 --> 00:44:14.930
He's been working on this for many years.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:20.660
How you do get people who work at Google,
in the Bay Area, around the world, the average

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:25.960
citizens who don't wake up in the morning
thinking about nuclear threats, how do we

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.220
get people to take this matter seriously?

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.490
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: Well, I would--.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:34.540
There are a number of things, but let me just
emphasize one and defer to George and Bill

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.540
on this.

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.450
But we did make a movie.

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:39.140
And we called it "The Nuclear Tipping Point."

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.309
And you can get that movie.

00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:42.210
We give it away free.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.150
George and Bill and Henry and I, we are on
the movie.

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.680
It's more of a documentary.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.309
It lasts about 30 or 40 minutes.

00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:51.040
It's called "The Nuclear Tipping Point."

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:58.020
You can get it at nuclear tipping point dot
org, or you can go to our website called nti.org,

00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.020
or dot-com.

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.020
It works either way.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.660
So, that's one way because it's an informative
movie.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.130
It tells you where we're coming from.

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:08.880
It tells you not only about the vision, but
about all the hard steps we have to take to

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.880
get there.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.930
The other thing is understanding that the
United States has a real stake in the whole

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.540
global security and regional conflict.

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:20.490
My view of it is that we're not talking about
a world without nuclear weapons.

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:23.000
Today's world, simply subtract any nuclear
weapons.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.849
You gotta change a lot of things in the world.

00:45:24.849 --> 00:45:27.290
We talked already about the Middle East.

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:31.980
We've talked about the former Soviet Union
and Russia and their feeling that they depend

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.080
on nuclear weapons.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.359
That's another whole area.

00:45:34.359 --> 00:45:36.569
We gotta talk about North Korea, Northeast
Asia.

00:45:36.569 --> 00:45:38.840
There are a lot of things that have to be
done.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.690
And perhaps the most dangerous of all is India
and Pakistan 'cause these are two heavily

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.730
armed nuclear countries that have been to
war several times.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:51.670
So, all of those things have to be part of
public awareness, but I would say directly

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:54.900
take a look at that movie and I think it'll
be pretty informative.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:55.900
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:59.480
William Perry: Let me build on what Sam was
just saying.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:04.370
We have had, I think, pretty good success--the
small group of us--in getting the message

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:09.339
across to the political elite and to the older
generation.

00:46:09.339 --> 00:46:10.339
What we're trying--.

00:46:10.339 --> 00:46:13.820
But that doesn't, it's not adequate in dealing
with the problem.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.630
We need to get across to the generation we
see here.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:20.350
You may notice the people sitting in this
room don't look much like us.

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:21.420
[laughter]

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.890
We're about two generations separate.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:30.170
We created the problem, I guess, by building
these nuclear weapons in the first place.

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:33.010
Your generation has to be responsible solving
them.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:34.880
But I teach a class at Stanford.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:39.000
And I try to bring this message across to
students there because I want them to take

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
it out.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Just think.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.790
If each person at Google, if even 20 percent
of the Google people, once they get the film

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:49.610
that Sam was talking about—The Nuclear Tipping
Point--.

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:50.610
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: Once they read the book.

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:51.610
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:52.610
William Perry: Or read the book.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:58.760
But whatever you do yourself, what I'm suggesting
is call together, have a meeting with your

00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.960
friends.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.540
Invite ten of your friends to your home.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.839
Show them the movie.

00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:07.790
Show them the book and have a discussion among
yourself.

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:12.240
And then if each of, two or three of those
ten people would do the same thing we start

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:17.520
a multiplicative effect here going on and
start getting it out to hundreds of thousands,

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.910
to millions of people instead of hundreds
of people.

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.859
So that's the sort of thing that needs to
be done.

00:47:21.859 --> 00:47:25.640
And it's really up to your generation to do
it, which is why we're sitting here at Google

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.859
talking to you.

00:47:26.859 --> 00:47:29.970
We're trying to get you interested not in
listening to this and becoming convinced yourself,

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:32.250
but in doing something about it.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:37.289
And the first thing that has to be done is
getting the message out because until the

00:47:37.289 --> 00:47:41.770
message is out, there will not be enough political
will in the US Congress and again in another

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.950
provenance in the world to really take the
action needed.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.040
You cannot take that action, but can take
the action of getting the message out.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.200
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: Phillip Taubman, I would
imagine--.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.200
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.619
George P. Schultz: Here's an example of something
we're doing.

00:47:54.619 --> 00:47:57.660
This subject has great resonance with religious
leaders.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:02.540
I mean, they look at it and said, "Where is
it written that a human being should have

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:05.020
the ability to press a button and kill a million
people?"

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.880
What is this, anyway?

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.359
Where's the morality?

00:48:08.359 --> 00:48:15.140
So, we had an inquiry from Evangelicals a
few years ago.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.839
Said, "We wanna come to Hoover and hear what's
going on."

00:48:18.839 --> 00:48:19.839
So, they came.

00:48:19.839 --> 00:48:21.670
We sent them some reading material.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.260
About 35 came.

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.260
Bill talked with them.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.260
I talked with them.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.359
They spent a day talking about it.

00:48:28.359 --> 00:48:34.170
And they have since issued some very strong
statements on behalf of the Evangelicals.

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:41.600
Then there are the Catholic Bishops, who had
made very strong statements on this.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.490
And then there's a really terrific guy here
in San Francisco named Bill Swing.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:50.410
He's a retired Episcopal Bishop of California.

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:53.280
And he started something called United Religion
Initiative.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.349
He has millions of people all over the world
from all religions.

00:48:57.349 --> 00:49:03.120
And the idea is let's pick a few subjects
on which we might agree and work on them.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.440
And he has picked this subject as one of his
subjects.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.440
So, these are ways of--.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.450
We're always seeking ways to get this message
out, as it says.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:17.589
And to get people to be concerned with the
notion that if they are, then in the end,

00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:20.730
that's gonna get reflected in political decision-making.

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:24.020
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: Let me ask a question
of Phillip.

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.829
You've been an outstanding journalist for
many years.

00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:30.150
You could've written a book on many, many
subjects.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:33.089
What was the motivation for writing this book
at this time for you?

00:49:33.089 --> 00:49:38.220
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: I think the motivation
began in 1988.

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:41.130
I was the Moscow Bureau Chief of the New York
Times.

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:47.670
And for the first time in the history of the
Cold War, the Soviet Union invited a group

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:53.630
of American scientists to come and witness
a nuclear test--underground nuclear test--at

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:56.190
the Soviet test site in Kazakhstan.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:00.030
And I was invited to go along to write about
it.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:05.430
And when you are present at a nuclear test,
even an underground nuclear test, it leaves

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:07.810
a lasting impression.

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:12.020
The bomb went off about a half a mile below
the Earth's surface.

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:18.190
And then I stood there [clears throat] and
watched as a shock wave rippled across the

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:19.579
Kazakhstan Steppe.

00:50:19.579 --> 00:50:24.670
It looked like a tsunami, except it was the
earth was moving.

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:29.910
And it literally rippled across for a mile
and a half until it hit the site where I was

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:31.500
standing with these scientists.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.490
It almost knocked us over.

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:37.309
And that is where the motivation to write
this book began.

00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:41.880
And then, I went to Hiroshima later.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:48.380
I saw what's left there of the damage caused
by our attack on Hiroshima.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:54.200
I went to Los Alamos to try to understand
the origins of the bomb.

00:50:54.200 --> 00:51:00.440
And all of this, as someone who covered national
security affairs during the Cold War, realizing

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:05.799
the degree of danger that we had of a nuclear
conflagration with the Soviet Union.

00:51:05.799 --> 00:51:13.420
I sort of woke up again in 2007 and ‘08,
after this article came out that the four

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:14.420
men wrote.

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:20.130
And I recalled all of these things that I
just cited to you and I said, "There's a book

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:22.369
here that should be written.

00:51:22.369 --> 00:51:26.770
And it should be written because we need to
get people around the world to understand

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:30.710
the threat that exists and to try to do something
about it."

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:32.089
So, let's see.

00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:35.170
We're towards the end of our time frame here.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:40.000
So, we'll do--I apologize--one more question.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Or two.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.410
Let's do two here in Mountain View and then
we'll call it a day.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:45.410
Thank you.

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:46.680
&gt;&gt;male #4: So, I'll make a quick two-part
question.

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.359
The first is about unknown and untracked threats.

00:51:49.359 --> 00:51:50.359
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:51:50.359 --> 00:51:51.359
William Perry: Can't hear you.

00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:55.430
&gt;&gt;male #4: The first one is about unknown
or untracked threats.

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:59.030
You've talked about reduction in strategic
stockpiles.

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:04.020
Do we know enough about what was disseminated
[ inaudible ] network across the world?

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:10.160
Is that material tracked or bounded?

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:16.010
And the second part of that question, somewhat
related, is there enough engagement from leaders

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:23.049
in previous and current US Administrations
to prevent an India-Pakistan nuclear exchange

00:52:23.049 --> 00:52:25.170
following a likely terrorist strike?

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:26.170
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:29.549
George P. Schultz: Let me tackle the last
one.

00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:34.690
It's a really important.

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:35.839
And about when was it?

00:52:35.839 --> 00:52:44.609
Six months ago, Bill and I convened a group
of Indian and Pakistani former foreign ministers,

00:52:44.609 --> 00:52:50.270
former generals and so on, who still have
some influence in their governments.

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:57.360
And we sat at our conference room at Hoover
for two days and discussed what they, how

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.450
they might compose themselves better.

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:06.300
They did produce a very impressive set of
confidence-building measures in the nuclear

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:11.920
area that they all signed on to and presented
to their governments.

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:18.150
Maybe more important, we talked about the
opportunities for economic advancement that

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:22.690
they're missing by virtue of the tension that's
present.

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:26.119
I tried to get that up there.

00:53:26.119 --> 00:53:32.660
But I would say at the same time, I think
Bill, on side conversations with some of the

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.450
Pakistani generals, you say, "Well, what's
worrying you the most?"

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:39.780
And they all say, "A nuclear war."

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:45.180
Because there are all these people who have
a stake in India-Pakistan enmity.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:49.690
That somebody could go and do another Mumbai.

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:53.420
And probably the Indians would not be able
to be as restrained as they were after the

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.180
first Mumbai.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:01.869
And that could lead to an invasion which could
lead to the start of a nuclear exchange.

00:54:01.869 --> 00:54:04.119
So, you gotta be really worried about that.

00:54:04.119 --> 00:54:10.039
That's why I just would underline what Sam
said a minute ago, that it's not the present

00:54:10.039 --> 00:54:11.970
world without nuclear weapons.

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:17.640
You gotta work at these problem areas and
see if there isn't something that can be done

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.869
to settle them down.

00:54:18.869 --> 00:54:20.880
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: Let me add one point.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:26.520
I agree with everything George said on it,
but there was an American Scientific magazine

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:34.470
a year or so ago that just used supercomputers
to play the hypothetical scenario of a hundred

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:36.599
weapons going one off between India and Pakistan.

00:54:36.599 --> 00:54:41.240
And they projected, and even if you divide
this by half or a quarter, it still tells

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:45.119
you the story that a couple hundred million
people would be killed if a hundred weapons

00:54:45.119 --> 00:54:47.440
went off between the two.

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:52.040
But over the next five years, six years, there
would be a billion people or more that would

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.020
starve to death because of the cooling effect
on the atmosphere.

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.660
So, this is not simply a sovereign problem.

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:00.660
This is much bigger.

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.880
It's a global problem.

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:06.510
We have the capacity of using nuclear energy
to really greatly better mankind or we have

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:09.289
the capacity to destroy God's Universe.

00:55:09.289 --> 00:55:12.799
And I think that all of us have a stake in
that all over the world.

00:55:12.799 --> 00:55:18.440
Our network was a bazaar, an arms bazaar.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:23.130
And I don't think we've had enough access
to know how extensive it was.

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:24.260
We know a lot, but not enough.

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.260
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: Right.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.339
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Thank you.

00:55:26.339 --> 00:55:27.339
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: OK.

00:55:27.339 --> 00:55:28.450
Last question.

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:29.450
Thank you.

00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:33.400
&gt;&gt;male #5: So, nuclear energy has potential
to change the world in terms of carbon dioxide

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:37.690
reduction, but a lot of the technologies involve
uranium or plutonium and the fuel cycle in

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:38.690
some way.

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:43.420
If somebody comes out and invents a new nuclear
power technology that does not require uranium,

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:47.310
plutonium, or any of those materials in the
fuel cycle, so that they're--.

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:54.170
You know, in a couple years, there's absolutely
no economic reason to refine uranium or plutonium.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:58.520
Does that give you a tool in the arms and
proliferation reduction?

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:03.099
In other words, there should be no reason
anybody is refining any volume whatsoever

00:56:03.099 --> 00:56:04.099
of those fuels.

00:56:04.099 --> 00:56:05.099
&gt;&gt;Sec.

00:56:05.099 --> 00:56:06.960
George P. Schultz: Obviously, the answer is
yes.

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:13.589
On the other hand, as Bill pointed out, there
are lots of nuclear power plants in operation

00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:19.339
and under construction right now, mostly in
China and India, but a couple in Sam's state

00:56:19.339 --> 00:56:21.049
of Georgia.

00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:23.170
And they're going to going on for quite a
while.

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.170
So,--.

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:27.450
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Do we have enough bomb pits to
keep those busy for a while?

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.450
[Sec.

00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:29.450
George P. Schultz laughs]

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:31.390
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: So, we've got enough nuclear
material out there.

00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:32.390
I agree.

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:33.390
It would be a real breakthrough.

00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:34.470
I mean, hopefully we can get to that.

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:39.690
But there's enough nuclear material out there
to make 40, 50 thousand nuclear weapons.

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:45.319
And so, your generation is gonna have continuing
challenges.

00:56:45.319 --> 00:56:48.819
This is a dynamic, continuing problem, but
we can make a lot of progress.

00:56:48.819 --> 00:56:49.819
&gt;&gt;male #5: Thank you.

00:56:49.819 --> 00:56:50.819
&gt;&gt;Phillip Taubman: Great.

00:56:50.819 --> 00:56:57.359
Well, thank you all and as Bill Perry has
put it, "I hope from this discussion some

00:56:57.359 --> 00:57:05.369
of you will think seriously about these issues
and think about how you might get involved

00:57:05.369 --> 00:57:10.099
in trying to deal with them because it's a
worldwide problem and the last thing we wanna

00:57:10.099 --> 00:57:15.700
have happen is wake up some day and discover
that New York or Washington or London or Paris,

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:20.549
or whatever city has been destroyed by a nuclear
weapon."

00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:21.549
Thank you very much for coming.

00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:23.380
&gt;&gt;Senator Sam Nunn: Just one final word.

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:26.960
You can't imagine how hard it is to take this
subject and write a book about it.

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.490
That is really a challenge.

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:30.039
Phillip has done a great job.

00:57:30.039 --> 00:57:34.859
So, his book is I think very well worth reading.

00:57:34.859 --> 00:57:40.680
And I'm not getting any part of the commission.

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:45.089
[laughter]

00:57:45.089 --> 00:57:49.509
[applause]
