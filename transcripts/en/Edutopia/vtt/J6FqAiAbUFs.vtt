00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:07.656
&gt;&gt;Hi, I'm Judy Willis
and I am a neurologist.

00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:10.756
I've been a neurologist for 15 years

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:15.316
and after the 15 years my
patient practice really changed.

00:00:15.406 --> 00:00:17.496
I started getting so many referrals

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.236
for kids whose teachers
thought they had ADD,

00:00:21.746 --> 00:00:24.856
obsessive compulsive
disorder, staring spells,

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:28.896
seizures petit mal epilepsy,
and the increase was huge and

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:30.866
yet the kids had no
greater incidence of it.

00:00:31.356 --> 00:00:35.276
And I saw the notes were coming from
the school so I visited the schools.

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:38.846
I'd look in the classrooms and I
saw kids who indeed were playing

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:40.906
with everything they could
find, staring out the window,

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:42.686
coloring on someone's chair or book.

00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:46.976
The problem was that the way they
were being taught was lectured.

00:00:47.176 --> 00:00:50.886
There were kids sitting in rows
in first grade just listening

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:52.986
to the information or
filling out worksheets.

00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:57.616
And I know the brain goes into
a state of stress from boredom.

00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:02.036
So it was my idea that I'd go to
school, get a teaching credential,

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:06.066
become a teacher and I did it for the
past ten years I taught second grade,

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:10.396
fifth grade, and seventh grade, and
applied what I know about the brain

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:14.196
to the classroom and found
that just making subtle,

00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:18.656
easy changes that anyone could
do got kids back in the state

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:21.906
of voluntary behavior
and they learned easily,

00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:23.526
and they were successful.

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:24.986
Their mindsets changed.

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:33.146
There's a part of the brain
that is an emotional filter.

00:01:33.586 --> 00:01:35.986
It's called the amygdala, it's
part of the limbic system.

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:40.436
And what information comes into
the brain it will go someplace

00:01:40.436 --> 00:01:44.176
in the brain, but this switching
station in the amygdala determines

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:45.626
where it's going to go in the brain.

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:50.906
So you have information coming in and
the metabolic state of this amygdala,

00:01:51.146 --> 00:01:56.386
how hyperactive it is, how much it's
processing how much energy it's using

00:01:56.786 --> 00:02:00.076
will determine where it
conducts information.

00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:02.776
So if a person is in
a state of stress,

00:02:03.126 --> 00:02:05.126
the amygdala gets highly active.

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:09.176
When that happens the switching
station sends everything that's

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:11.736
coming in to the lower
80 percent of the brain.

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:14.886
That's the part of the brain
that's the animal brain,

00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:16.696
the reactive, involuntary brain.

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:21.186
The only behavior that comes out
of there is a fight-flight-freeze

00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:24.906
which is great for animals because
if they are in some state of stress,

00:02:25.326 --> 00:02:27.666
they shouldn't be processing
and evaluating it.

00:02:28.206 --> 00:02:30.856
But we have the same system
and it doesn't work well for us

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:35.496
because it turns out boredom, when
we do neuroscanning of someone

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:38.526
in a bored state, that
shows their amygdala

00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:42.086
in the same hyperactive
state that other stresses

00:02:42.316 --> 00:02:45.076
such as hearing an alarm or things

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:46.866
that in the wild you'd
want to watch out for.

00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:51.306
So we need to keep that switching
station in a state of low stress.

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:56.346
And boredom, fear, concern about
their language differences,

00:02:56.446 --> 00:02:57.766
fear of reading, test taking,

00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:00.746
those things turn the amygdala
into a big "STOP" sign.

00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:09.136
The question of attention is one
the teachers are curious about.

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:12.896
There's a part of the
brain that decides pretty

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:16.416
on a low level what
information gets our attention.

00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:20.326
And the way it works is exactly the
same in humans as it is in animals.

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:24.256
It's the very first place that
information enters the brain.

00:03:24.646 --> 00:03:27.186
So what do animals need
in the wild to let in?

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:28.136
What sensory input?

00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:30.146
What's changed in their environment?

00:03:30.536 --> 00:03:34.166
So if there is something new in
the classroom, a new picture,

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.366
a great bulletin board,
something that's interesting,

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.546
something that captures
their curiosity.

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:42.266
So when you're walking backwards
before you do negative numbers;

00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:44.156
that is so interesting!

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:45.676
The kids want to know why,

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:50.176
so thinking about getting attention
means getting their curiosity

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:53.146
so they want to know
what you have to teach.

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:02.356
So how do you get students
to focus their attention?

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:05.526
You've gotten it in, they're curious,
but how do you get them to focus

00:04:05.526 --> 00:04:07.396
on something that's
particularly important?

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:10.836
If you want students to
pay particular attention,

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:13.546
have a signal just the way
animals respond to signals.

00:04:13.936 --> 00:04:17.236
What I do is if it's particularly
important I'd love to say

00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:19.156
"Pay attention" but I
know it won't get through,

00:04:19.156 --> 00:04:21.136
I'll take a hat and put it on.

00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:24.306
If I want to say "This
is even really, really,

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:28.416
really important" I'll take the hat,
the cap, and put it on sideways.

00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:30.126
The other one I'll use is color.

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:34.566
I'll have three different colors
pens, pencils, or whiteboard chalk.

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:38.816
So when I hear something that
they say or I'm writing down

00:04:38.816 --> 00:04:40.416
or saying something
that I want to say

00:04:40.416 --> 00:04:41.886
"This is important, pay attention!"

00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:44.546
I can't say it, but
I can use the color.

00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:48.026
So if it's important, if it's
like level-one important,

00:04:48.236 --> 00:04:52.086
I will pick up my green which
means all of them get to pick

00:04:52.086 --> 00:04:55.396
up their green so it's novelty,
it's change, it's color,

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:59.176
and it's emphasized and that's
how they know it's important

00:04:59.176 --> 00:05:00.216
so they'll write it in green.

00:05:00.756 --> 00:05:02.106
I'll write it in green,
they'll write it in green.

00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:03.836
And it goes up if it's
more important.

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:06.986
If I want to say "Pay lots of
attention" then I'll use the yellow,

00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:10.066
and super, super attention,
I'll use the red.

00:05:10.536 --> 00:05:11.986
So they are engaged.

00:05:12.256 --> 00:05:14.226
They are involved and
they're participating

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:16.446
and they have some way
to focus in their notes.

00:05:21.616 --> 00:05:25.776
It's really important now that we
know about these filters to make sure

00:05:25.776 --> 00:05:27.826
that the classroom is
a safe environment,

00:05:28.336 --> 00:05:31.346
that children feel safe
socially, emotionally,

00:05:32.016 --> 00:05:33.726
and safe to participate academically.

00:05:34.186 --> 00:05:36.806
We know only the person
who thinks, learns.

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:39.766
If you don't participate
the brain doesn't get

00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:44.486
to use its great prediction and
memory apparatus which has to do

00:05:44.486 --> 00:05:45.956
with the neuroplasticity of learning.

00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:51.566
But there's one particular
requirement: you must participate.

00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:52.886
You must make a prediction.

00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:54.766
You must basically
answer the question.

00:05:55.236 --> 00:05:58.226
Everybody in the class needs to
answer every question that's asked,

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:02.056
but the biggest fear students
have, the number one fear:

00:06:02.406 --> 00:06:03.876
making a mistake in front of others.

00:06:04.606 --> 00:06:07.336
So we know they need to
do it, but they're scared.

00:06:07.886 --> 00:06:09.936
Simply remove the barrier.

00:06:10.216 --> 00:06:13.436
The barrier is they don't want to
make mistake in front of the class.

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:16.866
They're fine making a
mistake if it's private

00:06:16.866 --> 00:06:18.046
and they're going to get help.

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:21.536
So using whiteboards,
individual whiteboards,

00:06:21.856 --> 00:06:26.306
individual erasable pads,
something where a question is asked

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.896
or something curious is there and
they get to predict why it's there,

00:06:30.336 --> 00:06:34.786
and then when they have something
they think is a good response they

00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:37.406
hold it up, you acknowledge
it, and they put it down.

00:06:37.406 --> 00:06:40.686
No one else sees it, they're
comfortable participating,

00:06:40.946 --> 00:06:44.146
and they're ready to learn
the answer, because otherwise

00:06:44.146 --> 00:06:48.446
if they made a mistake, their brain
is totally into the reactive mode.

00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:55.496
Fifty percent, it's
predicted of the facts

00:06:55.896 --> 00:06:59.266
that we are teaching them
now will have been modified

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:00.896
to some degree by the
time they leave.

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:03.656
So is it great to know
a lot of facts?

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:07.386
I guess for a test but what's
even greater is application.

00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:12.756
So what will be wonderful, what
will be perfect in a perfect world,

00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:16.646
children will enter the twenty-first
century, the opportunities

00:07:16.646 --> 00:07:19.936
and the challenge with
more than just the facts

00:07:20.186 --> 00:07:21.756
but with the tools to apply them.

00:07:22.596 --> 00:07:25.966
The toolkit is executive function;
it's in the prefrontal cortex,

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:28.986
that higher brain, that thinking
brain, the memory-building brain,

00:07:28.986 --> 00:07:30.956
the emotionally analytical brain.

00:07:31.486 --> 00:07:34.886
The prefrontal cortex is the
last part of the brain to mature.

00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:37.946
The myelination that gets
stronger and stronger,

00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:39.306
the networks that take hold.

00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:43.756
That happens at the greatest
rate ever in someone's life

00:07:43.756 --> 00:07:47.656
between about ages 8 and 16 and it
continues on at a pretty good rate

00:07:47.656 --> 00:07:49.406
until 25 and it never stops.

00:07:49.406 --> 00:07:50.986
That's the ability
to change our brains.

00:07:51.576 --> 00:07:54.596
So in the twenty-first century
there are going to be problems

00:07:54.596 --> 00:07:55.606
that we don't even know exist.

00:07:55.606 --> 00:07:57.146
There are going to be opportunities

00:07:57.176 --> 00:08:00.246
that we don't even know
exist, so what will they need?

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.456
What tool will they need?

00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:05.686
The executive functions: judgment,
critical analysis, having kids go

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:09.906
to websites that you pick out
and determine is this accurate?

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.446
How do we know that this is true?

00:08:12.016 --> 00:08:14.016
Can we find another website
that says the opposite

00:08:14.016 --> 00:08:15.246
and how do we know if that's true?

00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:19.526
So knowing how to evaluate
whether a history book is

00:08:19.626 --> 00:08:23.176
from a perspective that's biased
or not, those characteristics,

00:08:23.396 --> 00:08:27.256
the twenty-first century mind
needs and the way to do that best

00:08:27.446 --> 00:08:29.836
in school is to give
kids the opportunities

00:08:30.136 --> 00:08:32.976
to exercise those muscles,
to build the functions

00:08:33.466 --> 00:08:36.986
of long-term goal planning,
risk assessment, evaluation,

00:08:36.986 --> 00:08:38.696
critical analysis, problem solving.

00:08:39.126 --> 00:08:41.626
That's the best training for
the twenty-first century world.

00:08:46.806 --> 00:08:51.006
We have some concern, parents,
teachers, have a lot- some concerns

00:08:51.006 --> 00:08:54.346
of the amount of time
kids play on the computer,

00:08:54.346 --> 00:08:55.546
play with their video games.

00:08:56.086 --> 00:08:59.796
What is it that's happening in a
video game in the brain and how does

00:08:59.796 --> 00:09:01.116
that turn into a classroom model?

00:09:01.856 --> 00:09:06.456
First of all the video game,
you enter it at level one

00:09:07.016 --> 00:09:09.396
but where do you start
playing the game for real?

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:12.876
If you can do what's at level
one on a ten-level videogame,

00:09:13.406 --> 00:09:14.656
you go right to level two.

00:09:14.856 --> 00:09:18.346
If you can do the task at level two
without any effort you just do it,

00:09:18.716 --> 00:09:19.766
you go right to level three.

00:09:20.096 --> 00:09:22.576
Let's say at level
three there's a task

00:09:23.016 --> 00:09:24.166
that you don't really know how to do.

00:09:25.306 --> 00:09:28.256
Then you're at your
achievable challenge level.

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:32.816
Whereas if it made you stay at
level one for two hours or you're

00:09:32.816 --> 00:09:37.046
in the classroom and you already know
how to multiply five times five and

00:09:37.046 --> 00:09:41.066
yet the class is doing
repetition of that drill,

00:09:41.736 --> 00:09:43.766
first of all your brain is going
to get into a stress state,

00:09:44.006 --> 00:09:46.026
and there's not going
to be any interest.

00:09:46.446 --> 00:09:47.606
The brain knows that.

00:09:47.606 --> 00:09:51.006
There's no fun in it because there's
no prediction, there's no reward.

00:09:51.576 --> 00:09:52.096
Here we go.

00:09:52.246 --> 00:09:55.196
Then the brain has entered at
its achievable challenge level.

00:09:55.576 --> 00:09:56.236
That's perfect.

00:09:56.686 --> 00:09:58.116
What else does a videogame do?

00:09:58.856 --> 00:10:00.276
It gives you feedback.

00:10:00.756 --> 00:10:05.386
It gives you incremental
progress feedback so along the way

00:10:05.386 --> 00:10:08.946
in a classroom your feedback might
be the test at the end of the week.

00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:13.306
In a video game you see what's
happening with your effort,

00:10:13.306 --> 00:10:14.866
with your trial and error.

00:10:15.196 --> 00:10:18.216
You're getting corrective feedback
at a time you really want it

00:10:18.386 --> 00:10:21.386
because you want to achieve the
challenge that's right there,

00:10:21.796 --> 00:10:24.156
and you pay attention
to the feedback.

00:10:24.206 --> 00:10:25.036
You use it.

00:10:25.346 --> 00:10:28.116
No one else is seeing you
make mistakes so you're not

00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:30.726
in a risk state so you're attentive,

00:10:30.726 --> 00:10:33.376
you want to know what's
there to be learned.

00:10:33.996 --> 00:10:37.016
Now the best part of it
is you put in the effort,

00:10:37.186 --> 00:10:40.546
they see their score going
up, they get to level four.

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:42.906
And what's waiting for
them at level four?

00:10:43.546 --> 00:10:47.516
No prizes, no money,
no people coming out

00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:50.566
and hugging them giving
them five; harder work.

00:10:51.496 --> 00:10:52.146
What did they get?

00:10:52.306 --> 00:10:53.016
Harder work!

00:10:53.626 --> 00:10:56.106
That should be the classroom
model and we can do it.

00:10:56.106 --> 00:11:01.966
In a classroom thinking about what
level is appropriate for each child,

00:11:01.966 --> 00:11:05.456
what is their achievable challenge
level and doing as much as you can

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:08.716
to differentiate so they're
in groups at that level

00:11:09.466 --> 00:11:14.086
and showing them their incremental
progress toward a goal throughout the

00:11:14.086 --> 00:11:14.896
learning period.

00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:17.116
Looking at their work in group work

00:11:17.356 --> 00:11:19.166
or at their paper while
they're doing it.

00:11:19.526 --> 00:11:22.806
Looking at their whiteboard
responses, showing them progress.

00:11:23.186 --> 00:11:25.886
It's intrinsic reinforcement
that's going to get the dopamine.

00:11:25.946 --> 00:11:26.986
I'm not giving them candy.

00:11:27.496 --> 00:11:29.076
It's their recognizing "Ah!

00:11:29.446 --> 00:11:30.106
I got it!"

00:11:31.096 --> 00:11:33.676
That's the- it lights up the brain.
