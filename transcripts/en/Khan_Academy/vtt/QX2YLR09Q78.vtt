00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.960
This is just a quick review
of what we were

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.050
doing in the last video.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.320
We had this oddly shaped pipe
and the fluid coming in had

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.780
input velocity V1.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.010
The pressure on the left-hand
side pushing to the right is

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.530
P1, and the area of
this hole is A1.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.090
Everything that the same
variables with the 2 on it is

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.800
coming out of the pipe.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.500
What we just set up in that last
video is we said by the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.280
law of conservation of energy,
essentially the joules, the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.080
energy at this point in the
system, or that we're putting

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.570
into the system, has to be equal
to the energy coming out

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.650
of the system.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.360
We used that information to set
up this big equation, but

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.320
it's not too complicated.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.560
We figured out that the work
going into the system was the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.730
input pressure times the mass of
volume over some period of

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.590
time divided by the density of
whatever type of liquid we

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.580
had, which was the
potential energy.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.350
This is just typically mgh,
where the mass is the mass of

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.040
this column of fluid.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.530
We're saying, how much work
was done over some

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.550
period of time T?

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.710
That's the way I would
think about it.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.510
How much energy was there over
some period of time T?

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.920
The kinetic energy over that
period of time would have been

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.300
the mass of this volume of
fluid times its velocity

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.370
squared divided by 2.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.870
That's typical kinetic energy.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.510
Of course, that has to be
equal to essentially the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.250
output energy, and so this is
the output work, or how much

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.060
work a column of water could
do on the output side.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.110
It's an equivalent volume
of water, remember that.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.840
In some period of time T,
whatever volume of water this

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.240
was, an equivalent volume of
water-- maybe it'll be a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.505
longer cylinder now, because
it's going to be going faster.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.040
So on the output side, it's
this longer cylinder that

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.700
we're talking about, but it's
going to be the same volume

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.655
and the same mass.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:06.640
So what we say is that the work
that this column can do

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.650
in that same amount of time
would be the output pressure

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.556
times the mass of this column
divided by the density of the

00:02:13.556 --> 00:02:15.690
column-- which is the same
because the density of the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.230
liquid is the same throughout--
times the mass of

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.820
this column, which is the same
as the mass of this column

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.890
because the volume and the
density hasn't changed, so

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.510
they're the same mass.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.960
Now, this column has more
potential energy.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.060
It's up at h2, which I'm
assuming is higher than h1.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.590
This kinetic energy is just the
mass of this cylinder of

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.780
fluid times its velocity
squared, which is the output

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.840
velocity divided by 2.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.770
This is potential energy
out, and this is

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.920
kinetic energy out.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.930
These equal each other.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.180
This setup is Bernoulli's
equation, but let's see if we

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.150
can clean it up so that we can
get rid of variables that we

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.020
don't have to know about.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.280
One thing that we see is that
there's an m in every term, so

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.990
let's get rid of them.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.860
Divide both sides of
this equation by m.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.320
We get that.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.640
I don't like this density in the
denominator here, so let's

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.590
multiply both sides of this
equation by density, and what

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.800
we're left with is-- let me
write this in a vibrant color.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.470
P, the input pressure, plus--
and we're multiplying

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.320
everything by this rho,
this density.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.050
So we have input pressure plus
rho g h1, the input height,

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:49.760
the initial height, plus
rho v squared over 2.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.290
This is rho v squared over
2, and that equals-- we

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.600
multiplied both sides by rho, so
we get the input velocity,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.990
so that equals the pressure
out plus the density times

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.260
gravity times the
output height.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:16.935
Let's make everything
consistent.

00:04:16.935 --> 00:04:20.145
I wrote 2's here, so let's just
say this is pressure 2,

00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:26.880
this is height 2, plus rho times
the velocity squared.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.180
This is Bernoulli's equation,
and it has all sorts of what I

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.230
would say is fairly neat
repercussions.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.790
For example, let's assume that
the height stays constant, so

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.070
we can ignore these middle
terms. If the height is

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.770
constant, if I have a higher
velocity and this whole term

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.810
is constant, then my pressure
is going to be lower.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.490
Think about it: If height is
constant, this doesn't change,

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.520
but if this velocity increases,
but this whole

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.360
thing is constant, pressure
has to decrease.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.400
Similarly, if pressure
increases, then velocity is

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.430
going to decrease.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.360
That might be a little
unintuitive, but the other

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.270
way, it makes a lot of sense.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.840
When velocity increases, this
pressure is going to decrease,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.050
and that's actually what makes
planes fly and all sorts of

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.330
neat things happen,
but we'll get more

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.550
into that in a second.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.920
Let's see if we can use
Bernoulli's equation to do

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.790
something useful.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.740
You should memorize this,
and it shouldn't

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.710
be too hard to memorize.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.140
It's pressure, and then you
have this potential energy

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.370
term, but instead of mass,
you have density.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.160
You have this kinetic
energy term.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.410
It's not kinetic energy
anymore, because we

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.180
manipulated it some,
but instead of

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.290
mass, you have density.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.070
With that said, let's
do a problem.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.170
I'll keep this down here, since
you probably haven't

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.680
memorized it as yet.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.076
Let me erase everything else.

00:05:53.076 --> 00:05:55.930
That's not how I wanted
to erase it.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.900
That's how I wanted
to erase it.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.960
I wanted to erase it like that
without getting rid of

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.155
anything useful.

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:07.940
OK, that's good enough.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.464
And then let me clean up.

00:06:10.464 --> 00:06:12.568
Clean up all this stuff.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.300
Let's say that I have a cup.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.100
I'll just draw a cup.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.715
It's easier to draw sometimes
then to draw straight lines

00:06:31.715 --> 00:06:32.680
and all of that.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.170
No, that's too dark.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.420
Do purple.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.120
I'm using a super-wide tool.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.440
I have to switch the length.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.410
OK, so that's my cup.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.110
It has some fluid.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.870
Actually, let's say it has a
top to it, and I have some

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.090
fluid in it.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.910
Maybe it happens to be red.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.370
We haven't been dealing with
red fluids as yet,.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.450
Let me-- oh, I didn't
want to do that.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.980
So you know there's
a fluid there.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.780
And let's say that there's no
air here, so this is a vacuum.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.840
Let's say that h-- we don't know
what units are, but let's

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.150
say h meters below the
surface of the fluid.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.350
This is all fluid here.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:26.860
I poke a hole right there, and
fluid starts spurting out.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:32.870
My question to you is, what is
this output velocity of the

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.120
fluid as a function
of this height?

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.000
Let me tell you something
else.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.930
Let's say that this hole is so
small, let's call the area of

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.840
that hole A2, and let's say that
the surface area of the

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.600
water is A1.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.570
Let's say that hole is so small
that the surface area

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:59.560
the water-- let's say that A2
if equal to 1/1,000 of A1.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.270
This is a small hole relative
to the surface

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.340
area of this cup.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.790
With that said, let's see what
we can do about figuring out

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.430
the velocity coming out.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.030
Bernoulli's equation tells us
that the input pressure plus

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.700
the input potential energy plus
the input kinetic energy

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.100
is equal to the output,
et cetera.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.190
So what is the input pressure?

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.690
Well, the input pressure, the
pressure at this point,

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.340
there's no air or no fluid above
it, so the pressure at

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.500
that point is zero.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.020
What is the input height?

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.280
Let's just assume that the hole
is done at height 0, h

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:45.060
equals 0, so the input
height h1 is just h.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.930
If this is 0, then this height
right here is h.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.440
What is the input velocity?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.950
We know from the continuity
equation, or whatever that

00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:00.580
thing was called, that the input
velocity times the input

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.030
area is equal to the
output velocity

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.330
times the output area.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:15.360
We also know that the output
area is equal to 1/1,000 of

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:22.810
the input area-- and this is
area 2-- so we know that the

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:28.510
input velocity times area 1 is
equal to the output velocity

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.230
times 1/1,000 of area 1.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:36.590
We could say area 1 over
1,000 and divide both

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.030
sides by area 1.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.170
We know that the input velocity
is equal to V2 over

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:46.290
1,000, so that's good to know.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:51.790
These are the three inputs into
the left-hand side of

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.570
Bernoulli's equation.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.150
What's on the right-hand side
of Bernoulli's equation?

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.400
What's P2?

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.850
What's the pressure
at this point?

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.820
Oh, I just ran out of time.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.290
I'll continue this into
the next video.
