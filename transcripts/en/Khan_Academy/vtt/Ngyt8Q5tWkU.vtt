00:00:00.557 --> 00:00:01.759
- [Instructor] The dot plot shows the

00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:04.088
number of hours of daily driving time

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:06.255
for 14 school bus drivers.

00:00:07.326 --> 00:00:09.903
Each dot represents a driver.

00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:13.933
So for example, one driver
drives one hour a day.

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.109
Two drivers drive two hours a day.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.537
One driver drives three hours a day.

00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:20.259
It looks like there's five drivers

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.479
that drive seven hours a day.

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:26.274
Which of the following is the closest

00:00:26.274 --> 00:00:28.564
estimate to the percentile rank

00:00:28.564 --> 00:00:32.731
for the driver with a daily
driving time of six hours?

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:35.330
And then they give us some choices.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.699
Which of the following
is the closest estimate

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.959
to the percentile rank for the driver

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:42.880
with the daily driving time of six hours?

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.356
So pause the video and
see if you can figure out

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:48.197
which of these percentiles
is the closest estimate

00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:50.723
to the percentile rank of a driver

00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:53.889
with a daily driving time of six hours,

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:56.042
looking at this data right over here.

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:58.139
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:59.524
So when you think about percentile

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:00.936
you really want to think about,

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:02.198
so let me write this down.

00:01:02.198 --> 00:01:04.362
When we're talking about percentile

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:06.313
we're really saying the percentage

00:01:06.313 --> 00:01:07.230
of the data

00:01:10.608 --> 00:01:12.248
that,

00:01:12.248 --> 00:01:13.939
and there's actually two ways
that you could compute it.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.874
One is the percentage of the data

00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:16.957
that is below

00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:21.261
the amount in question,

00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:23.724
amount in question.

00:01:26.343 --> 00:01:29.343
The other possibility is the percent

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.547
of the data

00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:35.503
that is at or below,

00:01:35.503 --> 00:01:38.086
that is at or below the amount,

00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:43.681
the amount in question.

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:46.882
So if we look at this right over here,

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:48.899
let's just figure out
how many data points,

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.244
what percentage of the data points

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:52.577
are below six hours per day.

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:56.764
So let's see, there are,
I'm just gonna count 'em.

00:01:56.764 --> 00:02:00.097
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:05.822
So seven of the 14 are below six hours.

00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:08.599
So we could just say seven,

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.336
if we use this first technique

00:02:10.336 --> 00:02:13.587
we would have seven of the 14 are below

00:02:13.587 --> 00:02:16.129
six hours per day, and so that would

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.596
get us a number of 50%, that six hours

00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:21.622
is at the 50th percentile.

00:02:21.622 --> 00:02:23.092
If we want to say what percentage

00:02:23.092 --> 00:02:24.801
is at that number or below then

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:27.796
we would also count this
one, so we would say eight,

00:02:27.796 --> 00:02:29.379
or eight out of 14.

00:02:30.245 --> 00:02:33.126
Eight out of 14, which is the same thing

00:02:33.126 --> 00:02:35.292
as four out of seven, and if we wanted

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:37.080
to write that as a decimal, let's see,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.588
seven goes into four point zero zero zero,

00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:42.190
we just need to estimate.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.028
So seven goes into 40 five times.

00:02:45.028 --> 00:02:47.611
35, we subtract, we get a five,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.295
bring down a zero, it goes five times.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.642
Look, it's just gonna be 0.5 repeating.

00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:54.059
So 55.5555%.

00:02:55.447 --> 00:02:57.463
So either of these would actually be

00:02:57.463 --> 00:03:00.827
a legitimate response
to the percentile rank

00:03:00.827 --> 00:03:03.273
for the driver with the daily
driving time of six hours.

00:03:03.273 --> 00:03:06.073
It depends on whether you
include the six hours or not.

00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:07.844
So you could say either
the 50th percentile

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:10.577
or roughly the 55th, or actually

00:03:10.577 --> 00:03:12.700
the 56th percentile if you wanted

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.077
to round to the nearest percentile.

00:03:15.077 --> 00:03:16.995
Now if you look at these choices here,

00:03:16.995 --> 00:03:18.313
lucky for us there's only one choice

00:03:18.313 --> 00:03:20.033
that's even, that's reasonably close

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.055
to either one of those, and
that's the 55th percentile,

00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:25.184
and it looks like the people
who wrote this question

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:27.604
went with the calculation of percentile

00:03:27.604 --> 00:03:30.242
where they include the
data point in question.

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:32.875
So everything at six hours or less,

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:36.375
what percentage of the total data is that?
