00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
 A long time ago in a labretorium far away ... 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.900
 Welcome to Science Wars 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.720
 Chemistry, Bio, Physics and Mathematics! 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.320
 Which field is the best? 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.800
 (PHYSICS) 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.000
 I understand the power and energy 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.820
 quantum mechanics and relativity 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.940
 My field is pure and they trust in me 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.680
 I see the universe like no other 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.780
 You may have mocked me in high school 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.640
 To be uncomfortable and follow the rules 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.400
 Now I have readers. (Wow that very cool) 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.260
 May the mass times be acceleration with you 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.600
 ATOMS! 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.920
 ENTROPY! 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.460
 DARK MATERIAL! 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.460
 STRINGTOERIE! 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.080
 (CHEMISTRY) 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.080
 If you want to feel a band 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 Then I'll give you a good response 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.080
 The element that makes me is the essence 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.340
 Is my satisfaction 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.440
 All the other fields out there are so basic 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.440
 Yes, I am the central science 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.340
 Keep your eye on me, I'll get you loaded 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.380
 If you need me, call me at Avogadro's number 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.080
 If you let me go, take a titrant and press it on your acid buffer 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.620
 Dopamine and serotonin will keep you well and happy 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.480
 So get your bottle and your glass set up 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 And start to understand the world! 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:40.140
 (BIOLOGY) 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.680
 Inside you will find life its beauty 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.840
 From genetics to ecology 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.240
 Symbiosis and not section 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.860
 Except if it is mitosis or the study of fission 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.900
 Even if you don't get through, you'll at least enjoy my class! 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.840
 Evolution brought us together 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.020
 All species sing a song 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.920
 (Mathematics) 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.800
 If you want to learn about our planet I have to say 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.320
 I'm the purest field of study you can take 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.440
 Immune to misinterpretation 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.820
 The blueprint of creation 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.680
 The backbone of all science 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.740
 No benefit, just a constant addition 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.960
 In your mind and observation 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.660
 No devices, just logic and your time 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.380
 And PI 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.600
 Together we will find the answers to life! 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.680
 With Physics - Biology - Chemistry - and Mathematics 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.080
 Can we science!
