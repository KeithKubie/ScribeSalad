there and I was kind of surprised one
that the psychologist didn't all line up

that the psychologist didn't all line up
 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.250
that the psychologist didn't all line up
in a row and say you're right we've been

do things differently in education

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879
do things differently in education
 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.149
do things differently in education
because of the theory and then really in

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159
because of the theory and then really in
 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.460
because of the theory and then really in
the last 15 years I think I've become

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470
the last 15 years I think I've become
 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.170
the last 15 years I think I've become
much more reformist because I've been

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180
much more reformist because I've been
 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.300
much more reformist because I've been
concerned about the ethical dimensions

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310
concerned about the ethical dimensions
 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.330
concerned about the ethical dimensions
of our society that doesn't grow in any

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340
of our society that doesn't grow in any
 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.319
of our society that doesn't grow in any

intelligences theory if we if I look at

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439
intelligences theory if we if I look at
 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.009
intelligences theory if we if I look at
it somewhat autobiographically as a

young person I was very much involved

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629
young person I was very much involved
 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.470

with music I was a serious pianist and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480
with music I was a serious pianist and
 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.080
with music I was a serious pianist and
while I never thought about a career in

music music was and has been very
 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.969
music music was and has been very
important to me and then when I got to

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979
important to me and then when I got to
 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.350
important to me and then when I got to
college I became interested in the other

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360
college I became interested in the other
 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.529
college I became interested in the other
art forms and then I spent a year in

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539
art forms and then I spent a year in
 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.879
art forms and then I spent a year in
England as a fellow and I really

galleries and sort of expanded my
 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.770

went to graduate school in psychology I
 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.180
went to graduate school in psychology I
was stunned at how the arts were never

cognitively meant to be a scientist and
 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.040
cognitively meant to be a scientist and
to think scientifically and we could

to think scientifically and we could
 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.469
to think scientifically and we could
speculate about why that so but the

speculate about why that so but the
 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:55.820

first serious book I wrote was called

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830
first serious book I wrote was called
 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.100
first serious book I wrote was called
the arts and human development and what

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110
the arts and human development and what
 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.839
the arts and human development and what
I said in that book this is in the early

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849
I said in that book this is in the early
 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.899
I said in that book this is in the early
70s as all developmental psychology has

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909
70s as all developmental psychology has
 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.089
70s as all developmental psychology has
thought of science as the apotheosis of

thought of science as the apotheosis of
 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.670
thought of science as the apotheosis of
human development yet science is a

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680
human development yet science is a
 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.860
human development yet science is a
modern Western invention and we might

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870
modern Western invention and we might
 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.810
modern Western invention and we might
will never have invented science and you

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820
will never have invented science and you
 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.149
will never have invented science and you
had no Galileo and Copernicus and Newton

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159

on the other hand arts exist in just

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110
on the other hand arts exist in just
 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.360
on the other hand arts exist in just
about every society and they're very

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370
about every society and they're very
 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.600
about every society and they're very
important so can we conceptualize

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610
important so can we conceptualize
 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.390
important so can we conceptualize
development in terms

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400
development in terms
 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.380
development in terms
the arts as well as the as the sciences

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390
 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.080
nowadays nobody takes extreme positions

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090
nowadays nobody takes extreme positions
 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.650
nowadays nobody takes extreme positions
on that issue maybe someday the press

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660
on that issue maybe someday the press
 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.110
on that issue maybe someday the press
will learn not to take extreme decisions

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120
will learn not to take extreme decisions
 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.010
will learn not to take extreme decisions
on the issue and I certainly believe

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020
on the issue and I certainly believe
 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.890
on the issue and I certainly believe
that every intelligence has a genetic

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900
that every intelligence has a genetic
 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.800
that every intelligence has a genetic
component how else would it exist and

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810
component how else would it exist and
 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.960
component how else would it exist and
every intelligence has a certain

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970
every intelligence has a certain
 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.090
every intelligence has a certain
heritability that's the technical term

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100
heritability that's the technical term
 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.130
heritability that's the technical term
for how much of the variation the

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140
for how much of the variation the
 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.010
for how much of the variation the
population has to do with who you I was

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020
population has to do with who you I was
 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.570
population has to do with who you I was
it with who your biological grandparents

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580
it with who your biological grandparents
 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.670
it with who your biological grandparents
were because that's a better set of

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680
were because that's a better set of
 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.770
were because that's a better set of
genes than your parents because you've

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780
genes than your parents because you've
 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.500
genes than your parents because you've
got four sets rather than then - we

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510
got four sets rather than then - we
 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.120
got four sets rather than then - we
don't know what the heritability is of

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130
don't know what the heritability is of
 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.310
don't know what the heritability is of
most intelligences but from a lot of

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320
most intelligences but from a lot of
 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.110
most intelligences but from a lot of
research we know that on the average

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120
research we know that on the average
 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.020
research we know that on the average
human traits are about 0.5 heritable so

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030
human traits are about 0.5 heritable so
 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.650
human traits are about 0.5 heritable so
you know that means that you know genes

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660
you know that means that you know genes
 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.900
you know that means that you know genes
make big contribution but so do parents

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910
make big contribution but so do parents
 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.380
make big contribution but so do parents
culture the media peers and so on I

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390
culture the media peers and so on I
 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.990
culture the media peers and so on I
guess I've never put it this way before

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000
guess I've never put it this way before
 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.110
guess I've never put it this way before
but maybe what I would say is you know

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120
but maybe what I would say is you know
 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.580
but maybe what I would say is you know
the intelligence is that you favor

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590
the intelligence is that you favor
 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.580
the intelligence is that you favor
probably ones where you have a genetic

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590
probably ones where you have a genetic
 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.770
probably ones where you have a genetic
predisposition but how you use those

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780
predisposition but how you use those
 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.090
predisposition but how you use those
intelligences is going to be

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.100
intelligences is going to be
 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.090
intelligences is going to be
overwhelmingly determined by the culture

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100
overwhelmingly determined by the culture
 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.490
overwhelmingly determined by the culture
in which you're born and your parents

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500
in which you're born and your parents
 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.810
in which you're born and your parents
and what they value and whether you get

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820
and what they value and whether you get
 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.580
and what they value and whether you get
along with your parents and that kind of

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590
along with your parents and that kind of
 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.380
along with your parents and that kind of
thing so the deployment of intelligences

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390
thing so the deployment of intelligences
 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.430
thing so the deployment of intelligences
is probably largely a nurture factor but

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440
is probably largely a nurture factor but
 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.550
is probably largely a nurture factor but
you know if say by the BOK family had

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560
you know if say by the BOK family had
 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.410
you know if say by the BOK family had
loved genes going for it in the music

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420
loved genes going for it in the music
 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.540
loved genes going for it in the music
area and probably you know that was pre

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550
area and probably you know that was pre
 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.250
area and probably you know that was pre
pre pretty likely that they were going

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260
pre pretty likely that they were going
 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.500
pre pretty likely that they were going
to end up being musicians even if they

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510
to end up being musicians even if they
 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.750
to end up being musicians even if they
hadn't even if they've been so to speak

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760
hadn't even if they've been so to speak
 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.040
hadn't even if they've been so to speak
separated at birth and they've been

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050
separated at birth and they've been
 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.429
separated at birth and they've been
raised in another kind of family

00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:13.439
 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.469
the first thing I would say is that life

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479
the first thing I would say is that life
 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:17.239
the first thing I would say is that life
isn't fair and some people are going to

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:17.249
isn't fair and some people are going to
 

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:18.769
isn't fair and some people are going to
be strong a lot of intelligences and

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:18.779
be strong a lot of intelligences and
 

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:21.169
be strong a lot of intelligences and
some people aren't I think of the

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:21.179
some people aren't I think of the
 

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:23.119
some people aren't I think of the
intelligence as a set of computers and

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:23.129
intelligence as a set of computers and
 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:25.219
intelligence as a set of computers and
if you wanted to summarize my theory in

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:25.229
if you wanted to summarize my theory in
 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:26.809
if you wanted to summarize my theory in
a sentence we used to think there was

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819
a sentence we used to think there was
 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:28.579
a sentence we used to think there was
just one general computer in here if you

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:28.589
just one general computer in here if you
 

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:29.779
just one general computer in here if you
were good at one thing you'd be good at

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:29.789
were good at one thing you'd be good at

were good at one thing you'd be good at
everything if you're lousy in one thing

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:31.469
everything if you're lousy in one thing

money for no more than 50 years so let's
 

00:14:02.569 --> 00:14:06.279
money for no more than 50 years so let's
multiply 4 million a year by 50 and we

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:06.289
multiply 4 million a year by 50 and we
 

00:14:06.289 --> 00:14:07.960
multiply 4 million a year by 50 and we
get the 200 million I said no American
