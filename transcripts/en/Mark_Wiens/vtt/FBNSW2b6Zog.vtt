00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.770
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.603
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:03.436
I am in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:04.269
And tonight for dinner,

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:07.550
my friend P'Tan invited
me over to Mihara Tofuten,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.090
Thailand's first all tofu omakase.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.418
So it's dish by dish, piece
by piece chef's table.

00:00:14.418 --> 00:00:18.999
And this will be a totally
new dining experience.

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.582
(upbeat music)

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.653
No tofu, no life.

00:00:30.653 --> 00:00:33.236
(upbeat music)

00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:36.200
When you step in,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.210
to this little, this little courtyard,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.960
it's like a little Japanese oasis.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.950
So outside of the door it's Bangkok.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.900
Inside the door you really
do feel like you're in Japan.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.876
The little garden.

00:00:47.876 --> 00:00:49.885
(upbeat music)

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:52.448
(greeting in a foreign language)

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:53.580
- [Server] It's roasted tea.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.750
It's nice and naughty.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.740
It's got little flavor

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.630
almost like iron, a
little bloody minerality.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.170
Very nice to get the palette going.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.580
- [Mark] Welcome tea, and this is a,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.878
it helps as it cleanse the palette.

00:01:02.878 --> 00:01:04.093
(light upbeat music)

00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:06.433
Kind of has a bitter aroma to it.

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:13.858
You can taste the roasted flavor,

00:01:13.858 --> 00:01:16.330
but it's very, very light.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.078
Very light tasting.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.828
(Japanese music)

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.883
- [Mark] 15 dishes?

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:23.716
- [Server] Yes.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:24.549
- [Mark] Okay.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.680
When the drink is ready,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.738
we're going to start to serve the food.

00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:30.680
Enjoy.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.500
- Any meal that you can see

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.800
where the food is being prepared,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.170
and then it is served to
you course aby course.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.340
As always that adds

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.220
another dimension of an eating experience.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.730
It's going to be the tofu tasting course.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.300
There are 15 different dishes.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.730
So 15 dishes all including tofu.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.880
And I ordered some tea.

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:51.422
- And there's some

00:01:51.422 --> 00:01:52.374
- Oh, that's your tea.

00:01:52.374 --> 00:01:54.647
(both laughing)

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:55.720
- Yes, thank you.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.440
- Okay, my tea is still on its way.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.670
- Would you like to hear a little bit

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.550
about it first of all?

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.800
- [Mark] Yes, please.
- Yeah?

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.957
- [Server] We are starting
off with a oolong from Yaman,

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.670
a beautiful little prefecture

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.500
with some of the cleanest air in Japan.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.350
Which for me, really,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.640
is one of the most
important things, frankly.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.330
We don't wash away the first flush

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.032
like we would with Chinese tea.

00:02:14.032 --> 00:02:16.615
(upbeat music)

00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:21.027
- Wow it's like very, very,

00:02:21.027 --> 00:02:22.450
green tasting.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.283
Almost like,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.370
almost has like a sea

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.913
taste to it, to me.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.529
The first course is fresh homemade tofu.

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:33.480
Something I just learn right now

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.570
that she mentioned to us
is that even the water

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.110
is brought from Japan.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.943
The water comes from the,

00:02:37.943 --> 00:02:40.110
as that has a big impact

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.000
on the taste.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.040
- [Chef] It's from Saga. Saga.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.873
- [Mark] Saga?

00:02:43.873 --> 00:02:45.351
- [Chef] Yes, near Fukuoka, by the way.

00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:46.360
- [Mark] Near Fukuoka
- Yep.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.269
- [Mark] And that's where the tofu,

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.975
command recipes come from here, right?

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:49.890
- [Chef] Of course.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.240
- [Mark] Wow, that texture.

00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:54.965
(chill beats)

00:02:59.488 --> 00:03:01.170
That is so delicate.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.160
You just kind of chew a couple times

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.553
and it just slides down

00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:07.023
kind of like almost liquefies.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.090
And then she unwraps the napkin

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.270
and there will be these
little boxes inside

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.070
filled with delicacies.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.926
So there is a three cart course.

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:18.770
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.603
- [Mark] I guess so.

00:03:19.603 --> 00:03:21.560
I think I'll just put on the sauce.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.650
- [Ying] You have to mix this a little bit

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.500
- [Mark] Oh yeah.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.350
A little bit of sauce.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.683
And then, that almost
feels like a mozzarella.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.841
I should use this spoon (laughs).

00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:41.973
Yeah that's a good call, Ying, thanks.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.990
That really does almost
taste like mozzarella.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.190
Like a fresh mozzarella.

00:03:56.747 --> 00:03:59.150
That is amazing, I cannot
believe that almost tastes like,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.100
it really almost taste like mozzarella.

00:04:02.913 --> 00:04:06.110
(both laughing)

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.120
I was about to come in with my spoon.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.036
And I just like slid right up.

00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:11.543
Sorry about that.

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:15.150
I had a little tofu splatter accident.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.543
Tuna with the skin.

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:19.275
The yuba.

00:04:19.275 --> 00:04:20.660
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.613
That's almost like a thin slice of cheese.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.880
(chill beats)

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.320
It's just like

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.823
a world of different texture.

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.560
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.030
- [Mark] And then, yeah, I think this

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.883
you got to pick this up with your fingers.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:44.016
Good, I got to see the menu.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.530
What was that?

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.640
- [Server] Okara chips.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.870
Chili con carne.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.170
- [Mark] I was gonna say,

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.030
Okay, chili con carne.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.240
It almost has a Mexican taste to it.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.140
(upbeat music)

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.170
- [Server] It's our zuwai crab soup.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.150
The crab is from Hokkaido,
with a really light dashi.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.170
- Okay, so I am also having a tea pairing

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.080
which is also very cool with this meal

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.460
because the food and then the tea

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.987
which is just gonna to
complement of this samaliase.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.950
like deciding and really like,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.790
thoughtfully thinking about the tea

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.210
and how it'll pair with the dish.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.056
We've got like a black tea here,

00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:23.380
and then this is one of the,
our waiter explained that,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.840
this is one of the most umami dishes,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.800
edamame ball,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.250
which is a soybean ball,

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.350
and yuki tofu and dashi
soup with zuwai crab.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.330
Should this be eaten with a spoon, or the,

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.163
- [Ying] Eat with spoon.

00:05:36.163 --> 00:05:36.996
- [Mark] Sure?
- [Ying] Yeah.

00:05:36.996 --> 00:05:37.829
- [Mark] Even with this?

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:40.075
- [Ying] You have to try
your soup first, though.

00:05:40.075 --> 00:05:42.270
- [Mark] Look at that. Okay
I've got to try that first.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.780
Oh man, that looks awesome.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.750
Just feeling from the
chopsticks can just feel

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.860
that incredible textures.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.850
Soft and stuple.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.000
Actually your chopsticks is
kind of like fall through it.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.080
Oh yeah, just breaks up.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.324
Look at that.

00:05:53.324 --> 00:05:55.907
(upbeat music)

00:05:59.348 --> 00:06:00.763
That's like, whoa.

00:06:00.763 --> 00:06:02.308
It's like unbelievably silky.

00:06:02.308 --> 00:06:04.060
Spoon delicate.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.290
'Cause it just sort of dissolves.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.340
Okay, let's try that.

00:06:08.448 --> 00:06:09.709
That ball.

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:12.900
(upbeat music)

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.393
It's so neutral tasting.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.460
But at the same time,

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.000
you can taste the individual ingredients.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.330
So I can taste the soybeans.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.800
And then you taste that fragrance

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.490
of the slightly smoky crab,

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.805
an augment wrapped up in
like 12 different textures

00:06:27.805 --> 00:06:30.450
in your mouth all at the same time.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.350
That's just like pure strands of crab.

00:06:33.424 --> 00:06:34.815
It's the tea that goes with that.

00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:35.648
(sniffing)

00:06:35.648 --> 00:06:37.423
Almost like smoky cinnamon aroma to it.

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.110
Whoa. I really like smoky taste to it.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.943
That's awesome.

00:06:44.943 --> 00:06:46.580
- [Server] So we're going to go to,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.630
we're going to taste the silver needles.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.740
Exquisite and quite rare tea,

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.760
in the jasmine style.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.870
Very very floral and
delicate style of white tea.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.790
It can be served hot,
it can be served cold.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.070
We did a cold extraction

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.500
and serving it cold on ice for you.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.880
- [Mark] Okay the next course
is tofu shirae melon gazpacho.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.790
I am not sure it is
meant to be a one biter,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.190
but I originally try to get it on my,

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.300
balanced it on my chopsticks but, nope,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.720
and a small spoon,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.310
then chef came over and
gave me a big spoon.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.960
Now, there we go.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.803
It's wobbly.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.150
Cucumbers and carrots.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.440
Which kind of burst out
of the jelly foundation.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.211
White tea with this course.

00:07:30.211 --> 00:07:32.711
(chill beats)

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.120
- [Mark] Okay it tasted
like some jasmine to it.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.073
Kind of floral.

00:07:39.073 --> 00:07:41.656
(upbeat music)

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.360
Ying thought this one was the best so far.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.175
She already finished it.

00:07:48.175 --> 00:07:49.349
(Ying laughs)

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:51.970
Kabayaki style grilled saury fish.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:52.860
How do you eat it, Ying?

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.560
Did you like slice it in half?
- [Ying] Nope I basically...

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.580
- [Mark] Can I just, curl up,
okay, like that little rollup

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.260
But as soon as you do that
you can see kind of like

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.730
the fat squeezing out,

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.250
Yeah, let me just,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.842
you can just see the fat in there.

00:08:05.842 --> 00:08:08.425
(upbeat music)

00:08:10.883 --> 00:08:15.883
- [Ying] Eel, eel, eel,
eel, eel, eel, ell, (laughs)

00:08:18.976 --> 00:08:20.393
- Kind of like eel.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.644
Not as fatty as eel, but
yeah it's pretty fatty.

00:08:24.644 --> 00:08:28.497
But that's what makes it so
juicy and so incredibly good

00:08:28.497 --> 00:08:32.359
like belly fish tasting and then roasted.

00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:35.520
(plate squeaking)

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.790
A momen tofu

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.870
which she explained as a kind
of a harder, a firmer tofu.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.790
Like a aubergine eggplant cup.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.790
And then like a yuzu, kind
of like a citrus sauce.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.603
(upbeat music)

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.870
That's awesome.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.707
Bite into that.

00:08:58.707 --> 00:09:01.023
And the tofu just kind of like juices.

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:05.711
So good.

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:06.544
(Ying laughs)

00:09:06.544 --> 00:09:08.890
That's like, almost the texture of tofu.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:09.944
Next dish is zaru tofu,

00:09:09.944 --> 00:09:11.864
and Zaru, because it's cooked in oil,

00:09:11.864 --> 00:09:13.630
prepared in a bamboo,

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.050
the tofu is made in a bamboo basket.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.070
But then it's fried.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.360
It almost looks like a
little muffin or scone.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.380
Firmer than I expected.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.862
It's not like a wobbly, wobbly tofu.

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:24.770
May be because of that skin as well.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.003
But I do want to get
that seasoning as well.

00:09:29.499 --> 00:09:31.999
(chill beats)

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.040
Explosion of tofu.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.120
I like that because the ikura,

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.160
the roes,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.480
they explode with that saltiness.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.319
Which contrasts the
delicateness of the tofu.

00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:51.902
(upbeat music)

00:09:53.763 --> 00:09:55.780
That just kind of like,
brings out the flavor.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.553
Okay, I am excited to try that tea.

00:09:58.553 --> 00:10:01.660
(upbeat music)

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.520
By the way he said it
was a very umami tea,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.510
a very meaty taste.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.700
I do taste the meatiness of it.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.900
And it has a thick texture to it.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.080
- [Server] Would you like
me to mix it for you?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.124
Or would you like to do it yourself?

00:10:12.124 --> 00:10:14.804
(upbeat music)

00:10:14.804 --> 00:10:15.637
- [Mark] Let me try that in one sec.

00:10:15.637 --> 00:10:17.380
- [Server] Yuko was like why
are you wasting all the leafs?

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.650
And I was like what do you mean wasting?

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.483
It's not done yet.

00:10:20.483 --> 00:10:21.710
- You can actually eat the tea leafs.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.363
So you mix in a little bit of soy sauce.

00:10:23.363 --> 00:10:26.330
I have had like fermented
or pickled tea leafs salad

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.820
but this is a totally
different experience.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.570
And this is like totally different.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.033
That's delicious.

00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:39.300
A bitterness but a
bitterness that doesn't like

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.300
go past your tongue.

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:42.200
So you just taste the
bitterness on the surface.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.880
Like oceany tasting.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.853
You taste almost the soil.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.090
The donburi is almost like a rice ball.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.230
But it's like a rice ball puff.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.210
With yuba, the tofu or bean curd skin,

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.980
and abalone, she said,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.010
I think, she said abalone liver in there.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.794
But you can also see the roe on top

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:03.880
and that one looks very...

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.490
like you don't know what texture

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:08.768
or what even temperature

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:09.890
it's gonna be,

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.090
just from looking at it.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.970
Again, everything's subtle.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.910
Oh, I think like the rice.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.120
I missed the rice on that.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.470
But then it just fell
out of that abalone wrap.

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.182
- Try this

00:11:24.182 --> 00:11:25.280
- [Mark] This one she just hands it to you

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.440
and you just gotto take it in your hand

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.580
in a little origami wrapper.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.563
But it's a tofu, deep-fried
tofu like nugget.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.673
Oh it's hot.

00:11:35.673 --> 00:11:37.920
SO like delicate and just
like dissolve in your mouth.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.498
And then you got the
strands of scallops in it.

00:11:41.498 --> 00:11:42.331
That's what it is, scallop.

00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:45.373
And it is a blue cheese soy dressing.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.240
You taste that blue cheese,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.007
soy milk, kind of like
whipped soy milk almost.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.290
Oh I got a lot of blue cheese on that one.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.800
It's vinegar seaweed

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.350
with yuba, bean curd on top.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.350
So may be get a little bit of everything

00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:09.870
It's often how you can feel
the texture in your chopsticks

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.320
before you eat them.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.440
But this one you can tell it's
gonna be a little slimy-ish.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.013
Just look at the strands of it.

00:12:17.184 --> 00:12:20.400
(chill beats)

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.272
This one's one of those things

00:12:21.272 --> 00:12:22.580
that you want to just slurp up

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.000
immediately crunch to it.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.833
like a seaweed,

00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:29.004
and then a very delicate
vinegary sourness to it.

00:12:29.004 --> 00:12:31.587
(upbeat music)

00:12:41.404 --> 00:12:43.126
- [Server] Here's a sukiyaki experience.

00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:46.215
The soup is actually inspired
by a french onion soup.

00:12:46.215 --> 00:12:48.530
And we have grade A wagyu from Hokkaido,

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.997
served with momen tofu and cognac.

00:12:50.997 --> 00:12:53.570
We'll have the chef cook it
for you in about four minute.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:54.709
- [Mark] Okay, great.

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:56.792
(laughs)

00:13:07.484 --> 00:13:08.486
- Good.

00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:11.069
(all laughing)

00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:13.276
- It's one of the courses

00:13:13.276 --> 00:13:14.109
that I was most looking forward to.

00:13:14.109 --> 00:13:15.018
This is the sukiyaki,

00:13:15.018 --> 00:13:16.960
created by Chef Goh.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.770
It's a french onion soup stock.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.300
Really smell that oniony
aroma as he was cooking it.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.303
It was boiling thin and like wrinkly.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.825
(laughs)

00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:29.658
Whoa.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.340
Melt in your mouth beef.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.740
Not too salty.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.200
Really not too salty at all.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.000
A slight, a hint of sweetness.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.833
Wagyu beef.

00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:40.666
Whoa.

00:13:41.796 --> 00:13:44.296
(chill beats)

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.970
You can chew it with you lips.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.290
Re-submerge, go back to the beef,

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.103
and let that just keep
on marinating in there.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:56.893
You have beef.

00:13:58.103 --> 00:14:00.686
(upbeat music)

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.090
So the next course is somen,

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.390
which are noodles but I didn't
even know where they were.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.770
I didn't see them slip
the noodles into this,

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.310
this soy milk,

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.520
dashi stock.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.937
or like but it's cold

00:14:25.937 --> 00:14:29.490
yeah, like a, its milky,
it looks like milk.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:30.480
Almost looks scuff.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.283
It's soy milk, soy milk dashi.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.650
Be easy on the slurping.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.523
The texture of those noodles.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.480
That's awesome.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.370
Perfect simplicity right there.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.527
The tempura, into the
milk, it's all submerge.

00:14:57.527 --> 00:15:00.027
(chill beats)

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:05.970
Amazing.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.323
Okay I have this small pickle.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.610
Give that a little stir.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.413
There're sesame seeds in there as well.

00:15:13.557 --> 00:15:16.057
(chill beats)

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.280
That bumps up the flavor.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.723
Sesame, roasted sesame taste.

00:15:22.723 --> 00:15:25.306
(upbeat music)

00:15:28.804 --> 00:15:29.865
That's amazing.

00:15:29.865 --> 00:15:30.896
That's amazing.

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:33.479
(upbeat music)

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.780
- [Mark] Moving onto dessert.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.880
I think this is the final course.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.470
And then everything again is with tofu.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.510
So like every single course, I mean,

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.710
every single bite had tofu in it.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:47.073
So this is the soy milk
ice cream gelato, it is.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.900
Oh that's great because
it's not too sweet.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.124
And then it just has that again like,

00:15:56.124 --> 00:15:59.060
roasted soy milk taste to it.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.943
Four different flavors, all
again made with soy milk.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.620
This one must be the macha.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.837
I believe this is the macha.

00:16:11.765 --> 00:16:13.083
Whoa.

00:16:13.083 --> 00:16:16.869
- [Ying] Mmmmmm (laughs).

00:16:16.869 --> 00:16:18.030
Happy day at all

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.307
- [Mark] Next time your plate
is already clear (laughs).

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.506
That texture is unbelievable.
(Ying laughing)

00:16:24.506 --> 00:16:29.506
That's like the silkiest, but
like dense and silkiest thing,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.289
may be ever.

00:16:31.289 --> 00:16:33.080
It's like fudge.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.700
That's like soy milk fudge.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.533
Pistachio.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.490
I'm not a desserts guy.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.783
But this is one of the
best desserts may be ever.

00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:49.303
- [Ying] Are they gonna keep up?

00:16:50.897 --> 00:16:52.647
- All the chocolate one at the end.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.113
- He brought in like, all the milk--

00:16:56.113 --> 00:16:58.110
- [Mark] It's like, okay, okay.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.693
(all laughing)

00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:05.630
Okay we ended up talking for a little bit

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.233
because the next dessert
is still coming but,

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.583
how do you pronounce it, Ying?

00:17:10.583 --> 00:17:12.180
- [Ying] Im mee
- [Mark] Im mee

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.180
And we are waiting on one more dessert.

00:17:16.552 --> 00:17:18.736
- [Server] Okay.
- This is the I'Tung special.

00:17:18.736 --> 00:17:20.140
(laughs)

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.920
And it's like what, is this one?

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.437
- It's a mochi.
- A mochi? Okay.

00:17:24.437 --> 00:17:25.785
Made of tofu?

00:17:25.785 --> 00:17:27.220
- Tofu mochi.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.053
- Okay

00:17:28.053 --> 00:17:30.610
- With the tofu powder.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.500
- Awesome.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.563
Wow, that texture.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:34.463
- [Ying] May I take one bite?

00:17:34.463 --> 00:17:36.530
- [Mark] No I don't think
you can, oh the skewer

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.630
I'll take this guy.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:38.963
We get that giggliness.

00:17:42.114 --> 00:17:42.947
Wow

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.063
That texture.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:48.763
This whole night,

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.710
has been about textures

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.110
and that is a totally different texture

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.230
from anything so far.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.520
It feels the way you
think a jelly fish looks.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.006
Kind of like flopping around a little bit.

00:18:03.006 --> 00:18:05.589
(upbeat music)

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.950
We ended up just hanging out
and talking with Khun Tan

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.900
and Khun Tap for a couple of hours.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.023
That was so much fun.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.480
Yeah thank you for the awesome dinner

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.780
and okay I better turn on the
car and roll down the window

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.800
'cause it's already getting hot

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.113
Bangkok style.

00:18:26.591 --> 00:18:27.950
(car engine revving)

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.370
I didn't really know what to expect

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.620
I mean all I knew was it's
going to be a 15 courses,

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.400
or many courses of tofu.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.133
But hearing about the
entire story and Khun Tan,

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.330
I mean, he explained
things throughout the meal

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.115
as well so it's great to have him there.

00:18:44.115 --> 00:18:48.393
But it was one of the purest, may be like,

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.417
I mean I wouldn't call the food simple,

00:18:52.417 --> 00:18:57.417
but the flavors were not strong.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.430
But they were like
completely new flavors for me

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.750
that just well-rounded umami,

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.270
you could actually taste the pure umami.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.520
Thanks again to Khun
Tan for the invitation.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.420
An amazing meal and a
new culinary experience

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.649
for me, for real.

00:19:13.649 --> 00:19:16.950
