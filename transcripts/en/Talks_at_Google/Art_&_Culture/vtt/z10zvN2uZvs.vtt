00:00:04.974 --> 00:00:06.390
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Please join me

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.390
in welcoming, along with her
daughter Petah, Ani DiFranco.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.813
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:21.320
ANI DIFRANCO: Hello, hello.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.820
Thanks.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.530
All right, the mother
ship, pretty cool.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.880
Oh, what's happening to me--

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.458
technical difficulties.

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:39.970
We'll just leave it like that.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.460
You want to sing a tune?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.720
This is not from
my latest record.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.240
This is just a song that Pia
and I like to sing together.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.780
[MUSIC, ANI AND PETAH DIFRANCO]

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.106
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:47.570
Alright.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.546
Thank you.

00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:57.670
Never play a guitar twice.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.850
They get dirty.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.460
So that was what I
was thinking when

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.500
we're singing that
song, that second verse,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.580
have you felt the
longing in a seed?

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.250
That's you.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.840
You're the seed that
I was writing about.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.100
And now you're here
singing with me.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.130
And this is a song that I
wrote for Petah's daddy.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.090
[MUSIC, ANI DIFRANCO AND PETAH

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:11.204
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:11.204 --> 00:08:12.580
All right, thank you.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.610
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Please,
another round of applause,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.943
Ani DiFranco and Petah DiFranco.

00:08:27.943 --> 00:08:30.832
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:34.570
I want to thank you so much.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.289
Thank you for the
beautiful performance

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.190
and thank you for taking
the time to come and visit

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.360
with us here in New York.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.380
I know you have a lifelong
history here in New York.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.470
But having relocated, you've
been spending a lot of time

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.820
back up here.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.610
You were up here a few months
ago to receive a Lifetime

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:51.720
Achievement Award.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.250
Is that correct?

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.440
ANI DIFRANCO: Right,
yes, one of those.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.810
That's always good.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.830
Now I can die.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.400
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
It was really

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.680
the award of a lifetime
is what I'm understanding

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.792
from your reaction.

00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:05.250
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah
no, that's cool.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.730
I love coming back to New York.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:07.230
I do.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.970
I do.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.910
I used to miss it like
a person after I left.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.870
And now I just like to visit.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.370
Like we were talking about,
we were talking all morning

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.620
off mic, so now we
get to talk into mics.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.530
But yeah, now the
whole pace of New York

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.084
and just the circus of it,
I'm like wow, cool, got to go.

00:09:26.084 --> 00:09:27.750
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well you're here now

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.830
for kind of a wild event,
supporting Cindy Lauper

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.340
and the True Colors foundation.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:39.150
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah, a benefit
to help an organization that

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:45.060
tries to get homeless
queer youth a place to be

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.595
and people to support them.

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:48.720
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It
brings me to the first topic

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.095
that I wanted to
discuss with you

00:09:50.095 --> 00:09:53.250
which is, all of
these things speak

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.970
to a career of proactivity.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.860
Looking back through
the years, you

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.340
have always been at the pointed
end of the proactive stick.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.090
And I find that interesting in
the fact that a lot of artists

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.590
are very reactive.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.560
An event would take place
and there's a response to it

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.369
or a tribute to some tragedy
or some sort of reaction based.

00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:20.160
And I'm curious if you
can speak about what

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.030
it's been like to always be in
that proactive space instead

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.830
of just a simple reactive space?

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.360
ANI DIFRANCO: Wow, I dig it.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.490
I dig the whole pointed
end of the stick.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.520
I mean, yeah, jeez.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.460
I mean I guess like
anybody I've just

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:44.910
been trying to speak my truth,
my experience, my thoughts,

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.470
my dreams, my perception
in my songs, in my writing.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:54.450
And I guess
personally I'm always

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.720
compelled by art that
takes risks, you know?

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.450
So I've always kind
of pushed myself.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:08.400
It used to be really hard
to be that in the beginning.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.851
You know, I used to, oh jeez,
who's going to be at the show

00:11:12.851 --> 00:11:13.350
tonight?

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.590
And no, my mom, or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.620
And what will happen
when I say this?

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.005
And a lot happens when
you're jabbing at stuff.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.260
But I would say that the
most important thing that

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.230
happened over the years was
that people came out of nowhere

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.950
and said me too or
thank you, oh my God.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.210
And all of that, hearing
people repeatedly

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.420
say I can't believe you
just said that, thank you,

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.230
just meant so much
more than all the rest.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.220
So it's kind of encouraged
me to just let it go,

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.730
all those ideas of what's
private or personal or

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.860
inappropriate or
this or the other.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.420
It's like, it's all universal.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.732
It's, none of it's unique.

00:12:02.732 --> 00:12:04.440
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
It's curious that you

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.330
said it used to be
more difficult for you

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.720
because I would
almost think that now

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.380
is a time period of difficulty
for anyone being proactive.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:18.510
There's so much tension and so
much pushback to any push that

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.490
is there.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.380
Does that weigh in
at all when you're

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.320
about to step up and make
a bold statement of like--

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.206
you said before it
was the idea of oh,

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:29.580
my mom's in the
audience, I don't

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.650
want to run afoul of that.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.325
But now some fraction
of the world might be.

00:12:35.325 --> 00:12:37.950
ANI DIFRANCO: There's others in
the audience that are even more

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.090
dangerous than mothers.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.480
I mean, I feel like it was
really good to just come out

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.610
of the box with my mouth and
spirit open and just start.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:01.260
I mean when I was a teenager and
I started making my own songs,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.510
I started pushing against that
wall of acceptability and what

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.810
you can and cannot say
and can and cannot be.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.840
And really early on I
just was like, F it.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.210
Just what's going
to happen to me?

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.340
Let's find out.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:23.480
And 25, whatever it's
been, 30 years later,

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.560
I'm in a great position now.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.420
I mean, I weeded out the
riffraff a long time ago.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.420
I think it's much
more difficult if you

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.540
have a secret to let it go.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.780
If you've never had
secrets, it's easier.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.560
It's better.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.780
People used to ask me about
coming out or this or that.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.200
It's like, I was
not in anywhere.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.380
And I think that that, from
my experience, it's better.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.110
It's easier to do it that way.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.430
I had a young lady opening
up my shows recently

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:06.700
who's had some success
with a song online.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.280
And she's a lovely young gal.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.490
And she's sort of just
embarking on a career in music.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.160
And she was saying--

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.540
we were talking after one night
and she said, "I'm pro-choice

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.660
but I'm so afraid.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.440
I come from a traditional
family, I this and I that."

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.790
And I said, "Just say it.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.700
Just say it.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.880
The sooner you say
it, the better.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.450
Say who you are, what you
believe, what you think.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:38.060
Because from there, it
gets easier every day."

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.360
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I'm
going to change my plan now

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.200
that you brought this up because
this idea of just saying it--

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.960
I wanted to speak later in the
conversation about the idea

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.140
of directness and
metaphor, but we sort of

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.400
skipped ahead to that.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.120
In your music there's
use of metaphor,

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.610
but where you
really get masterful

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.580
is with just direct
statements of like you said,

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.560
just taking it head on
and tackling it that way.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.030
And I'm curious if you can talk
about the choices of when you

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.160
want to say something
in a very direct fashion

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.880
or when you reach a little
deeper for metaphor to try

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.277
and mask an idea or
bow an idea as it were.

00:15:16.277 --> 00:15:17.860
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, right.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:26.080
I guess I just always had
maybe just such a burning.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.990
Every time I see
an Eastern medicine

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.950
practitioner they say, oh, your
spleen, whoa with the spleen.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.420
I'm like yeah, I know.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:40.070
You should see my 20
records, spleen music.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:48.370
And it's just, I have such an
urgent need to, I don't know,

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:53.980
beat back lies and
silences that often it

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.850
drives me to just say it.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.050
I think that's just where
my music is coming from.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.850
Sometimes I'm
interested in, how could

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:11.350
you say it without saying
it, or how could you say--

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.850
but oftentimes the
direct route is

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.770
what is most appealing to me.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.580
I used to get a lot of flack for
it, like we were talking about,

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.490
a lot of resistance,
a lot of pushback.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.930
When you were forming
your question,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:31.030
I was remembering the first
time I went to Italy to play.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.850
We were talking earlier
about touring in Europe.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:38.960
And the first time I went to
Italy was probably 20 years ago

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.990
and it was in an age of
flak that I was living in.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.050
And I remember the first
interview I did in Italy

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:53.920
and the dude was like, "So
many artists, they say it

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.850
but they don't say it.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.330
They say the little metaphor.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.180
They hint it.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.500
You just [GRUNTS],,
you just say it."

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.660
And I was like, "That's good?

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.370
You're saying that's good?"

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:08.349
I'd never heard a positive
response to that before.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.230
I just remember that so
clearly that moment of,

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.453
maybe somebody
thinks that's good.

00:17:14.453 --> 00:17:16.869
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well, and
it's curious with the things

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.280
that you've chosen
to talk about.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.230
And we spoke with a
little bit about this

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:24.220
before, as you said,
but I was immediately,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.010
in preparing for
this conversation,

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.110
just went through
the entire catalog

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.880
again of flashing back--

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.190
ANI DIFRANCO: God
bless your heart.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.330
Live to tell the tale.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:35.580
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I'm a fan.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.930
I'm a fan.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.740
But a couple of things
that caught with me

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.970
were this directness.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.200
And I mentioned before
a song like "Gratitude".

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.970
And recently of course #MeToo
has found a life online

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.180
and this sort of
understanding of women

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.400
not being alone in these
situations, and men

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.790
as well in fact.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.830
But I immediately went
back to early '90s

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.610
when "Gratitude" spoke
exactly to that topic.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:07.490
And another example would
be like "To the Teeth".

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.820
This is something that is
decades old at this point

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.420
but it's still
modern day prescient.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.840
When something happens in the
world that you have spoken

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.750
or have tackled directly on
that flashes you back 10 years,

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.980
20 years into your career,
how does that land for you?

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.320
How does how do you
process something

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.140
like #MeToo in light of the
fact that 20 years ago you

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.240
were standing up shouting
exactly these words?

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.290
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah, sometimes
it's a little heart sickening.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.390
"To the Teeth"
that you mentioned

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.470
is a song about gun
violence, a song

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:49.160
I wrote, I don't know, pushing
20 years ago when I thought

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.400
it was completely out of hand.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.455
So to pull that song out now and
play it is kind of devastating.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.630
But things do change.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:09.890
And often you think this
is just the way it is.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.310
We just have to accept
this is the way it is.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.470
And then overnight, it's not.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:18.310
And this #MeToo
moment that we're in,

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:29.270
I think it really speaks to how
much the dominant culture sees

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:37.328
women now compared to when I
was writing that song even.

00:19:37.328 --> 00:19:39.650
The fact that
we're hearing women

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:46.218
give voice to their experience
as though it matters,

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:52.320
because they're becoming
human in the dominant culture,

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.310
and now we have to
accommodate that experience

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.090
and those people and those
voices and those stories.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:04.230
It's one more voice in the
chorus, one more person

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.030
with a seat at the table.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.980
And that's incredible.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.120
I've seen a lot change.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:19.930
I've seen the work of
feminism take hold around me.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:23.310
From when I was first
stomping around saying stuff

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.980
in my songs, I've never--

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.440
and I've actually,
on that tip, I've

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:33.790
never felt a more
receptive world around me

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:38.020
for a lot of my feminist ideas.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:43.030
So I actually am very
hopeful right now.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:46.510
I know it's a time
of great peril--

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:51.310
and I don't mean to underplay
that-- and a time of great pain

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.390
for a lot of people.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.670
But I think that
the possibilities,

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.940
I think it's a
transformative moment

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.669
we're in, especially
around gender politics.

00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:04.210
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And there's
more of that on the new album

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.660
"Binary", which by the way,
in addition to this incredibly

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.220
proactive career, it's also
an incredibly prolific career

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.360
in fact that--

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.570
I read somewhere that it's
the 20th studio album,

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.755
and I read somewhere else
that it was more than 20.

00:21:20.755 --> 00:21:21.960
20 albums?

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.050
ANI DIFRANCO: 20, yeah,
I know, what the hell?

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:24.880
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
That's amazing.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.440
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah,
it's at least 20.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.770
There's 20 of those suckers.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.960
Yeah, I don't know,
a lot of songs.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.240
Kids changed the game though.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.810
I've slowed right down.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.840
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: But not
for lack of just still creating

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.780
amazing artwork.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.970
There's a great album here.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.990
And more stuff speaking to
what we were talking about,

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.480
"Immediately Play
God" jumps to mind.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.780
Maybe you could talk about that
song and the nexus and genesis

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.280
of all that.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.580
ANI DIFRANCO:
Absolutely, thanks.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.860
Yeah, I mean, I started
writing that song

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.570
as kind of a bragging--

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:10.030
I was like, what if I was like
a cross between Howlin' Wolf

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.720
and Missy Elliott, what
would I write right now?

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.260
And I started
talking about my life

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.300
as an emancipated teenager.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:25.200
I was on my own at 15,
and never got nothing

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.480
from nobody kind of.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.940
And then the spleen took over.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:38.200
And something
inside me just felt,

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:44.720
as I was writing this bragging
verse about how I'm not

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.520
a child, and even
when I was a child,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.520
I didn't get a
chance to be a child.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.760
And I was contributing
in society.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.740
I was a part of
society real early on.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.240
And then my brain just sort of
flicked to that to, and so you

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.270
cannot treat me like a child.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:10.700
You tell me what I can and
cannot do with my body,

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:17.480
when I should reproduce,
if I must reproduce.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:23.450
This is the kind of
way that women still

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.200
are treated in society as
though they are inferior,

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.270
as though they are children.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:35.690
So I think of reproductive
freedom as a civil right.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.720
I think that we need to
talk about it that way,

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.800
address it that way.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.450
I think we could use another
constitutional amendment

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.840
to guarantee women civil rights.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:56.280
And so the song just sort
of mutated into a women's

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.430
civil rights anthem.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.935
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
There's a lot of--

00:24:01.935 --> 00:24:05.460
and it speaks to the title
of the album "Binary".

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.752
There's a lot of dual meaning.

00:24:06.752 --> 00:24:09.210
And I find it interesting in
that that story started in one

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.500
place and ended in another.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.580
Talk about the concept of
the entirety of the album

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.960
and being binary and what
that means, where that's

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.980
coming from.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.695
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah,
sure, here at Google.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:30.720
Binary to me, first
of all, is not--

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.750
I'm not really talking
about either/or.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.290
I'm talking about both always.

00:24:39.846 --> 00:24:43.440
I had a run-in with the
internet a few years ago.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.640
It came and found me in my
house and bit my head off

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.260
and chewed on it for a while.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:57.250
And that was sort
of the beginning

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:02.320
of a lot of meditations
on consciousness for me.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:08.560
Oddly, these ones and zeros
came and changed my life

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.910
and hurt me bad.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:18.750
And I started to look
at the whole world

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.860
as made of
relationship, basically,

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.160
that anything that looks
to be a singularity

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.660
is really a relationship.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.040
Everything is two
things spinning.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.650
From our atomic structure to
the planets and the stars,

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.260
there is this fundamental
design I think

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.110
that is made of relationship.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:47.190
And I'm fascinated
by quantum physics.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.840
I don't understand
it, of course,

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.360
but I like to read about it.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.310
And you know quantum
physicists, I

00:25:53.310 --> 00:26:00.040
think through a long
trajectory of masculine science

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.100
have come back around to sort
of the reality of the mother

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.070
that nothing exists on its own.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.720
Only in relationship do we--

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.850
I mean, there's an infinite
field of possibilities

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:18.220
until something is observed.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.460
And they will go on to tell
you that observing something

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.970
affects it, that
observing is interacting.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.050
So with interaction
comes existence.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.000
I guess that's basically--

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.570
Then of course it's not
disconnected with my feminism.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:39.160
And I think that that kind of--

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.760
the ways that my brain has been
spinning for the past few years

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.320
kind of weaves
through this record.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.020
So that's why I
took that song title

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.550
to title the whole record.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.970
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well it
goes even further than that,

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.540
because this is a very
interactive record for you,

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.100
I think, in the creation, right?

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.560
There's a lot of
collaboration on this record,

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.009
and even on the technical
side more collaboration

00:27:02.009 --> 00:27:03.550
than I think you've
done in the past.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:08.050
How was the process of making
"Binary" different or familiar

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.180
or unfamiliar or taking a risk?

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.530
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah, well often
I make records by myself.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:17.860
I crawl into a hole depending
on what's happening in my life

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.080
and make a little record.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:25.120
Or I track the songs with my
band but then I futz on my own

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.730
and finish it or
something solitary.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:33.340
The record right before this
I did a lot in the wee hours

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.330
when the kids were
sleeping in headphones.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.650
This time, my youngest is four.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:47.110
I needed to re-enter
the world and interact

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.870
with adults and creative
beings and people who

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.020
would bring ideas to
the table other than me.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:56.230
So I tracked the tunes
with not just my core

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:02.110
band, rhythm section, but a few
other musicians that I love,

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.450
Ivan Neville in New
Orleans where I live

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:10.030
and Jenny Scheinman, a beautiful
violinist from out west.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.740
And then I just
started calling up

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.110
a lot of other brilliant
friends that I have.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.550
I just didn't want to be alone.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:20.800
I wanted community
back in my life.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.770
So there's a lot of
beautiful players.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.290
And I had this kind of
experience of the best

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:30.010
Christmas ever again
and again where

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:33.220
I sent Justin Vernon a
track and then my present

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.170
comes in the mail,
bing, and I get

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.050
to open it up and see
this beautiful chorus

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.520
that he sang on my song.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.720
It's just the most
wonderful presents came back

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.970
to me from my friends.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.700
And then I even went
one step further

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.070
than I've ever gone which
is to have somebody else mix

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.300
the damn thing.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.130
I've always just,
oh, I can do this.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.930
OK, this sounds good, right?

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:07.630
So my records over the years
are unique and expressive.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:14.650
But having brought a creative
mind like Tchad Blake

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.970
to into this project to mix it--

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.500
remotely, once again.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.910
I just sent him raw tracks
and I got back mixes--

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.960
was breathtaking for me.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.580
It was like, oh wow,
what if you're not crazy

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.680
and you didn't just
write the songs

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:36.680
and you came in with an
objectivity and a skill

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.920
that I will never
achieve in mixing?

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.670
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Different perspective.

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:44.060
ANI DIFRANCO: A
different perspective.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:44.990
What a gift.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:49.620
Wow, you can really do things
in mixing, as it turns out.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.980
So I don't think I'll
ever go back to--

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.870
but you know, I've been
thinking about it lately,

00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:01.010
the emancipated minor thing
when you're just, I got this,

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.130
and you're just taking
care of everything.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:09.020
Now I'm 47 and I'm like, I
don't have to do that anymore.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.209
It took me a while to let go.

00:30:12.209 --> 00:30:13.750
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
It's interesting.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:18.960
It also, I found that in
listening to the record,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.940
it's super broad in
style and approach.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:26.500
And there's some stuff on
here that is very classic Ani

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.770
DiFranco style.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:34.860
There are other tracks on here
that are nearly hip-hop songs.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:39.240
And then "Spider" is
kind of the other end

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.410
of that spectrum in a very
indie rock kind of way.

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.660
Where did the diversity
come from from this album?

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.510
Was it out of this
collaboration or were

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.520
there trigger moments
that were like, hey,

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.594
I'm going to go in this
direction for a reason?

00:30:52.594 --> 00:30:54.302
I'm wondering if you
could speak to that.

00:30:54.302 --> 00:30:55.820
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah,
I mean, I like--

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.420
and I've been hearing
it from others

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:02.670
that the sort of diversity
of the sounds on this record.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:07.260
And I think that has to do
with Tchad and with the people

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.470
that I worked with,
the musicians helping

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:17.190
me translate my songs fully,
helping me manifest them fully.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:23.550
I think that I've always
written really in a diverse way.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:26.350
I never kind of want to
write the same song twice,

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.470
so I'm always, let
me write a song

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:32.790
standing on my head with
a bucket on each foot

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.940
and see what that
turns out like.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:36.930
So I've done that all.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:40.620
But then I think
then I just play it

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.310
like I always do on
whatever's sitting around.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:48.830
And then I just sort of mix
it so you can hear everything.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:52.980
But I think when other
people come in and enhance

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:57.810
the creativity that exists
in the seed of a song

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.550
and they say, well,
this sounds to me

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:05.280
like we should go over here,
and look, I have an ark.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.110
We can go over there.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:10.860
And so I think that these
songs were more fully

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.706
realized in their differences
than maybe on other records.

00:32:15.706 --> 00:32:17.580
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well
I'm happy to hear it

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.024
because it does take a lot
of the music in a new place.

00:32:21.024 --> 00:32:22.440
And speaking of
the new place, you

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.630
spoke a little bit of
the internet coming

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.460
to bite you a few years ago.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.020
Skipping past that, I
know that for "Binary"

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.589
there are some videos.

00:32:30.589 --> 00:32:32.880
And we were speaking about
it before, these were things

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.609
that you had sort of
independently done.

00:32:34.609 --> 00:32:36.150
I wonder if you
could talk about what

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.340
it's like to be, as
we've said before,

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.220
sort of an old-school
artist approaching that way

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.080
and being thrust
into the situation

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.590
to where maybe now just
an album's not enough?

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:51.090
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah,
that seems to be true.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.680
I think I'm just a folk singer.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.860
I'm a working musician and
playing live for people,

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.140
just gathering with people.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:06.200
I think the sort of
fundamental reality of music

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.360
as a social act is
really how I feel it.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.970
And that's what inspires me.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:17.780
And so I think I'm most inspired
on stage, spending an hour

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.610
and a half, two
hours with people

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:25.370
and the kind of connections that
you make and the kind of less

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.650
alone that we all
feel when we walk out

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.110
of there and the kind of--

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.950
that is what I live for.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.410
And the rest of
it, I don't know.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.690
It's all changed around me.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.000
And I'd be the last
to really know.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.750
I think at one point in
the '90s people were like,

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:47.040
Ani, how do you do it?

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.100
Show us how it's done.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.430
And I'm so far from
being that guy anymore.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.930
I'm an old lady.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:59.780
And I have no idea
how you utilize

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:06.020
the technology and the media
to have a career in music

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.880
in the 21st century.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.530
I just know that I like
to play for people live.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:16.790
And if I can just do that and
pay my rent until I'm dead,

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:17.290
I'll be OK.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.915
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
And you were saying

00:34:18.915 --> 00:34:20.630
before that you
felt very flattered

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.449
by your audiences enjoying
that moment with you

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:25.237
and participating in
that moment with you.

00:34:25.237 --> 00:34:27.320
I think it's very common
for people to go to shows

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.420
and the first thing that
happens is the phone comes out.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.503
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah, right.

00:34:30.503 --> 00:34:33.469
We were talking
earlier this morning

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:36.830
and I was telling
Matthew I have noticed

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:43.880
this last couple of months
being on the road, no phones,

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.580
no phones in the audience,
almost no phones,

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.179
which is noticeable.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:54.409
I feel like my audience
were sort of the last

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:58.460
to live the show
through the phone.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:03.960
And when it came into the space
of my shows, I just was like,

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.090
I guess this is the world now.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:13.400
There's nowhere to go that this
is not the world, so all right.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:19.610
And then these last few months,
I got the feeling like people

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:21.130
have had enough.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:22.180
They've had enough.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.650
It's like, I want
an hour and a half

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:28.670
of being in a place and a time
with the people that I'm with.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.960
And it was like,
look at you guys.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.300
There hasn't been one
glowing blue face tonight.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.690
"Con-grat-u-fucking-la-tions",
we're all here.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:42.890
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Maybe the escapism

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:46.940
that the phone initially
served is found again

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.620
in putting the phone
away and actually

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.220
being a part of the experience.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.600
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah,
well we got deep.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.230
We got deep.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.480
You guys missed the
whole conversation that

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.850
meant anything, because yeah--

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:56.150
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well I hope not.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.899
ANI DIFRANCO: --what
going on in new music

00:35:57.899 --> 00:36:02.460
and who are the groundbreaking
young artists of today?

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.570
And of course
Petah will teach me

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.910
everything I need to know
eventually about that.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:14.540
But we were wondering
together if this absorption

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:20.711
into the gizmos, this endless
distraction and entertainment

00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:26.270
has prevented a generation or
two of groundbreaking music.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:27.560
You are not bored.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.800
You are not desperate
for connection.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.990
So you don't have to
go into your garage

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.335
and invent some
convoluted way to connect.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:45.860
But we concluded this morning,
or at least we left off with,

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:53.330
well, maybe we're moving past
the endless days of absorption.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:57.090
Maybe that in itself is becoming
boring for young people.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:02.780
So maybe that next
awesome band or artist

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.955
is right around the corner now.

00:37:05.955 --> 00:37:07.830
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well
the speaking of next

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.450
is a good stepping-off point.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.909
So I will say that
those of you who

00:37:10.909 --> 00:37:12.908
have questions in the
audience, if you guys want

00:37:12.908 --> 00:37:14.340
to make your way
to a microphone,

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.650
I encourage you to do that.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.450
ANI DIFRANCO: Ooh, a spotlight
right by the mic there, nice.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:19.630
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: But
before we get into that,

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.505
I would like to talk a
little bit about next.

00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:25.530
I know that next year has a lot
of interesting things cued up.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.362
Specifically I think Babe
Fest is coming to New York.

00:37:29.362 --> 00:37:30.570
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah, possibly.

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:33.280
That's the big idea, Babe
Fest in Central Park.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.020
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well that would be--

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:34.560
ANI DIFRANCO: Oh I know--

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:34.640
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: --fantastic.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.240
ANI DIFRANCO: --I
hope, I hope, I hope.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:36.990
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Anybody who has

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.200
any contacts with the
SummerStage people at Central

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:39.240
Park--

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.650
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah really,
put in a good word for me.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.858
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: --start
pulling your strings now.

00:37:42.858 --> 00:37:45.160
But what else is
coming up for 2018?

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.195
ANI DIFRANCO: A book.

00:37:46.195 --> 00:37:47.320
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: A book?

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.780
ANI DIFRANCO: A book.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.363
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
What kind of book?

00:37:50.363 --> 00:37:57.420
ANI DIFRANCO: Complete
sentences spelled all correctly.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.560
I'm writing a book.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.534
I'm trying to write a book.

00:38:00.534 --> 00:38:02.700
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Are we
talking narrative fiction

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.350
or are we talking--

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:04.141
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah.

00:38:04.141 --> 00:38:06.560
Well, we're talking memoir.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.630
But of course it's
all made up, right?

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.810
We're all just
making up the story.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:21.090
But yeah, it's an idea that
I've floated for years.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:26.210
Back when I was the
groundbreaking indie girl,

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:30.000
the concept was more like
part manual, part memoir.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.770
This is what happened.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.715
Here's some tips on how--

00:38:33.715 --> 00:38:37.880
of course that
moment is long past.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:43.980
And I'm just writing stories
in a different format.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.630
It's totally different
from songs and poems.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.520
It's crazy to me
that it's all called

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.300
writing because it just feels
so different in its process.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:57.980
But I don't know, I'm
looking for challenges

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.150
I guess as a writer.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.870
So that's what I'm up to.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:01.600
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well when you finish,

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.110
you'll have to come back
and we'll do this all again

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:03.710
and talk about the book.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.830
ANI DIFRANCO: OK, cool.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:06.450
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Let's take
a question from the audience.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:07.310
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:10.570
I had a bunch of questions, but
when I saw you sing with Petah,

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:12.860
I flashed back to 20
years ago in my hometown

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.660
seeing the late
great Chris Whitley

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.840
perform with his
daughter Trixie on stage,

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.995
probably around the
same age as Petah.

00:39:19.995 --> 00:39:22.370
And so I'm kind of curious if
you could talk a little bit

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:26.140
more about the dynamics
of family and music,

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.710
who's nudging who to
perform together on stage?

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.490
How does that decision get made?

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.400
How do you draw a line
balancing exposing her

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.870
to the public on a stage to
photos versus helping her find

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:42.440
her own voice and her art and
her craft for about her music

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.010
future?

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.470
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah, cool, cool.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:51.020
Well I guess first of all I
start with her, what she wants.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.420
She's been touring
with me a lot.

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.450
When she was a kid she was
a road baby until 3 and 1/2.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:00.390
And so she's pro at
the touring business.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:04.430
And at some point more recently
she started saying, "Momma,

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:07.250
I want to come
sing on that song."

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.470
OK, all right.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:15.050
Don't push them on stage but say
yes if that's what they choose.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:20.070
And sorry Petah that
we're talking about you,

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:23.510
but it made all the
difference for me

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:30.100
as a working musician
mom because music

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.620
was my first baby.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:36.760
And the subsequent babies
that have arms and legs,

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.810
they're not well for the guitar.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:43.030
They could be playing happily.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.150
If I pick up the guitar
and try to do my thing,

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.530
they shut me down--

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:49.420
shut me down.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:53.020
No drifting off mommy
into your world.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.600
Me, it's about me now.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.955
And so that was
hard as an artist.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.610
The little guy, I have
a four-year-old son,

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.120
and he's the same way.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.540
But as soon as Petah decided,
I want to be a part of that,

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.430
then it became our thing.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:13.560
It was not my thing anymore.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.430
And it changed the
whole atmosphere

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:21.210
around music, which is
just thrilling to me.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:23.910
I love to sing, but I love
to sing with my daughter

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.500
even more.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.580
So yeah, now that we can make
it something we do together,

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:33.810
it's opened up a
whole new era for us.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.810
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Thank
you for your question.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.317
Let's take one from this side.

00:41:37.317 --> 00:41:38.150
AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.650
Hello.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:39.170
ANI DIFRANCO: Hi.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.253
AUDIENCE: First off, thank
you so much for coming.

00:41:41.253 --> 00:41:44.364
I truly believe you are one of
the greatest poets of our time.

00:41:44.364 --> 00:41:45.530
I don't actually a question.

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.780
This is a statement and I'm
going to embarrass myself.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.610
I apologize.

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:49.610
I was one of those kids.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:50.900
I grew up in rural Michigan.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.532
I was the G in LGBT.

00:41:52.532 --> 00:41:53.990
I didn't have anyone
to talk to you

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.180
and your music got me through.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:59.090
And I would not be
here today without you.

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:00.680
So I just want to say thank you.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.310
ANI DIFRANCO: Thanks man.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.210
AUDIENCE: And I'm
going to get off

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.501
because I'm probably going to--

00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:05.630
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah, I'm
going to cry with you.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:10.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:14.400
Yes, yay, yay to
realness and being

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.810
your whole authentic self.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.900
Thank you for that
moment of vulnerability.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.350
Yeah, I hear that a
lot and it keeps me

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:25.530
going through the hard moments.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.062
That means the world to me.

00:42:28.062 --> 00:42:30.660
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Let's
take another question.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:33.150
AUDIENCE: From me to
you, thank you as well.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:36.540
But I want to kind of know about
how you feel about your brand.

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.060
From an external
standpoint, I kind of

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.920
see you have this
personal brand.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:45.030
As I've been in this side
of you all of these years,

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.520
you now have a business brand.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.380
You have this cultural
brand as well.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.900
And you also now,
I'm hearing, you

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.970
have this other thing
that's mommyhood

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:57.990
that might prevent either the
evolution of or the building

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.940
or separation of another brand.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.710
What does your
brand mean to you,

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:05.020
and can you share your
thoughts of that over time?

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.350
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah, sure.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:09.390
Let me see.

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:14.356
I think what I tend to
do is not think about it.

00:43:19.738 --> 00:43:25.240
When you were talking of all
the elements in your question,

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.130
I was thinking about a story.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.590
I hear so many wonderful
stories from people

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.770
who have intersected my
music or my brand even.

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:42.050
I heard a story and
I get these letters

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:47.310
that are just like food for
me that nourish me back.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.620
And I got a letter
a little while ago

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:54.690
from a mom who is
a fan of my work.

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:58.770
And she had a Righteous Babe
sweatshirt with the logo.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.410
And her young
daughter said to her,

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:09.400
"Mommy, is that a girl or a
boy," striking this muscle man

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.400
pose but with a skirt,
the little logo.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.540
That started off as a
picture of me hamming it up.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:19.270
I hate cameras so I'm going
to do something ridiculous.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:21.190
And then that became
the logo and that

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:24.025
became the brand,
Righteous Babe.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.370
So here's a little
girl who I don't

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:32.660
know talking to her mom who's
found something in my music.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.150
"Mommy, is that
a girl or a boy?"

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:36.170
"That's a girl sweetie."

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:42.340
And then the little girl said,
"Is she so, so, so, so strong?"

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:47.240
And her mom said, "Yeah,
she's so, so, so, so strong."

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.490
And this is all in the letter.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:51.100
And then she said
there was a pause

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:55.760
and her five-year-old said,
"I want to be like that."

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.205
And I thought, whoa, a logo.

00:45:00.842 --> 00:45:02.300
And I don't think
that that's going

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.390
to inspire me to think about
it or how can I tweak the logo

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:10.670
or how can we work the brand
to make more value for--

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:15.270
I just try to do what
I do and be who I am

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:18.330
and write the best song
I can be and give it

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:21.420
in the most honest way
I can in whatever moment

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:27.030
and hope that these peripheral
things, like the idea

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:31.290
of Righteous Babe Records
and the look of that logo,

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.110
will do their own
work around that.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:38.640
If I just stay focused on what
I know and what I'm good at,

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.720
that those peripheral things
like the Righteous Babe Brand--

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.870
I mean, we are trying to
put a festival together.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:49.380
And maybe I have been
inspired by my new team

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:54.910
to contemplate it more, to try
to reinvent Righteous Babe.

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:58.750
And what does it mean to stand
at the intersection of art

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:02.590
and politics and who else
can we help or invite

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:05.380
in or what other
communities can we

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.960
help to bring closer
together, to make

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.360
stronger through a festival,
through a branded festival?

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.650
So I try to work with people
who do understand such things

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.860
and can build
momentum around them.

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:28.204
But for me, I just try to focus
on being an artist and a mom.

00:46:28.204 --> 00:46:30.357
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well it's curious--

00:46:30.357 --> 00:46:31.940
I'm going to follow
up on her question

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:35.570
if I can-- because the label
came out as a function of need,

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:36.860
right?

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.910
You created it
not to, hey, we're

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:40.910
going to make a ton of
money by releasing albums

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:44.520
but because you needed a
way to get your music out.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.910
And I think what I
have noticed is even

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.982
with other artists on the
label, it's not out of,

00:46:48.982 --> 00:46:50.690
hey, we're going to
put this out and make

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:53.600
a ton of money off of it, but
it seems to come from this music

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.770
deserves it.

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:56.480
And I wonder if
that functionality

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.300
speaks to what you were
saying as far as not having

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.430
to worry about
developing the brand,

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:04.010
just doing what
needs to get done?

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:08.180
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah, one of the
great ironies of my existence,

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.450
if you're me, is this
label entrepreneur

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:15.390
that has followed my
name for 30 years.

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:19.280
And it's so not the point.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.740
It's like so far from
the point that it

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.630
used to really bother me.

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:28.840
I mean of all the things that--

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:34.380
songwriter, activist,
entrepreneur?

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:38.290
OK, right, I guess I
started a record company.

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:43.030
But the whole point was really
to avoid the music business.

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:47.230
The whole point was can you
just make music your job

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:55.520
without having to get in
bed with business people,

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.110
bottom line-oriented people?

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.970
Not that the music industry
is full of bad people.

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:04.425
They're good people.

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:10.100
I think I was such
an idealistic kid

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:15.050
that it's sort of I looked at
the intersection of business

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:19.520
and corporate culture and art
and I see commodification.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.980
I see everything
beautiful and vital

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:25.670
come out of the underground
get commodified and die.

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.920
And I thought, [GROANS].

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.170
I don't want to be a
part of that process

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:32.990
even if it serves me.

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:36.690
I find that to be such a bummer.

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:39.260
How else could it be done?

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:44.390
So the point was
really just to never--

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:48.080
I mean for me to just follow
my teachers, the people that

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:55.060
really made my world bigger and
less about myself instead of,

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.420
you should wear this and play
this song and make this happen

00:48:58.420 --> 00:48:59.920
and here's how to--

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.140
it's just like, I don't
want to think about that.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:06.560
I want to think about
something meaningful.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:12.490
So yeah, I guess it was a
problem-solving process.

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:14.440
It was never about
running a record company

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:19.720
but about, how can I
dedicated as little energy

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.339
in that direction as possible?

00:49:21.339 --> 00:49:23.380
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: We
are running close to time,

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.213
so if you guys have a
couple more questions,

00:49:25.213 --> 00:49:26.424
we'll take them please.

00:49:26.424 --> 00:49:28.840
AUDIENCE: All right, so that
actually dovetailed perfectly

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.381
with my question
because I'm curious,

00:49:30.381 --> 00:49:32.980
you said you set up the record
label not out of the joy

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.420
of wanting to be
a business owner

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:37.570
but just to improve your direct
connection with the audience

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:39.520
and be able to get your
music to more people.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.439
And I'm curious if now,
speaking of the ones and zeros,

00:49:42.439 --> 00:49:44.230
do you feel like that's
still working or do

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:45.854
you feel like you're
sort of inevitably

00:49:45.854 --> 00:49:49.120
in an embrace with Spotify,
Pandora, Apple Music, Google

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.800
Play Music, whoever?

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.860
And if you were a young
artist starting out right now,

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:56.663
would you try to leverage those
or would you still try and do

00:49:56.663 --> 00:49:57.704
the whole thing yourself?

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.710
ANI DIFRANCO: I mean, there's
so much to know and navigate now

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:09.330
to have a career in music.

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:13.790
And I certainly don't think I'm
a voice of authority or knowing

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:15.650
necessarily.

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:23.480
My basic approach is to
just let go, to just let go.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:30.140
As the music business and
the world changed around me,

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.760
let go of the old.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:38.370
And is music free now and can
musicians have a job of music

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:42.890
if it's just free and you
can't commodify it at all?

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:46.310
And the little guy is
struggling so much.

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:50.390
And people have asked me what
I make about these streaming

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:52.540
and these--

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:56.860
And for me, I just
have this sort

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:05.150
of really basic primal
approach which is acceptance.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:08.520
I can't control how
people get their music.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.860
I just let it all happen.

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:19.060
And I hope that the--

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:23.630
and I have found through
this just sort of ignorant

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:26.900
but faithful approach
of, I'm going

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:32.600
to apply as much consciousness
as I can through my work

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.220
and hope that that comes
back at me from the universe,

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:43.550
hope that the universe has
a place for me in my art.

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.740
It has found a place for me.

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.390
So I'm one of the lucky ones.

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:50.960
Maybe it's easy for me to
speak in such trite terms

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.455
because the universe has
held me and I'm very lucky.

00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:00.720
But I think that when you are
in the groove, when you're

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.890
in the flow of yourself,
of whoever you are

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:07.920
and whatever you have
to offer, there is

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.290
a place in the universe for it.

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:17.700
So to calculate, [GRUNTS],,
what obstacles change the flow

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:22.030
or guide it, I don't
worry about that.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:24.390
I just worry, am I
being true to myself?

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:27.000
Am I giving what I have to give?

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:34.850
Am I listening to the
voices that guide me?

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:37.670
And so far it's worked out.

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:41.884
[LAUGHS] I don't know if
that's an answer, but--

00:52:41.884 --> 00:52:42.550
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:43.130
Thank you.

00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:44.297
ANI DIFRANCO: Thank you.

00:52:44.297 --> 00:52:46.380
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well,
and I want to thank you.

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.200
I want to thank
you for your time

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.920
to come here and
be with us today.

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.320
I want to thank you
for your thoughtfulness

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.190
in this conversation.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.356
It's really been a pleasure.

00:52:53.356 --> 00:52:54.890
ANI DIFRANCO:
Likewise, thank you.

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:57.090
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And I hope
that everyone else will join me

00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:58.220
in thanking you as well.

00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:03.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:06.050
We are running close to
time, but I'm wondering

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:07.460
if you would do us the honor.

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.870
Would you mind
performing another song?

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:10.536
ANI DIFRANCO: Yeah,
we'll play one more.

00:53:10.536 --> 00:53:12.660
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Excellent, thank you so much.

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:21.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:25.100
ANI DIFRANCO: Where's
Petah, you want to sing?

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.260
Yeah, here we go.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:28.900
So yeah.

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:39.210
So this is that song "Play
God" that we're talking about,

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:40.950
intergenerational feminism.

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:44.380
[MUSIC, ANI AND PETAH DIFRANCO,
 "PLAY GOD"]

00:58:22.636 --> 00:58:23.136
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:23.136 --> 00:58:25.260
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Please
keep the applause going.

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:28.300
Ani DiFranco, Petah DiFranco,
thank you both very much.

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:32.250
[APPLAUSE]
