[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.410
SPEAKER: When you think
of motorcycle gangs,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.570
this is what most
people imagine,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.530
a group straight out
of "Sons of Anarchy."

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.820
Thugs and criminals who probably
terrorize the road every time

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.890
they ride out.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.620
But not all motorcycle
gangs have the same agenda.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.620
MICHAEL SHARKEY: Hi, my
name is Michael Sharkey.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.150
And I'm a portrait photographer
living in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.990
This is just one
of many photographs

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.520
I made that day, documenting
the Empire City Motorcycle Club,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.450
or ECMC, New York City's
oldest gay biker gang.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.950
The club was formed
in 1964 at a time when

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.430
there were very few places
in the city gay men could

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.860
gather and be themselves.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.450
SPEAKER: When the club was
founded more than 50 years ago,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.540
the LGBT rights movement
was in its infancy.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.872
Older members recall how
coming out was a big risk.

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:53.830
MICHAEL SHARKEY: While
researching the project,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.400
I had the pleasure of speaking
with one of ECMC's oldest

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.910
members, Emil Solis.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.240
He joined the Empire
City Motorcycle Club

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.020
with his partner
Bill in June of 1965.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.570
And he told me at that
time it was very dangerous.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.130
You could be fired or evicted
if your boss or landlord didn't

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.970
like the way you looked.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.930
SPEAKER: And there was also the
very real threat of violence.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.370
So the Empire City
Motorcycle Club

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.120
really provided a
sanctuary from all that.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.530
And today members often
comment that it gives them

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.140
a sense of unity too.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.640
MICHAEL SHARKEY: The reason I
titled the series, Brotherhood

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.430
of Men, is because in the
course of speaking to each

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.990
of the members, it became clear
that the most important thing

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.600
to each of them was a sense
of family and camaraderie,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.330
friendship, and brotherhood.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.110
SPEAKER: The Empire City
Motorcycle Club was and still

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.420
is an integral part of the gay
community in New York because

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.350
of the sense of brotherhood.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.520
The club events and group
rides bring together

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.930
like minded folks from
the gay community,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.537
which is what compelled Michael
to take pictures of them.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.370
MICHAEL SHARKEY: As a
gay man, I'm certainly

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.180
drawn to gay subjects.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.070
But I think more generally, I'm
drawn to marginalized groups

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.450
and to subjects that
exist outside the norm.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.480
These guys are obviously
doing something

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.490
that they truly love and
with people that they really

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.670
care about.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.700

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.200
