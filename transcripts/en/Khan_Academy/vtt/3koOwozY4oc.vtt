00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.660
SAL: Everything we've been
dealing with so far in our

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.410
journey through chemistry has
revolved around stability of

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.420
electrons and where electrons
would rather

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.340
be in stable shells.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.030
And like all things in life,
if you explore the atom a

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.400
little further you'll realize
that electrons are not the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.250
only stuff that's going
on in an atom.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.250
That the nucleus itself has some
interactions, or has some

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.140
instability, that needs to
be relieved in some way.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.740
That's what we'll talk
a little bit

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.420
about in this video.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.110
And actually the mechanics of
it are well out of the scope

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.450
of a first-year chemistry
course, but it's good to at

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.570
least know that it occurs.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.110
And one day when we study the
strong nuclear force, and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.570
quantum physics, and all the
like, then we can start

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.280
talking about exactly why these
protons and neutrons,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.810
and their constituent quarks
are interacting

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.530
the way they do.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.500
But with that said, let's
at least think about the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.890
different types of ways that a
nucleus can essentially decay.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.880
So let's say I have a
bunch of protons.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.830
I'll just draw a couple here.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.590
Some protons there, and I'll
draw some neutrons.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.430
And I'll draw them in
a neutral-ish color.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.780
Maybe let me see, like a
grayish would be good.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.520
So let me just draw some
neutrons here.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.020
How many protons do I have?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.300
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:32.410
I'll do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9 neutrons.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.870
And so let's say this is the
nucleus of our atom.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.960
And remember-- and this is, you
know, in the very first

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.860
video I made about the atom--
the nucleus, if you actually

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.320
were to draw an actual atom--
and it's actually very hard to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440
drawn an atom because it has
no well-defined boundaries.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.050
The electron really could be,
you know, at any given moment,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.980
it could be anywhere.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.740
But if you were to say, OK,
where is 90% of the time the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.700
electron is going to be in?

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.680
You'd say, that's the radius,
or that's the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.750
diameter of our atom.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.530
We learned in that very first
video that the nucleus is

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.450
almost an infinitesimal portion
of the volume of this

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.340
sphere where the electron
will be 90% of the time.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.080
And the neat takeaway there
was that, well, most of

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.280
whatever we look at in life
is just open free space.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.030
All of this is just
open space.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.400
But I just want to repeat
that because that little

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.660
infinitesimal spot that we
talked about before, where

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.320
even though it's a very small
part of the fraction of the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.030
volume of an atom-- it's
actually almost all of its

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.890
mass-- that's what I'm zooming
out to this point here.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.240
These aren't atoms, these
aren't electrons.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.580
We're zoomed into the nucleus.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.040
And so it turns out that
sometimes the nucleus is a

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.650
little bit unstable, and it
wants to get to a more stable

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.400
configuration.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.600
We're not going to go into the
mechanics of exactly what

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.700
defines an unstable nucleus
and all that.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.880
But in order to get into a
more unstable nucleus,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.820
sometimes it emits what's called
an alpha particle, or

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.470
this is called alpha decay.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.440
Alpha decay.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.220
And it emits an alpha particle,

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.160
which sounds very fancy.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.450
It's just a collection of
neutrons and protons.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.690
So an alpha particle is two
neutrons and two protons.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.850
So maybe these guys, they just
didn't feel like they'd fit in

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.110
just right, so they're a
collection right here.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.740
And they get emitted.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.070
They leave the nucleus.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.870
So let's just think what
happens to an atom when

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.050
something like that happens.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.500
So let's just say I have some
random element, I'll just call

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.310
it element E.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.020
Let's say it has p, protons.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.660
Actually let me do it in the
color of my protons.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.800
It has p, protons.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.550
And then it has its atomic mass
number, is the number of

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.510
protons plus the number
of neutrons.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.480
And do the neutrons
in gray, right?

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.590
So when it experiences
alpha decay, what

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.180
happens to the element?

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.890
Well, its protons are going
to decrease by two.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.040
So its protons are going
to be p minus 2.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.450
And then its neutrons are also
going to decrease by two.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.320
So its mass number's going
to decrease by four.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.100
So up here you'll have p minus
2, plus our neutrons minus 2,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.940
so we're going to
have minus 4.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.080
So your mass is going to
decrease by four, and you're

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.700
actually going to turn
to a new element.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.710
Remember, your elements
were defined by

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.250
the number of protons.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.630
So in this alpha decay, when
you're losing two neutrons and

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.300
two protons, but especially the
protons are going to make

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.460
you into a different element.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.860
So if we call this element 1,
I'm just going to call it,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.590
we're going to be a different
element now, element 2.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.050
And if you think about what's
generated, we're emitting

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.600
something that has two protons,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.340
and it has two neutrons.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.740
So that its mass is going to be
the mass of the two protons

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.790
and two neutrons.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.830
So what are we emitting?

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.810
We're emitting something that
has a mass of four.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.170
So if you look at, what is two
protons and two neutrons?

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.740
I actually don't have the
periodic table on my

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.880
[? head. ?]

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.020
I forgot to cut and paste
it before this video.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.680
But it doesn't take you long on
the periodic table to find

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.280
an element that has two protons,
and that's helium.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.590
It actually has an atomic
mass of four.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.390
So this is actually a helium
nucleus that gets emitted with

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.080
alpha decay.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.875
This is actually a
helium nucleus.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.170
And because it's a helium
nucleus and it has no

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.420
electrons to bounce off its two
protons, this would be a

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.950
helium ion.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.490
So essentially it has
no electrons.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.830
It has two protons so it
has a plus 2 charge.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.110
So an alpha particle is really
just a helium ion, a plus 2

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.960
charged helium ion that is
spontaneously emitted by a

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.780
nucleus just to get to
a more stable state.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.670
Now that's one type of decay.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.850
Let's explore the other ones.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.050
So let me draw another
nucleus here.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.640
I'll draw some neutrons.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.310
I'll just draw some protons.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.920
So it turns out sometimes that
a neutron doesn't feel

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.710
comfortable with itself.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.710
It looks at what the protons do
on a daily basis and says,

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.560
you know what?

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.780
For some reason when I look into
my heart, I feel like I

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.220
really should be a proton.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.640
If I were a proton, the entire
nucleus would be a little bit

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.870
more stable.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.860
And so what it does is, to
become a proton-- remember, a

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.180
neutron has neutral charge.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.060
So what it does is, it
emits an electron.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.070
And I know you're saying, Sal,
you know, that's crazy, I

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.760
didn't even know neutrons
had electrons in

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.900
them, and all of that.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.050
And I agree with you.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.810
It is crazy.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.750
And one day we'll study
all of what exists

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.540
inside of the nucleus.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.880
But let's just say that it
can emit an electron.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.206
So this emits an electron.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.460
And we signify that with its--
roughly its mass is zero.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.830
We know an electron really
doesn't have a zero mass, but

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.970
we're talking about
atomic mass units.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.130
If the proton is one, an
electron is 1/1,836 of that.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.940
So we just round it.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.250
We say it has a mass of zero.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.380
Its mass really isn't zero.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.670
And its charge is minus 1.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.370
It's atomic, you can kind
of say its atomic

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.200
number's minus 1.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.570
So it emits an electron.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.760
And by emitting an electron,
instead of being neutral, now

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.020
it turns into a proton.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.090
And so this is called
beta decay.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.780
And a beta particle is really
just that emitted electron.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.480
So let's go back to our little
case of an element.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.940
It has some number of protons,
and then it has

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.980
some number of neutrons.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.340
So you have the protons and
the neutrons, then you get

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.660
your mass number.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.480
When it experiences beta
decay, what happens?

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.490
Well, are the protons changed?

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.890
Sure, we have one more proton
than we had before.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.500
Because our neutron
changed into one.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.410
So now our protons are plus 1.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.186
Has our mass number changed?

00:08:25.186 --> 00:08:26.720
Well let's see.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.750
The neutrons goes down
by one but your

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.365
protons go up to by one.

00:08:30.365 --> 00:08:32.380
So your mass number
will not change.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.789
So it's still going
to be p plus N.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.909
so your mass stays the same,
unlike the situation with

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.679
alpha decay, but your
element changes.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.039
Your number of protons
changes.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.975
So now, once again, you're
dealing with a new element in

00:08:47.975 --> 00:08:49.470
beta decay.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.530
Now, let's say we have
the other situation.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.360
Let's say we have a situation
where one of these protons

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.750
looks at the neutrons and
says, you know what?

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.240
I see how they live.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.170
It's very appealing to me.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:13.910
I think I would fit in better,
and our community of particles

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.660
within the nucleus would
be happier if

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.160
I too were a neutron.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.770
We'd all be in a more
stable condition.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.660
So what they do is, that little
uncomfortable proton

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.340
has some probability of
emitting-- and now this is a

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.020
new idea to you-- a positron,
not a proton.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.070
It emits a positron.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.670
And what's a positron?

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.390
It's something that
has the exact

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.610
same mass as an electron.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.890
So it's 1/1836 of the
mass of a proton.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.200
But we just write a zero there
because in atomic mass units

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.830
it's pretty close to zero.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.006
But it has a positive charge.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.720
And it's a little confusing,
because they'll

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.630
still write e there.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.440
Whenever I see an e, I
think an electron.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.720
But no, they say e because it's
kind of like the same

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.500
type of particle, but instead
of having a negative charge,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.830
it has a positive charge.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.080
This is a positron.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.450
And now we're starting to get
kind of exotic with the types

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.210
of particles and stuff
we're dealing with.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.730
But this does happen.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.920
And if you have a proton that
emits this particle, that

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.370
pretty much had all of its
positive charge going with it,

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:26.330
this proton turns
into a neutron.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.160
And that is called positron
emission.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.350
Positron emission is usually
pretty easy to figure out what

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.510
it is, because they call
it positron emission.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.880
So if we start with the same E,
it has a certain number of

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.500
protons, and a certain
number of neutrons.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.190
What's the new element
going to be?

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.060
Well it's going to lose
a proton. p minus 1.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.770
And that's going to be turned
into a neutron.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.620
So p is going to
go down by one.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.030
N is going to go up by one.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.020
So that the mass of the whole
atom isn't going to change.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.550
So it's going to be p plus N.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.500
But we're still going to have
a different element, right?

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.230
When we had beta decay,
we increased

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.150
the number of protons.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.700
So we went, kind of, to the
right in the periodic table or

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.070
we increased our, well,
you get the idea.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.440
When we do positron emission,
we decreased

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.700
our number of protons.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.300
And actually I should
write that here in

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.510
both of these reactions.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.460
So this is the positron
emission, and I'm left over

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.060
with one positron.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:29.430
And in our beta decay, I'm left
over with one electron.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.670
They're written the
exact same way.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.660
You know this is an electron
because it's a minus 1 charge.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.890
You know this is a positron
because it

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.810
has a plus 1 charge.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.170
Now there's one last
type of decay that

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.140
you should know about.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.810
But it doesn't change the number
of protons or neutrons

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:43.970
in a nucleus.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.940
But it just releases a ton of
energy, or sometimes, you

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.350
know, a high-energy proton.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.160
And that's called gamma decay.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.510
And gamma decay means that these
guys just reconfigure

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:52.795
themselves.

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:54.460
Maybe they get a little
bit closer.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.990
And by doing that they release
energy in the form of a very

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:03.180
high wavelength electromagnetic
wave. Which is

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.820
essentially a gamma, you could
either call it a gamma

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.230
particle or gamma ray.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.450
And it's very high energy.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.720
Gamma rays are something you
don't want to be around.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.460
They're very likely
to maybe kill you.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.130
Everything we did, I've said
is a little theoretical.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.000
Let's do some actual problems,
and figure out what type of

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.750
decay we're dealing with.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.400
So here I have 7-beryllium
where seven

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.900
is its atomic mass.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.520
And I have it being converted
to 7-lithium So

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.440
what's going on here?

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.000
My beryllium, my nuclear mass
is staying the same, but I'm

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.240
going from four protons
to three protons.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.130
So I'm reducing my number
of protons.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.840
My overall mass hasn't
changed.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.100
So it's definitely
not alpha decay.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.960
Alpha decay was, you know,
you're releasing a whole

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.770
helium from the nucleus.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.960
So what am I releasing?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.410
I'm kind of releasing one
positive charge, or I'm

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.560
releasing a positron.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.940
And actually I have this
here in this equation.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.040
This is a positron.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.140
So this type of decay of
7-beryllium to 7-lithium is

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.760
positron emission.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.830
Fair enough.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.400
Now let's look at
the next one.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:19.870
We have uranium-238 decaying
to thorium-234.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:25.140
And we see that the atomic mass
is decreasing by 4, minus

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.910
4, and you see that your atomic
numbers decrease, or

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.270
your protons are decreasing,
by 2.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.810
So you must be releasing,
essentially, something that

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.390
has an atomic mass of four,
and a atomic number

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.680
of two, or a helium.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.210
So this is alpha decay.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:46.100
So this right here is
an alpha particle.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.400
And this is an example
of alpha decay.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.110
Now you're probably saying, hey
Sal, wait, something weird

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.850
is happening here.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.630
Because if I just go from 92
protons to 90 protons, I still

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.430
have my 92 electrons out here.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.750
So wouldn't I now have
a minus 2 charge?

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:08.270
And even better, this helium I'm
releasing, it doesn't have

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.090
any electrons with it.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.390
It's just a helium nucleus.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.700
So doesn't that have
a plus 2 charge?

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.180
And if you said that, you would
be absolutely correct.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.510
But the reality is that right
when this decay happens, this

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.290
thorium, it has no reason
to hold on to those two

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.050
electrons, so those two
electrons disappear and

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.840
thorium becomes neutral again.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.480
And this helium, likewise,
it is very quick.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.040
It really wants two electrons
to get stable, so it's very

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.880
quick to grab two electrons out
of wherever it's bumping

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.460
into, and so that
becomes stable.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.305
So you could write
it either way.

00:14:40.305 --> 00:14:42.250
Now let's do another one.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.500
So here I have iodine.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:46.670
Let's see what's happening.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:51.020
My mass is not changing.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.790
So I must just have protons
turning into neutrons or

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.560
neutrons turning into protons.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.810
And I see here that I
have 53 protons, and

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.800
now I have 54 protons.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.060
So a neutron must have
turned into a proton.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.830
A neutron must have
gone to a proton.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.160
And the way that a neutron
goes to a proton is by

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.620
releasing an electron.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.360
And we see that in this
reaction right here.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.880
An electron has been released.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.130
And so this is beta decay.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.380
This is a beta particle.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.750
And that same logic holds.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:32.780
You're like, hey wait, I just
went from 53 to 54 protons.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.440
Now that I have this extra
proton, won't I have a

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.750
positive charge here?

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.480
Well you would.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.810
But very quickly this might--
probably won't get these exact

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.740
electrons, there's so many
electrons running around-- but

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.950
it'll grab some electrons from
some place to get stable, and

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.080
then it'll be stable again.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.890
But you're completely right in
thinking, hey, wouldn't it be

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.690
an ion for some small
amount of time?

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:52.900
Now let's do one more.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.210
So we have to 222-radon-- it
has atomic number of 86--

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:01.720
going to 218-polonium, with
atomic number of 84.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.540
And this actually is an
interesting aside.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:08.380
Polonium is named after Poland,
because Marie Curie,

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.220
she-- At the time Poland, this
was at the turn of the last

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.120
century, around the end of the
1800's, Poland didn't exist as

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.910
a separate country.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.540
It was split between Prussia,
Russia, and Austria.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.590
And they really wanted let
people know that, hey, you

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.000
know, we think we're
one people.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.170
So they discovered that when,
you know, radon decayed it

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.730
formed this element.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.430
And they named it after their
motherland, after Poland.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.880
It's the privileges of
discovering new elements.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.090
But anyway, back
to the problem.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:35.930
So what happened?

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.210
Our atomic mass went
down by four.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.430
Our atomic number went
down by two.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.580
Once again, we must have
released a helium particle.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.070
A helium nucleus, something
that has an atomic mass of

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:51.160
four, and an atomic
number of two.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.100
And so there we are.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.950
So this is alpha decay.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.810
We could write this as
a helium nucleus.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.145
So it has no electrons.

00:16:59.145 --> 00:17:00.820
We could even say immediately
that this would have a

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.990
negative charge, but
then it loses
