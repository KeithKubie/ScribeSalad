predators and of course Impala of such a
 

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.350

they can run really really fast and they

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:13.700
they can run really really fast and they
 

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.600
they can run really really fast and they
can also movie so believe it or not when

so yes they can run very very fast and

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:58.550
so yes they can run very very fast and
 

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.460
so yes they can run very very fast and
that is how they escape but it's really

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:00.470
that is how they escape but it's really
 

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.730
that is how they escape but it's really
fascinating when you watch an Impala

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:02.740
fascinating when you watch an Impala
 

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.040
fascinating when you watch an Impala
face a predator let's say for example a

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.050
face a predator let's say for example a
 

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.650
face a predator let's say for example a
leopard and they really stand their

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:08.660
leopard and they really stand their
 

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.290
leopard and they really stand their
ground they sort of operate on as long

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:11.300

it will actually face a standoff for the

it will actually face a standoff for the
 

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.980
it will actually face a standoff for the
predator and for example them back to

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:17.990
predator and for example them back to
 

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.080
predator and for example them back to
the leopards they can actually back down

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.090
the leopards they can actually back down
 

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.220

as soon as they know they've been seen
it's game over so they won't actually

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:23.420
it's game over so they won't actually
 

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.470
it's game over so they won't actually
run away from a predator if they can see

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480
run away from a predator if they can see
 

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.730
run away from a predator if they can see
it they will stand their ground they

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:27.740
it they will stand their ground they
 

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.500
it they will stand their ground they
will face it they will look at the

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:29.510
will face it they will look at the
 

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.600
will face it they will look at the
predator and of course they will alarm

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:31.610
predator and of course they will alarm
 

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:36.760

characters outside of the cat's so you
know I don't know where they are or

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:23.220

and if it's her daughter remember that

00:40:50.579 --> 00:40:50.589
and if it's her daughter remember that
 

00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:53.250
and if it's her daughter remember that
the calf will live in the herd all its

the calf will live in the herd all its
 

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.160
the calf will live in the herd all its
days and so she and her mother will

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:56.170
days and so she and her mother will
 

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.599

probably live together until the mother

almost zero to do with raising their

mother which species other than me Oh
 

00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:54.210

mum um why don't we go with the worst

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:54.220
mum um why don't we go with the worst

mothers first who the mothers that are

00:56:58.530 --> 00:56:58.540
mothers first who the mothers that are
 

00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:02.400
mothers first who the mothers that are
the worst by our well I guess those

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:02.410
the worst by our well I guess those
 

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:05.850
the worst by our well I guess those
would be mothers that would allow their

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:05.860
would be mothers that would allow their
 

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:09.000
would be mothers that would allow their
youngsters to be devoured eaten or

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.010
youngsters to be devoured eaten or
 

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:11.910
youngsters to be devoured eaten or
killed because they knew that they would

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920
killed because they knew that they would
 

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.160

just make another one again fairly

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:14.170
just make another one again fairly
 

00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:23.600
just make another one again fairly
quickly and so perhaps mothers like

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:23.610
 
 

00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:27.540
 
scrub hares perhaps

00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:27.550
 
 

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:29.880
 
I don't know how much protection scrub

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:29.890
I don't know how much protection scrub
 

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:31.950
I don't know how much protection scrub
her mother's afford there leverets I

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960
her mother's afford there leverets I
 

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.890
her mother's afford there leverets I
don't think very much at all and

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900
don't think very much at all and
 

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.660
don't think very much at all and
obviously if we're looking at birds will

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:36.670
obviously if we're looking at birds will
 

00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:38.430
obviously if we're looking at birds will
we doubt we know the two worst mothers

00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440
we doubt we know the two worst mothers
 

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.490
we doubt we know the two worst mothers
that we all worst parents at jhummer

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:41.500
that we all worst parents at jhummer
 

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.560

knows the Egyptian geeses in its just

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:43.570
knows the Egyptian geeses in its just
 

00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:45.480
knows the Egyptian geeses in its just
reminding me the Egyptian geese that

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:45.490
reminding me the Egyptian geese that
 

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:47.190
reminding me the Egyptian geese that
live at above us again but though

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200
live at above us again but though
 

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.280
live at above us again but though
they're individuals not species and I

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:50.290
they're individuals not species and I
 

00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:55.770
they're individuals not species and I
suppose then by the same criteria we

00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:55.780
suppose then by the same criteria we
 

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.900
suppose then by the same criteria we
should say that the mothers that put the

00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:57.910
should say that the mothers that put the
 

00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:59.640
should say that the mothers that put the
most effort into their youngsters and

00:57:59.640 --> 00:57:59.650
most effort into their youngsters and
 

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:01.560
most effort into their youngsters and
the most protective of them should be

00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:01.570
the most protective of them should be
 

00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:04.380
the most protective of them should be
those that get the crown of being the

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:04.390
those that get the crown of being the
 

00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:07.800
those that get the crown of being the
best mothers and then I suppose it must

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:07.810
best mothers and then I suppose it must
 

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:09.870
best mothers and then I suppose it must
go to the social animals and so lions

00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880
go to the social animals and so lions
 

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.960
go to the social animals and so lions
and as Lauren said hyenas and elephants

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:12.970
and as Lauren said hyenas and elephants
 

00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:17.250
and as Lauren said hyenas and elephants
I think of all of those the mother most

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:17.260
I think of all of those the mother most
 

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:23.090
I think of all of those the mother most
likely to do damage to some things

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:23.100
likely to do damage to some things
 

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.820
likely to do damage to some things
threatening her babies would be an

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:26.830
threatening her babies would be an
 

00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:29.580
threatening her babies would be an
elephant mother and so I suppose by

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:29.590
elephant mother and so I suppose by
 

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:31.320
elephant mother and so I suppose by
human standards that would make them

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:31.330
human standards that would make them
 

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:34.320
human standards that would make them
very good mothers you know hyenas will

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:34.330
very good mothers you know hyenas will
 

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:37.290
very good mothers you know hyenas will
abandon a den if it's too threatened by

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:37.300
abandon a den if it's too threatened by
 

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:38.700
abandon a den if it's too threatened by
the Predators they'll leave their babies

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:38.710
the Predators they'll leave their babies
 

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:42.090
the Predators they'll leave their babies
inside and just disappear we know that

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:42.100
inside and just disappear we know that
 

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.460
inside and just disappear we know that
mother Lions will abandon their cubs in

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:44.470
mother Lions will abandon their cubs in
 

00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:47.880
mother Lions will abandon their cubs in
extremis so I think we should vote for

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:47.890
extremis so I think we should vote for
 

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:51.450

six sets of molars that come at

01:11:54.089 --> 01:11:54.099
six sets of molars that come at
 

01:11:54.099 --> 01:11:55.680
six sets of molars that come at
different stages throughout their life

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:55.690
different stages throughout their life
 

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:59.100
different stages throughout their life
and the last set the six set comes in at

01:11:59.100 --> 01:11:59.110
and the last set the six set comes in at
 

01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:01.530
and the last set the six set comes in at
normally on average around forty seven

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:01.540
normally on average around forty seven
 

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:04.319
normally on average around forty seven
years old and they were wear down from

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:04.329
years old and they were wear down from
 

01:12:04.329 --> 01:12:06.089
years old and they were wear down from
the different food that they eat and of

01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:06.099
the different food that they eat and of
 

01:12:06.099 --> 01:12:08.609
the different food that they eat and of
course grassy is compared to trees and

01:12:08.609 --> 01:12:08.619
course grassy is compared to trees and
 

01:12:08.619 --> 01:12:11.430
course grassy is compared to trees and
shrubs is obviously very very different

01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440
shrubs is obviously very very different
 

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.379
shrubs is obviously very very different
grass as much softer and it won't wear

01:12:13.379 --> 01:12:13.389
grass as much softer and it won't wear
 

01:12:13.389 --> 01:12:15.600
grass as much softer and it won't wear
the teeth down as much whereas branches

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:15.610
the teeth down as much whereas branches
 

01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:19.109
the teeth down as much whereas branches
trees and shrubbery will of course where

01:12:19.109 --> 01:12:19.119
trees and shrubbery will of course where
 

01:12:19.119 --> 01:12:21.600
trees and shrubbery will of course where
the teeth die much faster so that is why

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:21.610
the teeth die much faster so that is why
 

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:23.760
the teeth die much faster so that is why
the elephants in Namara are said to live

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:23.770
the elephants in Namara are said to live
 

01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:25.950
the elephants in Namara are said to live
a little bit longer than the elephants

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:25.960
a little bit longer than the elephants
 

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.470
a little bit longer than the elephants
here in Juma and the Kruger because they

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480
here in Juma and the Kruger because they
 

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.600
here in Juma and the Kruger because they
do eat trees need to eat shrubbery they

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:30.610
do eat trees need to eat shrubbery they
 

01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:32.850
do eat trees need to eat shrubbery they
wear their teeth down faster and once

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:32.860
wear their teeth down faster and once
 

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.459
wear their teeth down faster and once
that last set of molars is completely

01:12:35.459 --> 01:12:35.469
that last set of molars is completely
 

01:12:35.469 --> 01:12:37.709
that last set of molars is completely
worn down the elephants are not able to

01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719
worn down the elephants are not able to
 

01:12:37.719 --> 01:12:41.100
worn down the elephants are not able to
feed any longer and that is normally the

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:41.110
feed any longer and that is normally the
 

01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:43.169
feed any longer and that is normally the
main cause of death with an older

01:12:43.169 --> 01:12:43.179
main cause of death with an older
 

01:12:43.179 --> 01:12:44.910
main cause of death with an older
elephants and that's why they are said

01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920
elephants and that's why they are said
 

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.819
elephants and that's why they are said
to live approximately around sixty years

01:12:47.819 --> 01:12:47.829
to live approximately around sixty years
 

01:12:47.829 --> 01:12:50.189
to live approximately around sixty years

predators are coming out it really is
 

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.230
predators are coming out it really is
time for them to sort of get together

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:29.240
time for them to sort of get together
 

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.600
time for them to sort of get together
and huddle together or find their hiding

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:31.610
and huddle together or find their hiding
 

01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:33.730
and huddle together or find their hiding
spot or go into their burrow depending

01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:33.740
spot or go into their burrow depending
 

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:35.080
spot or go into their burrow depending
on which animal you're talking about

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:35.090
on which animal you're talking about
 

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:38.800
on which animal you're talking about
and of course and the coral reefs is the

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:38.810
and of course and the coral reefs is the
 

01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:41.290
and of course and the coral reefs is the
exact same it's no different you will

01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:41.300
exact same it's no different you will
 

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.090
exact same it's no different you will
have your daytime fish that are thinking

01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:43.100
have your daytime fish that are thinking
 

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.160
have your daytime fish that are thinking
for example your parrotfish parrotfish

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:45.170
for example your parrotfish parrotfish
 

01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:48.010
for example your parrotfish parrotfish
or key species within your coral reef

01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:48.020
or key species within your coral reef
 

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:51.130
or key species within your coral reef
ecosystem and their diurnal so once it

01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:51.140
ecosystem and their diurnal so once it
 

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:53.770
ecosystem and their diurnal so once it
does get to that sunset hour you can see

01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:53.780
does get to that sunset hour you can see
 

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.990
does get to that sunset hour you can see
their behavior completely change and it

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000
their behavior completely change and it
 

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.820
their behavior completely change and it
is time for them to go in to hide them

01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:57.830
is time for them to go in to hide them
 

01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:59.560
is time for them to go in to hide them
so they'll find a little rock or a

01:14:59.560 --> 01:14:59.570
so they'll find a little rock or a
 

01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:03.070
so they'll find a little rock or a
crevice or any sort of protruding part

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.080
crevice or any sort of protruding part
 

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.440
crevice or any sort of protruding part
of a substrate where they can hide and

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:05.450
of a substrate where they can hide and
 

01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:07.210
of a substrate where they can hide and
what they do is they produce a mucus

01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:07.220
what they do is they produce a mucus
 

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.790
what they do is they produce a mucus
bubble from their lips so it's almost

01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:09.800
bubble from their lips so it's almost
 

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.800
bubble from their lips so it's almost
like this is gonna sound not very nice

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:11.810
like this is gonna sound not very nice
 

01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:14.470
like this is gonna sound not very nice
but well okay you know when you blow a

01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480
but well okay you know when you blow a
 

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.230
but well okay you know when you blow a
bubble with chewing gum or bubble gum I

01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:17.240
bubble with chewing gum or bubble gum I
 

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.180
bubble with chewing gum or bubble gum I
think I definitely used to do that when

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:19.190
think I definitely used to do that when
 

01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:21.520
think I definitely used to do that when
I was a kid I don't anymore it's like

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:21.530
I was a kid I don't anymore it's like
 

01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:23.050
I was a kid I don't anymore it's like
doing that but they do it with their own

01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:23.060
doing that but they do it with their own
 

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:26.500
doing that but they do it with their own
saliva and it's quite a large bubble and

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:26.510
saliva and it's quite a large bubble and
 

01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:30.220
saliva and it's quite a large bubble and
it completely envelopes the whole body

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:30.230
it completely envelopes the whole body
 

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:32.440
it completely envelopes the whole body
so there it's like a little cocoon of

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:32.450
so there it's like a little cocoon of
 

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:35.140
so there it's like a little cocoon of
saliva which doesn't sound great and it

01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:35.150
saliva which doesn't sound great and it
 

01:15:35.150 --> 01:15:38.290
saliva which doesn't sound great and it
completely protects them from odours

01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:38.300
completely protects them from odours
 

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.600
completely protects them from odours
being released so the Predators cannot

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:40.610
being released so the Predators cannot
 

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:45.730
being released so the Predators cannot
actually smell the parrotfish so it's

01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:45.740
actually smell the parrotfish so it's
 

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.530
actually smell the parrotfish so it's
the same in the coral reefs as it is on

01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:47.540
the same in the coral reefs as it is on
 

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.930
the same in the coral reefs as it is on
one the diurnal animals will begin to

01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:49.940
one the diurnal animals will begin to
 

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:52.060
one the diurnal animals will begin to
change change your behavior it's time to

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:52.070
change change your behavior it's time to
 

01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:53.290
change change your behavior it's time to
go into hiding and of course the

01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:53.300
go into hiding and of course the
 

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.270
go into hiding and of course the
nighttime animals come on that is what I

01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280
nighttime animals come on that is what I
 

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.940
nighttime animals come on that is what I
am banking on right now so as sensor

01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:57.950

stopped me in my tracks iya stop me from

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:18.050
stopped me in my tracks iya stop me from

do I think are better mothers aquatic

01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:25.580
do I think are better mothers aquatic
 

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:30.370

animals or land animals very interesting

01:21:30.370 --> 01:21:30.380
animals or land animals very interesting
 

01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:31.689
animals or land animals very interesting
question could probably have a great

01:21:31.689 --> 01:21:31.699
question could probably have a great
 

01:21:31.699 --> 01:21:34.680
question could probably have a great
discussion about that but I think

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:34.690
discussion about that but I think
 

01:21:34.690 --> 01:21:37.810
discussion about that but I think
generally it's very general very broad

01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:37.820
generally it's very general very broad
 

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:40.570
generally it's very general very broad
without going into specific examples I

01:21:40.570 --> 01:21:40.580
without going into specific examples I
 

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:45.419
without going into specific examples I
do think it has to be land animals

01:21:45.419 --> 01:21:45.429
do think it has to be land animals
 

01:21:45.429 --> 01:21:48.550
do think it has to be land animals
mammals of course is a broad category

mammals of course is a broad category
 

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:51.850
mammals of course is a broad category
and they generally generally generally

and they generally generally generally
 

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:55.479

tend to sort of show the highest level
 

01:21:55.489 --> 01:21:57.490
tend to sort of show the highest level
of maternal care and there's even a few

01:21:57.490 --> 01:21:57.500
of maternal care and there's even a few
 

01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:59.290
of maternal care and there's even a few
examples of paternal care in there as

01:21:59.290 --> 01:21:59.300
examples of paternal care in there as
 

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:01.859

that might not necessarily involve

that might not necessarily involve

but they will do absolutely everything
and explain how much energy that they

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:00.290
and explain how much energy that they

look like an animal

01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239
look like an animal

doesn't behave it's what we classify as
 

01:23:16.969 --> 01:23:19.300
doesn't behave it's what we classify as
an animal but it is it's in the sort of

an animal but it is it's in the sort of
 

01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:22.120

there's a very basic level of animal but

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:24.530
there's a very basic level of animal but
 

01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:25.510
there's a very basic level of animal but
it's still an animal

01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520
it's still an animal
 

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.090
it's still an animal
and the what we see when we look at

01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:28.100
and the what we see when we look at
 

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:29.980
and the what we see when we look at
these hard structures is actually the

01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:29.990
these hard structures is actually the
 

01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:32.530
these hard structures is actually the
exoskeleton inside there is an animal

01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:32.540
exoskeleton inside there is an animal
 

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:35.260
exoskeleton inside there is an animal
and how they reproduce is by spawning so

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:35.270
and how they reproduce is by spawning so
 

01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:36.880
and how they reproduce is by spawning so
at a certain time of the year within a

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:36.890
at a certain time of the year within a
 

01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:39.370
at a certain time of the year within a
particular moon phase these animals will

01:23:39.370 --> 01:23:39.380
particular moon phase these animals will
 

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:41.230
particular moon phase these animals will
just spawn they'll just release all the

01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:41.240
just spawn they'll just release all the
 

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.690
just spawn they'll just release all the
gametes into the ocean and just hope for

01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:43.700
gametes into the ocean and just hope for
 

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:47.590
gametes into the ocean and just hope for
the best and that is an animal that's

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600
the best and that is an animal that's
 

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.210
the best and that is an animal that's
doing that and obviously there's very

01:23:49.210 --> 01:23:49.220
doing that and obviously there's very
 

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:52.090
doing that and obviously there's very
very very little material or paternal

01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:52.100
very very little material or paternal
 

01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:54.100
very very little material or paternal
care that goes into that but there's a

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:54.110
care that goes into that but there's a
 

01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:56.680
care that goes into that but there's a
lot of energy expended and that is what

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:56.690
lot of energy expended and that is what
 

01:23:56.690 --> 01:23:59.320
lot of energy expended and that is what
they strive to do release surgeries

01:23:59.320 --> 01:23:59.330
they strive to do release surgeries
 

01:23:59.330 --> 01:24:01.030
they strive to do release surgeries
which will of course meet in the ocean

01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040
which will of course meet in the ocean
 

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.250
which will of course meet in the ocean
together and then they will settle they

01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:03.260
together and then they will settle they
 

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:05.650
together and then they will settle they
need a hard substrate to settle on and

01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:05.660
need a hard substrate to settle on and
 

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:08.770
need a hard substrate to settle on and
then that is how the start of coral

01:24:08.770 --> 01:24:08.780
then that is how the start of coral
 

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:11.110
then that is how the start of coral
grows it's a very beginning of coral

01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120
grows it's a very beginning of coral
 

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.450
grows it's a very beginning of coral
life and it's fascinating and maybe

01:24:13.450 --> 01:24:13.460
life and it's fascinating and maybe
 

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:15.550
life and it's fascinating and maybe
doesn't sound very relevant out here but

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:15.560
doesn't sound very relevant out here but
 

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:16.900
doesn't sound very relevant out here but
it's still an animal

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:16.910
it's still an animal
 

01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:20.220
it's still an animal
so Irena I think it was fantastic

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:20.230
so Irena I think it was fantastic
 

01:24:20.230 --> 01:24:23.470
so Irena I think it was fantastic
question and you Vito I could go on and

01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480
question and you Vito I could go on and
 

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.640
question and you Vito I could go on and
on and on about that saying that's

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:24.650
on and on about that saying that's
 

01:24:24.650 --> 01:24:25.990
on and on about that saying that's
giving me very funny looks from the back

01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000
giving me very funny looks from the back
 

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.650
giving me very funny looks from the back
here but yes there's such a broad

01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:29.660
here but yes there's such a broad
 

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:35.170
here but yes there's such a broad
spectrum of parental care and land

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:35.180
spectrum of parental care and land
 

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:37.240
spectrum of parental care and land
animals I think definitely wouldn't add

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:37.250
animals I think definitely wouldn't add
 

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:39.580
animals I think definitely wouldn't add
that but your a great question what a

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:39.590
that but your a great question what a
 

01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:42.340
that but your a great question what a
topic even though I haven't finds much

01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:42.350
topic even though I haven't finds much

we definitely have had some fantastic

01:24:45.450 --> 01:24:45.460
we definitely have had some fantastic
 

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.770
we definitely have had some fantastic
discussions that's for sure

01:24:47.770 --> 01:24:47.780
discussions that's for sure
 

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.960
discussions that's for sure
and I'm still hoping that something is

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:49.970
and I'm still hoping that something is
 

01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:51.790
and I'm still hoping that something is
just going to walk into my path because

01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800
just going to walk into my path because
 

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.550
just going to walk into my path because
