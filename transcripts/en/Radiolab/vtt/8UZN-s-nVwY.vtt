00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.690
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad. Boom. Rod. My guest today is Robert Krulwich,

2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:07.350
the science correspondent for ABC News, Nova and Nightline.

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:08.790
And we're talking about time,

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.710
the freezing of the speeding up of the slowing down of the absorbed science of

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.270
another politics of time.

6
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.670
<v 1>Speaking of which,</v>

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.240
my interview with member j Griffith from we heard in the previous whatever

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.470
section, she began her interview with me with a strange declaration,

9
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:25.820
which she read off a piece of paper.

10
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.630
<v 0>This is the independent free state of troll. Haim,</v>

11
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.870
we have no allegiance to the government. We do not recognize history,

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.950
patriarchy, matriarchy, politics, communist, fascist or lollipop men or ladies.

13
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.770
We have a hierarchy based on dog worship.

14
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.530
Our currency is to be based on the cog bata system.

15
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.820
We do not recognize the Gregorian calendar by doing so.

16
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.230
This Day shall be known as one. Be Afraid, be afraid,

17
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.940
all ie that here, respect this date.

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.860
What was that? That was the manifesto of um,

19
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.960
British anti road protests in the mid nineties.

20
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.100
The British and t road protest. Yes. [inaudible] like roads. Yes.

21
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.650
Environmentalist who are protesting against the building of roads.

22
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.520
And one of the things that they chose to do was to write this self-governing

23
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:14.354
manifesto,

24
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.190
pointing out that for them they were not going to recognize Greenwich. Meantime,

25
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.680
<v 2>three hours, 44 minutes, I reckon they did universal time.</v>

26
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.890
<v 0>Time is a highly political subject.</v>

27
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.830
It initially was the British sense of time,

28
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.590
which was transported all over the world.

29
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.950
Britain ruled their empire through ruling the oceans.

30
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:41.490
They rule the oceans because they discovered chronometer was of sufficient

31
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.620
accuracy to discover longitude.

32
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.810
What the British did in the empires was to insist on GMT,

33
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.703
Greenwich Meantime,

34
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.160
and you know all the countries where sort of Greenwich meantime retarded a bit

35
00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:54.971
or advanced a bit,

36
00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:58.780
but essentially all those will know him as the real slam in London.

37
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.540
I'm not sure what question is. The British don't own the seas anymore,

38
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:04.720
but we all still use Greenwich mean time. So lately, absolutely.

39
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.160
We're very used to thinking that empires are to do with land.

40
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.150
What I'm arguing is that actually though there have been empires of time

41
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.060
<v 3>[inaudible],</v>

42
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.820
<v 1>but there's one story you tell about the rulers.</v>

43
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.480
This is the ruler of trick menace than the current ruler of Turkmenistan.

44
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.790
A guy named President Niyazov.

45
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.820
Now the month of January in Turkmenistan is called Turkmenbashi and the month of

46
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.720
April is called Gerben Sultan. Why are they called that?

47
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.570
<v 0>Well, he named one after himself and one off to his mother.</v>

48
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.750
You mean everybody there sir in January calls it, you know,

49
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.150
president of our country month or whatever. Well,

50
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:47.930
I don't actually know whether you know that it's taken off in the street as it

51
00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:52.280
were and I rather suspect it probably has. But what he wanted to do was,

52
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.910
what in fact many rulers have wanted to do is to ally themselves with the clock

53
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:03.850
and the calendar. I mean like poll pot decided that 1975 would be at year zero.

54
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.900
Paul Potts says, all right, everything starts with me. Yes, exactly.

55
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:10.720
Everything starts with me. Now when I say it does,

56
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.970
this is year zero and to you,

57
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:17.830
I guess the joy of time, the deepest,

58
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:21.610
most ecstatic version of it is when you lose it completely.

59
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.970
I think that's absolutely right. And I think that's something that, um,

60
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.530
you know, that in prayer, in meditation, in art, um,

61
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.360
and in love actually is that people lose that. Um, very,

62
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.950
um, you know,

63
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:40.810
fretful ticking off kind of sense of clock time and what you fall into,

64
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.530
um, is, is something transcendent. You know,

65
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:49.531
all that you have to have done is loved somebody to know that and to hold them

66
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.100
for half an hour.

67
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.730
And you can know that that half an hour has lasted an eternity time.

68
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:56.740
Standing still in a moment like that is like a,

69
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.630
a really swollen now. Yes, exactly,

70
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:04.900
exactly. And that in a sense, you know, that's when, um,

71
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.040
the moment meets the eternal th that that is all that matters is just this

72
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:11.320
moment that you're holding in your hand.

73
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.020
<v 4>Thanks Robert. That was great.</v>

74
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.550
Jay Griffiths is the author of a sideways look at time.

75
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:23.090
You can find out more about her on our website, radiolab.org.

76
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.190
We'll close our program today on time.

77
00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:29.720
The way we started with an excerpt of performance is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

78
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.590
You know the one [inaudible] except this is not the way Beethoven would have

79
00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:34.970
intended it to be formed.

80
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.410
The piece he wrote to last 70 minutes has been stretched to 24 hours.

81
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.550
24 hours. Yup. Bringing it even closer to eternity.

82
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.560
Recently a group of San Franciscans spent an entire weekend in a gallery in a

83
00:04:48.561 --> 00:04:52.760
trance listening to all 24 hours and began on a Friday evening.

84
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.530
That is one oh two in the morning through the can went all night.

85
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.430
So it's about three 45 in the morning. Three 55 in the morning, in the morning.

86
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.803
Sound artist.

87
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.890
Aaron Zim was there otherwise known as the quiet American performance was at his

88
00:05:06.891 --> 00:05:09.110
gallery. In fact, close our show today.

89
00:05:09.111 --> 00:05:13.390
We asked him to give us a taste of what it sounded like. It starts with his

90
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.320
[inaudible] Duh, Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh.

91
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.870
But you know here it's like [inaudible].

92
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.440
<v 5>Even though it's like a very simple thing to do to like say, okay,</v>

93
00:05:24.441 --> 00:05:29.120
it's not going to be 90 minutes. It's going to be a day. It,

94
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.400
it still gives you that sense of floating time or hanging time at a time that

95
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.640
uh,

96
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.540
it takes a long time to pass that you haven't certain places in your life where

97
00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:44.260
major thing happens and evokes that

98
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.733
[inaudible]

99
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.310
<v 6>you know how people report that uh, you,</v>

100
00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:05.950
your life flashes before your eyes in a car crash or something like that.

101
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.500
I'm seem to slow down for people as sick.

102
00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:12.790
These really tense moments when if you happen to be playing Beethoven's ninth

103
00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:15.340
symphony on like on your car stereo,

104
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.100
well you were going into some car crash or something.

105
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.650
Would it slow down and sound like this?

106
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.183
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

107
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.260
<v 6>the idea was to stretch something to 24 hours by stretching Beethoven's ninth I</v>

108
00:06:42.481 --> 00:06:45.450
don't only ratchet piece of music, stretch music history.

109
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.830
<v 4>Oh God. Beethoven for 24 hours.</v>

110
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.820
Just wondering if Beethoven is slowly spinning in his grave loafing. Yeah,

111
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.190
that's my name here in San Francisco this weekend. This is the second tool,

112
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.780
24 over performance upstairs where the performance is going on has a good five.

113
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.490
Everything seems very gentle.

114
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.580
If Laura is completely covered with beanbags or pillows,

115
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.420
the space has a really amazing acoustic sound system. He was really good.

116
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.890
What can I say designed to be contemplative? Why would I do this?

117
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.880
I have no idea why we're doing it. You will. I do it again. I don't know.

118
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.990
I want to see how I feel being exposed to a one unique piece.

119
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.050
Your first response was very calming response and then when I walked in and they

120
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:31.150
I can in after this I wanted to stretch, open up,

121
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.163
expand

122
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.223
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

123
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.920
<v 6>so I had this thought that different animals based on probably their size and</v>

124
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:12.710
their heart rate might have different senses of time.

125
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:17.000
Like you see hummingbird zipping around in this manic way and you think we

126
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.670
humans must seem very slow to that hummingbird.

127
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.870
Everything we do must almost be in slow motion to something that can just deal

128
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:28.871
with things that quickly and to a whale or some huge animal with a heart rate

129
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:32.300
that just like once every few minutes, we must seem really fast.

130
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.180
This piece is kind of like that.

131
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:39.080
Suddenly I felt like I was moving at hummingbird speed.

132
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.800
<v 4>No, I stretched out.</v>

133
00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:44.730
It's getting this money growing and growing and growing and you're just wanting

134
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.720
it to [inaudible] and it's not going to,

135
00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:50.040
or it is rather,

136
00:08:50.041 --> 00:08:53.910
it is climaxing but it's just taking place over such a long time.

137
00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:57.630
That to us in our small human time, it doesn't feel like it's climaxing.

138
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.870
That's true. It doesn't feel that kind of climax never really happens.

139
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.070
That done in one. It's like euphoria. Right.

140
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.390
Most people. That's why, I don't know. Maybe somebody else ran out screaming.

141
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.910
I'm really serious. Oh, it's such an ecstatic apocalypse.

142
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.243
It felt

143
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.410
[inaudible] lifted up or just a constant lifting. Lifting. There was no,

144
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.150
just a constant lifting. Lifting.

145
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.103
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

146
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.720
<v 4>just got quiet. Yeah.</v>

147
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.920
It sounded like it was supposed to go quiet there. Yeah,

148
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.270
it'll be a stretched out. Quiet. Yeah. It's probably just like a rest.

149
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.840
Yeah. However many times.

150
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.540
[inaudible] camps again,

151
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.310
<v 5>that was produced by sound artist, Aaron Zim with help from Bronwyn's,</v>
