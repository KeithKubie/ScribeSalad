ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA TO DO IS

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.405 line:0%
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THESE TWO
COUNTERWEIGHTS WITH THIS WIRE

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.609 size:84% position:42%
AND WE'RE GOING TO LAY THEM
ACROSS THIS PIECE OF ICE.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.644 size:72% position:36%
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WILL HAPPEN TO THE ICE?

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.680
-I THINK THE ICE IS GONNA BREAK.
-IT SEEMS REASONABLE.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.081
YOU WANT TO TRY IT?
-YEAH, I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.448 size:63% position:31%
ALL RIGHT, COOL.
OKAY.

00:00:16.448 --> 00:00:18.317 size:66% position:33%
GET IT CENTERED THERE
AND --

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:20.052 size:69% position:34%
AND WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY
GONNA LET IT GO.

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:23.456 size:75% position:38%
BUT RIGHT THERE IS GOOD.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.793 size:78% position:61%
I THINK THE WIRE'S
GONNA PROBABLY SPLIT THEM

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:28.994 align:start size:75% position:25%
INTO TWO SEPARATE CUBES.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:30.463 size:78% position:39%
SO YOU THINK
THE WIRE'S MOVING THROUGH

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.265 size:88% position:44%
AND THE ICE IS ACTUALLY KIND
OF FALLING APART?

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:33.399 align:start size:53% position:47%
EXACTLY, YEAH.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.701
-WELL, THE WIRE IS SINKING...
-MM-HMM.

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:38.171 size:72% position:64%
...INTO THE ICE,
AND ICE ISN'T CRACKING.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.639
-YEAH, YEAH.
-WHICH IS SHOCKING.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:40.673 size:78% position:61%
Woman:
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE THERE,

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.408 size:63% position:69%
BUT IT KIND OF SEEMS
SOLID ON TOP.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:44.176 size:63% position:69%
SO, I GUESS,
AS IT'S SPLITTING,

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:46.979 size:88% position:56%
THE ICE IS JUST
FORMING BACK TOGETHER AGAIN?

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.215
YEAH, IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING
PHENOMENON

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.984
THAT SCIENTISTS
ACTUALLY DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND.

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:54.387 align:start position:0% line:0%
IT'S CALLED REGELATION.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:58.090 line:0%
Narrator: REGELATION IS WHAT'S
AT WORK WHEN YOU ICE SKATE.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.427
THE FRICTION OF THE SKATE
CAUSES THE ICE TO MELT A LITTLE,

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:03.062
ENHANCING ITS SLIPPERINESS.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:07.099
BUT THEN IT RE-FREEZES
AS IF NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:09.502
-CHECK IT OUT.
-NO.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:12.104
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
-IT'S ALL ONE PIECE.

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:13.439 align:start size:50% position:50%
THAT'S CRAZY.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.509 align:end position:100%
IT STILL GOT THE LINE
FROM THE WIRE. THAT'S SO COOL.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.978 size:63% position:69%
OH, MY GOODNESS!
LOOK AT THIS!

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.313 align:start size:94% position:6%
ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.314 size:59% position:70%
OH!
THIS IS FABULOUS!

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:23.515 align:start size:97% position:3%
IT'S ALL ONE PIECE.

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:24.717 line:0%
Narrator: SO...

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:29.022 line:0%
YOU DON'T -- YOU'RE ACTUALLY
SLIPPING ON A MICROSCOPIC LAYER

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:32.191 line:0%
OF WATER CREATED BY THE PRESSURE
YOU PUT ON THE ICE.

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.594 line:0%
AND IT WILL RE-FREEZE AS SOON
AS YOU SLIP AWAY.
