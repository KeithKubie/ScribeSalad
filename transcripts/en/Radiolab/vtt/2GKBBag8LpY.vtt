00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.750
You are listening to radio lab radio from w n y.

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.073
S. E. Yup.

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.320
<v 1>Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab and today</v>

4
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.550
we're gonna start this show with it with a fellow named Ben Montgomery,

5
00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:25.460
a reporter for the Tampa Bay Times. He's a guy we've had on the show before.

6
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.110
Ben, say something. Hi, this is Ben. Okay.

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.490
Everything good? Okay, good. All right. Where we are.

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.270
Just want to know from you like what are you guys doing? How are you doing it?

9
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.780
What are you thinking? I'll start at the beginning. Yeah.

10
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.230
Start at the beginning. Tell us what you're doing.

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.320
So after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson,

12
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.780
<v 0>here is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was</v>

13
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:50.170
shot and killed. When that became a national story,

14
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.260
there was a lot of belly aching in the press.

15
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.550
How many people do we see killed in the United States about by the police each

16
00:00:57.551 --> 00:01:00.430
year? How no one keeps accurate statistics.

17
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.240
There's currently no national statistics on police shootings,

18
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.830
law enforcement officer involved shootings.

19
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.150
And it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal.

20
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.120
You know, once in a while one of these things will catch fire, Tamir rice,

21
00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:17.800
Jason Harrison, Sam Dubose bird will become sort of a national story.

22
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.110
And I personally was having trouble like processing that like number one,

23
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.830
<v 1>is there a, is it trending one way or the other?</v>

24
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.520
Are Police shooting more black people than white people? Just very simply. Yeah.

25
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.780
The problem is we don't know. We have no idea because nobody tracks these.

26
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:40.070
FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part so that that data doesn't

27
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:42.680
exist somewhere within the police department itself in the police department.

28
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:45.480
It does on the local level. However, uh,

29
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.510
it doesn't exist in any accurate way, uh, by a broader agency.

30
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.010
And I could tell you how many person [inaudible] there were in Florida in 2011

31
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.070
using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted to the Florida Department of law

32
00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:02.750
enforcement. But I can't tell you how many times police shot somebody. Now,

33
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.170
there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track

34
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.950
nationally, but everything that's done so far is incomplete. You know,

35
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:13.220
cause most of those, you know, like the Guardian has an online database.

36
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.980
Most of them rely on media reports.

37
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:18.950
So they're only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public

38
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:22.280
consciousness. That's right. So Ben and his editors thought,

39
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.930
let's do something that's more complete.

40
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:25.430
Let's do something that's unprecedented.

41
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.620
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

42
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.890
<v 1>so first study had Florida, it's the third biggest state.</v>

43
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.140
Demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country.

44
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.410
And Florida has wonderful public records laws. Legally,

45
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:39.470
it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places.

46
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:40.251
And so of course,

47
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:44.270
if government events sat down and started emailing every single police precinct

48
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.620
in the entire state of Florida,

49
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.750
I think I said 388 emails asking for five years worth of paper,

50
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.680
any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or

51
00:02:56.871 --> 00:03:01.000
killed as a result of that shooting. Now this involves a year of work.

52
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.880
How many police departments getting lawyers involved?

53
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.210
This is a massive thing that evolved. Probably no less than a hundred people.

54
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.230
But eventually, thank you sir.

55
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.860
Ben Put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know

56
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:17.680
of.

57
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.630
<v 3>I want to show back a while back,</v>

58
00:03:20.631 --> 00:03:23.840
we sent our producer Matt Kielty down to the Tampa Bay Times. Oh,

59
00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:26.990
is this them right here to check it out? Yeah. How many,

60
00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:28.640
how many documents you think you have sitting on?

61
00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:31.160
This desk is probably 5,000 pages.

62
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.990
I have a stack of paper that's um, about as tall as me, six feet tall.

63
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.580
We've got them broken down by county, but you can see, uh, so h a,

64
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.500
B bay county, Booker Aton, Boynton Beach, uh,

65
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.560
all the way through the alphabet. And you basically just have, uh, all these,

66
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.310
uh, Manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across an entire desk.

67
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.460
It's a combination of a use of force reports,

68
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.300
civil court records and media clippings. The represent,

69
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.500
uh, 831 shootings.

70
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.880
I hope every shooting in the state of Florida in, in, in six years time,

71
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.830
2009 to 2014. So we did was go through all of this material,

72
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.110
scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could get that

73
00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:19.520
we thought was useful. Um,

74
00:04:19.521 --> 00:04:23.750
circumstantial stuff did involve a swat team that involve, uh,

75
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.270
an armed suspect was there, chase all the demographic information for the,

76
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:32.330
the firing officer or officers and the people were hit by those bullets.

77
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.480
Then we thought, let's learn from these, let's see how,

78
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.950
how we can compile the data and build a database and um, you know,

79
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.390
hopefully draw some conclusions, some lessons, some solutions.

80
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.300
<v 1>This is all going to go into it.</v>

81
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.350
Sort of a giant online database at the Tampa Bay Times website.

82
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.670
Hopefully other organizations in other states will start to do the same.

83
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:57.310
Perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this

84
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:59.920
stuff. In any case, in the meantime,

85
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.800
here's some of the things that Ben found and initially some of it, you know,

86
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.210
kind of surprised us. Well,

87
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.670
the biggest sort of counterintuitive a line in this, the,

88
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:11.500
the numbers are flat. He says,

89
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:14.830
if you look at the numbers of what you see year after year after year,

90
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.940
the numbers have stayed steady about 130 people shot by police every year,

91
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.460
which seems odd because a, you know, the past couple of years,

92
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.250
these videos that go viral and uh,

93
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.700
it makes it seem like this is a new and intense problem.

94
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.010
The numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case.

95
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.000
We also broke these down into category. He says, you know,

96
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.850
what you see like on the most basic level, uh,

97
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.750
are that about a third of the police shooting cases involves someone on the

98
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:43.450
other side who is quote, mentally unstable.

99
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.080
And this is a case we're not taking a guess at whether the person is mentally

100
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:47.471
unstable.

101
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:50.740
These are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has

102
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:54.130
been diagnosed mentally ill maybe off their meds at the time of the shooting.

103
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.390
And in that category,

104
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:59.960
Ben says they found a surprising of cases they call suicide by cop,

105
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.380
which is where it's somebody who's usually mentally ill,

106
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.800
is apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally.

107
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.590
The person is in view of the police standing on a porch,

108
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:14.150
standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police,

109
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:18.740
either a weapon or, or what they want the police to think as a weapon.

110
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.610
So it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me.

111
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.000
Right.

112
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.700
And that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get

113
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.690
shot. It's an attempt to incite the shooting. That's right.

114
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.470
This is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well.

115
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.490
You know, they're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week,

116
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.680
but it was news to us. I mean,

117
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:41.681
clearly police are now like the de facto frontline and dealing with mental

118
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:46.100
illness in this country. But when it got to bend central question,

119
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.900
what do the numbers say about race?

120
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.190
I think I would start with the fact that I'm there. I'm not sure.

121
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:57.191
It was so surprising that 40% of people shot by police are black.

122
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.400
And that is a, that is out of whack with, uh, the Florida, uh,

123
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.040
demographics. What is the percentage of African Americans in Florida?

124
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:10.580
It's not 40% it's more like 17 that's right.

125
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.370
Which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida,

126
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:17.460
you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white.

127
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.680
So it doesn't tell so much right now,

128
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:23.200
but the breakdown between fatalities for the same demographics and as ways that

129
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.950
they're going through this particular set of numbers,

130
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.310
50.9% were carrying a firearm,

131
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:33.030
9% had a blade. Uh, 70% involve some form of resisting arrest. You know,

132
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.390
and we talked with them numerous times over two years, you know,

133
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:39.350
drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that 50.9% you know,

134
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:40.700
it was weird, I started to feel like, you know,

135
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:42.830
I'm really glad that we have these numbers. Finally,

136
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:44.210
that in itself is a good thing,

137
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:48.890
but I'm further down 91 of the five 70 or 16 numbers themselves don't really get

138
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:53.510
you very far. 1% 16% this is 1% the more you hear, it's just like, yeah,

139
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:58.511
this is only one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem.

140
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.610
I mean, I mean, what's I guess to me is like how, I don't know,

141
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.240
it's back to where we were and why we wanted to start it.

142
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.690
<v 3>[inaudible] nasty, nasty. I'm still just moved by the single cases,</v>

143
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:16.350
the individual cases. And it's hard to remember that each of these is, you know,

144
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.720
I mean, they were all written in this, uh,

145
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.560
employment investigations revealed that ASP d officer Matthew Falor received a

146
00:08:22.561 --> 00:08:26.070
call on this staccato sterile police speak.

147
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.400
Fowler approached department two 55 and was confronted by a white male later

148
00:08:29.401 --> 00:08:30.870
identified as Anthony Skiles.

149
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.680
Armed with a knife at apartment two five five counts. Every one of these,

150
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.420
every report is at least one human life and someone was either, you know,

151
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.890
more often than not gravely injured or killed. Uh,

152
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.920
so we have on this table the investigation of the deaths or severe injury of 831

153
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.673
people

154
00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.020
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

155
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.340
<v 5>so what did we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay Times is we</v>

156
00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:05.690
grabbed a couple of Folgers right off Ben Montgomery's giant folder stack to

157
00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:08.900
follow wherever those stories might lead.

158
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.780
<v 6>Matt guilty and Ben traveled around Florida on a few different occasions talking</v>

159
00:09:13.781 --> 00:09:15.940
to the people behind those statistics you heard.

160
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.680
And over the next couple of weeks we're going to bring you two of those stories.

161
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.660
This podcast is the first, um, Matt, I guess we'll just turn it over to you.

162
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.470
Yup. Okay. Uh, so day one. Yeah. Where was this place again? The land,

163
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.810
the Land Florida, Mr Down. It's hot, heavy,

164
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.880
low eighties little town on the east coast of Florida.

165
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.330
And we were there because Ben had found out about this event.

166
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.680
Do you even know what the thing is called?

167
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.710
It's the third they cause celebration.

168
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:49.690
The third anniversary celebration of the police killing of Marlon Brown.

169
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.460
Okay. And this event was being held at the West Felicia shrine club.

170
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.620
Try Club shrine club like Shriners,

171
00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.440
like the Shriners just going to walk in and introduce myself.

172
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.880
<v 7>So I walk in and you know, it's like a small community center,</v>

173
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.390
linoleum floor fluorescent lights. And the first thing I noticed, to be honest,

174
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.060
is there's about 20 people in here, mostly black,

175
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.120
who were just milling about talking. But on the walls of this place,

176
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.850
I have photos of all the Shriners run, the length of this wall.

177
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.580
It's just like portraits of old white men wearing fez hats.

178
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.890
Who are all of the former Shriner presidents.

179
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.320
Just a old white dudes names like George Seger, Gunter language. Oh,

180
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.630
so all right. So Ben, and as I was taking in the scene,

181
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.110
this woman came up to me who was hosting the event. Her name is crystal Brown.

182
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.190
I do, I try to do something like this once a year from Molly's anniversary,

183
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.270
tall black woman, long dreads, and he's very piercing Hazel eyes.

184
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.730
And your relation to Marlin x. Y it was high school. We,

185
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.280
since I was 15 and I don't, I don't know Marlon Story. I don't. Um,

186
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.040
Marlon is, um, three years, May 8th, um,

187
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.310
he was 1230 in the morning and he was, um,

188
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.360
allegedly being stopped for not wearing a seatbelt. And so he didn't stop.

189
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.050
He got out of his car and he ran. Um, he was on,

190
00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:04.850
I guess some kind of community control where he's supposed to be home by 12,

191
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.090
he was on probation for a drug charge. You've been caught with some painkillers.

192
00:11:08.091 --> 00:11:11.900
So he ran and immediately the cop car followed him and eventually Marlin

193
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.820
slipped, fell the cop car, hit him going 24 miles. Power ran into him.

194
00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:20.060
He was pinned under the car for about four or five hours. Four or five hours.

195
00:11:20.061 --> 00:11:23.090
Yeah. Yup. And Crystal and some neighbors got out to the scene.

196
00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:26.810
We sat out there and laid it for five hours until they were able to get the car

197
00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:28.670
off. Marlin was pronounced dead.

198
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.690
And so crystal and I talked for a little bit and don't mind if I, uh,

199
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.810
join you for a minute. Is that okay?

200
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.600
I sort of just walked around and started introducing myself to people.

201
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.380
Where are you guys from in Florida? Tampa, Florida. Oh, you're from Tampa. Okay.

202
00:11:42.381 --> 00:11:45.050
So we just made the drive and I don't quite know what I was expecting.

203
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.670
I guess I just thought it was, you know,

204
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.180
gonna be a local event for this one person. But as I started to meet people,

205
00:11:50.181 --> 00:11:52.910
I started meet people from all over. From Tampa. From Palm Beach.

206
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.950
Whereabouts in New Yorker? Yeah.

207
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.190
I mean there were people from all over the country. East Flatbush, Brooklyn,

208
00:11:57.191 --> 00:12:01.480
Chicago, Georgia, and yes, this is my son to Norris.

209
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.570
I started seeing these people who are wearing these tee shirts and pink shirt

210
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:08.590
and then you have two doves with a big picture of a young black man's face or a

211
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:12.730
name. Oh, they represent angels watching over me.

212
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.060
There was one woman with a picture of her son's eighth grade graduation photo on

213
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:20.320
her shirt. It's his cap and gown in red. He was 14 years old when he was killed.

214
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.700
He was also buried in this same cap in his gown and then another mother.

215
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.660
This is going on the fourth year,

216
00:12:26.661 --> 00:12:30.820
so I have maybe about six or seven who had the name of her 23 year old son,

217
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:33.910
Rodney Mitchell on her shirt. I have one with his graduation picture on it.

218
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:36.310
I have like the fluorescent black and yellow one.

219
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:39.040
I have this Jamaican color one. I have a black and white.

220
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.190
I have different shirts. Oh yeah.

221
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.220
And I started seeing shirt after shirt after shirt and I'd say by the time like

222
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:47.290
40 people had showed up in there, all these different shirts,

223
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:48.250
I just realized like,

224
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.170
<v 6>Oh, this is not just a thing for one person.</v>

225
00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:54.000
This is a network.

226
00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.040
<v 7>Like almost everyone there had lost either a cousin or a brother or a husband,</v>

227
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.810
like even even a daughter to police violence. And in fact,

228
00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:07.670
when I later spoke to one of those women you just heard,

229
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.280
I have one with his graduation picture on him just to touch a Clemens,

230
00:13:10.281 --> 00:13:12.140
her 23 year old son, Rodney Mitchell,

231
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.210
he was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop.

232
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.340
We're actually going to get into that story later,

233
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.580
but she told me that I've met about 400 other mothers.

234
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.510
They've reached out to me and I 400 Oh yes. Really? Yeah.

235
00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:25.700
Through like traveling around through Facebook.

236
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.100
I've met 400 other mothers who's lost their children. Wow.

237
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.170
I was just seeing like a fraction of that at this community center.

238
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.090
Got The scales. Surprising. Right.

239
00:13:35.091 --> 00:13:37.880
And the other thing for me was how you see these stories pop up.

240
00:13:37.881 --> 00:13:41.060
37 year old Alton Sterling, 40 year old Terence Crutcher,

241
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.360
at least the ones that get pulled up to a, like a national level.

242
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.870
And you see the family members come out,

243
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:53.270
which children who are dependent upon their daddy on a daily basis and for like

244
00:13:53.881 --> 00:13:58.090
two days you see them on television. That big bad dude was my twin brother.

245
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:03.650
That big bat do was a father and then they kind of [inaudible] [inaudible] and

246
00:14:05.391 --> 00:14:07.970
they're gone. And I guess what I've thought is, you know,

247
00:14:07.971 --> 00:14:12.971
probably they have these long drawn out legal battles and then they go back to

248
00:14:13.761 --> 00:14:18.560
their lives, whatever, like whatever that means. But instead it's like, oh no,

249
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.470
<v 6>what happens is they get like folded up into this network [inaudible]</v>

250
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.960
<v 8>and we pray for those mostly is that, will you come into this family?</v>

251
00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.930
<v 7>And so at the community center there was a moment of prayer where the 40 to 50</v>

252
00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:35.600
people sat down at these big round dining tables.

253
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.130
<v 8>Because once upon a time ago,</v>

254
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.580
there wasn't little coalition like some we have to do.

255
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.710
There was no way to know what to do.

256
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.600
There was no rule print on how to get justice or how to make changes and how to

257
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:52.190
protect our kids now loved ones and we use prayers and all

258
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.870
<v 6>prayers in God's name. Amen. And so after the prayer,</v>

259
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.020
crystal hollered from the back of the room for everybody to eat.

260
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:04.610
So everyone stood up and then the vibe just totally changed and somebody put on

261
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:09.140
some MJ and a lot of people started to crowd around these two big picnic tables.

262
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.130
<v 7>He laid his mind just a, I'm not going to make now one comment until it oh no,</v>

263
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:15.150
no, no, no comment. Which is where I met this woman.

264
00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.910
I mean the only comment I was looking for was if you could just describe for me

265
00:15:17.911 --> 00:15:20.910
what we got on the table. Cause I'm just a what's on a table. Yeah.

266
00:15:20.911 --> 00:15:23.490
Just what's on the table this day. This table right here,

267
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.450
so I think you have changed. You have sweet tea, you have orange juice,

268
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:32.350
and then you have your condiments for that. But on the breakfast table, Oh man,

269
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.000
what's up? You get your eggs, you've got your grips, you get your bacon,

270
00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:40.110
you've got your sausage, you got everything. You going to have to get nice,

271
00:15:40.111 --> 00:15:44.700
good and full on today. Can I get your name? Sheila Geneva.

272
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:46.420
Reed Beal. I'm the mother of Sandra Blaine

273
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:47.560
<v 6>in case you don't remember</v>

274
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.950
<v 9>like 10 2015 hello ma'am. What it takes,</v>

275
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.780
I've told her reason for stop is you didn't fail.

276
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.680
You failed to signal your lane change. [inaudible] insurance for you.

277
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.190
Can you give me a few minutes? All right.

278
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.110
<v 6>Senior plan is pulled over in a small town in Texas.</v>

279
00:16:01.111 --> 00:16:03.420
The cop runs her information, comes back to the car

280
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.980
<v 9>putting out your cigarette. Please go mind. I'm in La Chi. What?</v>

281
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.310
I put out my cigarette. You can step on out. Now.

282
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.980
I don't know if there's that baton might step out of the car,

283
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.950
step out of the car. No,

284
00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:18.450
you don't have the right stepping out of the car and I have the right to do

285
00:16:18.451 --> 00:16:18.631
that.

286
00:16:18.631 --> 00:16:23.190
I do have the right condemn out or I will remove you and get it removed for a

287
00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:26.820
failure out or I will remove you. I'm giving you a lawful order.

288
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:31.740
Don't touch me. Don't touch me. I'm not under arrest.

289
00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:34.980
You have the right to say you are under arrest. Am I under arrest for what?

290
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.810
Get out of the car and then you go like shoe up. Get Out. Wow. No,

291
00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.170
mentally Sandra gets out of the car for failure to signal.

292
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:47.130
You're doing all this fun over there for fun. You are bound to read my wrist.

293
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.830
Can you fucking

294
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.510
stop? No.

295
00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.430
<v 6>Sandra was eventually taken in jail. Four days later in that jail cell,</v>

296
00:17:02.431 --> 00:17:05.370
she was found dead hanged with a plastic garbage bag.

297
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.960
The death was ruled a suicide and Sandra's family disputed that ruling.

298
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:16.380
<v 7>You got everything you want to have to get nice, good and full on today.</v>

299
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.340
So I'm excited. Can I get your name? Sheila Geneva. Reed Beal.

300
00:17:20.341 --> 00:17:23.340
I'm the mother of Sandra Blake. Sandra bland. Yeah. Where are you coming from?

301
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.980
Chicago. I want to let you, uh, eat your food.

302
00:17:25.981 --> 00:17:27.420
I have one thing I wanted to ask to have you come,

303
00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:30.120
have you come to events like this before? Yes sir. Quite a few.

304
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.080
I was in Missouri last week. Um, we go all around.

305
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.260
We try to support as many models as we can because it's important. And is that,

306
00:17:37.261 --> 00:17:38.670
is that exactly like, is that what it is?

307
00:17:38.671 --> 00:17:41.190
Is it really just like a support group? Yes sir. It's support.

308
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.450
It's support because that mother who has lost their baby needs to be able to see

309
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.520
somebody else who looks like them,

310
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.210
who's in the same situation that they are as opposed to someone walking up to

311
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:53.760
them and saying, I know how you feel, but you really don't.

312
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.660
Which made me think about something [inaudible]

313
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.360
<v 6>Ben and I had talked about a lot,</v>

314
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.170
which is in getting to meet these women and talk to these women,

315
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:04.940
you get the sense that their,

316
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.650
their experiences is really unique sort of loss.

317
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.450
<v 1>It sucked to lose somebody to cancer.</v>

318
00:18:11.451 --> 00:18:15.890
I've lost a friend to cancer recently in fact is a horrible thing.

319
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.390
And a very, you know, 10,

320
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.650
10 times a hundred times worse for his first wife children than it is for me.

321
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:26.750
I think it's a different thing when your person is killed by another human being

322
00:18:26.751 --> 00:18:31.751
and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun and a badge and a,

323
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.370
you know, in a position of authority.

324
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.010
<v 6>And this is something that you do see in beds numbers,</v>

325
00:18:37.011 --> 00:18:38.330
even though the numbers themselves,

326
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.850
they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting was, was legally justified.

327
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.450
What is clear is that over 800 plus shootings,

328
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.460
even the shootings where the person was unarmed,

329
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.550
only one police officer has ever been charged.

330
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.630
So it's this weird sort of like double grief. Yeah.

331
00:18:56.631 --> 00:18:58.460
It's like past and present at the same time.

332
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:03.370
Like you can't put it away because it's every day is another insult kind of.

333
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.303
Right.

334
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.230
<v 0>Then it's soon as I'm happy again, this is crystal Brown. Somebody,</v>

335
00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:11.020
one of us is reaching out, whoever's psychosis, like they,

336
00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.800
if something happened in, you know, here in Florida, we're in Florida,

337
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.520
we're gonna reach out to each other and then we're going to invite them and we

338
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.760
say this was like the, the club that nobody really wants to be a part of.

339
00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.620
It's crazy, but it's his family. I said family is more than just blood.

340
00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:30.230
This is my family and I could not have made it this way.

341
00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.270
I put him still be fighting. I wouldn't be doing anything if it wasn't for them.

342
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.920
<v 7>Okay. So after the event ended at the community center,</v>

343
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.030
crystal took a bunch of the moms,

344
00:19:41.031 --> 00:19:45.200
they all got in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shops.

345
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.610
Like do you guys do this after every,

346
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.220
every event or is this just like crystal knows this one says,

347
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.920
Krista knows this one's around here and has been telling everyone about this.

348
00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.740
This is deandre Joseph. Her Son Andrew died in 2014 so no,

349
00:19:57.741 --> 00:19:59.210
we didn't know anything about this,

350
00:19:59.211 --> 00:20:02.120
but figured this must be part of the different type of learning.

351
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.700
This is a part of just coping and dreaming. Right, right.

352
00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.550
We're all just simply trying to find our way.

353
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:12.230
It's a crystal gathered like probably 15 of us into this tiny little store

354
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.500
because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I

355
00:20:15.501 --> 00:20:18.650
deal with my grief. You can either get the um,

356
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.740
the large stage at certain point cause it was talking to these two women and she

357
00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:24.470
just had this big bundle of sage in her hand. Okay. Yeah.

358
00:20:24.471 --> 00:20:26.540
Cause like if you want to do like your house, like a, like a,

359
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.010
like some deep shit.

360
00:20:28.011 --> 00:20:32.300
Like then I opened my windows and I just usually I go through my house,

361
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.700
she says to sage, calms her down and I'm just,

362
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:41.760
and then uh, they went from the gem shop over to Crystal's house, maybe

363
00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.010
mid size, one story house in and

364
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.560
<v 6>lot of women hung out in the living room. We're drinking juice,</v>

365
00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:54.580
talking to Ben about his story. Crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen,

366
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:56.840
cook them chicken,

367
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.610
<v 9>the other guy look good as a day. Yeah.</v>

368
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.870
<v 6>And one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women,</v>

369
00:21:03.871 --> 00:21:05.550
when they come together and they like,

370
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.940
they bring with them and have their own stories, these stories of grief, of,

371
00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:12.180
of suffering. And yet when they're in the same room together,

372
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.120
it's like they just, they just have fun.

373
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:18.800
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

374
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.660
<v 6>apparently the night before they'd all gone out dancing together.</v>

375
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.273
<v 9>[inaudible] fire.</v>

376
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.390
<v 10>And now what we're doing, instead of getting motel rooms again,</v>

377
00:21:39.391 --> 00:21:42.930
this is Natasha Clemons, we starting to stay over here at each other's houses.

378
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.620
We've lived in each other's bed on each other's couch, you know, air mattresses.

379
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:50.780
It becomes like a huge sleepover and versus let's go on and sleep for up

380
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.490
talking, you know, getting to know each other. You know,

381
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.430
tell me stories about his age, his children. So it's like therapy for us.

382
00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.340
<v 6>Fake, he's letting me pass.</v>

383
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.910
But there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really

384
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:08.160
stuck with me, I believe were ad, I'm sorry, Ireland Brown's death.

385
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:13.440
And it was when crystal led some of us over to the site where her ex husband,

386
00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.180
Marlin, was hit by that squad cars.

387
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:21.000
It's about 12 people here and about eight of them were women who had lost either

388
00:22:21.001 --> 00:22:23.130
a husband or a brother or a child.

389
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.300
And we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this

390
00:22:27.301 --> 00:22:28.110
patchy grass.

391
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.870
<v 10>So when you see the video that's pretty, that we did came down,</v>

392
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:35.350
that's the video, that's the street. Then

393
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.550
house probably over like right there.

394
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.090
And then the police car that came behind him was probably right here.

395
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.540
And then the officer that hit that hit him, came in

396
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.573
<v 9>and then we come on.</v>

397
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.320
<v 10>That's when he came in. He came right here.</v>

398
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:59.110
And that's why we call it the execution and the vegetable garden because the

399
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:04.111
garden was here and vegetables were growing and that they had onions then cause

400
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.850
um, when they, when they, you know,

401
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:09.850
when they took him away and released it and took down and tape and stuff,

402
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:12.540
we came back here. That's all you could smell. What's uneasy.

403
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.610
And so now like when you cut, ain't like, it's, it's not as,

404
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.680
it's not as bad now, but just the association like school,

405
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:21.790
when I'm cutting onions, you get that smell. Like it just, you get those floods

406
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.350
<v 6>[inaudible] in your car. It just brings you right back here. [inaudible].</v>

407
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.073
<v 9>Yup.</v>

408
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.560
<v 6>And the 12 is just kind of stood there for a minute.</v>

409
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.290
Crystal size. We're starting to get teary.

410
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:46.190
Some of the other women's started to cry

411
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:02.410
and then y'all want me to do a take some? Yeah. My phone ain't the best.

412
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.530
A lot of what? A better phone than me. A couple of women handed me their phones.

413
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.340
<v 9>Mine is broken. Oh look like it's going to do right, but,</v>

414
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:16.630
<v 6>and it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just</v>

415
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:21.400
stared at the camera with this sort of straight face. All right. Three,

416
00:24:21.401 --> 00:24:22.390
two, one

417
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:27.590
<v 1>and then let me, three, two, one.</v>

418
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.960
All right, thank you. I think we got them

419
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.210
<v 9>and we all started walking back up to the cars. Bristle.</v>

420
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:42.230
I just want to thank you for just sharing that with us because I know

421
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.970
it has to be pretty hard to even come back to the Saturday. Yeah, I can go.

422
00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:50.040
Yeah. We haven't been on hand a long. It's been awhile. Oh,

423
00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:51.350
we'll go to the grave site.

424
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.490
We used to go there once a week at night,

425
00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.230
three o'clock in the morning. That's why I remember Dan.

426
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.070
I used to tell you all the time, how do you live so far away from him?

427
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:11.090
Oh my God, that was it. That was my son's grave.

428
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:14.180
It's about 15 minutes tops from where I live.

429
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.880
Every time I visited home I have to go there and spend some time. Oh

430
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.980
yeah. No boys. How could you not?

431
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.123
Right.

432
00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:29.510
<v 0>And Ain't ain't no goofy. Like you want to go take a chair and sit there. Yeah.</v>

433
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:33.930
And it's crazy cause like it's a whistle if a cemetery like a little bit further

434
00:25:33.931 --> 00:25:35.610
out and it's crazy.

435
00:25:35.611 --> 00:25:39.210
You can go by there like a certain time every day and it's this little white

436
00:25:39.211 --> 00:25:43.710
man. He's chair everything like set up. Like he literally, I think he does.

437
00:25:43.711 --> 00:25:48.150
He like go have lunch with every day I dance to be [inaudible].

438
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.390
It's the cemetery that's way out like going on towards Popeye's and all of that.

439
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.110
It's a little white guy that's always sitting out there. He take his chair.

440
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.790
I can have a wholesaler, I would think. I know it was not the happen.

441
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:19.543
<v 9>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

442
00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.970
<v 6>so that trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and I feel like I happen to</v>

443
00:26:26.971 --> 00:26:30.990
be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that

444
00:26:30.991 --> 00:26:31.824
trip,

445
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:35.130
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

446
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.870
<v 6>a Geneva Reed [inaudible] who was the mother of Sandra Bland who I met,</v>

447
00:26:37.871 --> 00:26:41.140
she spoke at the Democratic National Convention one year ago

448
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.100
<v 9>yesterday. I let the</v>

449
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.370
<v 6>worst nightmare anyone could imagine.</v>

450
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.550
She was on stage with Michael Brown's mother, Eric Garner's mother.

451
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.380
I've watched as my daughter was lowered into the ground and it was around this

452
00:26:55.381 --> 00:26:58.230
time that a few of these women's started to call themselves the mothers of the

453
00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:58.640
movie.

454
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.510
<v 11>When you say about the movement,</v>

455
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.470
<v 6>some of them showed up at the women's march in d c</v>

456
00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:14.650
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

457
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.230
<v 6>and um, it was weird because in this short amount of time,</v>

458
00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:22.630
this thing that we had stumbled into this thing that really kind of felt like at

459
00:27:22.631 --> 00:27:27.460
the time of support group had suddenly become a force

460
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:46.290
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

461
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:50.460
<v 12>coming up, hey, put it down. A cop with a gun, a man with a knife,</v>

462
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:52.860
put it down.

463
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.130
<v 6>And I look at the razor thin life or death moment between them.</v>

464
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:57.840
<v 12>Are you going to get it again?</v>

465
00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.810
<v 6>So stay with us.</v>

466

<v 6>hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich and just,</v>

471
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.650
let's just pick right back up with our,

472
00:28:42.651 --> 00:28:46.720
our story from Florida with Tampa Bay Times you're put at Ben Montgomery and our

473
00:28:46.721 --> 00:28:49.690
own mad guilty. All right, so day two,

474
00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.390
day two was Daytona led 53, May 3rd Daytona Beach, Daytona beach.

475
00:28:55.391 --> 00:28:56.140
It's about everything.

476
00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.420
And what happened was we went to this thing was these women,

477
00:28:58.421 --> 00:29:01.900
mostly black who have lost people to police violence.

478
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.320
And I'm time sitting across the table from an African American city councilman

479
00:29:05.321 --> 00:29:07.320
in Daytona Beach. And I told him what I had been working on.

480
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.790
I told him some of the numbers we'd learned and he said,

481
00:29:09.791 --> 00:29:12.080
you really need to meet our police chief. Uh,

482
00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.500
you guys want me to run down to get a shower since you got here?

483
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:18.430
His name is Mike Chitwood. You're not cool now. Just, yeah, just a microphone.

484
00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.010
Okay. He's the police chief of Daytona Beach,

485
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.030
<v 14>known for its wild and rocket spring break scenes.</v>

486
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.490
They have bike week that draws 500,000 bikers from all over the country,

487
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.440
Daytona international speedway. And on top of that,

488
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.360
<v 6>the permanent population there is like 62,000 people and over that six year</v>

489
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:42.160
period they've only had four police shootings. And that's slow.

490
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.040
<v 15>Yeah. For a city like that, that's really low. Jesse.</v>

491
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.520
I need the breakdown for 2015 and in fact while we were there by race of tickets

492
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.400
and arrest, [inaudible] had his assistant print out these spreadsheets.

493
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.300
Here we go. Those there. The stats. Yup. Thank you.

494
00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.320
Have to do the math and especially,

495
00:29:59.321 --> 00:30:01.300
it's actually kind of fascinating because if you look at them,

496
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.910
you just can go right down here and you can add them up for things like

497
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:08.830
aggravated, aggravated assault, theft, shoplifting, a speeding or arrest ratio.

498
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:14.190
And our ticket ratio basically mirrors our city in terms of racial demographics.

499
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:18.430
Yeah, we're right. We're roughly a 60, 40, shitty, 60% white,

500
00:30:18.431 --> 00:30:20.620
40% African American. And so when you look at these numbers,

501
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.740
it's pretty much what you see tickets for speeding about 60,

502
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:25.720
40 arrest for theft about 60, 40.

503
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.170
That's the way we're supposed to in theory approach to law.

504
00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:32.050
And so what are they doing differently? Well, a whole bunch of things.

505
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.380
First of all, when all these, these incidents were occurring in, uh,

506
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.400
around the country with Ferguson and everything else, we did a race in policing,

507
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.500
mandatory training for the entire PD.

508
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:45.240
And basically what we wanted our officers to do is number one,

509
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.810
to learn the history of the country.

510
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.380
Cause the history of the country is that we are a racist nation no matter how

511
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:54.760
you want to look at it and started with moving the Indians off of their land for

512
00:30:54.761 --> 00:30:57.940
manifest destiny. Uh, when you look at Jim Crow laws,

513
00:30:57.941 --> 00:30:59.920
when you look at the civil war, we look at slavery.

514
00:30:59.921 --> 00:31:02.440
When you look in the bull Connor, for example,

515
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.280
of turning the dogs and fire hoses loose on civil rights marchers.

516
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.770
So it's important for officers to understand that,

517
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:13.030
that you may go into an African American community and you may think and act and

518
00:31:13.031 --> 00:31:15.790
talk away where you think you're being respectful and understanding.

519
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.230
But in reality you're not.

520
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:22.060
But let's not for a moment think that there isn't biased in policing because

521
00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:25.930
there's biased. We all have biased Ines. Uh, and the trick is,

522
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.690
and I don't know no of to trick and I don't know of any of us know how to

523
00:31:28.691 --> 00:31:29.524
contain that.

524
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.700
How do we stop that bias from coming through when you make a decision? Right.

525
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:34.790
And I think in, you know,

526
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.080
I've read a lot about implicit bias and it always seems like, um, it's like a,

527
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:43.150
it's like feels like a kinder way to say fear, like a fear of a black person.

528
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:46.030
And that fear is greater than what you would feel when you're encountering a

529
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:48.520
white person, when you're out on the job as a cop.

530
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.490
When you look at some of the shootings that were caught on video and I,

531
00:31:51.491 --> 00:31:56.230
and I think of the poor school janitor who lost his life in Minnesota. Oh yeah.

532
00:31:56.231 --> 00:31:57.210
The [inaudible] Casteel shooting.

533
00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.530
There's a guy who told the officer in no uncertain terms, I'm a good guy.

534
00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.780
I have a gun permit. You can't get a gun permit if you're a convicted felon,

535
00:32:07.781 --> 00:32:09.610
you can't get a gun permit if you're a drug dealer.

536
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.340
So when the minute that young man tells that officer,

537
00:32:12.341 --> 00:32:14.890
I have a gun permit for some unknown reason,

538
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:19.900
that officer threat level with a baby in the car and I got a guy in is what his

539
00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:22.990
kid, his girlfriend and Carney's tell him he's a gun permit holder. This is,

540
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.150
this is an easy car stop for some reason.

541
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.760
And the reason is because of the color of the man's skin.

542
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.440
All of those things never registered.

543
00:32:29.441 --> 00:32:31.090
Black guy reaching for his black because pocket.

544
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.500
And I shoot and I would like to tell you in all my years in policing,

545
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:39.340
I would like to sit here and be naive and tell you that we don't shoot harm

546
00:32:39.341 --> 00:32:42.770
people as a 28 year practitioner in law enforcement, a second generation cop.

547
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:44.780
I'm appalled at what I see on those videos.

548
00:32:44.781 --> 00:32:49.760
I could not believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control.

549
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.040
Some of them I understand what's going on. I mean,

550
00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:55.100
you're wrestling into ground for your life and you and you know there are times

551
00:32:55.101 --> 00:32:57.620
that we have to use deadly force, but the incidents in South Carolina,

552
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.740
the incident in Minnesota, I mean, are you kidding me?

553
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.880
And you're looking at what are we doing? I mean, how do you,

554
00:33:01.881 --> 00:33:05.240
how do you train that out of an officer so that when they make a traffic stop,

555
00:33:05.241 --> 00:33:08.390
they're not already operating with this level of heightened fear or this

556
00:33:08.391 --> 00:33:12.980
perceived threat? In my opinion. Number one, you have to train tactically sound.

557
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.900
You have to train using it.

558
00:33:14.901 --> 00:33:19.400
Real life scenarios that take that extra split. Second,

559
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.510
before you fire your weapon. And I'll give you an anecdotal rup very quickly.

560
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.220
When I first joined the Philadelphia Police Department,

561
00:33:25.221 --> 00:33:29.990
we were shooting people at a crazy rate on an accidental discharge.

562
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.240
The officer had their finger on the trigger.

563
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.330
When they would go to grab that person, if that person pulled or moved,

564
00:33:35.331 --> 00:33:38.150
you would jerk back and it was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger.

565
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.500
So they sent us all back up to the police academy and we all had our be

566
00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.900
retrained on how to keep your finger on the side plate of the weapon,

567
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.820
not on the trigger. So that if that happened,

568
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.300
you wouldn't accidentally trip and fire and shoot somebody and you went to

569
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:53.630
thought it was Armageddon. Oh my God, they're gonna get us killed. One reality,

570
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:59.140
what it did was it slowed down your field division. It slowed everything down.

571
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.520
That split second didn't make a difference in that blink of an eye didn't make a

572
00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:04.700
difference. It made a difference in you not shooting because that split second,

573
00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:08.610
let you see what you thought may have been the the color of my glass coming out

574
00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.400
and my cell phone was a cell phone

575
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:13.760
<v 6>so you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that chip wood</v>

576
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:18.260
comes back to again and again is this idea of time in certain situations,

577
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.290
slow down when you're dealing with a mentally ill person,

578
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.020
slow down like whatever you can do, he was covered.

579
00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:26.930
Just creates some space to buy yourself another 30 seconds,

580
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:30.350
that extra 30 seconds maybe the difference between saving your life and somebody

581
00:34:30.351 --> 00:34:32.330
else's life. Another interesting thing was,

582
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.510
and Ben Ben found this out also through some of his reporting with other police

583
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:39.500
chiefs is the idea that some police chiefs don't like to hire kids out of high

584
00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:43.160
school, like 1920 year olds in part because everything I do is this.

585
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:44.443
It texts a lot.

586
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.290
<v 15>It's all know how to communicate. It's like this. And then when,</v>

587
00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.890
when they look up and go to talk to somebody, I'm,

588
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:50.360
and I'm serious about the ones that the drive through a McDonald's and they

589
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.930
could piss off the person ordering cheeseburger. How the, how did you do it?

590
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:56.240
It's just their demeanor. It's just the way they act.

591
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:56.991
<v 6>In fact,</v>

592
00:34:56.991 --> 00:34:59.780
Ben told me that he talked to different police chief who told him the young

593
00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:02.090
people who are coming into the academy, uh,

594
00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:05.270
the past few years have never been in a physical fight,

595
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:07.550
which is a problem because when they get into a fight,

596
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:10.220
their heart starts to race and their muscles tense up and they don't really know

597
00:35:10.221 --> 00:35:10.821
what to do.

598
00:35:10.821 --> 00:35:15.020
So they freak out and they're way more likely to draw a weapon and use the

599
00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:19.230
weapon to, you know, to, to in the confrontation. Huh. So how do you,

600
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.940
do you like you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been

601
00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:25.490
beaten up on your nose and nose? So that Ben says that,

602
00:35:25.491 --> 00:35:28.130
that's why the police chief told him he looks to hire bouncers.

603
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.820
I see bouncers for chip Wade, he said from, I'm

604
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.100
<v 15>just my little myopic world that I live in.</v>

605
00:35:33.101 --> 00:35:36.910
We have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military.

606
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.620
They are my best officers. They are level headed, they are well trained.

607
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:42.030
They know how to follow the policy

608
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:42.590
<v 6>basically.</v>

609
00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:47.590
You know how to not freak out during the confrontation and last thing provinces,

610
00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.520
the last thing, one of the most

611
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.251
<v 15>important things too.</v>

612
00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:53.580
It says you have to get into the community and I'm not talking about the the

613
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:56.340
good stuff. Oh we they bought Christmas gifts or they cook Thanksgiving dinner.

614
00:35:56.341 --> 00:35:58.680
I'm talking day to day. You have to get to know people.

615
00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:03.490
<v 6>Yeah. Cool. All right. Sure. And so to make this point, Chitwood got up,</v>

616
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.160
walk me down the hall to another office.

617
00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:10.940
Sat me down in a computer. Sound comes on about 20 seconds. Okay.

618
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.110
To show me this video. There you go.

619
00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:16.600
So video starts in silence and it's a body cam video.

620
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:20.320
It's a body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car.

621
00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:24.220
He's got his body cameras mounted to his eye on his glasses to the cameras going

622
00:36:24.221 --> 00:36:26.950
where his eyes go next to him. Passenger side is his partner.

623
00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:29.740
Both cops are white also it's night. So

624
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.470
<v 12>okay.</v>

625
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:34.170
Call is for a guy who was running around with a knife trying to stab people who

626
00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.940
was off his meds. I think he was on a crack cocaine binge,

627
00:36:36.941 --> 00:36:38.800
if I remember correctly. They Park.

628
00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.420
It's a little neighborhood street and you can see down the street,

629
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.140
half a block away. No Man, I was this shirtless black guy.

630
00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.720
Why don't you chill out there? That's the cop talking to him.

631
00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:51.360
The cop where in the body cam and this black man,

632
00:36:51.361 --> 00:36:54.570
he's got his arm raised pretty big knife in his hand and he's walking towards

633
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:56.770
the cops. You stopped talking so crazy

634
00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:03.140
like it gets closer and closer and closer and finally the copper and the body

635
00:37:03.141 --> 00:37:04.280
cam pulls out the Taser.

636
00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:09.440
The other officers out of the frame is behind him with his firearm out and the

637
00:37:09.441 --> 00:37:12.510
guy what you're fucking like put it down.

638
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.380
<v 15>Approaching, approaching, approaching, approaching.</v>

639
00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.950
<v 12>Well you're not getting the knife down. Put it down.</v>

640
00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.650
<v 6>He gets within like 10 feet of the cops,</v>

641
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.100
<v 12>Taser, Taser, Taser taker.</v>

642
00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.990
<v 6>The guy with buddy campfires, the Taser, the guy holding the knife,</v>

643
00:37:25.991 --> 00:37:28.690
he falls onto his back onto this cement driveway.

644
00:37:28.691 --> 00:37:29.800
Still got the knife in his hand.

645
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.780
<v 12>Dan, are you going to get it again? Put it down. Are you going to get it again?</v>

646
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:36.190
<v 6>And the cop who's got his gun out, he hustles over,</v>

647
00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.660
kicks the knife out of the guy's hand, grabs him by the hand, turns him over,

648
00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:40.940
right?

649
00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.760
<v 12>And then he's been trying central coast for cuffs,</v>

650
00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:46.150
him and then [inaudible] Derek, man, it's not a,

651
00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:49.090
it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming at the police.

652
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.270
<v 15>The officer will say,</v>

653
00:37:50.271 --> 00:37:53.210
why didn't you listen to me and just dropped the knife and walked her. Me.

654
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:54.380
Why did you keep coming at me

655
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:58.720
<v 12>real lucky you didn't get shot. I want it. I was trying not to lose.</v>

656
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:01.510
Trying your best to get shot. I'll see you down here. You want to die?

657
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:05.980
I want to see you wanna die. Huh? You can die.

658
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.060
<v 15>He tells the officer goes,</v>

659
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:10.070
I'm Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill

660
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:15.740
<v 12>[inaudible] all right, there we go on stand up. Alright, count to three. One,</v>

661
00:38:15.741 --> 00:38:20.370
two, three. And so the two cops pick them up, walk them over to the squad car,

662
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.863
put them in

663
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:27.000
<v 6>in the video lens. Huh? So this is the thing that you guys,</v>

664
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.440
will you use this video for? What exactly? One

665
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.640
<v 15>of multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things.</v>

666
00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:34.411
You know, and,

667
00:38:34.411 --> 00:38:39.040
and that's the points we hit home are the officers use time and distance to

668
00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:39.970
their advantage.

669
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.420
They didn't pull right up and the guidleines in the car and tried to stab.

670
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:45.640
When I'm in Uni, you have to resort to deadly force right away.

671
00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.020
They use verbal commands first warn and let them know what's going on. Uh,

672
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.160
trigger control was another thing. You know what? That Taser, Taser, Taser,

673
00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.970
and this is important because the guy's partner was holding a gun.

674
00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:58.923
Had he heard this,

675
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.680
you might've just instinctively reacted thinking it was a gunshot and fired his

676
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:02.980
gun.

677
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:07.330
So you know he's deploying the Taser and communication is key communication with

678
00:39:07.331 --> 00:39:10.150
the person you're trying to arrest in communication with your fellow officers

679
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.580
because those are the things that we drive home. And again,

680
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.950
there was no doubt in my mind that they,

681
00:39:14.951 --> 00:39:19.360
one officer in particular knew that individual from prior contact. Right.

682
00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:22.840
I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek, right?

683
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.620
It's like Derrick is Derrick and Derrick isn't just a black man shirtless with a

684
00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:29.050
knife in his hand when there's no connection there.

685
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.860
It's a lot easier to see somebody as nameless and faceless and I got scared and

686
00:39:32.861 --> 00:39:34.720
I shot him. But because of that,

687
00:39:34.721 --> 00:39:39.580
knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of a rapport that

688
00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:43.390
made the officer think of how he's going to deal with this thing.

689
00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:46.880
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

690
00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.230
<v 6>actually after we finished watching them video and I was packing up Chit with</v>

691
00:39:50.231 --> 00:39:53.380
told me that just a couple months after that incident on bike and through the

692
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:55.950
neighborhood and you might man sit on the front step waves at me. Hey you,

693
00:39:55.951 --> 00:39:59.500
what are you doing man? It did. Derrick does. Yeah. You stupid son of a bitch.

694
00:39:59.501 --> 00:40:00.760
You don't know how close you came to being dead,

695
00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.670
but he's back on his medication,

696
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.750
wasn't doing drugs and he was as completely as normal as me.

697
00:40:07.751 --> 00:40:08.584
And you are right now.

698
00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:10.400
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

699
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.880
<v 6>no, again, uh, almost kind of like when I was with these women,</v>

700
00:40:13.881 --> 00:40:18.881
it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a

701
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:21.140
few months after I left

702
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.550
<v 16>last night's primary election. Among the big winners.</v>

703
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.750
Daytona beach is police chief. He is now Belushi county's new sheriff.

704
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:32.540
<v 6>Well, Mike Chitwood was elected the sheriff of Volusia County.</v>

705
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.780
<v 16>Humble. I am extremely honored,</v>

706
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.570
<v 6>which is the county that Daytona beach belongs to. Huh.</v>

707
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.780
And the other thing to mention is that, uh,

708
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.010
chipper belongs this organization called Perf,

709
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.440
which is the police executive research forum.

710
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.800
It's this big coalition of police chiefs and in 2016 per put out what they

711
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:53.141
called her,

712
00:40:53.141 --> 00:40:56.990
30 guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle, well,

713
00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:01.370
rather than being something law and order law and order is the sanctity of human

714
00:41:01.371 --> 00:41:05.840
life. Hmm. Now just a month after proof put out those principles.

715
00:41:05.841 --> 00:41:09.350
Two of the biggest policing organizations in the world, the ICP,

716
00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.530
the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the fraternal order of

717
00:41:12.531 --> 00:41:13.280
police.

718
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:18.260
The big police in union both came out against these guiding principles,

719
00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.920
basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these

720
00:41:21.921 --> 00:41:24.080
principles make it more dangerous.

721
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.560
And then just like eight months later or so, um,

722
00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:32.570
the ICP and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these

723
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.910
principles. Hmm. Despite that,

724
00:41:34.911 --> 00:41:37.460
there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations,

725
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:39.440
but according to Ben, for the very first time,

726
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:43.550
I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking

727
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:46.510
about this two or three years ago. Huh. I don't know man.

728
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.361
And just thinking about this,

729
00:41:47.361 --> 00:41:52.361
like you've got these women who have become kind of a political force.

730
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:57.970
You have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way

731
00:41:58.521 --> 00:42:01.490
policing is done in America, or at least maybe slowly. Right.

732
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.500
But cumulatively it does. I hesitate to use this word, but it does make,

733
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.500
it does feel like reason for hope. Right.

734
00:42:09.501 --> 00:42:12.470
And I sort of felt the same way too, but

735
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.970
there was this experience than I had registered,

736
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.470
realized how far hope has to go.

737
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.100
We are here to see Natasha Clemons. Natasha Clemons,

738
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.110
the mother of Rodney Mitchell. Okay.

739
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.740
So in touch with a woman who you heard earlier,

740
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.180
I'm back at the community center.

741
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:34.730
I've met 400 other mothers who lost their children.

742
00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:36.920
That's actually when I first met her.

743
00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:40.520
Men had been reporting on Natasha for like a couple of years by this point.

744
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.450
And we were there because Ben was going to hand a ton of documents over to

745
00:42:44.451 --> 00:42:47.510
Natasha on her son Rodney's case, cause she didn't have any.

746
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.030
And I was there because we'd set up a short interview with Natasha.

747
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:51.020
But when we got to her door,

748
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:02.360
<v 11>she just started sobbing.</v>

749
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:28.910
And then I just had no idea what had happened.

750
00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:46.780
<v 6>But then usually I just turn the tape recorder off. Huh. So what was,</v>

751
00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:49.810
what was happening in that moment? Well. Okay, so the backup.

752
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:54.100
So meeting somebody like Chitwood, you know, um,

753
00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:59.170
like there is a sort of hope in that I believe. But the thing about, uh,

754
00:43:59.171 --> 00:44:00.710
Chitwood, um, uh,

755
00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:05.730
sheriff a police chief is that the only have the power to fire a police officer.

756
00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:10.720
And that's really about it. After that, it goes into the court system.

757
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:15.190
And so for Natasha, um, her son, Rodney, 23 years old,

758
00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:19.780
unarmed was shot and killed by two police officers during a traffic stop after

759
00:44:19.781 --> 00:44:22.780
the shooting, a judge ruled that the two officers had done nothing wrong.

760
00:44:22.781 --> 00:44:24.970
They had acted in accordance with the law.

761
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:30.510
And it just so happened that 45 minutes before Ben and I showed up at her,

762
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.820
she just got an email from her lawyers saying that the appeal that she had filed

763
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.150
against that decision, uh, had just been rejected.

764
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.510
And so we sat there in Natasha's apartment for awhile.

765
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.410
We actually even left for like an hour, eventually came back,

766
00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:52.740
kind of just hit reset on the whole thing. Mentally. Natasha,

767
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:56.640
show me some pictures of Romney, long dreads. He's got a big, big smile.

768
00:44:56.730 --> 00:45:01.160
Big Smile, right? White smile. And then we sat down in her kitchen table. Um,

769
00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:06.420
okay. So, uh, if you can walk me back to the night,

770
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:08.250
that kind of everything. Everything happened

771
00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.820
<v 10>and shown 11, 2012, Natasha was at home,</v>

772
00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:16.550
nine 30 at night, Rodney who was 23 years old,

773
00:45:16.551 --> 00:45:19.040
was back from college and out driving and touch car.

774
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.720
That's when all the phone calls started happening. People calling,

775
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.920
saying something's going on with your car. I knew something was wrong.

776
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:29.150
So I immediately started screaming outside to see if I can get somebody to,

777
00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:33.050
you know, respond to help me so I can get a ride. Nobody came, came out.

778
00:45:33.051 --> 00:45:36.140
So I started running down the interstate barefoot. I just left.

779
00:45:36.141 --> 00:45:38.840
I don't even recall locking the door or anything like that.

780
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:42.680
Eventually a family member actually picks her up. They drive to the scene,

781
00:45:42.681 --> 00:45:47.240
she gets there, it looks like just people everywhere, police cars.

782
00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.410
And I was like, where's Rodney?

783
00:45:48.411 --> 00:45:51.250
I was looking for my vehicle and my one cousin says, [inaudible],

784
00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.280
he's over there.

785
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:55.010
She pointed about 20 feet over to where the car had come to a stop.

786
00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:56.300
And it collided with a gas station,

787
00:45:56.330 --> 00:46:01.190
but then she had the the back of my loop on my pants so that I couldn't run over

788
00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:01.970
there.

789
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:05.630
The whole place was surrounded by a police tape and eventually Natasha says it

790
00:46:05.631 --> 00:46:06.291
took a couple of hours,

791
00:46:06.291 --> 00:46:11.120
but a cop pulled her off to the side and told her that her son had been shot and

792
00:46:11.121 --> 00:46:14.360
killed by police. I just got on my knees, hands and knees, and started praying.

793
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:18.230
Don't let this speech roll please, Lord. I was basically big and in pleading,

794
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:23.180
that's the only thing I could to what, what else do you do? Is Cry,

795
00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.290
scream, pray, Christ, scream, pray, cry, scream, pray. Next thing you know,

796
00:46:27.291 --> 00:46:29.060
I woke up, I was at the hospital.

797
00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.050
Natasha says that she apparently was so frenzy,

798
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:36.410
did that an EMT on the scene struggled with something to calm me down.

799
00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.460
So when I woke up, I see my family standing over me in the hospital.

800
00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.570
<v 6>You know, as to what happened to Rodney that night,</v>

801
00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.530
Ben has looked at testimony from the cops involved from eyewitnesses,

802
00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:52.220
different court records to piece together the events. You know, Rodney,

803
00:46:52.221 --> 00:46:53.720
according to all these documents that night,

804
00:46:53.721 --> 00:46:56.090
Rodney and his 60 year old cousin were in Natasha's car.

805
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:57.410
They had stopped at a gas station.

806
00:46:57.411 --> 00:47:00.080
They left the gas station and were driving down this, uh,

807
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:04.210
highway when he and his little cousin, uh, get pulled over by two, uh,

808
00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:08.450
white officers. The officer said he saw him without a seatbelt.

809
00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.840
It turns out Rodney was wearing a seatbelt and these two officers approaches

810
00:47:11.841 --> 00:47:14.930
vehicle one is kind of standing in front of the car about several feet away

811
00:47:14.931 --> 00:47:16.220
towards like the driver's side.

812
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.730
And the officer approaches his window according to Rodney's cousin, he says,

813
00:47:19.731 --> 00:47:23.630
boy, why didn't you pull over sooner? And uh,

814
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:25.790
and then orders Rodney to put the car in park.

815
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:29.740
And Ronnie's got both hands at this point on the steering wheel and reaches down

816
00:47:29.741 --> 00:47:30.730
to put the car in park.

817
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.420
And this is where things in the story sort of diverge because the cops say that

818
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:38.470
Rodney put the car in park but then quickly put it back into drive accelerated

819
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.000
at the officer in front of the car.

820
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.130
Ronnie's cousin gives two conflicting accounts as to what happened.

821
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:46.420
And there was apparently an eye witness across the street who said the car had

822
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:49.960
yet to move, but what is clear is what happened next,

823
00:47:49.961 --> 00:47:53.320
which is deputy and front pulls out his gun fires two shots,

824
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:56.170
and in the windshield, the deputy right by the door. Here's the fire.

825
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.500
He pulls a gun and fires twice. One bullet went through Rodney's left hand,

826
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:00.910
which he'd put up in Self-defense.

827
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:05.170
Another bullet entered through his left temple and the car lurches forward and

828
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.470
Corinne's across the street for about 300 yards until it collides with this gas

829
00:48:08.471 --> 00:48:12.280
station. Rodney's cousin at this point gets out of the car fleets from the scene

830
00:48:12.281 --> 00:48:15.940
unharmed. Eventually paramedics arrive in pronounced Rodney dead at the scene.

831
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:23.090
<v 10>My mind is always on Rodney. Natasha says, when she does think about that night,</v>

832
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:27.290
she always comes back to this one question. Why were the guns pulled?

833
00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:32.030
Why? Why? What? Why was that? What was that all about?

834
00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:37.010
What do you think the answer is? He's black and that's just it.

835
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.210
Is there ever a moment where you try and put yourself in the mind of those two

836
00:48:41.211 --> 00:48:45.410
officers? Absolutely not because I would never do somebody kid like that.

837
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:51.320
That never crossed. No, I would never do that. Do you feel like it's like,

838
00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:57.380
do you feel like the cop in that moment it's Rodney's black is what frightens

839
00:48:57.381 --> 00:49:02.120
the cop and that's why he pulls his gun out? No, he's the bully. Hell if he,

840
00:49:02.121 --> 00:49:04.550
if somebody gets hurt, he doesn't mind. He gets injured or killed,

841
00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:09.110
he's going to get off. He's behind that blue badge. She's a bully.

842
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:13.700
Is that what you think of cops like writ large? That's how it is.

843
00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.270
That's exactly how it is. Nope. EFMs and buts about it.

844
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.150
Cause it's hard for me cause I think like,

845
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:24.620
like it's clear that there's discrimination that exists within the police force

846
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.430
and the people who they are sworn to protect and serve.

847
00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:33.200
But like at the end of the day there's probably a hand like, well I don't know,

848
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:37.740
I couldn't give you a percentage but a number of officers in which like yes they

849
00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:41.540
are probably violent individuals who don't belong in a police force.

850
00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:46.810
But I would assume that like a majority of the cops mean well have probably

851
00:49:48.441 --> 00:49:53.441
probably have some sort of bias where they don't think I see a black person and

852
00:49:54.231 --> 00:49:58.580
I'm going to like, I'm going to get that boy. But that there's like a,

853
00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:03.810
like there's some sort of triggered response and that the police are constantly

854
00:50:04.431 --> 00:50:09.020
being put into different situations where they feel under threat and concerned

855
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:10.640
and that like,

856
00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:15.170
there's like a whole host of factors leading to these moments where somebody is

857
00:50:15.171 --> 00:50:19.520
shot and killed. It's not just that they're out here bullying people.

858
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:22.790
You say that because you're, you're white.

859
00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.540
That's why you say that. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what,

860
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:33.650
we can try this, go to my sister, we'll make sure we can get your week,

861
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:36.380
go to tennis lawn, get yourself spree black,

862
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:40.430
and I guarantee you you'll get a different response. I dare you try it.

863
00:50:40.431 --> 00:50:43.790
I bet you we could make you look like a a black boy. I'm telling you,

864
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.950
you'll see a huge difference. And that's just it.

865
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:55.110
<v 6>Like sitting, like sitting there in that moment, I,</v>

866
00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:57.480
I felt I felt the Gulf

867
00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:00.163
<v 11>and [inaudible]</v>

868
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.500
<v 6>I just kept wondering like,</v>

869
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:09.650
how long does it take to fill that golf? Like how many Chitwood's does it take?

870
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.130
Uh, how many conversations need to happen

871
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:20.760
in any case? Um,

872
00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:25.320
do you want us to then still had to give Natasha those files on Rodney to get

873
00:51:25.321 --> 00:51:29.160
those documents for you? I would appreciate it. Sure. Okay.

874
00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:33.560
Yeah. Sorry.

875
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:38.070
So Ben grabbed this huge folder of paper out of the trunk of our car,

876
00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:42.240
walked back inside. This is not everything.

877
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.690
Um, Ben put the stack of Rodney's files on this glass kitchen table.

878
00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:52.570
<v 3>So again, with the stack, um, uh,</v>

879
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:57.190
like 10, uh, crime scene photos,

880
00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.540
because I don't want to be the person, uh,

881
00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:04.120
to give you those unless you want me to go get them right now.

882
00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:06.560
<v 11>But there, you know,</v>

883
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:14.560
I don't want to, I won't have it.

884
00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:18.520
I don't wanna retraumatize you and their graph, just frankly the graphics,

885
00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.850
you know, so, um,

886
00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:25.540
I'll leave it up to you. You don't have to tell me right now.

887
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.690
<v 10>Yeah. When I'm ready, I'll get them.</v>

888
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:35.840
[inaudible] and I'm going to have to eventually see, yeah,

889
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:40.890
<v 6>three days later.</v>

890
00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:45.890
And Atocha contacted Ben and said that she was ready to see those photos.

891
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:58.920
<v 11>Wow.</v>

892
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.693
[inaudible]

893
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.210
uh, [inaudible]

894
00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:47.310
<v 13>huge thanks to Ben monk,</v>

895
00:53:47.311 --> 00:53:49.780
I mean at the Tampa Bay times and to the staff at the paper that,

896
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.740
that did all the hard work of gathering statistics and material in the near,

897
00:53:53.741 --> 00:53:56.350
near future. They're going to be putting out Ben Story,

898
00:53:56.351 --> 00:53:59.920
a whole series of videos and interactive graphic with all their final numbers.

899
00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:02.950
It should be amazing. Definitely check it out. Well,

900
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.100
we'll make sure that we link to it when it's live from our website,

901
00:54:06.101 --> 00:54:11.101
radiolab.org and then of course to our own Med guilty who reported and produced

902
00:54:11.891 --> 00:54:15.560
this piece. Next week we'll bring you part two of, ah,

903
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:19.660
Matt Kielty and Ben Montgomery's reporting to very different kinds of story.

904
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:24.220
A check in for that. Okay. Um, chat app and Ron,

905
00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.350
I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
