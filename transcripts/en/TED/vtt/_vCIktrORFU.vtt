00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:15.873
Big boys don't cry.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.404
Suck it up.

00:00:19.558 --> 00:00:21.232
Shut up and rub some dirt on it.

00:00:22.462 --> 00:00:25.136
Stop crying before I give you
something to cry about.

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:28.116
These are just a few of the phrases

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.314
that contribute
to a disease in our society,

00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:33.297
and more specifically, in our men.

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:38.669
It's a disease that has come
to be known as "toxic masculinity."

00:00:40.044 --> 00:00:42.591
It's one I suffered a chronic case of,

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:47.274
so much so that I spent 24 years
of a life sentence in prison

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:50.343
for kidnapping, robbery,
and attempted murder.

00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:56.099
Yet I'm here to tell you today
that there's a solution for this epidemic.

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:01.509
I know for a fact the solution works,
because I was a part of human trials.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.596
The solution is a mixture of elements.

00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:10.163
It begins with the willingness
to look at your belief system

00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:12.437
and how out of alignment it is

00:01:12.461 --> 00:01:15.752
and how your actions
negatively impact not just yourself,

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:17.080
but the people around you.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:22.389
The next ingredient is the willingness
to be vulnerable with people

00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:27.045
who would not just support you,
but hold you accountable.

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.481
But before I tell you about this,

00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:33.807
I need to let you know
that in order to share this,

00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:37.472
I have to bare my soul in full.

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:40.314
And as I stand here,

00:01:40.338 --> 00:01:42.147
with so many eyes fixed on me,

00:01:43.238 --> 00:01:45.639
I feel raw and naked.

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:49.690
When this feeling is present,

00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:53.554
I'm confident that the next phase
of healing is on the horizon,

00:01:55.422 --> 00:01:57.699
and that allows me
to share my story in full.

00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:04.289
For all appearances' sake,
I was born into the ideal family dynamic:

00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:06.939
mother, father, sister, brother.

00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:12.623
Bertha, Eldra Jr., Taydama and Eldra III.

00:02:12.647 --> 00:02:13.797
That's me.

00:02:14.978 --> 00:02:17.987
My father was a Vietnam veteran
who earned a Purple Heart

00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:22.043
and made it home to find love,
marry, and begin his own brood.

00:02:23.273 --> 00:02:26.526
So how did I wind up serving life
in the California prison system?

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.336
Keeping secrets,

00:02:30.527 --> 00:02:33.162
believing the mantra
that big boys don't cry,

00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:38.705
not knowing how to display any emotion
confidently other than anger,

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:42.675
participating in athletics

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.552
and learning that the greater
the performance on the field,

00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:48.114
the less the need to worry
about the rules off it.

00:02:48.486 --> 00:02:51.312
It's hard to pin down
any one specific ingredient

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:53.842
of the many symptoms that ailed me.

00:02:55.613 --> 00:02:59.715
Growing up as a young black male
in Sacramento, California in the 1980s,

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.596
there were two groups
I identified as having respect:

00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:05.993
athletes and gangsters.

00:03:07.463 --> 00:03:08.976
I excelled in sports,

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.741
that is until a friend and I chose to take
his mom's car for a joyride and wreck it.

00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:19.673
With my parents having to split
the cost of a totaled vehicle,

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:25.428
I was relegated to a summer
of household chores and no sports.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.095
No sports meant no respect.

00:03:30.592 --> 00:03:32.992
No respect equaled no power.

00:03:34.103 --> 00:03:37.468
Power was vital to feed my illness.

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:44.352
It was at that point the decision
to transition from athlete to gangster

00:03:44.376 --> 00:03:46.793
was made and done so easily.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:52.389
Early life experiences had set the stage
for me to be well-suited

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.723
to objectify others,

00:03:57.635 --> 00:03:59.958
act in a socially detached manner,

00:03:59.982 --> 00:04:03.799
and above all else, seek to be viewed
as in a position of power.

00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:07.017
A sense of power

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.379
(Sighs)

00:04:11.331 --> 00:04:13.832
equaled strength in my environment,

00:04:13.856 --> 00:04:16.029
but more importantly,
it did so in my mind.

00:04:16.916 --> 00:04:18.907
My mind dictated my choices.

00:04:20.138 --> 00:04:23.645
My subsequent choices put me
on the fast track to prison life.

00:04:25.278 --> 00:04:28.072
And even once in prison,
I continued my history

00:04:28.096 --> 00:04:30.174
of running over the rights of others,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.540
even knowing that that
was the place that I would die.

00:04:35.564 --> 00:04:38.859
Once again, I wound up
in solitary confinement

00:04:39.748 --> 00:04:42.518
for stabbing another prisoner
nearly 30 times.

00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:47.752
I'd gotten to a place where I didn't care
how I lived or if I died.

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:51.331
But then, things changed.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.198
One of the best things
that happened in my life to that point

00:04:55.222 --> 00:04:57.075
was being sent to New Folsom Prison.

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.242
Once there, I was approached
to join a group called Inside Circle.

00:05:03.693 --> 00:05:07.662
Initially, I was hesitant to join a group
referred to around the yard

00:05:07.686 --> 00:05:09.475
as "hug-a-thug."

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:12.735
(Laughter)

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.471
Initially, yeah, that was a little much,

00:05:17.495 --> 00:05:19.973
but eventually, I overcame my hesitancy.

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:26.510
As it turned out, the circle was
the vision of a man named Patrick Nolan,

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.468
who was also serving life

00:05:28.492 --> 00:05:32.838
and who had grown sick and tired
of being sick and tired

00:05:32.862 --> 00:05:34.638
of watching us kill one another

00:05:35.598 --> 00:05:36.891
over skin color,

00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:39.090
rag color,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.688
being from Northern
or Southern California,

00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:48.060
or just plain breathing
in the wrong direction on a windy day.

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:52.145
Circle time is men sitting with men

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.804
and cutting through the bullshit,

00:05:55.287 --> 00:05:57.676
challenging structural ways of thinking.

00:05:58.346 --> 00:06:00.180
I think the way that I think

00:06:00.204 --> 00:06:01.779
and I act the way that I act

00:06:02.874 --> 00:06:04.540
because I hadn't questioned that.

00:06:06.104 --> 00:06:09.023
Like, who said I should see a woman
walking down the street,

00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:12.547
turn around and check out her backside?

00:06:13.531 --> 00:06:14.761
Where did that come from?

00:06:15.864 --> 00:06:19.102
If I don't question that,
I'll just go along with the crowd.

00:06:21.706 --> 00:06:23.070
The locker-room talk.

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:26.849
In circle, we sit
and we question these things.

00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:28.741
Why do I think the way that I think?

00:06:28.765 --> 00:06:30.475
Why do I act the way that I act?

00:06:31.087 --> 00:06:33.626
Because when I get down to it,
I'm not thinking,

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.910
I'm not being an individual,

00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:38.576
I'm not taking responsibility for who I am

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.513
and what it is I put into this world.

00:06:42.233 --> 00:06:45.184
It was in a circle session
that my life took a turn.

00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:47.565
I remember being asked who I was,

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:49.010
and I didn't have an answer,

00:06:49.913 --> 00:06:51.771
at least not one that felt honest

00:06:51.795 --> 00:06:54.837
in a room full of men
who were seeking truth.

00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:56.604
It would have been easy to say,

00:06:56.628 --> 00:06:58.340
"I'm a Blood,"

00:06:58.364 --> 00:07:00.596
or, "My name is Vegas,"

00:07:01.396 --> 00:07:04.784
or any number of facades
I had manufactured to hide behind.

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:09.762
It was in that moment and in that venue
that the jig was up.

00:07:11.362 --> 00:07:13.775
I realized that as sharp
as I believed I was,

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:15.884
I didn't even know who I was

00:07:15.908 --> 00:07:17.893
or why I acted the way that I acted.

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:25.102
I couldn't stand in a room full of men
who were seeking to serve and support

00:07:25.126 --> 00:07:27.070
and present an authentic me.

00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:33.140
It was in that moment
that I graduated to a place within

00:07:33.164 --> 00:07:34.944
that was ready for transformation.

00:07:36.317 --> 00:07:38.041
For decades,

00:07:38.065 --> 00:07:42.155
I kept being the victim of molestation
at the hands of a babysitter a secret.

00:07:43.277 --> 00:07:46.952
I submitted to this under the threat
of my younger sister being harmed.

00:07:46.976 --> 00:07:48.943
I was seven, she was three.

00:07:50.281 --> 00:07:53.392
I believed it was my responsibility
to keep her safe.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.786
It was in that instant

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.032
that the seeds were sown
for a long career of hurting others,

00:08:03.056 --> 00:08:05.889
be it physical, mental or emotional.

00:08:07.604 --> 00:08:10.643
I developed, in that instant,

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:13.298
at seven years old,

00:08:13.322 --> 00:08:15.193
the belief that going forward in life,

00:08:15.217 --> 00:08:19.696
if a situation presented itself
where someone was going to get hurt,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.529
I would be the one doing the hurting.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.870
I also formulated the belief
that loving put me in harm's way.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:31.834
I also learned that caring
about another person made me weak.

00:08:33.376 --> 00:08:36.122
So not caring, that must equal strength.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.855
The greatest way to mask
a shaky sense of self

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:43.022
is to hide behind a false air of respect.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.059
Sitting in circle
resembles sitting in a fire.

00:08:47.654 --> 00:08:50.480
It is a crucible that can and does break.

00:08:52.542 --> 00:08:54.668
It broke my old sense of self,

00:08:55.573 --> 00:08:58.784
diseased value system

00:08:58.808 --> 00:09:00.507
and way of looking at others.

00:09:02.245 --> 00:09:06.955
My old stale modes of thinking
were invited into the open

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:09.161
to see if this
is who I wanted to be in life.

00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:12.638
I was accompanied by skilled facilitators

00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:15.391
on a journey into the depths of myself

00:09:15.415 --> 00:09:20.051
to find those wounded parts
that not only festered

00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:23.368
but seeped out to create
unsafe space for others.

00:09:25.957 --> 00:09:28.981
At times, it resembled an exorcism,

00:09:29.005 --> 00:09:30.946
and in essence, it was.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.322
There was an extraction
of old, diseased ways of thinking,

00:09:35.346 --> 00:09:37.980
being and reacting

00:09:38.004 --> 00:09:39.676
and an infusion of purpose.

00:09:40.775 --> 00:09:42.909
Sitting in those circles saved my life.

00:09:44.749 --> 00:09:49.226
I stand here today as a testament
to the fact of the power of the work.

00:09:53.241 --> 00:09:56.074
I was paroled in June 2014,

00:09:56.098 --> 00:10:00.162
following my third hearing before a panel
of former law-enforcement officials

00:10:00.186 --> 00:10:03.868
who were tasked with determining
my current threat level to society.

00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:10.214
I stand here today for the first time
since I was 14 years old

00:10:10.238 --> 00:10:12.713
not under any form of state supervision.

00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:15.450
I'm married to a tremendous
woman named Holly,

00:10:15.474 --> 00:10:17.647
and together, we are raising two sons

00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:22.822
who I encourage to experience
emotions in a safe way.

00:10:24.053 --> 00:10:26.824
I let them hold me when I cry.

00:10:26.848 --> 00:10:30.141
They get to witness me
not have all the answers.

00:10:30.165 --> 00:10:32.410
My desire is for them to understand

00:10:32.434 --> 00:10:35.966
that being a man is not
some machismo caricature,

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.189
and that characteristics
usually defined as weaknesses

00:10:41.213 --> 00:10:43.220
are parts of the whole healthy man.

00:10:44.066 --> 00:10:47.208
So today, I continue to work
not just on myself,

00:10:47.232 --> 00:10:49.899
but in support of young males
in my community.

00:10:51.225 --> 00:10:54.336
The challenge is to eradicate this cycle

00:10:56.986 --> 00:10:59.515
of emotional illiteracy and groupthink

00:10:59.539 --> 00:11:04.824
that allows our males to continue
to victimize others as well as themselves.

00:11:05.475 --> 00:11:07.623
As a result of this,

00:11:07.647 --> 00:11:11.597
they develop new ways
of how they want to show up in the world

00:11:11.621 --> 00:11:14.390
and how they expect this world
to show up on their behalf.

00:11:15.303 --> 00:11:16.454
Thank you.

00:11:16.478 --> 00:11:20.658
(Applause)
