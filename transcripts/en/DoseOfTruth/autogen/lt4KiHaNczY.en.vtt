really a kind of a stupid little switch

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329
really a kind of a stupid little switch
 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.069
really a kind of a stupid little switch
but you put them together in the right

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
but you put them together in the right
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.389
but you put them together in the right
way and you get something really

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
way and you get something really
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.939
way and you get something really
brilliant and in the same way I don't

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
brilliant and in the same way I don't
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.200
brilliant and in the same way I don't
know all the history here but my

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
know all the history here but my
 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.679
know all the history here but my
understanding is that science begins or

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689
understanding is that science begins or
 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.120
understanding is that science begins or
the culture of science the scientific

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
the culture of science the scientific
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.840
the culture of science the scientific
revolution begins in Europe in the 17th

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
revolution begins in Europe in the 17th
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.480
revolution begins in Europe in the 17th
century as you begin getting you get the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
century as you begin getting you get the
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.100
century as you begin getting you get the
printing press so people can share their

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
printing press so people can share their
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.870
printing press so people can share their
ideas but you get communities of people

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
ideas but you get communities of people
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.249
ideas but you get communities of people
who are challenging each other's ideas

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
who are challenging each other's ideas
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.340
who are challenging each other's ideas
and that's what makes it so brilliant is

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
and that's what makes it so brilliant is
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.990
and that's what makes it so brilliant is
that is that people have to do their

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
that is that people have to do their
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090
that is that people have to do their
best we're really bad at disconfirming

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
best we're really bad at disconfirming
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.710
best we're really bad at disconfirming
our own ideas it's very hard to make

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
our own ideas it's very hard to make
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.480
our own ideas it's very hard to make
it's very hard to do that but you put

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
it's very hard to do that but you put
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.550
it's very hard to do that but you put
your ideas out there and then everyone

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
your ideas out there and then everyone
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.990
your ideas out there and then everyone
else is motivated to challenge them and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
else is motivated to challenge them and
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030
else is motivated to challenge them and
so if you put us together in the right

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040
so if you put us together in the right
 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.160
so if you put us together in the right
way the truth comes out and so

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
way the truth comes out and so
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.740
way the truth comes out and so

know this they have to listen to both

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
know this they have to listen to both

scientists should know this
