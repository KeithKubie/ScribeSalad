00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.660
- [Instructor] In this off-white color,

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.990
I have a handful of statements

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.040
that you might hear folks say especially

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.020
in the United States,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.780
and what we're going to think
about is are these statements

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.150
that you would typically
hear from a liberal?

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.480
And I'm gonna make a little key here,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.130
so I'm gonna use a light blue for liberal.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.850
Conservative, I'll use this salmon color

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.850
for conservative, or a libertarian?

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.740
So I'll do this white
color for libertarian.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.140
Libertarian.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.410
And I've pre-grouped these
statements into categories.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.030
They could be views on social
issues or economic issues

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.950
and within each of those dimensions,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.130
they could be views that
might want more social

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.900
or economic control or ones

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.410
that want less social or economic control,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.790
and this isn't a perfect full sampling of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.697
all of the major issues
that folks will talk about

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:51.780
and some of these things
kind of border on social

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020
and economic, or some of them

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.990
could be viewed as more
control depending on

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.190
how you view it or less control,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.070
but this is a first take on things.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.920
So let's just go from the
top left to the bottom right,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.330
and I encourage you to
keep pausing this video

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.730
and coming to your own conclusion.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.860
So this first statement,
affirmative action is a good thing.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.900
Would you expect that to come
from someone with a liberal,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.623
conservative, or libertarian ideology?

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.950
Well, this would typically come

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.620
from someone with a liberal ideology.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.290
Much of the ideas and policies

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.960
that liberals would favor
might be around curing

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.760
social injustice, so they might say,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.600
hey, we don't have the proper
diversity in certain walks

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.120
of life right now, we don't
have a level playing field,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.160
so we need to make sure

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.400
that people are properly represented,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.630
and so that would be something

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.760
that you would hear from liberals,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.593
and it would be something

00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:43.090
that in general involves more control.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.650
A libertarian or a conservative would say,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.770
hey, we shouldn't try to
do social engineering here,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.680
we should maybe make sure
people have equal opportunities,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.513
but that doesn't mean

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:57.160
that you have to have equal
representation and outcome.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.350
This next statement, marriage should be

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.920
between a man and woman.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.753
Pause this video.

00:02:01.753 --> 00:02:03.113
Who is likely to say that?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.500
Well, that would typically come

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.680
from someone with a conservative ideology.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.480
This would be around a theme that

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.560
many folks with conservative
ideologies would point

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.660
to values that are worth
preserving in a society,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.450
that should not change,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.900
and so that would
typically come from them,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.630
while a liberal or libertarian
is more likely to say,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.030
hey, what goes on between two people,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.090
well, that's their decision

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.690
and really the government should

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.823
have no say on what they do.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.350
We need tougher penalties

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.810
and policing to deal with crime.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.930
Well, once again, that would
be something that you would

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.380
likely hear from someone
with a conservative ideology.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.190
A liberal or libertarian
would be on the opposite side.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.440
They would say, hey, I'm
afraid of too strict penalties,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.100
too strict policing, I'm afraid

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.810
that the government is putting
too many people in jail.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.740
So now let's go to fewer social controls.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.520
So marijuana should be legalized.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.353
Pause this video.

00:03:00.353 --> 00:03:01.690
Who is more likely to say that?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.450
Well, many liberals would
be likely to say that,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.163
and also libertarians.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.620
They would say, hey, once again,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.820
what someone does within
their own privacy,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.840
why should the government have a say,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.000
while many conservatives,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.820
and this goes back to values

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.710
and kind of social fiber, might say,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.810
well no, some of these drugs,

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.930
they break down people's value system.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.350
Maybe they lead to crime and
so a conservative would be more

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.453
likely to be against legalizing
something like marijuana.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.253
The next statement.

00:03:34.253 --> 00:03:36.940
Laws restricting gun
rights are unconstitutional

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.760
and won't have the intended impact.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.593
Pause this video.

00:03:39.593 --> 00:03:40.513
Who would say that?

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.700
Well, you would often hear a statement

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.120
like this from someone with
a conservative ideology,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.640
but also from someone with
a libertarian ideology,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.530
so libertarian ideology would
also say something like that,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.400
and they would both cite

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.740
that people have a right
to protect themselves,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.520
they might cite, hey, people have a right

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.550
to use guns for things like hunting,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.330
and especially libertarians
might make the argument

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.160
that people need to be armed in order

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.330
to protect themselves from
an overly strong government,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.173
from an overly strong police state.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.170
So the next statement.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.540
Same-sex couples should
have full marriage rights.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.800
Who's most likely to say that?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.730
Well, this is kind of
the opposite statement

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.550
of this one we saw up here,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.250
and for the reasons we mentioned,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.350
this is more likely to come

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.350
from someone with a liberal
ideology or a libertarian,

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.370
libertarian ideology.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.480
And for them, it would be about

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.960
personal liberty and equal rights.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.810
And so you might already see some trends

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.810
that the conservative
and liberals are kind

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.740
of mixed on the social when
it comes to more control

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.810
or less control, and don't read

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.030
too much into how many there are of these.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.250
This is just, you could view

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.840
as a random sampling of some issues.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.250
If I sampled more, you might
have more liberal boxes up here

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.960
or more conservative boxes down here,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.250
but it seems like a mix.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.000
But one clear thing that comes out

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.260
is that libertarians
on the social dimension

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.740
are for less control.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.400
But what about the economic dimension?

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.430
So this first statement,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.410
everyone has a right
to quality healthcare.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.123
Who's more likely to say that?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.490
Well, that would be a liberal.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.410
Liberals, once again, they
think a lot about injustice

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.060
and inequality and they
want the government

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.140
to be proactive about it.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.950
And so they would say,
hey, the government should

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.800
somehow supply universal
healthcare to folks.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.970
Conservatives or libertarians,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.720
not that they don't care
about injustice or inequality,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.130
but they would argue that, hey,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.440
when the government kind
of intervenes in things,

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.320
they don't, they have all sorts
of unintended consequences

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.690
and oftentimes do more harm than good.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.580
The next statement.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.210
Rent control is a good thing.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.470
Well, once again, this is
likely to come from a liberal,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.480
probably motivated from the idea

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.330
that if rents or living
costs are getting too high,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.580
that this is a way to avoid
people being displaced

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.740
or being priced out of their neighborhood.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.900
Now, conservatives and
libertarians would argue

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.200
that rent control distorts the market,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.630
it actually makes the properties

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.670
that aren't on rent
control overly expensive,

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.000
and so it's probably
doing more harm than good.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.833
The next statement.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.450
Social safety nets are crucial.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.140
Once again, this is likely

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.810
to come from someone
with a liberal ideology.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.060
They believe that someone,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.150
that the government has
a role in making sure

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.860
that everyone has a
basic standard of living,

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.240
so programs like food stamps or welfare.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.840
Every worker has the
right to a living wage.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.040
And living wage is sometimes,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.790
you'll hear this in the context
of minimum-wage discussions.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.540
Who would say that?

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.610
Well, once again, you're

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.410
likely to hear this from
someone with a liberal ideology.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.460
They believe that higher
minimum wages are a good thing,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.750
while conservatives or
libertarians would argue that,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.930
no, that distorts the market

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.910
and actually you might
increase unemployment

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.450
and you might hurt the very people

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.640
that you're trying to help with some

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.990
of these efforts around minimum ages.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.170
And what about here when we go

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.200
to less control on the economy?

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.270
Government intervention

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.850
in the free market will slow
the economy, hurting everyone.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.140
Well, as you could imagine,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.260
this is kind of the opposite
statement as these here,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.490
because these once at the top

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.030
are all the government intervening

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.720
in a free economy in some way,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.970
and so this statement is more

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.690
likely to come from a conservative,

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.250
some of the conservative
ideology or a libertarian.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.460
And so when you look in
the economic dimension,

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.520
the distinction between
conservative and liberal,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.040
at least when it comes to more control

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.210
and less control, become more clear.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.160
On economics, liberals
tend to favor more control,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.700
more government intervention with a focus

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.260
of trying to address social

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.010
or economic inequality or
environmental concerns,

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.840
while conservatives and
libertarians will often say,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.660
well, that's gonna do more harm than good,

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.550
the government does have some functions

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.970
but it should really
be as small as possible

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.640
and free markets are what's,

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.000
in the end of the day, going
to make people better off.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.020
So I will leave you there,

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.940
this is a very simple model,

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.150
but it helps us start to
think about these issues,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.420
and so when you think about issues

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.130
and you read about it in the newspaper,

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.630
try to think about it in
this type of a framework.
