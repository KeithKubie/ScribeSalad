00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.780
So let's talk about sort of planning for
security.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.330
When we talk about security here,

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.039
obviously we're talking
about cyber security.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.440
So of course,
the first thing you're going to ask is,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.520
you talk about what is of
value what are the assets?

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.150
What needs to be secured?

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.490
You've been asked to come in and plan.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.060
The next thing you have to say is
if something has to be secured,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.920
whose responsibility is it to do that?

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.820
So who is responsible for it?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.700
Okay once we do that,
the next thing then we're going to

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.110
say well security is going to
require some controls okay,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.010
so once you have that [INAUDIBLE]
we know who is responsible for it.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.250
We know what kind of things they're
doing or what controls they're putting

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.380
in place, but are people really
supported to do what the need to do?

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.700
Do they have the budgets?

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.310
Do they have the authority?

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.790
And one thing to keep in mind is that

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.520
no matter how well we do all these
things that we are talking about.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.730
The risk is now going to be zero.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.910
So the chance, or

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.220
likelihood that something might go
wrong, well it's going to be there.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.124
And if something does go wrong,
fortunately if that were to happen,

00:01:07.124 --> 00:01:07.680
how do we respond to that?

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.230
How do we recover from that
adverse event that has happened

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.560
because some control either didn't exist
or didn't function as it should have.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.730
And of course if we had people
who are responsible for

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.080
doing certain things in our
security planning that we did and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.060
something bad happens,
there has to be accountability.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.510
So in the planning process we
always have to keep in mind that

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.970
we're never going to get 100% security.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.070
Okay.
The risk is never going to be zero so

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.500
we have to worry about, we sort of
focus on prevention, detection but

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.900
then of course we have to focus
on response and recovery as well.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.630
And the planning process has
to cover all those aspects.
