Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:05          great. Let's talk about consciousness a little bit. I just had Sam Harris on. We've, we've talked about it quite extensively. I think you have some thoughts on consciousness, the nature of consciousness. Indeed. Yeah. I mean it's probably to do this right, we would need to agree on a definition. I'm not sure that that's any definition that we choose will immediately antagonize some amount of your audience. This is like defining div wedding. This is like defining truth, which seems to be tough these days. Yes, exactly. Um, so maybe, maybe rather than that, um, you are humans the only conscious beings on this planet? I don't think so, but we are the most conscious. We are the most fully conscious and we have better access to our own consciousness obviously. Then we have access to the consciousness of say dolphins or elephants or other apes or maybe wolves, any of these long lived social organisms with long childhoods and generational overlap who lived sometimes with three generations together at a time.

Speaker 2:          01:09          So this transmission of cultural information, organisms that have theory of mind and can imagine can put themselves in the other individual's position. And think, what do they think is going on right now? Even though I understand that that's a different thing than what I think is going on right now, which we now know that certain monkeys and apes exactly do that. Yes, theory of mind. There's a beautiful book, um, called baboon metaphysics by the husband and wife, team Chaney and Seyfarth that basically explores theory of mind and baboons. Uh, and you know, it's not the only one. Um, they're, they're not the only species, but you know, how do we as humans find our consciousness best? You know, there, there are ways that we can hack into what is sometimes been called flow states or, um, you know, that's, that's the most common one. But you know, we can do so through well, through deep conversation, um, through meditation, through music, some, sometimes through producing it, but sometimes to experiencing, especially live music, dance for some people, Hallucinogens, sex, sport, you know, intense physical or physiological or emotional experience in which we are just moving with others usually.

Speaker 2:          02:27          And you know, there are those of us like myself, you have a very strong introvert who will find, so my deepest flow stays, you know, access to consciousness alone. You're alone in the Amazon when I can sit and watch monkeys and write that for me. That's one of them. But sport is also, so when I talked about this with Sam, the way he was defining it, which I think is sort of similar to what you're saying here, it strikes me as just like an extreme ability to maintain presence in the moment that that really sort of when a basketball player, so if we use the sport analogy like a basketball her when they're the zone, you know, and Jordan scores 20 points and five minutes and he just, he goes, well, everything I threw up just went in like that. They hit that level of consciousness or for you to be outside enough out of yourself to be able to write in that perfect moment or, or whatever it is that it, oh, it always seems about being present more than anything else to me is a kind of, um, time stopping time stopping and disappearing on you at the same time, which I think is part of why Anthea, Jen's hallucinate, hallucinogens can kind of capture that as well because they're, the sense of time just disappearing on you is, is remarkable.

Speaker 2:          03:33          Um, so you, you both don't care about time and time passes usually in ways that seem quicker than you were expecting them to, uh, with, with say sports or um, or right. Meditation. I, yeah, that's not one that I do, but, um, you know, Sam has a lot to say about that. Of course. Um, yeah, I remember when I was doing mushrooms, at least squares in college aged somewhat consistently, maybe every six months or something. Um, I would always want the clocks to be covered. Yes. Because I hated it. I hated the numbers are no good. I did. I definitely did. One trip like five hours in the mirror, forget that. But I always wanted the clocks to be covered because the idea that time was passing while I was in this state was, was very scary to me. That's scary. Or just, I just wanted nothing to do with it.

Speaker 2:          04:22          I guess. Maybe it doesn't matter what that distinction is, you know, scary or just not interested. Right. But, um, so it's, it's very different. The, the kinds of consciousness enhancing activities that we can engage in, including hallucinogens are very different. If you're inside in a room like this where you have no access to what is going on climatologically or weather wise outside, as opposed to if you, if you are out and you can watch as the sunsets and as the moon comes up and you can think again, oh, right, it's a, it's a, it's a waxing moon. It'll be full in four days and um, or you know, or you're at a coast and you can watch the tides and think about the shifting time. So for me, thinking about time that is clearly being brought as clearly being revealed by the planet. We're on as opposed to coming at me through a clock is more meaningful and I'm, I'm willing to think about time in that way, but definitely not through clocks when I'm, when I'm writing hallucinogen sport, any of that.

Speaker 2:          05:25          Right. And yet we have all of these devices now that are men constantly talk to our time that are meant to take our attention that does he literally designed this way? Do you sense runs like that? There's actually a digital assault on consciousness because maybe that really does explain so many of the other problems we're having in society right now. It's, it's one of the key pieces for sure. And I think that phrase is brilliant. A digital assault on consciousness. This is something, I'm Tristan Harris who I don't know, but I bet him on the show. Yeah, I'm talks talks about a lot and you know, he, he's been, he has been ringing the alarm bell for years about the algorithms that are being put into our devices that are, that are creating addicts out of us. But more broadly, your, you know, the digital assault on consciousness is, there's not, there is, it's increasingly hard to find a space where you're just actually free and clear.

Speaker 2:          06:20          And this is, you know, this is part of what I do for myself and what I used to do for my students was take them to places, not only that we're remote and where they could explore nature, but where there was no cell signal where there was no internet. So, you know, the deepest part of the Amazon that I took students to, there's just, there's no email, there's no internet, there's no Wifi. We are, you know, a plane ride over the Andes and then a boat ride and then a truck ride and then another five hours down a tributary of the Amazon to a place with no roads, no airstrips, nothing. And boy, this time feel different and you need, you're sleeping in little cabins that are screened. And so you wake up when the insects and the birds and the monkeys wake up and they start talking at you.

Speaker 2:          07:04          They're not talking to you, they're talking to themselves. But you getting a sense of the rhythms of the planet that we're on can return people I think to a real sense of self and also to a sense of what they value, what their passions are. And this is a big thing that I think is missing in many of the, to return to what we were talking about earlier. You know, the, the far left activists, the control left mostly I think lack another passion. And I've said before I, you know, the prediction I would make is that you have very few rock climbers or skiers among the radical left activists. People who have something that they can engage in that frees them from time and devices from, from a response to time. I need to be here then or this my thing just pinged me. I need to look at it, uh, are better able to center themselves to, to find their own consciousness and discover who, who they are and what they want to be in the world.

Speaker 2:          08:02          What does that say about the self? Do you think? To me. There's something there about like if you really believe in the self and your and the individual and your ability to overcome things, you don't need all these external processes to help define the world because you're sort of defining it yourself. I agree and I think I do think for me self sufficiency is one of my highest values personally and I have a, I have a very hard time understanding anyone who says Oh if you leave me on my own I wouldn't know what to do. Like I, I just don't get this. I don't get why you would maybe want to lefty thing. I'd be fine too. I'm like what? Why would, why would you broadcast to the world that you would be helpless? This doesn't make any sense to me but, and you know there plenty of situations where I wouldn't know what to do and I would know what to do in situations that most people wouldn't just because of where I've traveled and where I've lived.

Speaker 2:          08:55          But the idea that self sufficiency required, the idea that you want to be self sufficient requires a concept of self I think is, is important here. Yeah. Maybe just maybe that. Yeah. And if you give that up, well then boy you're, you're giving up a lot. You, you give up so much. And um, the devices as, as heroin, as Tristan Harris has argued are addicting us. It's no accident. We're, you know, we, we should not view ourselves actually as weak. We, when we get addicted to the things we should wean ourselves, we should as much as possible to provide ourselves zones, periods of time when we have no access to those things. And so we are actually free and clear to let our minds do what they will because when, when we, uh, when they have access to our brands, they are designed to protect us.

Speaker 2:          09:50          So using, using the discipline that you're an expert in, is it possible that we're in a unique position right now because of technology that our brains are actually evolving now evolving or I guess devolving, depending on which way you look at it at an extraordinarily high pace or something like that. You know, the, the rate of change across almost every sector in the economy, in an human experience right now is higher than it's ever been. Could you say that about any moment in history maybe. Um, but the rate of change itself is changing as well, right? So that's the important distinction, right? Um, and what is going on with technology is completely untested. And so this is, this is a place where, you know, why, why am I so certain that I'm still on the left, even though most of the people who say they're on the left publicly, I don't have any interest in continuing to talk to them because they don't seem to be making any sense.

Speaker 2:          10:50          I look at systems that are involved, that are, that are in stable state because they've evolved over millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years. And my instinct is don't mess with that until you really, really understand what you're doing. And so for instance, I, unlike many scientists and not feeding my children GMOs, I give them and myself organic food and when we meet, which we do a lot of, I want that meat to have been fed the grass, if it's at the food of its ancestors, what or what exactly is the harm? We now know a little bit of this, but 20 years ago if you asked me what's the harm and feeding cows grands, so I have no idea. But I know that messing with a system that was working is more likely to interfere with something in that animal then not why, you know, why would you mess if you could not, and of course there are economic reasons to mess, but um, the, the don't mess with systems that are working until you really have a solid understanding of what the, what the effects are going to be.

Speaker 2:          11:53          The, the use of the precautionary principle pretty widely is what puts me pretty far on the left. But systems that we've created that are evolutionary, but people don't know that we need to regulate in order to get them under control because nuclear energy isn't gonna regulate itself. And habitat loss throughout most of the world is not going to regulate itself. So there are some problems that we've created and that are bigger than individuals can do anything about. And you know, that's why I'm not a libertarian. Right. And this is, this is where I think we have a, I get it. Like I don't know that if you just leave everybody to do whatever the hell they want all the time, that everybody isn't going to be doing all sorts of awful things. I think generally the market does fix some of that. But I get what you're saying.

Speaker 2:          12:35          Like these systems are I suppose often precarious in nature too, right. To the point where anything could be tilted one way or the other and then we've got bigger problems. Right? So how do we, how do we fix some of this stuff? How do we, how do we actually scale this back? I mean, I get it, you know, most of my audits we'll get, okay, well we have to keep talking about it. Sure. We have to wake more people up. Sure. But what can you do using the knowledge you have and the, and the study you've done? I have less, I have less insight right now at least to answer in this amount of time, uh, for the adult systems. Um, but I think I have a fair amount of clarity on what we should do, should be doing with children and with parenting. We're really, really not doing a, which is when you say the adult systems, you mean like economic systems and, and, and more specifically, how do you get adults who are already, who they are to behave differently?

Speaker 2:          13:30          Um, it's, it's less clear to me what, what we can do and so we'll show them for the purpose of yes. Yes. Also, also, it's true that I have, um, that I'm not going to wade into a, for instance, what we should do about our economic system here. Now with you. I might do it later, but yeah, it's like, okay. Um, but with regard to, for instance, you know, most, most people I think, I've never thought about what childhood is. And if you don't have children yourself and you're an adult, okay, maybe you don't have to, maybe it doesn't matter. Like maybe it just doesn't matter to you. But if you're a parent, you need to think about why it is that we have literally the longest childhood relative to lifespan of any organism on the planet. This is a feature. This is a way for us to learn how to become humans.

Speaker 2:          14:19          We are not, and this, this is a point that Brett has made very often. We're not playing slates, but we are the blankets, slates of any organisms on the planet. We, we are more software than hardware. And so what we're doing for these first, I don't know, 11 to 25 years of our lives right now into the forties. I think it depends, but depending on culture, you know, when do you start calling yourself an adult? And then, um, what we're doing is learning how to be human and we're learning how to be human by direct X. We're supposed to be learning how to be human through instruction, direct instruction by our parents, through observing our parents, through observing our siblings, through interacting with, including fighting with our siblings and having them smack us down both sometimes, literally, but definitely metaphorically when we do stupid things.

Speaker 2:          15:07          And, um, better yet if our parents have lots of adult friends around and they have lots of kids and there's a whole mess of humanity that we are learning from. And then we're also in that very long developmental period supposed to be learning from direct physical experience of the world. So the example I like to go to here is um, you know, the, the roadrunner cartoons when Wiley Coyote scoots is way off a cliff and he doesn't fall until he realizes there's nothing below him. It's funny, right? Like it's really funny. But of course it's funny because we know the gravity doesn't really work that way. Right? Increasingly I suspect that a lot of kids and now into the, and some of the younger millennials kind of aren't sure, like they were protected so much by their helicopter parents and they were behind screens rather than having real experience.

Speaker 2:          16:02          And to the extent that they played sport, it was totally regulated and overseen by adults and they didn't have any free time to go and get themselves into trouble and maybe even like burn something down or hurt themselves or break an arm or whatever it is and learn from it that they arrive at the cusp of what should have been adulthood. Totally unclear on what that supposed to mean. Does this absolutely to you because as I'm hearing you say that this is the bell going off in my head, man, I've been on a tour where Peter soon for the last six weeks, everything that you just said there is basically what he is saying. He is trying to, I sent that what he's trying to do at the most personal level. Yeah. He talks about society as a whole, but at the most personal level he's trying to retool young people.

Speaker 2:          16:48          It's not even retool. He's trying to give them the tools in the first place that they clearly should have gotten before. So that's what's so fascinating to me because it's like how did this happen? Right? How did, how did this happen? And, you know, we can point to, we can point to pharmaceuticals being given to kids to make boys less boy alike and to some degree to make girls last girl like, you know, give great, let's give speed to boys. So they'll serve and face forward and learn what. So they'll calm down, calm down and not do rough and tumble play. And I mean that's insane. And at the same time let's give antianxiety meds to girls and Ssri wise and um, and you know, just, just the model of schooling is ridiculous. You know, we have, we have schools that have gotten rid of recess because recess is dangerous and everyone who's ever been in school, even if like me, you happen to have been a good fit for the model of schools that you were in, which I think is pretty rare, actually knows that you also need to have time to get out there and play and move your body and experience it and not have it being overseen by some adult who's decided in advance.

Speaker 2:          17:56          What isn't, is not safe for you to experience. So know one of the things I used to say to my students in advance, you know, I did a lot of team building and like actual team building and planning with them in advance of these lung study abroad trips. We would have spent weeks together on campus in advance of going on these trips. Um, but what I wanted to do before we left was established with them. What's your relationship with risk? How do you, how do you view yourself, your relationship with risk? And we would do this in round like, and I would answer the question too and you know, I would say to them, actually I happen to love risk. I will, I am the leader on this trip but I will keep all of you safe. But then I'm going to go do things and you know, I am going to walk alone in the forest a lot and do things because it happens to be one of the ways that I find my consciousness that I, that I find my truest self.

Speaker 2:          18:45          And I don't expect any of you to do that also, but you need to be comfortable with the fact that your leader is going to be doing that sort of thing. And one of the other things that we were talking about was, you know, what's your relationship with comfort? Or you're going to be uncomfortable. You're gonna have to, you know, just because you can say in advance, you're okay with the bugs and the mud and the not having a phone doesn't mean you actually will be when you're faced with it. Uh, but maybe most important is we are going to leave ourselves open to serendipity. I cannot tell you everything that we're going to do or learn on this trip. If I could, what would be the point of going, we're going to go and some interesting things are gonna happen. I've, I've had a couple of near death experiences on these trips.

Speaker 2:          19:26          I didn't want them. I didn't, you know, I, I, and you know, I, I was always been a learning experience where there's a learning experience and frankly on the, on, on the most recent one on a, on a boat in the Galapagos with eight students in which the only thing that didn't survive was the boat. But it was, it was really touch and go. I mean, I really did almost die. Those eight students and I are friends for life. Right. You know, there's, there's some of them that I'm not an active contact with, but I know where they are and that, you know, that bonds you and no, I'm not going to pitch a trip with Andy might die. That's not what the goal is. But the idea that it could happen and you should have the tools on board, the physical tools, the psychological tools, the emotional tools, intellectual tools to figure out in real time as your boat is being flipped by a 15 foot wave and now you're trapped under it.

Speaker 2:          20:20          What do you do? Was that a uniquely Evergreen type of teaching? Was that something that you and Brett really, that was a unique name there me kind of teaching. And then this last trip, Brett was there with me as well. There was, there was a way in which I think what, you know what I said about childhood, which I, you know, my interest originally and evolution was about the evolution of parental care and territoriality and social systems and sexual selection. And long before I ever had kids, my cell phone before I wanted kids, but I thought no one spread. And I did have kids and I'm watching these amazing creatures began to grow up. Okay, let's think then about what, what is the best way to do this? And we could put them a little boxes and make absolutely sure that they survive till the age of 18 and then we opened up the boxes and we let them out and they have basically no chance at being adults or even of knowing how to be adults or we could expose them to ever greater risk.

Speaker 2:          21:23          Having first made absolutely sure that they know that they are loved and that we have their backs and that we will do anything to come in and get them and to protect them if we can, but that they are going to start going out into the world pretty early. You know, biking it too. And you know, we took them to the Amazon at seven and nine the first time and young something could've gone wrong and I don't know, I've known parents who lost kids and I don't know how you survive that, but you need to be willing to take risks such that when your kids do hit 18 or 20 or whatever, you know that they're actually already on their way to being adults. And that is going to require backing off and letting them do some of their learning on their own and knowing that that's going to result in some harm coming to them and it's going to be physical harm. It's going to be psychological harm, it's going to be intellectual harm. But frankly, the, the lack of any kind of harm that a lot of kids are experiencing is part of why they're now saying speech is violence. Yeah. Right. I mean that's, that's part of how we get there

Speaker 3:          22:25          is some of this an extension of the success of the West in a way. Because if you take the, this set of kids who however old they are, let's say we go from, although now there's a lot of studies that are showing that young, the generation younger than millennials is actually leaning more conservative. But let's say we take 16 to 30 roughly. Yeah. So generation y ish, but you see that most of their parents were baby boomers who were the most successful, at least financially generation ever. Most of the baby boomers, parents all went to war and right. You know, live through depression and all sorts of stuff, but that because the baby boomer is basically where the biggest middleclass and because there was such upward mobility, they added so well, they kinda got their eye off the ball, started focusing on things that didn't matter as much, protecting kids from things that a kid would have used to have to have done. And that is sort of what led us here. So it's almost like an economic backing for what ended up happening psychologically.

Speaker 2:          23:22          Yeah. I think, I think that's apt. You know, there's so many things feeding into this and yes, the wealth of America Post World War II, uh, and the fact that those are most of the parents of the generation, that seems the most confused. I think definitely there's a causal link there. Yeah. And then you toss into the Internet and you toss on the Internet, right. Um, which, you know, we can't go back obviously. Uh, but, but we need to understand that it's an evolutionary system and then it's going to run away from us and that we are all prone to be addicted to dopamine hits. We're going to seek the quick, quick likes rather than, you know, even even. Okay. So take internet out of the picture for a moment. If you don't know what you do for physical activity, I bike you play basketball.

Speaker 2:          24:16          Okay. So maybe with basketball it's going to be different. Uh, for me, I like video games too. Is that better? No, that's probably, probably probably the opposite. But, so I used to play a lot of ultimate frisbee and you could like anytime there was a pickup game, like I would, I, I'm, I'm there. I was playing five, six times a week for awhile. Um, and then I ruptured my Achilles tendon playing on an Oregon beach with students a few years ago. I'm not doing that anymore. Um, but biking, which I love and I find meditative, I have a very hard time convincing myself to get on my bike even though while I'm doing it, I love it. And after I do it, I feel better and I'm more productive and a more creative and I just am, you know, more in love with life, but it's a pain in the ass and it's a little bit physically uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:          25:04          And you know, all of these things are true. We, we prioritize the pleasure of now over even something that for me, I know not, it's not even that I'm going to feel better after I did it. I actually love the activity itself, but getting over that sort of activation energy to do the thing. And I suspect that sport, like actual team sports is a little bit different, a little different. Like you're ready to go. You ready to go? Like, oh, people are there, I'm ready. I'll like, let's, let's do it. Going to the gym, I would like into that. Like I know that when I work out, I like doing it and I feel great after, but it's like, oh, I gotta get in my car, I got to drive over there and I got a bark, or blah, blah, blah. It feels like a chore, but yet, you know, it's good.

Speaker 2:          25:43          And yet, so we're always fighting our nature sort of. We are. No, exactly. We're always fighting or nature and it shouldn't surprise us that we're going to need to fight our nature with regard to responding to the Internet and responding to, especially especially the little computers we carry around in our pockets and you know, learning to restrict our access to those training ourselves to restrict our access to those. And I think anyone with the ability to train themselves to meditate or to do anything on a regular basis should, should be able to train themselves that same way with regard to devices. Yeah. All right, well we've done about an hour here and I am going to demand that you come back because I know, I know we can do way more of this unfortunately just because my schedule is so nuts at the moment. We, we have to kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          26:28          But can you give me one more thing that you're just really excited about right now that you've been thinking about or working on or anything else that's really just giving you a little bit, uh, a little bit of juice at the moment while you're in this interesting space for yourself? No. Um, there are a number of things I guess. Um, there's a, there's a piece I wrote a number of years ago that is supposed to be out in the literary magazine just about now, ash about haven't been mugged at knife point and Quito, one of these on one of these study abroad trips. Um, which prompt and I was with three students, Quito, the capital of Ecuador. Okay. So it was, it was the very, it was before the first day of one of my six weeks study abroad trips. I was a 20 students just made, Brett wasn't there on this one.

Speaker 2:          27:10          Um, and the experience in which, you know, we've been, we've been to get the three students that I have been together all day. We come to the top of the stairs and suddenly two guys with, with knives run around the corner and pin me and my female student up against a wall and do this sort of knife dance in front of us and then relieve. I didn't have anything on me because I know how to walk around Latin American cities and one of my students didn't. But two of my students had all of their stuff taken off them, including this really nice DSLR that that Michelle my student had. And they run off. And the next thing I realize I am on one of these guys in the middle of the street pulling on the backpack. He's stolen from another one of my students. Another one of my students has chased down the other guy.

Speaker 2:          27:59          Wow. And thought, how did that happen and why is everything now so loud and so colorful? And I thought back immediately thought, wow, the entire experience that I just had was somehow in black and white and was without sound. And so, I mean it's an interesting long story that, that I basically explored in this essay by going into doing, doing a dive into the literature on the nature of memory, on the nature of sensory memory in particular and what it is that we can and cannot perceive in the moment, what our brands take in, why time seems to slow down. So just to go back to our earlier conversation about time, why tea time seems to slow down in periods of intensity. It's not that it time slows down, but basically our frame rate increases and not only our frame rate increases but the amount that we remember and you know, move into short term memory.

So this is, this is one of the things that I've been thinking about lately is sort of how, how memory and the senses and in fact how all of us are a little bit of synesthesia. It's are experiencing our world in ways that, that we don't usually have language for. Now that it was the purpose of the story. But how did this all end? It ended. We got, we got the stuff back. Wow. We got the stuff back and as soon as the student, Jeremy and I give [inaudible] Tracy these guys and got the stuff back, then the police showed up. Then the pleaser got blurred up from the island and the whole watching I, it was, it was remarkable actually. It was totally, there was no one on this walk. We'd send no one. These two guys run up to us, Mug us, run off, we give chase, and then the entire neighborhood comes alive. Suddenly there were hundreds of

Speaker 3:          29:42          people there like, where were you guys there? There's some sort of study to be done on that. Well, I'm sure they've done studies on that. You know, when people see the bad thing happening, but nobody calls the police and all that kinda stuff. Well, listen, it's been an absolute pleasure. I'm so glad that we finally got to do this in person and we will do it again. And you guys can follow Heather on the Twitter. She does tweet a decent amount, but not a unhealthy addicted amount.
