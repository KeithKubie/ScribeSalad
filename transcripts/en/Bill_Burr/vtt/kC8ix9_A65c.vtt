1
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.743
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.970
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:08.150
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
And Ah,

4
00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:12.310
I'm just checking on you.
I'm just checking out on you.

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.840
See now your weeks ago,
and I know if you live in Boston your weeks ago,

6
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:21.080
pretty good.
If you're living in Houston.
I echo so good.
Is it

7
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.940
fucking unbelievable how many times?

8
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.230
How many fucking times to fucking players on opposing teams just going to

9
00:00:31.421 --> 00:00:34.660
fucking rile up the other team with some dumb horseshit?

10
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.830
Didn't you learn anything with Aaron judge and a very unfair and judge moment

11
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.470
playing fucking New York,
New York up in Boston

12
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.040
because they want,
they tied the fucking series.

13
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.200
What are you doing?
And then this other jackass on Houston

14
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.940
looking at some game film.

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.520
That's where they went back to back to back on fucking whatever.
Valdi whatevers.

16
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.800
I don't know what anybody's fucking name is.
Why the fuck would you do that?

17
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.690
I'm glad you keep doing it.
Stupid fucking moves.

18
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.580
You're the defending world series champions.

19
00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:16.370
You don't need to be going around trying to fucking troll people.

20
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.360
You carry yourself with the quiet confidence of a champion.

21
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.640
That's what you supposed to do.
You don't fucking rile him up

22
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.560
so they can be in the other locker and gone into itself.

23
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.870
But those guys across the hall
then no respect you.

24
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.710
I mean,
oh,
it did.
Oh look what he said on fucking,
I'm fucking facetime.

25
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.390
Whatever the fuck these kids are doing.

26
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.660
And I know there's a lot of people down in Houston going like,
you know,

27
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.240
I don't know about that.
All to vague thing.
I think that was a fucking home run.

28
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:55.150
You know what?
I agree with you.
God knows they didn't have any angle.

29
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.660
We could definitively say it one way or another.

30
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.860
Look like he reached back into the stance.

31
00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:06.010
I know Kate Upton thought that that's the way it went down and that's good

32
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:06.844
enough for me.

33
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.820
Um,
Kate Upton said Sofa players in the stands,

34
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.510
fans are supposed to move over.
Those are the rules.

35
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.680
Mlb shouldn't let fans sit there.
They didn't reach over the fence.

36
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.150
<v 0>Okay.</v>

37
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.983
<v 1>You know,</v>

38
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.610
who would've thought Kate Upton was that into the fucking game is great.

39
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.940
Um,
anyways,
I thought,
oh,
I thought it was a,
I mean,

40
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.900
every angle that I saw,
which was not nothing definitive,

41
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.350
I could see why they didn't overturn it.
I was surprised we got that call.

42
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.380
But that's not why the Astros lost the game.
I hate when people do that.

43
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.790
Well he missed a field goal in the first quarter and a,
they lost by two.

44
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.670
So I mean if he hits that,
that they,
uh,
they were the fuck no,

45
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.350
the [inaudible] fucking hits.
It changes the whole game.

46
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.610
Did you watch back to the future?
He can't go.
He can't go back changing things.

47
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.040
It changes the future.

48
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.970
The reason why you fucking lost is because you let up eight runs.

49
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.300
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

50
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.500
<v 1>Why did you let a bait runs?</v>

51
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.670
Cause you're on fucking social media fucking amping up the red sox.

52
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.370
They've got a little more spring in their steps going.
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.670
Did they not respect the fact that we want 108 fucking games

54
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.080
then Jackie Bradley Jr has got to go up there and get the old right there.
Fred,

55
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.240
what does,
um,
anyways,

56
00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:30.780
I still,
you know,
I still think this thing is far from over.

57
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.590
All right.
You're probably thinking,
Hey,
bill,
while you're up three games to one,

58
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.341
why would you say that?

59
00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:38.370
Because I remember 2004 when there was a fucking $200 million team up,

60
00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:41.510
three games to none and they did win.
So it's still,

61
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.220
we till we put the final nail in the fucking coffin,
you know?

62
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.950
Uh,
that's it.
And by the way,

63
00:03:48.951 --> 00:03:52.310
who was the fucking country and how the fuck did you figure out how the fuck did

64
00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:56.510
they figure out the name of the guy?
Some random fucking guy,

65
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.150
not one credit on IMD B.

66
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.060
How do they find out what his fucking name was?

67
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.640
And then why would you go ahead and publish it after?

68
00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:10.730
What happened to that poor bastard?
Uh,
what's his name?
Oh,
Mikey.

69
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:13.310
Michael said up there in the Chicago cubs.

70
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.120
That guy when fucking him in for the people I reached up for the ball.

71
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.000
He just so happened he hit him.
Whatever the hell his name is.

72
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.470
I'm glad I forgot what his fucking name is.

73
00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:24.080
I hope that guy has been able to move on with his life.

74
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.750
The guy to hire fucking hide under the old Comiskey stadium for the last
fucking,

75
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.393
I dunno,

76
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.460
15 years now that the cubs won it will you finally stopped taking your childhood

77
00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:37.754
out on this guy.

78
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.040
That fucking guy in the front row did what everybody else would do.

79
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.000
Do you realize the balls it takes to fucking stick your hand out there?

80
00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:52.970
You ever see?
You ever buy cattle foul ball?
Some.
It's a fucking baseball.

81
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.720
Would you go play baseball with your friend?

82
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.850
The guy who's just building an APP with no,
with no glove.
Would you do that?

83
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.020
Leave the guy the fuck alone.
That's like some shit that morning.

84
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.280
Fucking radio guys trying to be edgy.
They're the kind of people they fucking

85
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.970
put the person's name out.
There's poor bastard.
He goes,
okay.

86
00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:17.510
You know I got to get security the Astros lose this game.

87
00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:19.670
I'm going to need security escort me out of here.

88
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.180
The Astros don't come back and win.
This match is fucking,
that's pathetic.

89
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.180
You know what about the other pitchers given up all those runs?
Huh?

90
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.200
Do they have security escort them out of the building?
Well I guess they do.

91
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.413
How

92
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.940
about that cash for Ben attending and the game unfucking believable.

93
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.490
So having said that,
uh,

94
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.730
the Houston Astros still scare the shit out of me cause they are the defending

95
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:49.510
world series champions.
They've got a couple of fucking uh,
you know,

96
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.680
tough games here.

97
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.820
But I figured Verlin has got to be coming back any moment to put it on his white

98
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.950
hat and come back in and save the day,
try to make it three,

99
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.300
two then all of a sudden they're like,
why,
you know,
all we got to do is one,

100
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.940
one more now it's fucking tied up and ads anybody series.

101
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.820
That's how quickly you can fucking turn around.

102
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.410
It's no different than getting married.
You know,
you're a single man,

103
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.500
you've got the world by the balls and any second you could just fall in love

104
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:19.550
with a woman and all that freedom you had all that time,

105
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.070
all those great feelings you felt about yourself,

106
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.360
all those dumb sports shorts,
shorts,

107
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.760
sports shirts that you had that you thought were cool.

108
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.530
All of a sudden they just disappear.
You just like,
you're in seventh grade.

109
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.930
I liked seventh grade,
honey,

110
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:39.740
just try on this button down and it all fucking goes away.

111
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.460
Don't ever forget that.
You know,
it's like a fucking squirrel,
right?

112
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.550
Goes off and gets a couple of nuts.
It's fucking lolly gag.
And across the road,

113
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.610
all of a sudden a hammer comes along,
right?
Just fucking flats the thing.

114
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.070
I haven't,
no,
I'm talking about right now.
I just can't,

115
00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:02.440
I'm just stunned that were up three games to one.
Um,

116
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.590
hopefully Joel Olsteen we'll fucking open the doors to his church and let some

117
00:07:07.591 --> 00:07:10.980
people in there,
you know,
let that guy fucking hide in there.

118
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.750
<v 3>Joel opened the fucking door on eight security.
Is it raining up?</v>

119
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.940
Jesus doesn't want you to come in if it's raining out.

120
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.650
<v 1>Um,
all right,
enough of that shit.
We still got one more to go.</v>

121
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.670
Uh,
having said that,
I,
I still love the fucking Astros and I love their fans.

122
00:07:29.671 --> 00:07:33.120
It's like I haven't seen them this fucking amped up.
You know,

123
00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:36.600
since those great late seventies teams with Jay are Richards and all that.

124
00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:41.601
And I love when I see the old school gay pride parade will flag that they used

125
00:07:41.641 --> 00:07:43.350
to have.
Um,

126
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.140
it was actually more like the gay pride,
like ginger flag.
Like if you were,

127
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.290
if you like gay people,
but only redheaded once that was like,

128
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.120
you had a flag for it,
that's what their Jersey looked like.
Um,
all right,

129
00:07:57.121 --> 00:08:01.080
here's one for you.
I've been in New York City,
I'm in,
I'm in Baltimore now.

130
00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:05.580
Baltimore,
Scarface,
reference anybody.
Um,

131
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.200
I got two shows tonight at the lyric theater and then I fucking got Atlantic

132
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.930
city.
I got two more.
And then I see my daughter for the first time in a week.

133
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.670
This has been fucking brutal,
but I had to do it cause I gotta fucking try.
And,

134
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.680
uh,
you know,
I got a hype these Goddamn gigs.
So,
um,

135
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.630
anyway,
I'm doing the whole fucking run yesterday,

136
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.010
six feet,
six 15 in the morning until seven at night.

137
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:36.780
Just run in my fucking Yap about Madison Square Garden and dude,

138
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:40.230
every fucking,
every,
almost every fucking interview.

139
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.680
Almost every fucking interview is just like,
so what do you mean,
do you think

140
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.830
<v 3>about,
uh,
Louis C K coming back?
You know,</v>

141
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.730
it's still predominantly white.

142
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.960
Which would you say that it's a predominantly white male?
Patriarchal.
Wha what?

143
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.540
<v 1>What do you feel Jen?
Abortion.
Essentially,</v>

144
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.510
what am I fucking running for office here?

145
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.770
You know all these fucking comedians that want to talk about that shit just

146
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:11.520
cause they're talking about all of that Shit and getting all political and

147
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.450
fucking
dive in into this,

148
00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:17.870
dividing the country down the fucking middle.
I just sitting there like,

149
00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:20.710
why do I have to,
why do I have to comment on this?
So I'll let,

150
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.590
I'll let you guys on a little fucking inside 10 think of,
sorry,

151
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.530
I don't have my microphone.
So sorry about the fucking breathing on them.

152
00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:31.640
Like they're,
um,
I'll let you in on a little fucking secret.

153
00:09:31.641 --> 00:09:34.430
This is how I handle those questions.
They'll go like,

154
00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:38.150
so what do you think about Louis CK coming back?
I just go,
I dunno.

155
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.230
What do you think about it?

156
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.983
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

157
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.380
<v 1>It fucking works every time.</v>

158
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:48.260
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

159
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.160
<v 1>Either they either,
they go,
well,
no,
I'm asking you.
I'm like,
well,
I go,</v>

160
00:09:52.161 --> 00:09:54.470
I wasn't thinking about you.
You're obviously thinking about it.

161
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.990
You obviously have an opinion.
I would love to hear your opinion.

162
00:09:56.991 --> 00:10:01.640
That fascinates me.
What do you think about it?
Or You just go,
I don't know.

163
00:10:01.641 --> 00:10:03.730
What do you think about it in the book?
You know,
I take a jet tickets,

164
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.960
fine Merr already tickets bullshit or whatever,

165
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.950
and then I just sit there and I look over and I fucking look at my butt.

166
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.270
You know,
the guy taken me around the radio and it just smiling

167
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:16.840
the fuck.
Do I take what I take?

168
00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:20.110
I want to be still be able to make my mortgage this month,
if you don't mind.

169
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.033
<v 4>Okay.</v>

170
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.860
<v 1>Fucking unbelievable.</v>

171
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.550
I don't understand how this is a more progressive era where,

172
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.870
and things are getting better.
That if,
if you haven't done anything,

173
00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:37.390
even if you comment in the wrong fucking way,

174
00:10:37.391 --> 00:10:42.280
all of a sudden you're in trouble and they take your fucking show away.
I just,

175
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.670
I like it's,
it's fucking ridiculous.

176
00:10:45.671 --> 00:10:49.370
And I know that I am in the massive majority when I say that,
right?

177
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.510
Jesus fucking Christ.

178
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.120
We might have people that I saw on this fucking trip,

179
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.750
that old friends I haven't seen yet.
You know,
women,
are you going to hug him?

180
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.960
You're like,
oh,
well this,
you know the fire I want to,

181
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.220
I'm going to come up with a fucking me to stick the thing where you go in for

182
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:10.590
the hug and then if you feel fucking weird,
it just fucking,

183
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.830
it's like a nerf sticker up that it just shoots out between the two of you.

184
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.030
I'm bringing it back,
the fist bump.
But you know,

185
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.740
<v 5>current comedy climate,
what do you,</v>

186
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.300
is it hard is it can be

187
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.230
[inaudible] current claim.

188
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.540
<v 1>All right,
if I hear that one more fucking time.</v>

189
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.900
It's like what fucking shows go to a comedy show.

190
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.830
People are just showing up in the laughing.
They're adults.

191
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:44.040
They know you're there at a show.
Yeah,
I know these fucking assholes.

192
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.140
What kind of a fucking adult goes to a comedy show and then goes,
you know,

193
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.190
I was triggered by that show.
You were triggered.
Well,
toughen the fuck up.

194
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.640
Stay home.
All right,
go,
go watch a willy Wonka and the in the,

195
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.620
in the fucking chocolate factory.
Go Watch that shit.

196
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.640
Go Watch.
Go.
Go fucking home and go watch a muppet movie.

197
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.920
Okay.
You went outside,
you went in public,

198
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.070
you said fucking down in a comedy club.

199
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.280
It's the job of the comedian to say crazy outrageous shit and make you laugh.

200
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.760
You know,
go get,
go with the fucking ice capades that's in a country.

201
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.050
Most of those,
you know,
usually when they have the star,

202
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:33.600
the star of the thing is usually a fucking Olympic gold medal winner.

203
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.950
Way Back in the day.
The fuck was her name.
Donna Karen.

204
00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.840
Who was that chicken one in [inaudible] 76 I remember she called in sick that

205
00:12:42.841 --> 00:12:45.270
day.
We went to go see Dorothy Hamill.

206
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.630
There's a great old name on Dorothy.
Dottie.

207
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.370
Dottie.
What do you mean you're not fucking skate?

208
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.060
And at the fucking Boston Garden,

209
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.090
we got into a bunch of mascots out there looking for a pretty chicken.

210
00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:02.490
You ain't out there toiling around
the ice.

211
00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:06.480
Capades trigger me because my last relationship,

212
00:13:06.481 --> 00:13:08.520
my boyfriend was ice cold to me.

213
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.490
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

214
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.700
<v 1>Is there any way you could melt the ice and give me my money back?</v>

215
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.930
Um,
anyway,
so I'm doing all this fucking doing all of this press.

216
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.550
I wasn't all like that,
but there was a,

217
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:27.020
there was a lot of fucking talking about the current climate.

218
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:28.190
Um,

219
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.670
I'll be honest if you come into my show is I've been going harder than ever and

220
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.980
I've been trashed feminist because it's fun.

221
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.083
<v 4>MMM.</v>

222
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.180
<v 1>And I agree with,
you know,
a lot of this,
you know,</v>

223
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.580
you want to make shitty equal like yet it,
it's fine.

224
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.720
Does that mean I have to lose my job because I have a fucking opinion about

225
00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:50.554
something?

226
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.223
<v 4>Huh?</v>

227
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.590
<v 1>All right.
They have bushy
anyways,</v>

228
00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.330
so going around right.
And all of these fucking goddamn buildings,

229
00:14:02.331 --> 00:14:03.740
you go into the,
you know,

230
00:14:03.741 --> 00:14:08.510
they want like you're fucking driver's license and shit like you going into the

231
00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.250
Goddamn Pentagon.
So I just show it to them.

232
00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.010
And now that they let they like take the thing from you and they stick it in

233
00:14:13.011 --> 00:14:16.730
this little ass fucking computer things,
scan it or all I was dumb shit.

234
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.190
And you know,
they're taking all your information off of it.

235
00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:22.490
So I have an expired license,
right?

236
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.200
I have one that's not expired,

237
00:14:24.201 --> 00:14:28.040
but I kept my expired one and that's the one I give it.
I give to them.
Right?

238
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.880
It's fucking from way back in the day when I still had fucking heroin at a

239
00:14:31.881 --> 00:14:34.220
different address.
Right?

240
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.400
So I fucking go to this building and I hand it to the guy and he goes,

241
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.190
your ids expired.
I go,
yeah,
but my face is it,
you know,
I,

242
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.910
I didn't come here to drive the building.
You know,
it's a fucking id.
You need an,

243
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.760
there's an I date and I'm telling you these guys,
pretty soon it's gonna be,

244
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:59.800
you need a valid id to go.
It's like you have to know where the fuck I live.

245
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:06.050
That goes back to this fucking guy
who just like,
who caught that,

246
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.720
you know that home run.
And now he's sitting there going,

247
00:15:09.721 --> 00:15:11.140
I'm going to meet this poor past has got it.

248
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.780
Thinking about his own personal safety,

249
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.620
like I don't understand how these corporations and all these people are able to

250
00:15:16.621 --> 00:15:17.850
snag your personal information.

251
00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:21.480
People have stalkers but get all the women out there who literally have to have

252
00:15:21.481 --> 00:15:22.140
like,

253
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.310
like restraining orders from these Luna Tech guys and these fucking corporations

254
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.200
that you're going to buy fucking chap stick.
You know,
they,

255
00:15:31.201 --> 00:15:35.340
they double swipe you love whatever the fuck they do with you.
God Damn license.

256
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.340
They take your fucking information and they just put it out there

257
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.900
and you know what's going to happen is somebody's going to get fucking killed

258
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:47.140
because of it.
And then these corporations,
they're not going to be responsible.

259
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:54.600
I,
I dunno,
I dunno.
I'm just basically,
I'm just fucking,

260
00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.420
I'm shouting into a tornado here.
Nobody gives a fuck.

261
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.990
And if you dumb fucks are going to go onto that ancestry.com and then we're all,

262
00:16:01.991 --> 00:16:06.240
all of our fucking DNA is going to be mapped.
You know what I mean?

263
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.610
Like in what,
what good is going to come with that?

264
00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:14.510
They'll catch a couple of Syrah killers.
Okay.
What else are they going to do?

265
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.090
I'm telling you I'm doing that whole bet.

266
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:21.680
They're going to fucking build your robot replacement.
Oh,
who knows what?

267
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:25.410
I don't know.
I just don't understand what people have against privacy now.

268
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.590
You know it's fucking,
you see the look of concern or this guy's,

269
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.970
this guy's put full fucking poor bashed his face.

270
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.510
This poor guy in Houston,
he's probably thinking,

271
00:16:37.511 --> 00:16:41.530
how the fuck am I going to get to my goddamn horse and ride out of fucking town

272
00:16:41.531 --> 00:16:46.531
without these mother fuckers getting a posse together coming after me?

273
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.343
<v 4>MMM.</v>

274
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.100
<v 1>Anyways,
I don't know when the next game is,
but uh,
people can we,</v>

275
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:57.410
can we try to stop yelling at each other?
You know,

276
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.950
can we fucking stop trying to peer into everybody's fucking living room?

277
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.620
These fucking lunatics like the fucking Alexis Shit.

278
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.990
What kind of a fucking moron gets that?

279
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.840
You have literally bugging your own house house.
Sorry,

280
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.900
was yelling at the TV last night.
I'm watching the game.

281
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.910
You literally bug in your own house.

282
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.420
You're sending your DNA into the fucking Internet.

283
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.280
Oh at,
or what else are you gonna do?

284
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.620
You're gonna fucking handcuff your risk to your ankles.

285
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.670
Start walking backwards down the street and see what happens to me.

286
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:34.720
What are you doing?

287
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.740
It's,
it's just so you can have some fucking thing

288
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.890
and you and you and you goddamn house.
So you could be like a,
you know,

289
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.640
captain and Tennille.
What was the captain's Alexis?

290
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.590
What was the captain's real name?

291
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

292
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.360
<v 1>Through the fucking shit that I say when I'm in my house to try and make my wife</v>

293
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:06.030
laugh.
I made,
I don't want anybody here on that.

294
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.970
I mean,
that's,
that's our own private fucking jokes.

295
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.420
Then forget about what I get to a God damn argument.
The shit that I say.

296
00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.440
Well it's the,
why the fuck would you do somebody's recording that?

297
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.180
Who's listening to it

298
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.340
at this gotta be somebody on the other side that Alexis Alexa,

299
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.210
whatever the fuck it is,

300
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.890
is literally listening to your life like a reality show.

301
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.490
You know,
maybe it was like an FBI guy or a fucker.

302
00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:40.330
One of those international fucking Gumshoe guys and they're listening.

303
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:44.860
Maybe set a couple of fucking a,
you know,

304
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.130
you were trying to talk about form of President Obama and you said Osama
instead,

305
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.330
and that was a trigger thing.

306
00:18:50.331 --> 00:18:53.150
So now they got to listen in on your life to make sure you're not fucking,

307
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.220
you know,
a terrorist or some shit.
Right.
And then they just,
I dunno,

308
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.850
they just listening.
They don't hear any terrorist shit,

309
00:19:01.851 --> 00:19:03.500
but they just kind of get into your life.

310
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.560
Oh,
he's,
yeah,
they were expecting a child.
This is,
oh,
this is so exciting.

311
00:19:10.561 --> 00:19:14.250
I'm so sick of being in this van and they just fucking listens.

312
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.630
Uh,
you know,
do you like on like one of those flat screen TVs?
You know,

313
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.390
they got the cameras on and like they got,
they ask them,

314
00:19:25.391 --> 00:19:29.920
do you watch people in their houses watching TV?

315
00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.100
And I don't know why they didn't just say no.
They would like,
uh,
you know,

316
00:19:33.101 --> 00:19:36.190
we're not going to comment on that or something.
Let me,

317
00:19:36.191 --> 00:19:41.050
let me fucking look that shit up.
Here we go.
What is it right here?

318
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.180
Um,
smart TVs.

319
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.670
Watch you watching you.
All right,
here we go.
This side,

320
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.550
it'd be great for my fucking paranoia.
Para know yourself.
Destroy.

321
00:19:55.551 --> 00:20:00.190
Yeah.
Your smart TV is watching you watching TV.

322
00:20:00.191 --> 00:20:03.670
Consumer report fines.
Now,
why isn't this

323
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.380
a concern to anybody?
You know

324
00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.160
you're smart.
TV is watching you watch TV,
consumer report fines.
All right?

325
00:20:16.161 --> 00:20:21.020
Millions of smart TVs sitting and families living them are vulnerable to hackers

326
00:20:21.021 --> 00:20:22.780
taking control.
Oh,

327
00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.750
this is saying hackers and could be tracking the households personal viewing

328
00:20:26.751 --> 00:20:31.220
habits much more closely than their owners realize according to a new consumer

329
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:36.380
reports investigation.
Um,
all right,

330
00:20:36.381 --> 00:20:37.970
so this is talking about hackers then that's,

331
00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:41.660
I'm talking about the actual fucking companies.
All right?
So if hackers

332
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.070
like one,
this is like fucking,
I mean that's like a,
that's has be a crime,
right?

333
00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.740
I Dunno.
These fucking voyeurs these days is so god Damn Lazy.
Back in the day,

334
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.780
if someone wanted to look at you,
they had to walk up to your window,
right?

335
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.660
And you saw him coming up your yard,
but they're fucking dick out.

336
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:07.520
And you had a time to grab like a steak knife for something or maybe a shotgun.

337
00:21:07.521 --> 00:21:09.860
You came out,
you brandished a weapon and the guide,
you know,

338
00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.200
ran away may not too fast,

339
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.390
cause you can only run so fast with the fucking erection.

340
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:16.580
And that's usually how people got caught.

341
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.903
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

342
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.990
<v 1>Um,
but now they can just stay,
just stay at home.
Eight o'clock,</v>

343
00:21:24.991 --> 00:21:29.991
they start knowing you fucking habits a is just a couple of banks every Friday

344
00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:35.190
night around nine o'clock,
when they,
you know,
kids all go out.
The kids are older.

345
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.070
Sit down.
Wow.
Look at that and doggy style this week.
Oh,

346
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:39.940
they added something else.

347
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.530
The ripple to have this little fucking TV show much.
I don't know.

348
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.550
The whole thing fucking freaks me out.
Um,

349
00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.040
what,
what is people's fascination with that shit?
Why do you want to listen?

350
00:21:55.041 --> 00:21:57.200
Why do you want to look at people?
What the fuck do you care?

351
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.810
Maybe because I'm antisocial,
I don't get it.
Like,
you know what I mean?

352
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.840
My wife's social,

353
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.350
she says hi to the neighbors and that shit,
I'm,
if I'm like,
I'm just like,

354
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.360
Hey Aria,
I go inside.

355
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.000
I don't care what you're doing.
I don't want to what?
Know what you're doing.

356
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.530
I don't want to watch your fuck.

357
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.430
I don't want to see what she eating and I don't want,

358
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.650
I don't want to see your arguments.

359
00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:33.140
I could barely talk to you in my fucking driveway.
The fuck would,
I won't get up.

360
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.440
I'm going to,
I'm going to fucking watch that.

361
00:22:37.441 --> 00:22:42.441
I'm going to learn how to hack into somebody's TV or I could put on a Martin

362
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.090
Scorsese movie instead.
Yeah man.

363
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.860
But Alexis is real man.
I Dunno.

364
00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.560
It's all fucking this whole podcast.
They'll hold worlds.

365
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.050
He's fucking weirded me out.
Now I'll tell you this.
Current climate,

366
00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:00.570
let me read this.
Felix Gray,
which sounds like a,
a high,

367
00:23:00.571 --> 00:23:05.390
like a Hollywood escort service,
doesn't it?
Felix Gray.
Can I help you?

368
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.220
Yeah,
I want a red head.
I want a Brunette.
All right,
Felix.
Sorry.
Felix Gray.
Uh,

369
00:23:10.221 --> 00:23:12.350
the average American blast,

370
00:23:12.351 --> 00:23:17.351
their eyes with bright screens for 11 hours every fucking day.

371
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.810
All these things are great.
I actually have a pair of these.
He's amazing.

372
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.140
Now you can protect your eyes and not wearing them cause I'm a moron.

373
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.040
Have them at home.

374
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.360
Now you can protect your eyes with a pair of Felix gray glasses available with

375
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:34.370
or without a prescription.
Felix gray glasses filter out 90% of high energy.

376
00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:38.630
I love that percentage.
I always go with that percentage.
90% of high energy,

377
00:23:38.631 --> 00:23:43.010
blue light and eliminate the glare coming off all those screens.

378
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.620
That means no more tired eye.

379
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:50.600
You can have your tab,
boom,
boom,

380
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:53.010
boom and you're blur.

381
00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:57.410
Revision is a thin this guys all right or headaches

382
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:04.070
[inaudible] usually it seems like a hassle to have to protect your eyes man and

383
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:06.530
that's why most of us don't do it,

384
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.790
but Felix gray glasses aren't like those weird computer glasses you've seen

385
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:15.620
before.
There's no yellow Lens Tint.
Donny shut the fuck up.

386
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.390
That's what I always think of when I think yellow.

387
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.150
I love of a finger here in an hour.

388
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.430
Felix gray glasses are handcrafted from premium Italian acetate,

389
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.160
Acetate,
Acetate,

390
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:31.850
In fact,

391
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.850
throwing on some Felix Graze is an easy way to look pretty put together.

392
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.000
Sorry Felix.

393
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:43.350

Um,

401
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:20.630
and there's a lot of them
staying in and on the corner.
Winslow,

402
00:25:20.631 --> 00:25:23.360
Arizona,
such a fine sight to see.

403
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:30.050
It's an l two vague fucking ball going into the fucking stands.

404
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.480
Hold on baby.

405
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.680
You're out.
Take a seat.
I can't believe how many calls Boston teams get now.

406
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.390
It's like they're making up for the entire last century roughing the passer.

407
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:47.060
Go Fuck yourself and your super bowl drapes.

408
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.410
Right?
Then all of a sudden it just turned around.

409
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.480
Everything just fucking has been going our way.
I don't know what happened

410
00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:02.270
from bill by Tom Brady.
Brady.
Wait a minute.
The tuck rule.

411
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.090
You're going to the Superbowl,

412
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.010
Alex Rodriguez slapping that ball out and Mincaye his hand.

413
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.120
We never got those calls.
Yeah,
you're out.
You can't fucking do that.

414
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.480
But he's wearing pin stripes.
That's over

415
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.070
fucking God damn Canadians.
Are they losing the game man.

416
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.390
Fucking too many men in the ice.
Gila floor right there.
Fred.

417
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.410
No Stanley Cup for you,
sir.
My whole fucking life.

418
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.370
It's unbelievable.
I'm just going to enjoy the shit out of it.
The same way.

419
00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:39.590
Any other fan?
What if everything was going his way?

420
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.900
That's another thing they always asked me on these sports shows,
don't you?
I,

421
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.590
you're excited.
I mean,
with all these titles,
as it says,
it's still exciting.

422
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:52.940
I mean,
I,
I w I would be bored.
Well,
I'm not,
I'm enjoying the shit out of it,

423
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.660
but thank you for your concern.
Thank you for asking.

424
00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:01.370
I know it's coming from a place of jealousy.
Okay.

425
00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:06.110
I know when things are said,
when they're not coming from a place of love,

426
00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.790
the way Kate Upton was,

Why was that good looking?

441
00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:13.540
If I was like Brad Pitt,

I'd be like,

all the whole,

451
00:28:49.471 --> 00:28:53.880

Um,

452
00:28:53.881 --> 00:28:57.180
I've been eating like shit out here in the road.
My flat stomach is no more.

453
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.620
I looked like a fucking Turd.

454
00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:00.893
<v 4>MMM.</v>

455
00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.350
<v 1>All right.
You know what Kate Upton looks like?

Um,</v>

456
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.600
oh my God,
I look like a fucking redheaded Danny Devito.

457
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.710
Oh fuck.
I just,
you know,

458
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:19.810
I got here and it's just like I got one of those New York Deli sandwiches and I,

459
00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.590
I just,
you don't,

460
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:24.210
you feel like you have to stock up because I know I'm going back out.
Like,

461
00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:26.850
if I was going to move,
ever move back to the east coast,

462
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:31.020
like the amount of fucking Mexican food that I would be eating in La,

463
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.490
the amount of Taco trucks that I would hit,
the amount of Thai food,

464
00:29:35.491 --> 00:29:39.270
the amount of Burgers,
everything that La does.
Great.

465
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.110
I go up to San Francisco,
I'd get a couple of thousand fucking burritos

466
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.380
shoving down my fat fuck a fucking throat,
you know?

467
00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.390
And then that would be it.
And,
and I would,

468
00:29:54.391 --> 00:29:57.660
I would just head back east and I would never get another fucking Taco.

469
00:29:57.661 --> 00:29:59.820
It's like I'm not doing it.
Um,

470
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.980
I mean pizza.
I mean,

471
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:05.110
how do you lay off pizza in Italian food when you're back here?

472
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.470
Cause I can't do it because I got to go back to,

473
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.640
to no man's land of Shit,
bread,
shit,
doe and all of that stuff.

474
00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:17.560
So whatever.
I'll get back on the Diet.
I'm going to do that three day water fast.

475
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:19.623
You know

476
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.590
where you just drink water and you don't consult a doctor and then all of a

477
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:28.591
sudden you go into convulsions and then you come to in the hospital

478
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.330
and there's some guy fucking the stethoscope standing over Vigo in.
Uh,

479
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.990
that was a pretty a reckless thing.
You did.
What happened?
Well,

480
00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.440
you let your electrolytes get down to la.

481
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.450
She ever challenged him any less than a year,
a bile juices and hey,

482
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.790
what happened was the,
uh,
the lining of your cell walls.
Uh,

483
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:53.380
if you take too much water,
I just,
hey buddy,
could you just fucking,

484
00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.860
am I still alive right now or am I in hell because I don't know what the fuck

485
00:30:56.861 --> 00:31:00.340
you talking about.
Okay,
I get it.
Can I see a mirror?

486
00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:03.400
But see how much weight I lost?
How long was he in a coma for?

487
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.060
Was it like a liquid diet and you couldn't force me to chew where you,

488
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.220
I'm a big Hollywood phony.
I don't care if I almost killed myself.

489
00:31:11.221 --> 00:31:12.480
I'm just trying to lose weight.

490
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.560
I'm trying to keep my Michelle entire fucking,

491
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.170
do you know if somebody told me that the,

492
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:21.840
I didn't know Michelin Stars were the same people who make the tires.

493
00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:24.690
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

494
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:28.890
<v 1>For those of you,
uh,
uncultured people,
a Michelin Star,</v>

495
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:32.160
the coveted Michelin Star,
you know,
if you get three of those,

496
00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.230
which is such a weird thing cause it's usually usually have to get like four,

497
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.260
five star hotel,
you know,

498
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.080
five star hotel is done is the new four.
Right.

499
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.260
But Michelin,
it's like three stars.

500
00:31:49.261 --> 00:31:53.400
It's got three Michelin Stars and that means that the food evidentaly is out of

501
00:31:53.401 --> 00:31:54.540
this fucking world.

502
00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.053
<v 4>Okay.</v>

503
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.470
<v 1>And I found out that
I thought there was separate,
you know,</v>

504
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:08.770
like there's the Macintosh stereo and then there's the Macintosh computer and

505
00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:10.990
they're spelled differently and they have nothing to do with each other.

506
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.780
That's what I thought.
A Michelin Star Wars.
I'm like,
yeah,

507
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.170
but it's not literally the fucking Michelin tire people.
It is.

508
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.730
And this person had to look it up cause I refuse to believe it.

509
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.250
And I was just like,
but why the fuck are we listening to these people?

510
00:32:24.251 --> 00:32:25.090
They make tires,

511
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.413
<v 4>you know,</v>

512
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.440
<v 1>I mean that's just a weird thing.</v>

513
00:32:30.441 --> 00:32:35.441
I see tires and then you're into like a also breaks or something else on a

514
00:32:36.771 --> 00:32:40.140
fucking car.
Steering columns.

515
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.280
<v 4>Something in the tire area.
Okay.</v>

516
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:45.703
<v 1>You know,</v>

517
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:50.740
how the fuck do you go from radial tires helping me not hydroplane to a beef

518
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.780
Borgen y'all like where the fuck I was supposed to go to photo.

519
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.540
Fuck does Michelin think they are and furthermore,

520
00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:00.650
what's wrong with all of these fucking,
what do you call them?
The,

521
00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:05.660
the God damn ma chefs getting all fucking nervous about what a tire company

522
00:33:08.431 --> 00:33:09.264
thinks.

523
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.970
That would be like a bunch of comedians getting nervous

524
00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.240
about uh,
making one comedian make them fucking nervous.

525
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:22.843
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

526
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.800
<v 1>All right,
I'm speaking to code here.
Okay.
Anyways,

Yeah.

543
00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.060
There's a few places that I go back to and it's like,

544
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:32.060
I just go back to where the fuck I want.
Like whenever I go back to Boston,

545
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.990
it's just over.
I go to all the places that I went to when I,

546
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.790
when I could eat McDonald's at four in the morning,

547
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.070
still wake up and not have no damage done.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:45.210
<v 3>all right.
Please enjoy the music,
uh,
on the podcast here.
And,
um,</v>

568
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:46.821
<v 1>that's it.</v>

569
00:35:46.821 --> 00:35:50.030
And then we'll play another half hour of greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon

570
00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.120
podcast just before Friday with the Monday,

571
00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.890
somewhere in there from earlier this year,
maybe

572
00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:57.243
<v 2>five minutes ago.</v>

573
00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:21.120
[inaudible] long

574
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:21.953
<v 3>distance hiking.</v>

575
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.760
The last week I mentioned that I went on a hike and we just kept going and going

576
00:36:26.761 --> 00:36:29.730
like assholes,
not realizing that we had to walk back.

577
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.390
Hiking is not like a treadmill.
You don't just get to step off and be like,
oh,

578
00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:37.740
I'm still,
despite the fact I walked for an hour,
I am still only,

579
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:42.240
you know,
10 paces from my phone,
the parking lot,
my car.
Um,

580
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:46.580
we ended up going on like an 11 mile hike and uh,

581
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.610
it was exhausting to say the least.

582
00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:53.190
So this person is writing about long distance hiking,

583
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.650
another great old man thing to do yoga,
hockey,

584
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:03.600
ice hockey,
and a hiking,
you know.

585
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:05.310
Um,
all right.
Hey Bill,

586
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.210
I've been listening to your podcast long enough to know that you love hiking,

587
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.400
you hate getting fat and you get easily annoyed by day to day bullshit.

588
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.820
I really think you'd enjoy backpacking out.
Jesus

589
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:23.430
backpacking.
I know it's awesome,

590
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:26.520
but can you call it something else?
Backpacking.

591
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.500
I just feel like I'm fucking waiting for a bus,

592
00:37:28.501 --> 00:37:32.700
picking my nose by really get the shit kicked out of me.
Hey,

593
00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:35.820
you guys want to go backpacking to pack?

594
00:37:35.821 --> 00:37:40.821
You put on your back and you go backpacking or long distance hiking.

595
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.400
Okay,
let's call it that.
It's a really,

596
00:37:44.401 --> 00:37:47.880
I don't have long distance hiking freaks me out because I figured at that point

597
00:37:47.881 --> 00:37:52.170
you've walked long enough to run into something that can mall you to death slash

598
00:37:52.171 --> 00:37:56.760
rip your face off or at the very least just sort of bite your throat until it

599
00:37:56.761 --> 00:37:59.400
stops feeling the pulse,
you know,

600
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.520
start getting into that next weight class of animals and I don't know,

601
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:09.390
you know,
mountain lions,
black bear,
grizzly bear,

602
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.510
fucking Anaconda,
whatever.

603
00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:16.950
Exotic pet that somebody let loose that has no natural enemy that is now taking

604
00:38:16.951 --> 00:38:19.530
over the forest.
Um,

605
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.580
longest or long distance hiking.
It's really,

606
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.950
it's really freeing to walk away from civilization for a week or more with the

607
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:33.570
solid pair of boots and everything you need strapped to your back,
dude.

608
00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:37.960
Fuck that.
You're more man or woman than I am.
I,
I can't fucking deal with that.

609
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.580
I get scared.
I get,
I get freaked the fuck out.

610
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.850
I'd have to be out there with somebody who knew what they were doing.

611
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.110
Who had a gun.
Uh,

612
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.790
automatic to not even semiautomatic.

613
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:56.050
I need something that I could spray and the general direction of the sound I

614
00:38:56.051 --> 00:38:59.050
just heard and you know,
if we kill a couple of backpackers,

615
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.790
there's no one else around burying them as optional.

616
00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:08.340
I would say leave them above ground cause they'll get picked away a lot quicker

617
00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.760
than people will find their clothes.
I guess the bones would be there.

618
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.930
That's creepy.
See what happens when you go out in the wilderness,

619
00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:20.640
you start fucking talking about shit like that.
I live in a suburb.

620
00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.560
Okay.
There's plenty of people to shoot and I never think of donut.

621
00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.573
They're right out there.

622
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:27.870
Right fucking out there and I never think of shooting him.

623
00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:31.650
All of a sudden you get me backpacking or long distance hiking and I'm trying to

624
00:39:31.651 --> 00:39:34.440
think how to bury bodies.
All right.

625
00:39:34.441 --> 00:39:37.200
Every time I finish a long hike,

626
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.630
I come back looking healthier and leaner and feeling refreshed.
Yeah.

627
00:39:42.631 --> 00:39:45.810
Cause you were out there eating berries,
wiping your ass with fucking pine cones.

628
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:50.410
That's it.
That's why you have that peculiar look on your face.

629
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.670
No matter how much you eat on the trail,
you're guaranteed to lose weight.

630
00:39:54.671 --> 00:39:59.110
If you spend six hours a day hiking with a 35 pound backpack,

631
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:02.680
there's no need to limit yourself to salads and juice.

632
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:07.950
I can't tell you how many times I've had older day hikers look at my backpack

633
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:12.730
and tell me they wish they had done more backpacking when they were able to.

634
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:16.780
It's a really unique experience.
Experienced out there on your own.
Yeah,

635
00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:20.050
I bet it is.
Well,
what do,
can you please write back and tell me,
uh,

636
00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:24.850
what you do about animals,
man,
because I'm telling you right now,

637
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.630
I'm not doing this.
You know,
I,

638
00:40:28.631 --> 00:40:31.840
the only way I would do this is I was in a fucking platoon and we all had

639
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:36.400
machine guns just in case I missed.
Um,
anyways,

640
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.860
oh,
here he goes.
He's going to calm me down.

641
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:42.430
And it isn't nearly as dangerous or as difficult as people make it out to be.

642
00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.900
If you stay on the trail,

643
00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:48.190
you'll usually run across another hiker every few hours.
Oh,
that's comforting.

644
00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.210
That's comforting.
Every couple hours I can run into Johnny Appleseed,

645
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:57.700
but during the other hour and 50 minutes minutes,
I'm on my own.
All right.

646
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.080
Ah,
you're running usually run into another hike or every few hours that can help

647
00:41:02.081 --> 00:41:02.650
you.

648
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:07.650
If you get hurt and bears mountain lions and all those other beasts kill a lot

649
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:13.420
fewer people than Los Angeles.
Traffic accidents do.
Well,

650
00:41:13.421 --> 00:41:16.030
I used to do a bit on that.
Well,
obviously,
because the fucking,

651
00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:23.300
you know the,
there's,
you're running into one person every two hours,
sir.

652
00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:24.830
Let's do the math here.
Okay?

653
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.093
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

654
00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:28.183
<v 3>Here's the deal.</v>

655
00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:29.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

656
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.960
<v 3>There's like 7 million people in Los Angeles.</v>

657
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:36.643
<v 4>Okay.</v>

658
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:41.150
<v 3>You can't fucking go anywhere without running into like a thousand fucking</v>

659
00:41:41.151 --> 00:41:41.984
people out here.

660
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.870
You're somewhere where you walk every two hours and run into one human beings.

661
00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:50.510
So obviously I can guarantee you if those lines and mountain lines were down

662
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:53.450
here,
the death rate would be through the fucking roof.

663
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.020
All right?
This is the guy,
this is what he says too.
He goes,

664
00:41:57.021 --> 00:42:00.350
just keep your food away from your tent and you'll be fine.

665
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:03.961
Do you understand,
sir,

666
00:42:03.961 --> 00:42:08.790
that you're telling me to do something where if I'm too near my food supply,

667
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:13.800
I could possibly get eaten to death.
You want me to leave my living room?

668
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.440
Do you know why can't I just sit on my back porch?
Well,
listen,

669
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:23.840
I would love,
I,

670
00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.770
I would love to too.
Go hiking like that.
I,
I really would,

671
00:42:28.771 --> 00:42:30.330
but I cannot get past.

672
00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.163
<v 4>MMM,</v>

673
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.880
<v 3>no,
I don't think you should be able to get past it.
That there's,</v>

674
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.910
that type of shit is out there.
All right.

675
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:43.280
And if you get mauled to death as a standup comedian,

676
00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.230
yeah.
You really were just looking for trouble,
aren't you?

677
00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.960
I,
I,
that's,
you know,

678
00:42:52.961 --> 00:42:56.970
somebody just asked me to do a cruise to do stand up on a cruise and I,

679
00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:01.540
I told him I wasn't going to do it.
And they said,
why not?
And I said,

680
00:43:01.541 --> 00:43:05.330
because I'm terrified of the ocean.
Okay?

681
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.840
That's why I don't,
I respect it.

682
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:13.370
The ocean is not the ocean is the ocean,
but it's,

683
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.690
it's literally you're talking about

684
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.830
it's outer space on earth.

685
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.170
That's what it is,
okay?
You can't breathe in it.

686
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:34.290
You're not.
You can't be in it.
If you're in it too long,

687
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.250
you're either going to get hypothermia or something's going to come up and take

688
00:43:38.251 --> 00:43:40.230
a bite out of yet to see if your edible

689
00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:45.760
or are you going to drown.
Those are your three fucking options.

690
00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:49.930
And I know what you're thinking,
dude,
cruisers to safe,
man,

691
00:43:49.931 --> 00:43:52.190
you're out there on this big fucking boat yet.

692
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:56.050
And until you're not until you're not,

693
00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:01.600
and then you proceed to die.
One of the slowest,

694
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:06.630
most terrifying fucking deaths that there is treading water in the middle of

695
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:10.930
fucking nowhere and somebody's going to die.

696
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:14.500
No matter how fast they can fucking get you out there that somebody is going to

697
00:44:14.501 --> 00:44:19.480
die and people follow.
I fucking would did one cruise in my life and I could not,

698
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:24.190
I couldn't get past the fact that I was on something that the second it fucking

699
00:44:24.191 --> 00:44:26.920
shits the bed.
And I know you guys think that you go,

700
00:44:26.921 --> 00:44:31.030
I've been on cruises and go fuck yourself.
I talked to the,

701
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.640
that was on this cruise ship for fucking years and they told me stories over a

702
00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:41.340
little fucking played a Jello late at night.

703
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:46.210
Those awful cruise desserts.
So poor excuse for fucking,

704
00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.051
I also,

705
00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:50.500
I don't like fucking going out there and all of a sudden it's maritime laws and

706
00:44:50.501 --> 00:44:55.501
this Douche bag who didn't even run for office is now telling me what the he,

707
00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:01.320
whatever he says goes with his stupid ass fucking outfit.

708
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:06.840
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,
they told me stories.

709
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.540
Okay.
They told me,

710
00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:13.660
they told me enough fucking stories about food poisoning,

711
00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:18.130
about shit backing up about uh,
one engine not working.
Yeah.

712
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:22.580
And now they're going half speed and then they don't make it to all the cities.

713
00:45:22.581 --> 00:45:26.330
And then they make up shit about hurricanes and then they have,
fuck it.
Trust me.

714
00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.700
People have medical issues.

715
00:45:28.701 --> 00:45:33.280
And having to be fucking helicoptered off and flown is quickly.

716
00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:34.900
Is Human possibly possible?

717
00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.470
Not to the best possible hospital to the nearest one.

718
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.660
All right,
and are you going on a cruise?

719
00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.760
They go all over the fucking world and they go buy a bunch of fucking countries

720
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.360
that you wouldn't want to fucking get,
have I've ever Goddamn hangnail in,

721
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.220
but all of a sudden they're the closest one.

722
00:45:52.221 --> 00:45:55.430
And that's where the fuck you're going.
Dole.

723
00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.520
Hey Doctor Harry Hackett off.
Fuck that.

724
00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.540
Fuck that.
All right.

725
00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:09.620
Fucking combined.
Stand up comedy and waterworld.
I'm not doing it.

726
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:14.630
All right.
So that's the thing about,
I would absolutely love to go backpacking.

727
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:17.300
I would love to do that.
I would love to go up fucking mountains.

728
00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.700
I would love to do that.
It's way better than going to the gym.

729
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:24.910
I understand 100% what you're talking about,

730
00:46:24.911 --> 00:46:29.911
but do that shit where you run into a bear mama bear and it just,

731
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:33.460
<v 4>yeah,</v>

732
00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:37.930
<v 3>turns around and just runs it.
You 35 40 miles an hour,</v>

733
00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.240
you basically,

734
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:45.410
and you're sitting there hearing this does beast

735
00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:52.180
like trees getting out of the fucking way.
It's this thing is just coming,

736
00:46:52.181 --> 00:46:57.181
flying down the fucking hill at you and you're running knowing you're going to

737
00:46:57.341 --> 00:47:01.480
get caught and you're here in your stupid pots and pans,
clink,

738
00:47:01.481 --> 00:47:06.010
clank and together and all you're trying to do is just get out in front of your

739
00:47:06.011 --> 00:47:06.844
friend.

740
00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:12.120
So he's the one that goes down and so you can live knowing for the rest of your

741
00:47:12.791 --> 00:47:17.660
life what your strategy did.
Killed your friends here in his cries

742
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:23.030
whenever enough.
What is the sound of having your face ripped off?

743
00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.900
I like to lose weight like the next guy.
Jesus,

744
00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:33.880
you go out there with your beer,
you're fucking bear mace.
Fuck.
All of that.

745
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.740
Bears.
Mountain lions,
poisonous snakes.

746
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.230
What about if you just,
and then all the fucking varmints out there.

747
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.370
I love that word because you send me Sam's the only person I ever heard use it.

748
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:52.270
And when I found out it was actually a credible word,
not something made up.

749
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:57.980
I absolutely loved that word farm.
It's,
you know,
badgers,

750
00:47:57.981 --> 00:47:58.940
wolverines,

751
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:05.040
bobcat's people will get bobcat's like they're no big deal if you're getting

752
00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:08.190
scratched by a fucking house cat,
how bad that,

753
00:48:08.191 --> 00:48:10.920
that thing can fuck you up with its little ass.
Fucking pause.

754
00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:13.163
<v 4>All right.</v>

755
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:17.010
<v 3>You,
you want a goddamn links jumping on.</v>

756
00:48:17.011 --> 00:48:22.011
You go to fucking town cause it's board or you're freaked out.

757
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:27.590
You came near to near something that had peed on and you have no fucking idea.

758
00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.590
That's another thing,
dude,
you're,
you're in their world.

759
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:35.520
This guy actually actually respected the fact that I said I'm not doing it,

760
00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.580
but I also,
he,
I think he thought it was pretty peculiar that I,

761
00:48:38.581 --> 00:48:43.320
I wouldn't do a stand up on a cruise.
I just jumped subjects.
Sorry.
And uh,

762
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:46.890
and I was waiting for him to ask me why.
And I would just be like,
well,
you know,

763
00:48:46.891 --> 00:48:51.180
would you do a podcast,
you know,
in on a,

764
00:48:51.181 --> 00:48:54.390
on a boat in a lake that's full of fucking alligators.

765
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:59.150
I mean you can like,
okay,
we're on the boat,
everything's fucking fine,

766
00:48:59.151 --> 00:49:03.080
but it's really is just an unnecessary risk that you take.

767
00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.850
Goes all the way back to that fucking saints fan.
He got off easy.

768
00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:13.740
That same fucking guy put that guy with his Jersey with his video cam camera

769
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:16.050
walking up to a mama bear screaming who day,

770
00:49:16.051 --> 00:49:18.630
who day and all that type of shit and he's worried about getting spit in his

771
00:49:18.631 --> 00:49:22.590
face.
He would have bare saliva all around his fucking neck.

772
00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:28.630
Oh Jesus Christ.

773
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:32.470
I've actually thought about that like what do I have dual for?

774
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:33.730
Bear was running right at me.

775
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.740
I just wished that I would have the wherewithal to run right at it.

776
00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:42.400
Like you know,
if a shark was coming at me,

777
00:49:42.401 --> 00:49:45.730
swim right at it and it as quickly as you can.

778
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:49.270
Shove your fucking head in there and get it over with.

779
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:51.000
<v 4>Okay,</v>

780
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.320
<v 3>that is the only fucking strategy.
What are you going to climb a tree?</v>

781
00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.950
Things going to go right up that tree.

782
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.980
Did you ever see that youtube video of those guys sitting in the tree hunting

783
00:50:01.981 --> 00:50:06.981
that bear and all of a sudden the bear just literally runs up the tree next to

784
00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:09.840
him and is like,

785
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.190
like,
I dunno,

786
00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:19.040
seven feet above them on the tree next to him leaning out,

787
00:50:19.041 --> 00:50:21.440
sniffing at them,
trying to figure out what the fuck they are.

788
00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:25.730
And I love how the bears just instinctual and stay fully know.
It's just like,

789
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.930
like would that bear eight feet above you?

790
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:33.860
That's like when you're in the upper deck of the stadium,
you know,

791
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:38.090
and you shit faced and you get into it with somebody two rows behind you,

792
00:50:38.091 --> 00:50:42.440
they automatically have the advantage because they're punching down,
right?

793
00:50:42.441 --> 00:50:44.870
You're gonna lose that fight.
You're going to fall on your back.

794
00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:48.020
You're probably going to break your ankle.
Something's going to get twisted.

795
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.980
Is this guy's punching down at,
you're not.
Just imagine it was a bear.

796
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:55.250
That was the situation these people are,
and you got to check out that video,

797
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.930
this fucking bear.

798
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:02.120
It was on the ground and they're whispering in their little fatigues looking at

799
00:51:02.121 --> 00:51:05.420
this thing.
And then this thing,
I don't know how it found them.

800
00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.450
You just heard and that was it.

801
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:12.380
Over this thing was all of a sudden not on the floor of the forest,
20 feet down.

802
00:51:12.381 --> 00:51:15.200
It was now eight feet above them,
sniffing at them like,
Ooh,

803
00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:19.330
is that a food source?
Jesus,

804
00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:22.480
do you really just hit on like two people today hit on two tremendous fears.

805
00:51:22.481 --> 00:51:26.860
I have been alone in the fucking wilderness and and,
and being out to sea.

806
00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:33.260
Fuck both of those,
although I want to hear the stories.
If you do it,
you know,

807
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.300
not if you went on a cruise.

808
00:51:34.301 --> 00:51:38.140
I don't give a shit going out there eating Jello with the date rape drug,

809
00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:42.670
fucking Weirdo,
you know,
to go see the reunion of wham

810
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:45.423
Cindy Lopper.

811
00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:49.610
<v 2>I love</v>

812
00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.190
[inaudible].
Hey,
what's going on?
Yeah,

813
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.750
<v 3>spell burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

814
00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:22.210
October 18th,
2010 how the fuck are you?

815
00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:27.750
I'm actually doing this shit Sunday night and I posted it nice and early.

816
00:52:27.751 --> 00:52:29.950
Look at that.
That's a gift for you all.

817
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.570
You can't sit out there bitching about how to actually,

818
00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.900
you should call it the fucking Monday after new podcasts.
You know,

819
00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:42.470
I guess maybe you have a point,
but you know what about me?
What about my world?

820
00:52:42.471 --> 00:52:45.270
What about the fact that I record them Monday morning?

821
00:52:45.271 --> 00:52:49.220
So it's still the Monday morning podcast.
All right.

822
00:52:49.221 --> 00:52:53.060
It's fucking free.
I think.
I don't,

823
00:52:53.061 --> 00:52:57.070
I have the right to name the goddamn thing.
Um,

824
00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:58.121
speaking of which,

825
00:52:58.121 --> 00:53:02.380
if you'd like to make a donation to the Monday morning podcast and actually get

826
00:53:02.381 --> 00:53:03.580
a little trinket for yourself,

827
00:53:03.581 --> 00:53:07.840
go to the the m M podcast.com and get the uh,

828
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.180
the Oh Geez.
Ring tone for your phone sales have picked up last week.

829
00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:17.740
F after I kind of broke your guys' balls about saving up for fucking happy
meals.

830
00:53:17.741 --> 00:53:22.720
You can't even kick me fucking 99.
God Damn sense I'm closing in.

831
00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:24.310
This is just like PBS.

832
00:53:24.311 --> 00:53:27.840
I'm closing in on the number that I need to go buy that fucking thing so I can

833
00:53:27.841 --> 00:53:32.070
start walking around doing these three things.
Maybe go to a mall and just,

834
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:36.180
you can listen to me shit on people for a fucking 45 minutes.

835
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.440
It's actually,
you know,
something that's something I really want to do because,

836
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:45.690
uh,
yeah,
I don't know.
I like to think I have love in my heart,

837
00:53:45.691 --> 00:53:49.950
but I,
I don't think so.
But anyways,
it was a a,
it was a big week.

838
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:54.150
I'm just looking at who I wrote for Douche bag of the week and I spelled her

839
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:58.860
name wrong.
Um,
anyways,
let's talk about the,

840
00:53:59.220 --> 00:53:59.310
uh,

841
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:03.120
the week coming up and I've actually been talking about this shit on stage and,

842
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:06.570
uh,
I don't give a fuck because it's such a topical bit.

843
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:10.540
I don't even know if people are gonna think it's funny in a month.
But,
uh,

844
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:15.740
can we please talk about fucking Bill O'reilly going on the view?

845
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:20.550
Um,
I gotta I gotta tell you something right now.

846
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:24.390
I don't like that guy's politics.
I don't like his face.

847
00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:29.820
He has,
he has that racist face.
You know his,

848
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:33.300
when he gets mad,
his fucking,
his face gets pointy.

849
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.130
He just looks evil.

850
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:39.720
He's just not a pleasant human being whatsoever,

851
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.520
but I gotta tell you,

852
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:46.470
he fucking destroyed on the view,

853
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:49.560
you know,
and I,

854
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:54.590
somewhere in there was a victory for men because he took on for fucking women.

855
00:54:54.601 --> 00:54:55.800
They were all yelling

856
00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:00.360
and he got two of them to walk off their own fucking show.

857
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:06.150
How do you do that?
I as a comedian,

858
00:55:06.151 --> 00:55:09.330
I was embarrassed to,
to stand up.
Comic comics just quit,

859
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:14.670
which is why I'm nominating Joy Bay harbor and Whoopi Goldberg is Douche bags of

860
00:55:14.671 --> 00:55:19.290
the week went,
what did you think was going to,
you think he was gonna go,
no,

861
00:55:19.291 --> 00:55:20.790
wait,
don't leave.

862
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:24.720
That's exactly what the fuck he wanted you to do.

863
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:29.490
I was actually hoping at that point that the other two women were going to leave

864
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:33.300
and then he could just start hosting the O'Reilly factor on the view.

865
00:55:33.301 --> 00:55:34.134
That would have been,

866
00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:40.010
he just totally 100% dominated at the very least,

867
00:55:40.201 --> 00:55:42.870
that segment,
because I don't,
I don't watch that fucking show,

868
00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:47.880
but just,
he just came on.
First of all,
he sits down,

869
00:55:47.881 --> 00:55:50.910
he's got on that shiny fucking Joe Pesci shoot,

870
00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:53.393
Joe Pesci Peshy suit.

871
00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:58.400
It's difficult to say Joe Peshy suit and he's got his fucking leg spread like a

872
00:55:59.311 --> 00:56:03.780
with his ball bag,
hang his shiny ball bay.
He locally,
if you ever see like,
uh,

873
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:08.310
when Kennedy debated Nixon,
how,
if you listen to it on the radio,

874
00:56:08.311 --> 00:56:11.210
how everybody said Nixon won.
But if you watched it on TV,

875
00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.860
Nixon was all tanned up.
He had his legs crossed,

876
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:19.190
he looked like a winner and Nixon sat there with his fucking legs splayed and

877
00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:22.410
cross like underneath the cherry living a fucking moron.

878
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:26.440
That's what bill O'Reilly looked like any,
he just,
he still dominated.

879
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:31.420
I love when he turned to joy and was just whatever I,
I'm paraphrasing here,

880
00:56:31.421 --> 00:56:34.420
but he was just like,
be quiet and learned

881
00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.680
and she had nothing,
a fucking standup comic.

882
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:43.120
She had nothing.

883
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:48.550
The whole segment was fucking hilarious.
And when he goes,
uh,

884
00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:52.090
another gem of a moment was when he goes,
you know,

885
00:56:52.091 --> 00:56:53.410
a lot of people don't realize this,

886
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:58.411
but 70% of Americans don't want a mosque at ground zero.

887
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:03.550
And joy goes.
She goes,
well,
I'd like to see that,

888
00:57:03.551 --> 00:57:04.870
that poll or something like,

889
00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:09.880
and as she's saying that the crowd is applauding what bill O'Reilly just said.

890
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.590
So you really don't need to see the pole at that point.
And,

891
00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.640
and getting beyond that,

892
00:57:15.641 --> 00:57:20.470
what he really should have said was 70% of Americans don't realize that they're

893
00:57:20.471 --> 00:57:23.290
not building a mosque at ground zero still,

894
00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:29.130
that they're actually making a rec room with a ping pong table and an area to

895
00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.640
pray.
Kind of like they have an area to pray it every fucking airport,
you know,

896
00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:34.211
three,

897
00:57:34.211 --> 00:57:38.710
four blocks up the street at a God damn coat factory is where it's actually

898
00:57:38.711 --> 00:57:39.221
being built.

899
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:44.020
But the fact that he said that they're still building a mosque and then he got

900
00:57:44.021 --> 00:57:45.070
an applause break.

901
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:49.750
Joy is so wrapped up into her own fucking opinion that she doesn't even hear her

902
00:57:49.751 --> 00:57:53.530
own studio audience backup the guy that she's trying to shit on.

903
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:58.750
And the fact that this fucking guy is still putting out inaccurate information,

904
00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.420
that people are still backing.
I would,

905
00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:04.330
it just was fucking awesome on all of those levels.

906
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:09.820
And a,
I like how Barbara Walters was old school.
Cool.
And she didn't walk off.

907
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:14.170
She gave those two Douche bags of the week shit for walking off their own show.

908
00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:18.360
And then she got him with a nice little class.
He's a singer.
He said,
ah,

909
00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:23.380
Bill O'reilly's on here this week.
When we come back,
we're going to talk,
um,

910
00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:25.540
or he's on the show today.
We're going to,
when we come back,

911
00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:29.860
he's going to talk about his new book called pinheads in Patriots.

912
00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.040
And then she looked at bill and she goes,
at this point I uh,

913
00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:37.360
I'm not sure which you are or something like that.
It was a great little zinger,

914
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.390
but she wasn't like judging the guy.

915
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:45.740
I don't know that the whole thing was funny and just how bill O'Reilly is,
is,

916
00:58:45.741 --> 00:58:48.130
is viewed as this intolerant person.

917
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.820
And then he comes on the show of a,

918
00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:55.830
I guess mostly liberals and then they show absolutely no tolerance for him and

919
00:58:57.581 --> 00:59:00.640
then throw a fucking temper tantrum and walk off their own goddamn show.
I mean,

920
00:59:00.641 --> 00:59:01.301
you can't tell me.

921
00:59:01.301 --> 00:59:06.301
Everybody over at at Fox News wasn't literally jerking off to that moment.

922
00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.140
I,
Bill O'reilly almost became a fucking rock star in that moment.
That was,

923
00:59:11.141 --> 00:59:14.560
that was like a standup comic moment that he did to two comedians,

924
00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:18.220
which blew my mind.
You know,

925
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:22.340
and I know I'm always trashing the broads on this show,

926
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:27.320
but that really was a chick way of handling,
losing an argument.
Like,

927
00:59:27.321 --> 00:59:31.490
I'm just going to get off up in storm or he is so used to people paying for your

928
00:59:31.491 --> 00:59:34.790
drinks and holding the Goddamn door for you.

929
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:39.710
You actually thought that as an adult that you were just going to walk off the

930
00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:43.400
shell and this was going to be this big moment.
And he was going to be like,
oh,

931
00:59:43.401 --> 00:59:46.820
wait a minute,
let me stop.
Ah,

932
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:51.860
I loved it.
He was like,
go ahead and leave.
I don't give a fuck.
I'll continue.

933
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:57.800
I'll take over your fucking show.
Um,
so anyways,
there you go.

934
00:59:59.170 --> 01:00:00.050
Douche bags of the week.

935
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:05.610
Joe Bay Har and Whoopi Goldberg for walking off your own fucking show when a

936
01:00:05.611 --> 01:00:08.540
shiny suit fucking,

937
01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:13.520
I can't say he's a moron because he does know.

938
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.750
I mean,
I look,
he,
he's very read up

939
01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:23.120
on that.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I am too stupid.
This is why I wouldn't,

940
01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:23.841
this is right here.

941
01:00:23.841 --> 01:00:28.400
Why I would never engage is much as I disagree with his opinions.

942
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:33.650
I don't fucking pay attention to politics at all.
I don't,

943
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:38.630
I find it frustrating.
I find it to be,
it just a rigged fucking gay.

944
01:00:38.631 --> 01:00:42.860
I don't give a fuck,
you know,
and I,
so I would never try to,

945
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.230
as much as I disagree with Bill O'reilly,

946
01:00:45.231 --> 01:00:48.920
I would never go on his show and try to fucking one up the guy and think I'm

947
01:00:48.921 --> 01:00:53.230
going to,
uh,
beat the guy in an argument about politics.
It's like tea.

948
01:00:53.231 --> 01:00:56.980
He's paying attention to these politicians the way I,

949
01:00:56.981 --> 01:01:00.620
I give a fuck about football.
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna win that argument.

950
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.980
And we went on,

951
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:05.810
I bring fucking Roy Jones Jr over and start debating him in about boxing.

952
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.050
I don't know.
It's just,
it was,
uh,

953
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:13.370
it was fucking hilarious at the whole thing was just,

954
01:01:13.371 --> 01:01:18.260
it was hilarious and a big,

955
01:01:18.261 --> 01:01:21.980
big fucking victory for that fucking,
I dunno.

956
01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.810
I Dunno how enough as a stand up comic.

957
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:32.630
He fucking you just tap out.
That was embarrassing.

958
01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:35.810
Anyway,
let's get on with the Goddamn podcast for this week.
Um,

959
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.600
I kinda liked that you guys liked that format.

960
01:01:38.601 --> 01:01:42.590
Just getting a Douche bag of the week out of the way right off the fucking bat.

961
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:47.200
Uh,
I know a lot of people in Denver are probably saying that referee who called

962
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:50.630
dead fucking pass interference on the jets.
I mean on the Broncos,

963
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.810
put them right down there on the goal line to the jets.

964
01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:55.610
Give that guy a game ball or what?

965
01:01:57.530 --> 01:02:01.760
That was fucking hilarious because everybody in New York wanted to kill that
ref.

966
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:03.740
I can't say it was just him,

967
01:02:03.741 --> 01:02:07.310
but I mean he fucked up to passenger interference calls where the Broncos were

968
01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.400
mugging the jets receivers and uh,

969
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.020
what a fucking time for a makeup call.
Huh?
Hey,
you go mark.

970
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.570
You fucking,
he looks like that dude from entourage,
doesn't he?
Look,

971
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.750
I got to extend a fucking olive branch here to the Goddamn jet fans.

972
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:28.320
I hate the fucking say it,
but you guys got a good team.
I'm convinced now.

973
01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.370
All right,

974
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:32.310
at right now you're probably rolling your eyes and I want you to shut your green

975
01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:37.300
fucking fucking faces for a second.
All right?
This is what I,

976
01:02:37.301 --> 01:02:40.770
I wait til mid October before I start doing,

977
01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.400
we're going to win your fucking Superbowl.

978
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.550
That dumb shit that people do in August.

979
01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:48.750
Those people who paint their faces and have horns on their hats and all that

980
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:49.590
dumb shit,

981
01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.690
and you don't wear a shirt to the game in November to show people how crazy you

982
01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:58.290
are because you don't know how to talk to fucking women.
Um,

983
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:05.240
this is what scares me about the jets as a New York jet hater is,
uh,

984
01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.020
not only are they a solid team,

985
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:11.850
they got luck on this side and you fucking need that.
All right?

986
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.610
Patriot fan.
The tuck rule pulled that one out of the Goddamn fucking mothballs,

987
01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:20.090
wherever that one came from,
you need some luck.
And a,

988
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:25.100
the jet's got real lucky when the refs finally decided to call a pass

989
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.950
interference they got,
they got and that,

990
01:03:26.951 --> 01:03:29.850
that's the type of shit that happens when you win a championship.

991
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:31.470
I'm just letting you know jet fans,

992
01:03:31.471 --> 01:03:34.920
cause I know you don't know what that looks like as a jet fan unless you're in

993
01:03:34.921 --> 01:03:38.760
your fucking seventies at this point.
So,
uh,

994
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:42.570
but I do want to say this to all you conti jet fans and I was going back and

995
01:03:42.571 --> 01:03:47.160
forth with like 20 of them this week.
So I'm sorry if I didn't get back to you.

996
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:52.320
Um,
all the you shitting on the fucking patriots for getting rid of Randy Moss.

997
01:03:52.321 --> 01:03:56.700
I gotta admit our offense kind of looked the exact same,
you know,

998
01:03:56.930 --> 01:04:00.090
kind of look the exact same and look at Deon branch caught a touchdown fucking

999
01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:03.960
pass and we beat the ravens.
So we're four and one.

1000
01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:08.550
I don't know what the fuck that means.
Our defense looked a little bit better,

1001
01:04:08.551 --> 01:04:09.384
but I dunno,

1002
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:14.510
this has been the weirdest year in history for NFL football where there's just,

1003
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.940
there's nobody dominating.

1004
01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:23.190
There's just no front runner team,
you know,

1005
01:04:23.191 --> 01:04:26.880
and don't sleep on the fucking a Kansas City patriots out there.
Huh?

1006
01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.130
Jesus Christ.
They got our old office of coordinator,

1007
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:33.780
defensive coordinator,

1008
01:04:33.781 --> 01:04:37.650
old quarterbacks coach and they pulled that fucking play out where you fucking

1009
01:04:37.651 --> 01:04:42.540
throw the ball to Mike Graybeal for a touchdown.
Um,

1010
01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.940
yeah,
but there's,
there's nobody out there.
Raw Steelers came back big Ben.

1011
01:04:47.941 --> 01:04:52.230
They got him back.
I stayed away from that game.
I didn't bet it.
I was like,

1012
01:04:52.231 --> 01:04:54.450
the fucking steal is 13 points.
They're going to cover that.

1013
01:04:54.451 --> 01:04:58.050
But there was something,
I got my stupid theory about division rivalry games.

1014
01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:01.920
This is something that's embarrassing.
I'm actually doing this Sunday night,

1015
01:05:01.921 --> 01:05:05.370
so I don't even know if the colts one,
I picked the colts,
but I had a,

1016
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:09.600
the colts given three,
but these were the beds I had this week.

1017
01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:13.860
And you can follow this all along on the [inaudible] podcast.com me and Paul

1018
01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:18.100
Versey heavy season long bet.
We basically,
we were picking three games a week,

1019
01:05:18.101 --> 01:05:20.590
but now we're kind of addicted to it.
So now we're kind of up to four.

1020
01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:24.070
We're going to pick for each and at the end of the,
against the spread,

1021
01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:28.780
the end of the year,
whoever has the,
uh,
the best record wins the pot.

1022
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:33.580
And uh,
I went for,
and one last week I thought I knew some shit in this week.

1023
01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:38.320
I got my ass handed to me.
The only game I won I think is the jets game.

1024
01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.150
I took the jets given three.

1025
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:45.370
I just didn't believe in Denver's fucking quarterback and a,
but I had,

1026
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.650
I had Oakland given six go into San Francisco.
I just,

1027
01:05:50.651 --> 01:05:53.050
San Francisco keeps shooting themselves in the foot.

1028
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.070
Oakland's been paying clinic competitive as fuck it.
I'll take that one.

1029
01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:58.480
I lost my ass on that one.

1030
01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.780
And I went against my gut that has been telling me that Tony Romo is missing

1031
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.370
half a fucking chromosome.
And he did,

1032
01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:10.690
despite the fact that he throws for 350 yards and the final minutes of the

1033
01:06:10.691 --> 01:06:13.180
fucking game,
he just doesn't get it done.

1034
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.540
I went against that because I saw what's his face?

1035
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:21.040
Brett Farve grab his goddamn elbow last week during the Monday night game.

1036
01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:22.510
So I'm like,
he's an old fuck.

1037
01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:26.340
I don't give a shit how many horse tranquilizers they give them a then I kind of

1038
01:06:26.341 --> 01:06:27.940
went,
so I lost that fucking game too.

1039
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:32.740
And I gotta admit I have won money on the jets two fucking weeks in a row,

1040
01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.720
two weeks in a row,
two fucking weeks in a row.
So there you go.

1041
01:06:37.721 --> 01:06:39.960
So if you want to follow along and watch our,
uh,

1042
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.820
watch our NFL picks and that type of stuff.

1043
01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:45.310
I'm actually trying to talk less about the NFL just because I've really,

1044
01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:49.180
that's all that I've been talking about,
I feel for like the last two,

1045
01:06:49.181 --> 01:06:52.510
three weeks.
So,
um,
and speaking of which,

1046
01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:55.450
I actually ran into Nick Swardson then he asked me next time he could come on

1047
01:06:55.451 --> 01:06:58.960
here cause he wants to scream about fucking NFL football.

1048
01:06:58.961 --> 01:07:03.730
And if you guys think that I am a psycho
when it comes to that Shit,

1049
01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:08.560
this guy,
uh,
he really like I was sitting,
I was telling them that bills,

1050
01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.090
you know,

1051
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:12.730
Bill's jets game or somebody like when I was taking a piss and somebody almost

1052
01:07:12.731 --> 01:07:14.740
pushed me into the wall because I was one of my mouth so much.

1053
01:07:14.741 --> 01:07:19.270
And I was telling him how I was thinking back afterwards of how I don't want to

1054
01:07:19.271 --> 01:07:24.070
end up with my teeth on the floor of a fucking half as NFL stadium.

1055
01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.360
And he was like,
no,
no,
you did the right thing.
You did the right thing.

1056
01:07:28.361 --> 01:07:29.650
You should have talked more shit.

1057
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.920
So I got to get them on there cause I think it will be on this podcast.

1058
01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:35.440
Do another one of those special ones just because I think it'll be interesting

1059
01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:36.274
to,
uh,

1060
01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:41.230
hear me try to be a recovered angry fan and uh,

1061
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:46.150
and him saying,
no,
you've got to steer into it.
Um,
anyways,

1062
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.890
uh,
let's get with questions this week.

1063
01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:53.740
Somebody wrote me here and he said a bill.
Um,
I just got the DVD,

1064
01:07:53.741 --> 01:07:58.300
let it go in the mail and it was fucking awesome.
And,
uh,

1065
01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:02.290
before I even get going,
I want to thank this guy for by actually buying the DVD.

1066
01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:05.590
Um,
and also want to thank all you guys who went out and bought it.

1067
01:08:05.591 --> 01:08:07.480
It was actually number one last week,

1068
01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:12.640
the number one comedy download as far as standup comedy goes on iTunes.

1069
01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.180
So I want to thank all you guys and it was fucking huge for me to hear that.

1070
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:20.950
So,
uh,
and then as far as comedy goes,
it was only behind,
uh,

1071
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:24.470
the soundtrack to get him to the Greek.
I don't know where the fuck it is now.

1072
01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.910
This point might be behind some fucking Nipsey Russell compilation,

1073
01:08:28.911 --> 01:08:32.960
but for one day I was number one.
So please keep buying it.

1074
01:08:32.961 --> 01:08:36.920
And everybody's saying the same shit who is bought it.
They're like,
wow,

1075
01:08:36.921 --> 01:08:39.230
it's even funnier than when I saw on comedy central.

1076
01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:43.790
And they took out some fucking
strong bits,

1077
01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:48.850
which I really feel that is accurate because they took out 16 minutes of the

1078
01:08:49.471 --> 01:08:52.190
special.
So if you think you saw it,
you still haven't seen it.

1079
01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:56.030
It's only fucking 10 bucks,
$10 in change.

1080
01:08:57.410 --> 01:09:01.940
Um,
so please check it out.
Just so I can sell enough fucking units of this place.

1081
01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.500
These people I did business with,

1082
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:08.980
we'll actually get in business with me again and want me to do another fucking

1083
01:09:09.051 --> 01:09:12.200
special.
It's how it works.
See if they don't make any fucking money.

1084
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.230
Next thing you know,
I will be on American idol.

1085
01:09:15.231 --> 01:09:19.430
Sit next to Steven Tyler and I'll be fucking,
I dunno,
actually,

1086
01:09:19.431 --> 01:09:21.350
I guess I would be on last comic standing.
Wouldn't I?

1087
01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.970
Have I said anything funny for 20 minutes?
Let's go.
Let's,

1088
01:09:25.971 --> 01:09:27.720
let's plow through this.
Anyways,

1089
01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:32.510
I just recently started listening to the podcast and whatever,
any fucking ways,

1090
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.370
like a conversational,
this guy writes it,

1091
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:37.430
listen to the podcast and shit in any fucking ways.

1092
01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:42.420
I like how you talk about pirating music slash comedy and how it's sucks ass.

1093
01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.190
I'm an independent musician and if I don't sell my singles for 90 cents a

1094
01:09:46.191 --> 01:09:48.620
fucking song,
my music career dies.

1095
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:53.690
It doesn't matter that my youtube videos of songs have,
uh,

1096
01:09:53.691 --> 01:09:57.860
hundreds of thousands of hits or whatever actual sales mean everything.

1097
01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:02.930
I hear Ya.
I hear Ya.
Cause they will not get back in business with you.
Um,

1098
01:10:02.931 --> 01:10:07.790
so anyways,
he goes,
I have a question about alcohol.
Um,
I don't drink that much,

1099
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:12.410
but when I do,
I drink excessively like twice a week.

1100
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:16.400
Usually I blackout.
Nothing bad ever happens.

1101
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:21.680
I just like drinking.
Jesus,
this sounds familiar.
Uh,
he goes on to say,

1102
01:10:21.681 --> 01:10:23.760
should I cut back?
I usually clean my,

1103
01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:29.210
I usually clean my apartment when I black out.
That doesn't seem bad.
However,

1104
01:10:29.211 --> 01:10:34.010
most people think I have a problem for getting that drunk on the weekends.

1105
01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:37.970
Uh,
I would appreciate your feedback again.
Let it go.
Was Great.

1106
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:42.410
Worth the 10 fucking dollars.
Well,
thank you once again for buying it.
Um,
yeah,

1107
01:10:42.411 --> 01:10:45.310
dude.
All right.
I gotta Tell You,
uh,

1108
01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.660
I've blacked out from drinking who hasn't?
Um,

1109
01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.110
and I got it made.
I've always been fascinated.
Oh,
the lovely knee is coming in.

1110
01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:00.470
Um,
I've always been fascinated.
It's freezing.
It's freezing in here.

1111
01:11:00.471 --> 01:11:05.330
Come on the podcast for a second.
We'll turn the heat on.
Yeah.
Oh,

1112
01:11:05.331 --> 01:11:07.340
Jesus.
You know what,
she's,
she just picked up.
She,

1113
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:08.960
I don't know where you got that.

1114
01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:15.060
She bought this fucking it like a wooly mammoth pelt.

1115
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.790
You're really into first.
Oh my God.
Huh?

1116
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:22.020
Pick up the microphone and talk into it this week rather than,

1117
01:11:22.021 --> 01:11:26.210
than me integrate it all.
This is not real far.
Okay.
This is photo.

1118
01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:31.080
I got this down to his foe means fake in French.
Oh,
okay.

1119
01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:33.580
Jesus.
Look,
you come in here all hoity.
Toity

1120
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.570
it's fucking gross.
Yeah,

1121
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:42.890
that looks like that used to be in the back of a van in the 70s and I bet if you

1122
01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:45.720
put a fucking ultra violet light over it,

1123
01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.980
reg Brady's Jesse's is on there from when he banged Florence Henderson.

1124
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:52.590
All right.
I set it.
I set it.
It's disgusting.

1125
01:11:52.591 --> 01:11:57.240
I don't like it like you made that point several times to you,

1126
01:11:57.241 --> 01:12:02.070
but not to the listeners.
I think they need to know,
I think 20 times.
Listen,

1127
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:06.600
I'll be the judge of their,
okay.
It's fucking,

1128
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:11.160
it's disgusting.
It's not,
you call it a fabric.
Does Hey,

1129
01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:16.050
be quiet and learn something and oh my God,
are you doing the bill O'Reilly?

1130
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:19.680
I'm trying to see if that works on all females because joy just shut up.

1131
01:12:19.681 --> 01:12:22.050
You know it's fucked up.
I actually Douche bags of the week.

1132
01:12:22.051 --> 01:12:26.070
I actually said Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg for walking off their own goddamn

1133
01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:29.250
show.
Quitting his standup comedian.
Sell O'reilly in there too,

1134
01:12:29.251 --> 01:12:33.750
or just the two of them.
No,
I said that.
I don't agree with his politics,

1135
01:12:33.751 --> 01:12:37.650
but he fucking was,
he was the man.
It was their show.

1136
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:40.800
They shouldn't have walked out.
It's true.
It's like you're in my house.

1137
01:12:40.801 --> 01:12:44.400
You walk off.
You know what I mean?
It'd be like someone,

1138
01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:49.020
you had a house party and some guy came in like breaking shit was being a dick

1139
01:12:49.050 --> 01:12:52.530
and then to make him leave you leave your own fucking house.

1140
01:12:52.531 --> 01:12:54.100
I can't deal with this anymore.

1141
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:58.890
And you're waiting for him to say no.
So let's get back to this thing.

1142
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:02.490
Can you please stop buying shit like that.

1143
01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.040
All right.
You know what else she got really going to trash everything you got.

1144
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:13.070
She found this cheetah print.
I didn't find it.
I paid for a yard sale.

1145
01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:16.650
You're like fucking peg Bundy.
What do you mean your,
your,
your,

1146
01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:22.000
your furniture blankets style that looks animal related.
No,

1147
01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.500
it's,
it's leopard.
It's,

1148
01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.620
she found this leopard print sort of table sort of something that you,

1149
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:33.210
it's clearly the print on this basically saying,
you know,

1150
01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.170
fuck your hoary girlfriend on this.
That's what that says.

1151
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:41.930
And she went out and she got it.
And I'm like,
and she hates that.
Yeah.
And I said,

1152
01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:45.420
if you hadn't guessed no and I told you to get the thing fumigated and you never

1153
01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:50.010
did fumigated,
whatever the fuck you doing professionally cleaned.

1154
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.860
Listen,
I'm trying to help you out.

1155
01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.280
If you're going to buy something used when it comes to,

1156
01:13:56.281 --> 01:13:59.820
it's going to be up against your body or whatever the f are you,

1157
01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:04.500
are you going to let me finish my stupid point?
Okay.

1158
01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:09.620
Be quiet in learn if you keep doing that kick kicking the ball.

1159
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.490
No,
listen to me.
If you're going to do shit like that,

1160
01:14:15.491 --> 01:14:20.230
like stay away from leopard prints.
Might.

1161
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:24.520
I like it because that's my taste.
It's not your taste and that's fine.

1162
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:29.670
Okay,
but it we bought it off of some frigging Yuppie googling.

1163
01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:34.810
I did.
Okay.
It wasn't like I founded mentioned at halogen areas.

1164
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.430
It's wrong with you.
Why don't you just give the Goddamn air?

1165
01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:42.940
They live across the street.
They don't live across the street.

1166
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:48.150
You live far away from home off my one stalker trying to throw him off paranoid

1167
01:14:48.671 --> 01:14:50.190
about this cause I said

1168
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.680
thank you for stopping by the broadcast.
I am dismissing you.
Oh my God.

1169
01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:01.000
Your kid,
because you're divulging too much information.
You're cold.

1170
01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:04.540
You're wrapped up in that woolly mammoth blanket.
I don't like it.

1171
01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:07.540
You're really annoying me.
Just get outta here.
All right.
I'm serious.

1172
01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:12.040
I'm dead serious.
Go out to the kitchen and fucking cook something up.

1173
01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:15.730
Whip something up there.
Totes.
Yeah.
You don't even believe it,
dude.

1174
01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:19.180
Did you turn the fucking heat on?
Cause I smelled that burning smell.

1175
01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.430
When are we going to step up our life?

1176
01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:26.320
I should really take a picture with our life.
That's what I want to do.

1177
01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:29.320
I'll tell you because I keep going to people's parties and they're living better

1178
01:15:29.321 --> 01:15:32.230
than we are.
This,
this whole debt free life that we're living,

1179
01:15:32.231 --> 01:15:36.370
the level of freedom that we have.
Like,
yeah,
it's,
hey man,
let's go see a movie.

1180
01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:39.040
And we don't have,

1181
01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:43.300
we don't have to work that day that we can take trips than I am.

1182
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.020
We both had a white trash upbringing.
I'm not in my house.

1183
01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:52.510
More Brash.
Macaroni and cheese was a main dish.
And you hit it with toast.

1184
01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:55.600
We used to eat chipped beef on toast.

1185
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:59.110
You didn't have macaroni and cheese and toast for dinner.
Yeah,
we did.

1186
01:15:59.111 --> 01:16:01.460
Your mom cooks like it was awesome.
No,

1187
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:04.510
but every once in awhile we would have that as a dinner and I loved it.

1188
01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.880
We'd have chipped beef on toast.
What?
Beef chipped beef on toast.

1189
01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:15.150
It was chips of beef from notes.
Like if,

1190
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:20.300
just imagine if you could freeze a cow,
you skinned it and then you froze,

1191
01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:20.771
froze it.

1192
01:16:20.771 --> 01:16:24.760
And then you walked up to with a hammer and chisel and you chipped off some beef

1193
01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.880
and it came in this,
uh,

1194
01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.260
this mushroomy sort of a,
Oh my God,
what the fuck was that?
It?

1195
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:39.820
Oh my God.
What?
I'm trying to remember the name of that movie.
But it came,

1196
01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:42.580
it came in a sauce.
That's what you're saying?
Yeah.

1197
01:16:42.610 --> 01:16:45.450
And there was this really having a flashback to my childhood.

1198
01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:50.350
We had this other meal that we always involve bread cause it fills you up.

1199
01:16:50.351 --> 01:16:54.310
And we had like two pieces of bread and was like this mushroom,

1200
01:16:54.311 --> 01:16:57.160
he sorta looking shit that had these little red things in there.

1201
01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.290
That was fucking gross.
That sounds gross.
Isn't that Cube steaks?

1202
01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:07.410
[inaudible] you'd be showing it.

1203
01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.540
You'd be chewing it like three hours later trying to get that tendon down.

1204
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:16.790
No,
I lived,
uh,
we always had food.

1205
01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.790
We know we hit,
we had our ups and downs.
My child was like the economy,

1206
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:27.380
there was booms,
there was busts.
But unlike this country,

1207
01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:31.880
at some point we hit a level ground and then yeah,
we leveled off,
uh,

1208
01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:35.690
around my high school years.
Yeah.
But,
uh,
but it was a good time.

1209
01:17:36.450 --> 01:17:38.920
But what I'm saying is,
you know,
what are you saying?

1210
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:42.340
I'm just saying that we're living like we're still eating QC.

1211
01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:46.570
Yes we are doing that.
But we,
but my point was though,

1212
01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:48.190
you even said,

1213
01:17:48.190 --> 01:17:52.590
why don't we have new fucking table that doesn't have just stains on it.

1214
01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.520
She is stupid trying to have style.

1215
01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:01.060
You're ridiculous.
You always think it has a leopard print.

1216
01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:06.070
Leopard print equals come Nia.
It equals com podcast.

1217
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:11.550
Know that you think when it comes 30 seconds to wrap this up or vintage thing in

1218
01:18:13.421 --> 01:18:16.780
the balls,
I will kick you.
What are you Yoda

1219
01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:22.470
in the balls?
I will kick you.
Sorry.
Hacky impression.

1220
01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.240
I've never even seen that movie.

1221
01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:28.050
I've just seen enough hat comedy about star wars.
Give it so forgettable.

1222
01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.560
Those are the most overrated piece of shit.

1223
01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:34.920
You're going to fear the wrath of the star.
Let me take some,

1224
01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:38.970
I go back and watch sesame street.
Kermit the frog is still funny.

1225
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:43.840
Timelessly timelessly funny if you get the ones when Jim Henson did it.
Yes.
Okay.

1226
01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.650
And that time you ever seen that one with that guy comes in and they're trying

1227
01:18:47.651 --> 01:18:52.240
to teach you about instruments and he comes into the to the music store and he

1228
01:18:52.241 --> 01:18:54.760
goes,
uh,
and he goes,
what can I help you with?
And he goes,

1229
01:18:54.761 --> 01:18:58.600
I'd like to buy and he sounds like a trumpet.
And he goes and he goes,

1230
01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.940
<v 5>pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop.</v>

1231
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.530
<v 3>Right.
So you're thinking in your head,
you're like,
oh that's a fucking trumpet.</v>

1232
01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:11.480
And the dude comes back with like a like a snare drum.

1233
01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:14.180
And he goes,
no,
I didn't ask for a,

1234
01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.340
and then he could make in that they would just have somebody play,

1235
01:19:16.341 --> 01:19:17.420
the tone was teaching you about.

1236
01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:21.320
But the guy went in the story was hilarious at one point he goes,

1237
01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:24.870
oh you're one of those.
Like he kind of gave him a little dig.
There was,

1238
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:28.130
there was something in there for a,

1239
01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:32.720
for adults and it's still funny but you go back and you watch star wars unless

1240
01:19:32.721 --> 01:19:34.070
you just like reliving a childhood,

1241
01:19:34.071 --> 01:19:37.250
which I understand cause I watch NFL highlights and look at football cards.

1242
01:19:37.251 --> 01:19:40.390
I do get that,
but I wasn't a Scifi kid,
but I,

1243
01:19:40.391 --> 01:19:44.060
I go back and I watch those and they suck.

1244
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:46.020
The acting sucks in that.

1245
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:48.680
The fact that they were doing this movie about you know,

1246
01:19:48.681 --> 01:19:52.850
space and the effects at the time it didn't that shit like blow people away.

1247
01:19:52.851 --> 01:19:56.990
I thought that was the thing at for it's time.
People were like,
oh my God,
yes.
No,

1248
01:19:57.090 --> 01:20:01.610
no,
no,
absolutely.
Absolutely.
But it doesn't,
it doesn't hold up.
Hold up,
hold up.

1249
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:06.260
Like it looks kind of cheesy and like be movie.
No,
like it sucks.

1250
01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.180
Just really getting to what?
What were we talking about?

1251
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:12.240
I have to get back to the podcast.
All right.
Oh,

1252
01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:14.640
I thought this was a part of the podcast.
If you don't stop talking,

1253
01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.750
I'm going to walk off my own podcast.
That'll show me

1254
01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:25.230
in protest.
There are listeners out here,
do they know your opinion of,

1255
01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:30.570
you know,
vintage or old items like like a goodwill or a yard sale.

1256
01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.700
Fucking gross that you feel like people are,

1257
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:36.270
even people either died in it or came on it.

1258
01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.660
This is seriously what bill thinks when it comes to like vent.
Like I said,

1259
01:20:39.661 --> 01:20:42.210
vintage goodwill,
yard sale,
someone either.

1260
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:45.690
The thing is we donate stuff to goodwill all the time.

1261
01:20:45.691 --> 01:20:50.510
Have we done any of those things on any of those things that we,
God,

1262
01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:54.150
I can't believe you're saying yes.
No we haven't.
I'm gonna tell you right now,

1263
01:20:54.151 --> 01:20:58.010
there's not a t shirt that I own.
I give a talk.
Oh my gosh.

1264
01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:01.890
You've watched the to stop.
Well,
you need to stop asking the questions.
Well,

1265
01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:05.610
I never did anything grows in like the clothes that I donate to goodwill or

1266
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:06.680
whatever can be prayed.

1267
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:09.150
I listen to you if you're not going to be honest on the podcast.

1268
01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.180
Completely honest.
Look at,
first of all,

1269
01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:15.510
you go down there and then all that God damn estate jewelry with those broaches

1270
01:21:15.511 --> 01:21:18.720
that somebody's dead grandmother's stuff.
So what?

1271
01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:21.330
That's fucking creepy.
So what do you,

1272
01:21:21.331 --> 01:21:26.130
what do you propose people do throw it in the trash?
No,
I don't know.
I'm not,

1273
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:28.140
people can do whatever they want.
I'm just,

1274
01:21:28.141 --> 01:21:32.400
I just don't want you wearing some fucking Jack Klugman old trench coat.

1275
01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:36.780
Oh,
fucking itchy and it's just gross.
It's fucking gross.

1276
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:40.170
We have the money to buy new clothes.
Go by him.

1277
01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:45.100
I like certain vintage clothes.
A lot of people do.
It's a style thing.

1278
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:49.200
All right.
You need to not be such a snob about it.
No,
I don't.

1279
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:53.560
I'm not a snob.
I am not.
As you talk about us not stuffing it up a,

1280
01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:55.170
your snobby about stuff.

1281
01:21:56.330 --> 01:22:00.960
Any stepping it up is having nice shit near not grabbing a leopard fucking come

1282
01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:05.250
table off the goddamn sidewalk.
If you don't stop.
It's nice.

1283
01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:07.860
I like it.
It brings me happiness.

1284
01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.430
And just because you don't like it doesn't mean that I'm not allowed to be
happy.

1285
01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:17.430
All right,
you're warmed me up.
You one.
All right,

1286
01:22:17.431 --> 01:22:20.450
well thank you for stopping by the podcast.
No,
I have to give,

1287
01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:23.070
I have to give because I already,
I talked to Greg,

1288
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:26.310
Greg Fitzsimmons on the special one.
So I've already had guests.
I try to,

1289
01:22:26.311 --> 01:22:29.890
I try to do the guest thing every once in awhile and uh,

1290
01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:33.570
you're a little pouty face is not going to influence me either way.

1291
01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:38.910
Fine.
Um,
do me a favor,
go out and,
uh,
go get me some ice cream or something.

1292
01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:42.750
Can you,
what's that?
What's that shit that the Italians make?

1293
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:47.160
They're that awesome stuff.
Gelato.
I'm not going to get your gelato.
Why?

1294
01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:50.580
Because you kicked me out and you're cold hearted.
What if I asked?
Really Nice.

1295
01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:55.860
It's really nice tasting.
Oh,
I asked nicely.

1296
01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:59.160
So what if I ask nicely?
It's too late.
You're not even asking.

1297
01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:05.380
You haven't yet.
You haven't given me a chance.
I'm leaving.

1298
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:07.990
Yeah,
it's been real.
Listen,

1299
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:12.250
he looked so beautiful right now and I was wondering,

1300
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:16.420
Hey,
you go see.
That's how you get rid of your girl.

1301
01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:20.320
IED was ask her to do you a favor and they storm out of the room.

1302
01:23:20.321 --> 01:23:24.180
So there's another one for you.
Um,
all right,
let's get to underrated.

1303
01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:29.140
Overrated this week.
How far into this fucking part?
31.
Fucking God.
Damn minutes.

1304
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:32.230
Actually speaking of reliving your childhood?
Um,

1305
01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:37.190
I actually every once in awhile go through like I,

1306
01:23:37.191 --> 01:23:42.130
I'm really big on the NFL in the 1970s and I own complete,

1307
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:44.703
uh,

1308
01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:49.000
sets of football cards basically from the late seventies to the early eighties,

1309
01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:54.001
which was basically when I was of the age when I should have been collecting

1310
01:23:54.971 --> 01:23:59.200
football cards all the way to the age where I was almost getting a driver's

1311
01:23:59.201 --> 01:23:59.650
license.

1312
01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:03.790
And it was getting a little weird and my parents were worried that either I was

1313
01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:08.020
a going to live at home for the rest of my life or bring a gun to school.

1314
01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.640
One of the other,
um,
let me get rid of this.

1315
01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:16.300
Close this window here.
Let's get to underrate it.
Overrated for the week here.
Um,

1316
01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:20.580
overrated,
underrated,
overrated.
This persons,

1317
01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:24.940
and this is for all any new listeners out there of my podcast,

1318
01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:28.630
which I doubt I'm going to have for well because evidently iTunes is done with

1319
01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:32.110
me.
And I know there's a lot of people,
if you already subscribed,

1320
01:24:33.010 --> 01:24:37.360
this was the confusion last week with Brad is um,

1321
01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:42.670
if you are already subscribed to my podcast on iTunes for some fucking reason,

1322
01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:45.640
you can still get the podcast each week.

1323
01:24:45.641 --> 01:24:48.460
But if you're a new listener and you search for the podcast,

1324
01:24:48.461 --> 01:24:51.460
it's not there anymore.
If anybody knows,

1325
01:24:52.450 --> 01:24:57.450
any computer savvy people out there knows away that I can guide new listeners to

1326
01:24:58.181 --> 01:25:02.620
find where my podcast is on.
Um,

1327
01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:06.310
iTunes.
I would really appreciate it.
Um,

1328
01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.770
I don't know if it's because you clicked on my website.

1329
01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:13.150
This is all shit my web guy handles so I have no fucking idea.
Please help me up,

1330
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:17.020
won't you please.
All right.
Overrated.
Underrated for the week.
Overrated.

1331
01:25:17.021 --> 01:25:21.430
Lady Gaga and this guy says a or this woman,

1332
01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.293
I don't have no idea.

1333
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.720
Why is it she can dress like a slim Jim Mascot and sing about being a cock tease

1334
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:29.590
and everyone thinks she's brilliant,

1335
01:25:30.190 --> 01:25:34.630
that they listened to her lyrics and stopped telling me she's beautiful on TV

1336
01:25:34.631 --> 01:25:38.770
and in magazines.
I'm sick of being told what to find attractive.

1337
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:42.400
I don't know where they get their standard,
but this bitch is ugly.

1338
01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:46.900
Granted she has a nice ass from what I can tell by the rolling stone cover,

1339
01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:50.860
but I bet it's not even her real one.
A while I'm added,

1340
01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:57.490
Brittany Spears is ugly to where does the media get its taste in women from uh,

1341
01:25:57.790 --> 01:26:01.450
c'mon man.
Back in the day Brittany wasn't hot,
you know,

1342
01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:06.050
before she went crazy and her head and rob that seven 11 or whatever the fuck

1343
01:26:06.051 --> 01:26:10.520
she did.
Um,
you know,
something they might,

1344
01:26:10.521 --> 01:26:14.660
they might actually fix her up a little bit because I thought that,
um,

1345
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:18.860
remember that video she did was she just wore the all red,
uh,

1346
01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:23.180
latex outfit.
She looked like a fucking midget.

1347
01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:26.930
I don't know what it was about that.
Was she not wearing high heels?

1348
01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:31.640
She looked like,
like how she would look like the morning after,

1349
01:26:31.641 --> 01:26:35.390
after you fucked her and you've got to see what she really looked like.
You know,

1350
01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:38.420
you know my theory about the,
the whole,
uh,
you know,

1351
01:26:38.421 --> 01:26:42.530
women with high heel shoes and you're thinking,
oh my God,
look at this girl.

1352
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:45.530
She looks like a supermodel and then you get them home,

1353
01:26:45.531 --> 01:26:48.710
you get them out of the shoes in ft had done doing what you do when they get up

1354
01:26:48.711 --> 01:26:50.390
to go get some water or go to the bathroom.

1355
01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:55.200
You just see this midget and a thong waddle and across the fucking floor.
Um,
she,

1356
01:26:55.201 --> 01:26:56.720
that's what she looked like in that video.

1357
01:26:57.940 --> 01:26:59.930
Oh Jesus sees this is why I don't do fuck this.

1358
01:26:59.931 --> 01:27:04.400
You know something for all you cunts who give me shit about how the podcast is

1359
01:27:04.401 --> 01:27:05.270
late every week.

1360
01:27:05.271 --> 01:27:08.270
This is why I don't do it Sunday night cause I'm burned out from watching

1361
01:27:08.271 --> 01:27:11.870
fucking sports or I flew on an airplane and it's never funny.

1362
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:16.760
This is the only part of the podcast that ends up being funny is me talking

1363
01:27:16.761 --> 01:27:21.320
about how fucking on funny it is.
All right,
let's plow ahead.

1364
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:25.190
Did I tell you guys it was raining out here today and how every Douche bag out

1365
01:27:25.191 --> 01:27:26.960
here,
the second it starts raining in La,

1366
01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:30.050
they start driving like this six inches of snow on the ground.

1367
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:33.770
Evidently it's because it never rains out here.
That all the oil,

1368
01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.630
transmission fluid and all that just sits there in marinades on the street.

1369
01:27:38.631 --> 01:27:40.910
And I guess when it rains,
it makes it extra slippery,

1370
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:45.410
more slippery than it would be in an area where it actually rains.

1371
01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:50.750
But these fucking,
it's still not that fucking slippery.
Um,

1372
01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.840
continuing on,
these are just ideas.
These aren't even jokes.

1373
01:27:53.841 --> 01:27:57.020
I'm just presenting premises that maybe one day I'll be able to make funny.

1374
01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.860
Jesus Christ,
um,
underrated pit bulls.
Uh,

1375
01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:06.880
it fucking burns me up to see all the bad press pitbulls get because some

1376
01:28:07.131 --> 01:28:08.990
horrible luck,
abused one

1377
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:16.640
wet get because some horrible fuck abused one into killing into a killing

1378
01:28:16.641 --> 01:28:21.590
machine yet again that not like that.
I have one and he's a fucking marshmallow.

1379
01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:26.090
You know how since,
uh,
you,
you should know since you have one too.

1380
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:28.010
They're great dogs.
Um,

1381
01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:31.910
I like most dog breeds except for the one that the tiny ones,

1382
01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:35.000
but pitbulls especially make great dogs.

1383
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:39.590
They're the chosen breed of evil fucks,
I admit,
but on their own,

1384
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:40.940
they're nothing dangerous.

1385
01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:44.150
It's funny to see people at Warrior around my dog sometimes,

1386
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:49.460
but it's also kind of sad.
Yeah,
I would go with that.
But also I think that,
um,

1387
01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:55.100
you should get some sort of training before you get either a pit bull,

1388
01:28:55.290 --> 01:28:58.070
a German shepherd,
a a,

1389
01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:02.550
a Doberman Pinscher and even like a Labrador or any of those fucking dogs

1390
01:29:02.551 --> 01:29:05.790
because
I dunno,
they kind of,

1391
01:29:05.791 --> 01:29:09.900
I've learned through taking my dog to one of these dog whisperer people,

1392
01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:12.740
they really feed off you vibes.
And as you noticed,

1393
01:29:12.741 --> 01:29:17.310
I'm sort of an angry amped up guy.
So you know,

1394
01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:19.170
I'm not going to get into the fucking details,

1395
01:29:19.171 --> 01:29:22.380
but I've had to definitely adjust my behavior.
My dog's fine now,

1396
01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:26.460
but it got a little shady there for a second.
Um,
overrated.

1397
01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:30.750
The Disney channel as far as I can tell on passing by this channel.

1398
01:29:30.751 --> 01:29:35.520
Sometimes it's,
it's uh,
oh fuck.
See,
now I'm yawning on the podcast.

1399
01:29:35.521 --> 01:29:39.060
This is all you cons.
Who give me shit every week to do it fucking Sunday night.

1400
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:44.730
Um,
as far as I can tell on passing by this,
this channel,

1401
01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:47.820
um,
it's a preteen porn ring.

1402
01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:52.800
They take these 12 to 14 year old girls and dress them slutty and cover them and

1403
01:29:53.230 --> 01:29:56.490
makeup and then tell them to act twice their age.
Jesus,

1404
01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:01.200
what is with these shows where the kids are fucking 14 and they have problems.

1405
01:30:01.201 --> 01:30:03.240
I didn't have till I was in my twenties.

1406
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:06.870
I was a moron when I was 14 and so was everyone else.

1407
01:30:06.871 --> 01:30:11.070
I didn't do shit with my life.
Um,
then and neither did anyone.

1408
01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:14.940
It's disgusting.
And it's a farce what they do to these girls.

1409
01:30:14.941 --> 01:30:18.990
You make in my Dick Confuse thinking,
I'm looking at a grown woman when I'm not.

1410
01:30:18.991 --> 01:30:23.310
Thank you.
Lead me into 10 teeth.
Uh,

1411
01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:26.040
lead me not into temptation.
Disney channel.

1412
01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:30.810
And You wonder why there are so many pedophiles.
Um,

1413
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:34.950
I don't think Disney's the reason why,
uh,
there's so many pedophiles,

1414
01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:37.890
but I do agree they're subtly making programming for them.

1415
01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:40.500
I don't even know if that's fucking true.
I shouldn't even say that shit.

1416
01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:45.240
But I will say like Calvin Klein,
if I was to guess is,

1417
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:50.160
uh,
100% pro pedophile and,
uh,

1418
01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:53.700
I think that he had a meeting at some point and was like,
you know what,

1419
01:30:54.570 --> 01:30:59.570
there's an entire segment of the human population that is not getting their

1420
01:31:00.571 --> 01:31:05.160
needs taken care of when it comes to advertising and that is the fucking

1421
01:31:05.161 --> 01:31:09.630
pedophiles.
So with that,
let's come up with an ad campaign.

1422
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:15.150
Underrated legendary comedians.
Bill as a comedian yourself,

1423
01:31:15.151 --> 01:31:19.530
I'm sure you have nothing but respect for legends like Carlin prior or Lenny

1424
01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:23.410
Bruce,
Lenny Bruce.
But Carlin gets dismissed so often in favor of,

1425
01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.530
of the hacks they have out there today.
Uh,
for the most part,

1426
01:31:28.531 --> 01:31:32.220
the only thing most people know about him is that he,

1427
01:31:32.490 --> 01:31:34.680
he's the seven dirty words guy.
Really,

1428
01:31:34.681 --> 01:31:39.681
that's how we honor a 50 year career of a comedy legend with obscure bit he did

1429
01:31:39.781 --> 01:31:43.970
in the 70s.
I know there was a supreme court case over it and whatnot,

1430
01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:48.660
but it just bothers me to see how many kids today know all about hack comics.

1431
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.531
Like,

1432
01:31:49.531 --> 01:31:54.300
I'm not naming names and they've never heard of Carlin prior Bruce Hicks or

1433
01:31:54.301 --> 01:31:58.830
their work.
It's nice that there are comedians out there.
Uh,
okay,

1434
01:31:58.831 --> 01:32:02.890
now he's complimenting me so I can't read that shit.
All right.
Uh,
yeah,

1435
01:32:02.891 --> 01:32:07.870
I mean it is what it is.
It's one of those deals where,
you know,

1436
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:12.070
uh,
I think I knew who Carla was when I was a kid because he was,

1437
01:32:12.071 --> 01:32:16.840
he was at the height of his career when I was coming up in the 70s and the 80s.

1438
01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:22.360
Um,
but I had no idea who Lenny Bruce was until I got into stand up comedy,

1439
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:27.520
um,
at,
that's just,
I think that's just part of being young.
It is annoying.

1440
01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:33.380
I actually talked to one of my cousins the other day who's in her early

1441
01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.080
twenties,
and,
uh,

1442
01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:40.770
I mentioned the kids in the hall in both her and her boyfriend had no idea who

1443
01:32:40.931 --> 01:32:44.560
or what that was.
It just,
I don't know.
It is what it is.

1444
01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:48.720
Overrated.
Beautiful women.
Um,

1445
01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:51.490
I don't mean because they're prone to deception.
I mean,

1446
01:32:51.491 --> 01:32:56.491
because some women are two beautiful in this sort of unfuckable kind of way that

1447
01:32:58.401 --> 01:33:02.590
just ruined a woman,
has to be at least a little flood.

1448
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:04.830
So you feel like you can violate her son.

1449
01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:09.460
It's helping with a beautiful woman anyways because you drive yourself crazy

1450
01:33:09.461 --> 01:33:13.330
thinking everyone wants what you have.
It's better to be with someone you learn,

1451
01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:18.190
you learn to find attractive in your own way,
and no one else can see it.

1452
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:22.480
All right?
Uh,
Oh shit.
Okay,
these are,

1453
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:26.530
here's his opinions.
That's a self esteem issue right there on your part.

1454
01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:30.010
You know?
But I do understand,

1455
01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.190
do you know what it is when a girl is just so,
it's not all,

1456
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:37.900
it's a combination of,
of beautiful and just nice.

1457
01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:40.391
They can be met.

1458
01:33:40.391 --> 01:33:44.560
A girl who's just so beautiful and so nice and you're so fucked up and twisted

1459
01:33:44.561 --> 01:33:48.130
that you can't have sex with her.
You just can't.
You're like,

1460
01:33:48.131 --> 01:33:51.100
I don't want to fuck you on what?
To take you to a movie,
you know?

1461
01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.070
And then you meet some skank and you're like,
I'm gonna take you to a movie.

1462
01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:56.200
I want to fucking bend you over the dresser.

1463
01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:58.120
I believe that's a hormone Donna complex.

1464
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:01.990
Am I the only one who feels that way?

1465
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:05.380
I'm trying to think of if somebody on TV that you could relate to that's just

1466
01:34:05.381 --> 01:34:06.214
nice.

1467
01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:13.410
You know who's borderline is that fucking goofy chick who cooks Rachel Ray.

1468
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.210
She's borderline.
So sort of like nice and innocent that you couldn't,

1469
01:34:19.211 --> 01:34:23.340
but it's literally that quality that just makes you want to fucking,
you know,

1470
01:34:25.530 --> 01:34:29.260
I dunno,
I get involved in it.

1471
01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:35.290
Oh Gee,
here's,
let's continue underrated having a fun job.

1472
01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:40.090
This one is aimed at you,
Bill.
You like to bitch about how uh,

1473
01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:43.690
midgets insert midgets more on stones,
et Cetera.

1474
01:34:44.230 --> 01:34:48.880
Don't want to work often enough.
Can I clarify that stoner thing?

1475
01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:51.520
I made fun of a specific person.

1476
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:57.270
A friend of mine who smokes way too much weed and every stone are out there.

1477
01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:00.780
Fucking sent me these emails.
We mean,
what do you got against?

1478
01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.080
Or I guess cause I imitate you like that,
but what the fuck?

1479
01:35:03.081 --> 01:35:04.550
That's the standard voice for you.

1480
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.420
You find me a pot movie where someone doesn't talk like that and I'll do a

1481
01:35:08.421 --> 01:35:10.220
better impression.
But that's what everybody says.

1482
01:35:10.221 --> 01:35:13.670
How come you always cut me down,
bud hedge me in.
I'm not,

1483
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:18.260
I'm coming down on my fucking douchebag friend who all he's done is smoked weed

1484
01:35:18.650 --> 01:35:22.370
and it hasn't been a good thing for him.
His quote,

1485
01:35:22.371 --> 01:35:27.050
I like to smoke weed because it turns my life into a movie.
All right,

1486
01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:29.900
you have a problem at that point.

1487
01:35:29.901 --> 01:35:32.480
Now all you fucks who liked to smoke weed and listen to this shit?

1488
01:35:32.481 --> 01:35:37.010
I don't give a fuck.
I drink.
Wouldn't that be hypocritical?

1489
01:35:38.290 --> 01:35:42.020
And speaking of which,
I'm on the wagon again,
as of today,

1490
01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:46.040
I did not drink today.
Everybody and a,

1491
01:35:46.041 --> 01:35:50.060
I'm going to try and see if I can make it all the way to the rose bowl before I

1492
01:35:50.061 --> 01:35:53.420
fall off the fucking work.
And again,
it's yawning once again.

1493
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:56.420
No,
I don't know what it is.
I um,

1494
01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:02.660
I just been eating the wrong foods and uh,

1495
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.950
I dunno.

1496
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:07.920
And every night I've just been doing sets and I've had two Heinekens and next

1497
01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:12.740
scene.
Oh,
I have this distended white belly and I'm not liking it.
You know,

1498
01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.780
I was just at a party and I wasn't drinking,

1499
01:36:14.781 --> 01:36:18.710
but I was leaning up against the counter and normally it would be digging into

1500
01:36:18.711 --> 01:36:23.450
my back.
But I had a nice,
a nice level of padding,
you know,

1501
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:27.800
from fucking,
you don't really screwed me up was when I went to buffalo,

1502
01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:33.130
the goddamn buffalo wings was so good there that I have gone on a buffalo wing

1503
01:36:33.650 --> 01:36:38.150
kick and I found a couple of places out here that have really good buffalo
wings.

1504
01:36:38.151 --> 01:36:42.710
And um,
actually you don't want to hear the story.
This is what happened.

1505
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:45.200
Um,

1506
01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:50.200
I woke up on Saturday and I'm getting another ca or Saturday as they say in

1507
01:36:51.171 --> 01:36:52.004
Boston,

1508
01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:56.600
in Boston when the real hardcore Boston guys,

1509
01:36:57.830 --> 01:37:01.910
you know,
I saw him on Saturday.
You just sort of open your mouth

1510
01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:06.410
sachet Thursday,

1511
01:37:06.411 --> 01:37:09.920
Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday.

1512
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:16.850
Say,
um,
I woke up and I'm thinking,
all right,

1513
01:37:16.851 --> 01:37:21.470
college football,
Auburn,
verse Arkansas.

1514
01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:26.630
Lsu was plain McNeese state.
They're given 39 and a half points,

1515
01:37:26.631 --> 01:37:28.460
so they're going to fucking cover the spread.

1516
01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:32.360
Who else was playing Georgia?
Was playing,

1517
01:37:32.361 --> 01:37:36.620
Vanderbilt was all fucking site and we're laying in bed.

1518
01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:40.400
My beautiful girl wakes up and she said,
uh,

1519
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:44.840
and she claimed the fucking TV.
It's like I'm watching TV.

1520
01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:50.270
So I immediately got up,
acted like I was going to the bathroom,
and I walked out,

1521
01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:57.490
sat in the living room,
and I turned on the fucking and I started watching,

1522
01:37:57.870 --> 01:38:00.390
uh,
who the fuck was blessed or watching the Auburn Arkansas game,

1523
01:38:00.391 --> 01:38:03.380
which was fucking ridiculous.
You know,

1524
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:07.680
Arkansas end up scoring like 40 something points and they still lost by 20.

1525
01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:09.000
It was absolutely insane.

1526
01:38:09.930 --> 01:38:14.130
<v 6>And so she's like,
Hey,
I said,
it's gonna Watch TV.</v>

1527
01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:16.280
[inaudible]

1528
01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.820
<v 3>right?
So I tried to bill O'Reilly,
I tried to do that and it just didn't work.</v>

1529
01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:22.430
Didn't work.
All right.
She had a rough week.

1530
01:38:22.431 --> 01:38:26.150
She wanted to watch your stupid reality shows.
So I said,
fine.

1531
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:31.910
I said,
fine.
All right.
And uh,
I,

1532
01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:34.820
I grabbed my stereo,
one of my stereo speakers was busted.

1533
01:38:34.821 --> 01:38:38.510
So I took it down to this fucking local guy.
Sky's out of his God damn mind.

1534
01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:43.490
He actually repairs shit.
So I already loved the guy.
So I go down there,

1535
01:38:43.491 --> 01:38:44.810
I get that taken care of.

1536
01:38:46.770 --> 01:38:51.040
I know I,
what else did I do?
I went out,
I just,

1537
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:53.730
I just fixed some shit.
I went out and I bought some stuff.

1538
01:38:53.731 --> 01:38:56.910
I fixed some shit around the apartment and I let her watch the shit.

1539
01:38:57.090 --> 01:38:59.190
And at one point I was picking up dry cleaning.

1540
01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:03.690
I was doing all these God damn chores and I just saw this fucking,
uh,

1541
01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:08.290
this bar and I knew they had wings and I was literally going to go in to get dry

1542
01:39:08.291 --> 01:39:09.124
cleaning.

1543
01:39:09.130 --> 01:39:14.130
I was parked in the dry cleaner parking lot and I look across the fucking way

1544
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:17.820
and there's a bar with wings and I get out like,
uh,

1545
01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:19.560
like the Manchurian candidate.

1546
01:39:19.561 --> 01:39:24.561
Like they just turned on my chip and I walked across the street and the bar and

1547
01:39:25.211 --> 01:39:28.060
next thing you know,
I'm sitting there,
I've got a water,

1548
01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.860
they got a Boddingtons and I got a fucking order of a dozen wings and I'm

1549
01:39:32.861 --> 01:39:36.280
tearing these fucking things down.
Like I'm in a wings Eaton contest.

1550
01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:41.650
Here I am consuming 800 fucking calories or whatever the hell it was.

1551
01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:44.680
1200 goddamn calories for no fucking reason.

1552
01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:48.440
Cause I don't want to bother my girl because she's watching.

1553
01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:52.590
She's watching a fucking shows.
So I do all his shit.

1554
01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:55.290
I ended up stumbling out of there and then I finally,
uh,

1555
01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.520
go over to get the God damn dry cleaning
and I come back,

1556
01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:05.410
right.
And during that time a buddy of mine text me said,
Hey,

1557
01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.470
I'm in la.
Are you watching the Ohio state game?
I said,
well,

1558
01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.790
it's going to be on TV.
Why don't you come by?
I figured,

1559
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.340
cause my girls watched three hours of fun.
I have to whisper this Parker,

1560
01:40:14.341 --> 01:40:15.174
she's going to get mad.

1561
01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.810
I figured because she watched three hours of fucking TV that I could actually

1562
01:40:18.811 --> 01:40:23.740
have a friend over,
but like douche rather than saying,
hey,

1563
01:40:23.770 --> 01:40:25.630
you know,
you watch TV for three hours.

1564
01:40:25.631 --> 01:40:28.620
So I'm going to have a buddy of mine over here now and we're going to watch the

1565
01:40:28.621 --> 01:40:32.390
I,
hi,
hi.
Oh State Wisconsin game.

1566
01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:36.530
I actually gave her the benefit of the,

1567
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:40.470
of the doubt that she was going to be courteous and I said,
hey,

1568
01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:44.620
a friend of mine's coming over to watch your house state game.
You know,

1569
01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.560
we can either watch it here or would you rather us watch it out at a bar?

1570
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:52.790
You know,
cause I thought she was going to be like,

1571
01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:57.160
well know I hogged the TV for three hours.
You know,

1572
01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:02.920
why don't you watch it here and I'll leave you guys alone.
She didn't.
She goes,

1573
01:41:02.921 --> 01:41:07.390
yeah,
go watch it as sports bar.
So now I was pissed.

1574
01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:12.580
You know like when you have like one slice of pizza left and you offer it to

1575
01:41:12.581 --> 01:41:13.271
somebody going,
hey,

1576
01:41:13.271 --> 01:41:16.270
do you want this slice of pizza even though you want it cause you're thinking

1577
01:41:16.271 --> 01:41:18.910
they're going to go,
no,
no.
That's okay because that's what you would say.

1578
01:41:18.911 --> 01:41:21.370
And you go,
hey,
would you like to slice of pizza?
And they go,
actually I would.

1579
01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:22.950
And then they start eating.

1580
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.450
Then you sit in there for your fucking mad at them when you should be mad at

1581
01:41:25.451 --> 01:41:27.850
yourself like an asshole.

1582
01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:33.130
I got mad at her right and we had time to do a quick workout.

1583
01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:36.070
I just made some fucking wings and she wanted to go on a hike.

1584
01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:39.550
So we start to go on this hike and I just start going on to the,

1585
01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:44.610
on this rant about this stupid whore TV shows that she fucking walked watches

1586
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:48.970
and we got about a third into the hike in,

1587
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:52.900
she was like a wide receiver,
just breaking off her fucking pattern.

1588
01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:55.610
She just made a right down.
We were supposed to be walking straight.
She,

1589
01:41:55.611 --> 01:41:56.444
she broke off,

1590
01:41:56.510 --> 01:42:00.520
made a right and started walking down a side street and I didn't even give a

1591
01:42:00.521 --> 01:42:05.410
fuck.
And I continued my own way and we both were hiking um,

1592
01:42:05.890 --> 01:42:08.410
separately,
you know,

1593
01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:11.320
broke off the whole fucking thing.

1594
01:42:11.321 --> 01:42:16.321
We ended up getting this huge goddamn argument before my friend came over and

1595
01:42:16.361 --> 01:42:18.010
then there was that whole thing like a fuck.

1596
01:42:18.011 --> 01:42:20.140
Now I've got to patch it up before he comes over.

1597
01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.110
So he doesn't feel the tension that we've been fucking arguing.

1598
01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:28.240
And not only we arguing,
we're arguing about fucking him coming over.

1599
01:42:31.450 --> 01:42:36.340
So I smoothed it over.
She came back,
I said,
look,
I fucking overreacted,
Yadda,

1600
01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.430
Yadda.
Yet I didn't know that I even have a fucking ending.
I don't give a fuck.

1601
01:42:39.431 --> 01:42:41.170
I'm just going to keep saying it's because it's Sunday.

1602
01:42:41.710 --> 01:42:45.760
I'm going to read one more fucking email and I'm just going to tap out of this

1603
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:48.340
awful fucking podcast.
What was the point of that?

1604
01:42:49.210 --> 01:42:51.940
Can anybody even remember where the fuck was I even go,

1605
01:42:51.941 --> 01:42:56.941
I've started talking about about eaten wings and being out of shape and then the

1606
01:42:57.251 --> 01:43:00.580
end of it,
I told a fucking half ass story about getting into an argument.

1607
01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.200
Now he can't even sign into my fucking this,
this,

1608
01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:09.370
this podcast is literally just unraveling,
unraveling.

1609
01:43:09.970 --> 01:43:14.650
I don't even drink today.
The fuck is my podcast.

1610
01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:17.290
Here's a youtube video of the week.
If you guys are like,

1611
01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:20.560
if you play drums and you want to see a guy who actually can kind of make his

1612
01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:24.880
drums and the way he plays sounded like John Bonham's guys does a great job.

1613
01:43:24.881 --> 01:43:27.340
Look up John Bonam swing feel,

1614
01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:31.360
feel f e e l and uh,

1615
01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:35.940
and tell me the guy playing drums does not look like a,
was it ogre?

1616
01:43:36.130 --> 01:43:39.100
What was the name of the,
the the fucking psycho in revenge of the nerds.

1617
01:43:39.101 --> 01:43:43.510
Tell me that's not him.
Um,
but hang on a second.

1618
01:43:43.710 --> 01:43:47.110
I got gotta get back here because I wanted to read something about douchebag

1619
01:43:47.150 --> 01:43:49.660
sports fans and then I'm going to end the podcast for this week.

1620
01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:51.440
This one really sucked,

1621
01:43:51.441 --> 01:43:54.860
but I got him at the last couple of weeks were pretty good.
But this one,

1622
01:43:56.210 --> 01:43:59.900
this one was not good in the annals of Bill Burke podcast.

1623
01:43:59.901 --> 01:44:04.590
You know this one will not make it to repeat if the,

1624
01:44:04.710 --> 01:44:08.300
if this ever goes into syndication,
somebody sent me a great fucking email.

1625
01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:14.660
Oh I know why.
Cause I had it on this page
about sports fans.
Right?

1626
01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:16.161
I'll tell you what it is.

1627
01:44:16.161 --> 01:44:20.540
I'm searching for this fucking thing that I can't find anymore.
God Damn can't.

1628
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:24.560
Um,
here we go.

1629
01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:29.690
Here's some youtube videos out called reason to kill.

1630
01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:33.860
All of these are on the Mlm podcast cause some of these are actually from

1631
01:44:33.861 --> 01:44:38.060
break.com and a.
So rather than have to jump around websites,

1632
01:44:38.061 --> 01:44:42.950
if you want to watch all these,
um,
out cold reason to kill,
uh,

1633
01:44:42.951 --> 01:44:46.430
this is like inexplicably this fucking video,
this a singer,

1634
01:44:46.431 --> 01:44:47.690
he's on the ground in,

1635
01:44:47.691 --> 01:44:50.840
there's a fan doing something to him that I just can't believe,

1636
01:44:51.170 --> 01:44:55.130
and they proceed to have the worst fist fight in the history of,

1637
01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:58.190
of fist fights.
Uh,

1638
01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.520
look up Kendall on sharecropping field trip

1639
01:45:04.730 --> 01:45:09.730
one slap Kao at gas station that's actually from break.com and then look up

1640
01:45:11.751 --> 01:45:14.090
massive knockout.
Those things that kind of violent.

1641
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:18.230
What the fuck did I do with the goddamn email?
This kid sent me,

1642
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:22.640
this guy sent me a great email about as much as people hate the patriots,

1643
01:45:22.641 --> 01:45:25.580
they hate the cowboys more.
So we actually kind of,

1644
01:45:27.210 --> 01:45:30.770
I give up.
You know what I just fucking give up on this God damn podcast.

1645
01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:34.580
All right,
here's where I'm going to be this week.
All right,
you fucking pricks.

1646
01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:39.410
I'm going to be at,
uh,
the Wilbur Theater in Boston,

1647
01:45:39.411 --> 01:45:42.830
Massachusetts.
Uh,
on Wednesday of this week,

1648
01:45:42.831 --> 01:45:45.890
this is a fundraiser for my brothers,
uh,
campaign.

1649
01:45:46.190 --> 01:45:50.840
He's running for a state Senate in Massachusetts,

1650
01:45:50.841 --> 01:45:55.100
not to be in the United States Senate representing Massachusetts,

1651
01:45:55.101 --> 01:45:59.720
but I guess they have a different kind of senator just in Massachusetts.

1652
01:45:59.721 --> 01:46:00.710
I'm too fucking dumb.

1653
01:46:00.711 --> 01:46:03.530
So whatever I'm going to do at a comedy show at the Wilbur Theater,

1654
01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:05.660
it's my brand new hour of material.

1655
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:10.990
All proceeds will go to my brother's campaign to try to help him get elected.

1656
01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:15.530
I'm so come on down,
even if you're not in his district,

1657
01:46:15.531 --> 01:46:20.470
which I don't even know what the fuck it is.
Uh,
come on down and,
uh,

1658
01:46:20.710 --> 01:46:25.040
maybe tell,
be telling a lot of family stories
and uh,

1659
01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:26.510
trying to walk that line

1660
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:33.290
so I don't offend too many people because it is kind of a political thing.
Uh,

1661
01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:34.490
and later on this week,

1662
01:46:34.491 --> 01:46:39.320
I will be at the pantageous theater in,
uh,

1663
01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:44.240
Minneapolis,
Minnesota on October 22nd,
and the,
a wonderful,

1664
01:46:44.241 --> 01:46:48.800
talented teen idols sensation from the opiate.
Anthony showed Joe de Rosa.

1665
01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:50.040
We'll be opening for me.

1666
01:46:50.850 --> 01:46:54.090
And then the following day we're going to be at the Vic Theater in Chicago,

1667
01:46:54.091 --> 01:46:57.000
Illinois.
October 23rd,
um,

1668
01:46:57.001 --> 01:47:01.350
that show from what I've heard is actually sold out.
Um,

1669
01:47:01.410 --> 01:47:04.170
and I think the one in Minneapolis is coming damn close.

1670
01:47:04.171 --> 01:47:08.580
So I'm going to thank you guys for the ridiculous amount of support that you've

1671
01:47:08.581 --> 01:47:13.410
given me and I'm going to give you a fucking hell of a show when you come down

1672
01:47:13.411 --> 01:47:16.950
there.
And uh,
I think that's it.
I think that's it for the podcast this week.

1673
01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:21.450
It is,
was one of the lamest ones I think I've ever done.
Let me,

1674
01:47:21.451 --> 01:47:24.780
let me see if I can just somehow pull out of it.

1675
01:47:26.610 --> 01:47:31.500
Do I got anything?
This thing this guy sent me.
Robots are stealing jobs.

1676
01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:36.480
Robots are stealing American jobs according to MIT economist.

1677
01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:41.820
Uh,
forget the recession.
Immigration and the mortgage industry collapse.

1678
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:45.570
Well,
okay.
Why?
How can you forget all of those?
Okay.

1679
01:47:45.571 --> 01:47:47.250
This is already a ridiculous article,

1680
01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:50.730
but I think there was a point to be made here when it comes to the loss of

1681
01:47:50.731 --> 01:47:54.540
American jobs.
Robots are to blame.
And you know what's hilarious?

1682
01:47:54.541 --> 01:47:59.541
They got a picture of a robot with fucking arms folding a goddamn sweater.

1683
01:48:01.210 --> 01:48:03.420
Um,
that's the conclusion of a con economist.

1684
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.940
Do you understand in the future that when you have a robot,

1685
01:48:05.941 --> 01:48:10.500
not only can it fold the sweaters at the gap,
it can also be security.
You know,

1686
01:48:10.501 --> 01:48:14.910
didn't you guys see robocop?
Can't you see what the fuck is gonna Happen?

1687
01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:20.130
All you morons who are using these automated checkout machines just helping

1688
01:48:20.131 --> 01:48:21.180
these fucking guys.

1689
01:48:22.530 --> 01:48:27.530
Do you think these corporations are beyond leading you to a shallow mass grave

1690
01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:29.880
when they don't need you anymore?

1691
01:48:30.330 --> 01:48:35.330
When they figure out how to make a robot that can actually work for free and,

1692
01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:39.180
and you can actually fuck it in.
It feels like a human being.

1693
01:48:39.181 --> 01:48:42.560
When those two things come together,
uh,

1694
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:46.230
like when they drove that golden spike in,
when they made the railroads connect,

1695
01:48:46.231 --> 01:48:50.430
I'm telling you that's the end of it for you and for me.

1696
01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:55.290
Huh?
Be honest with yourself.
Are you inventing anything?

1697
01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:58.980
What do you do for a living?
Do you think you're not replaceable?

1698
01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:03.150
They could.
You don't think they could have a robot.

1699
01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:07.470
They just fucking upload every goddamn routine of all time and you just,

1700
01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:12.090
you can just have like a a computer screen topics,

1701
01:49:12.091 --> 01:49:16.620
political,
absurd hacky,
what you know,

1702
01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:21.570
women,
men and women,
dogs and cats,
all that type of shit.

1703
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:26.610
Or just have it to a Richard Pryor bit and have it move around like Richard and

1704
01:49:26.611 --> 01:49:30.570
they have a red fucking shirt on like that.
Great.
Specially did.

1705
01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.530
We're all fucking replaceable.
All right,

1706
01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:36.690
why are you going to help him out anyways?

1707
01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:40.170
They say that's the conclusion of economist who studied Labor Statistics and

1708
01:49:40.171 --> 01:49:45.171
increasing job peril polarization or growing disparity in the pay among low and

1709
01:49:45.661 --> 01:49:48.220
high skill,
low and skilled jobs.

1710
01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:52.600
A handful of studies from the spring and summer have picked up steam in recent

1711
01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:56.830
weeks and they raised some interesting questions about the economy in the days

1712
01:49:56.831 --> 01:50:01.060
leading up to election day.
By the way,
how great have I become reading out loud?

1713
01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:03.490
This is fucking amazing.
Now that I've said it,

1714
01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:05.350
let's see if I'm in my head and I fuck up.

1715
01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:10.840
Manufacturing is still strong in this country.
It's just that robots,

1716
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:14.590
not humans are the ones manning the factories.

1717
01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:20.080
If automation is the future of manufacturing and medicine in other fields,

1718
01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:23.920
less educated Americans could be left in the dust.

1719
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:27.430
I gotta be honest with you.
I don't write the way they just worded that.

1720
01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:30.610
I don't know where I stand on that.
Um,

1721
01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:36.610
I'm definitely think the world is overpopulated.
See this,
this,

1722
01:50:36.611 --> 01:50:38.770
this enters like that.
Fucking Hitler Shit.

1723
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:41.800
You're gonna have to start deciding who gets the live and who doesn't.

1724
01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:46.990
A Jesus.
Oh Geez.
So I dunno.

1725
01:50:48.250 --> 01:50:50.380
I actually took my fucking speakers,
right?

1726
01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:53.080
I found this guy down the goddamn street.
Somehow.

1727
01:50:53.081 --> 01:50:56.020
I'm going to stretch this into an hour.
I've got another two minutes.

1728
01:50:56.021 --> 01:50:59.800
I found this guy down the street
who I had,
you know,

1729
01:50:59.830 --> 01:51:03.280
you know the thing that you stick your iPod on and it's got the speakers and

1730
01:51:03.281 --> 01:51:07.000
that type of shit.
When I think broke one day and it just doesn't work.

1731
01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:10.870
So Nia is just like,
well,
we'll just throw it out.
And I go,
no,
I want to get it.

1732
01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:13.200
I want to get fixed.
And she's like,
oh,

1733
01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:16.140
she literally gets like upset and I'm like,

1734
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:20.380
there's probably just a fucking wire or something.

1735
01:51:20.410 --> 01:51:24.340
I just don't understand electronics.
He could just open it up,
you could fix it,

1736
01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:27.940
and I find this fucking guy,

1737
01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:33.540
the first thing I did was had these old speakers that I hook up to my laptop and

1738
01:51:33.581 --> 01:51:35.920
so I go,
all right,
I don't give a fuck about these.

1739
01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:37.120
I'm going to take them down to this guy.

1740
01:51:37.250 --> 01:51:41.020
Am I going to figure out if this guy is any good or anything and the guy fixes

1741
01:51:41.021 --> 01:51:42.520
them,
they fucking phenomenal.

1742
01:51:43.090 --> 01:51:47.980
So what I'm doing is I'm gradually bringing this guy more expensive shit.

1743
01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:50.440
All right.
Now that's what I suggest.

1744
01:51:50.441 --> 01:51:52.840
When you find a guy who says he's going to repair your shit,

1745
01:51:52.841 --> 01:51:57.170
start with something you don't give a fuck about like a clock radio.
All right?

1746
01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:02.350
Let them repair it.
And if it works,
you're all fucking good,
right?

1747
01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:06.160
Because I'm all about this shit by the way.
He's,
when something breaks,

1748
01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:11.340
you go out and you get it fixed because evidently there is a pile of shit in the

1749
01:52:12.041 --> 01:52:13.360
middle of the Pacific Ocean.

1750
01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:18.540
One and a half times the size of Texas in two miles deep of all the shit that we

1751
01:52:19.121 --> 01:52:21.820
just fucking throw out.
All right.

1752
01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:26.470
And then the sun breaks down the plastic as much as it can,
right?

1753
01:52:26.610 --> 01:52:31.360
And it becomes these little cubes in birds eat it and fucking fishing it.

1754
01:52:31.361 --> 01:52:32.300
And then you go down and eat,

1755
01:52:32.490 --> 01:52:34.690
order some Sushi and you think you're eating healthy.

1756
01:52:34.691 --> 01:52:37.030
You're actually eating year old fucking roller blades.

1757
01:52:39.070 --> 01:52:42.670
So I'm all about fixing this shit.
So this fucking maniac,

1758
01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:47.990
he's like really like eccentric.
His places an absolute fucking mess.

1759
01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:53.170
And he was talking about,
I don't want to give away his idea here,
but I'm kind,

1760
01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:58.400
kinda going to talk cause he was talking about how all recorded music since the

1761
01:52:58.611 --> 01:53:02.990
beginning of history is a fucking lie.
I'm like what?
What are you talking?

1762
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:06.020
These are the kinds of conversations you have when you go into a fucking mom and

1763
01:53:06.021 --> 01:53:06.950
pop kind of place.

1764
01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:12.740
You know it isn't like Coes Nax can I help complains on salary therapy.

1765
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:15.740
We can't kids there anything else I can help you with.
This guy isn't like that.

1766
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:20.890
He's telling me this shit and he basically broke it down saying that he works

1767
01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:26.750
Monday through Saturday fixing electronics shit.

1768
01:53:26.930 --> 01:53:29.480
And on Sunday he goes on the Internet

1769
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:35.990
and he looks up the heights of,
of like Jimi Hendrix,

1770
01:53:36.230 --> 01:53:40.370
all the beetles and he tries to learn how tall they are so he can figure out

1771
01:53:40.371 --> 01:53:44.360
where to position his speakers.
And I'm like,

1772
01:53:44.361 --> 01:53:47.600
what the fuck are you talking about?
He goes,
look,
he goes Simon and Garfunkel,

1773
01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:52.460
he's like Garfunkel was five 11 Paul Simon's like five seven and a half,

1774
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:56.000
whatever for you,
you'd like new,
their exact heights.
He goes,

1775
01:53:57.590 --> 01:54:01.460
but when they do the mix they mix them like do the exact same height.

1776
01:54:01.730 --> 01:54:06.730
So He's trying to tell me that you've got to put one speaker at five foot 10 or

1777
01:54:06.921 --> 01:54:11.670
11 and the other at five foot seven and a half to really sat.

1778
01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:15.860
Hear what it sounds like if they were actually in the room singing to you.

1779
01:54:16.630 --> 01:54:20.240
And when you really think about acoustics,
that actually fucking makes sense.

1780
01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:23.330
I know a lot of you are going like,
what the fuck?
But I'm telling you,

1781
01:54:23.331 --> 01:54:27.470
this guy broke it down where it made sense because think about it like if I was

1782
01:54:27.810 --> 01:54:31.610
standing,
if I was sitting down,
if your ears were good enough,

1783
01:54:31.730 --> 01:54:35.510
if you heard a recording of me sitting down or if you stay sitting in a room

1784
01:54:35.511 --> 01:54:36.410
with your eyes closed,

1785
01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:41.680
you could tell if I was sitting down or standing up in the room because you

1786
01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:44.120
could because of the way the sound was hitting you.

1787
01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:47.090
But when I guess when they record the shit,
they level everything out.

1788
01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:51.320
Like the drums don't sound like they were behind the piano player or off to the

1789
01:54:51.321 --> 01:54:53.500
left.
I guess everything sounds,
you know what?

1790
01:54:53.501 --> 01:54:58.040
I'm too stupid to explain this shit.
All I know was the guy in front of me.

1791
01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:01.070
He fixed this guy so he doesn't just fix your speaker.

1792
01:55:01.250 --> 01:55:05.180
He asked you if he wants you to hook it up and do it the right way.

1793
01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:09.500
Same thing with like amps and guitars and I don't have the balls to bring in my

1794
01:55:09.501 --> 01:55:11.360
amplifier.
I'm trying to see if this guy is true.

1795
01:55:11.361 --> 01:55:15.740
But he basically played steely Dan out of one of this guys speakers and it

1796
01:55:15.741 --> 01:55:20.690
sounded like two speakers.
The sound was fucking unbelievable.
So,
uh,
once again,

1797
01:55:20.691 --> 01:55:23.120
I don't know what the point of my fucking story was there.

1798
01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:27.910
Other than fuck robots fucked.

1799
01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:29.000
Let me wrap this whole thing up.

1800
01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:33.410
Fuck by an old furniture that has leopard print on it cause it's got TJ's on it.

1801
01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:36.320
Guaran fucking teed and if something breaks down,

1802
01:55:36.321 --> 01:55:40.070
why don't you try and get it fixed?
Speaking of which,
the blinds in my apartment,

1803
01:55:40.071 --> 01:55:44.160
my dog attacked him,
like 90 of them are okay,

1804
01:55:44.161 --> 01:55:48.540
but I need some new slots.
Can anybody tell me where the fuck to buy those?

1805
01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:50.070
Because I want to repair them.
Once again,

1806
01:55:50.670 --> 01:55:54.900
Nia wants me to throw out the fucking things and just go buy some brand new ones

1807
01:55:54.901 --> 01:55:59.720
and it's like,
well what about the,
where the fuck did the,

1808
01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:04.190
do my other blinds go?
Where do we,
where the fuck did those go?

1809
01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:09.110
That'd be a great documentary.
He just throw something out.

1810
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:14.050
You'll put a microchip on it and you just follow it.
You know,

1811
01:56:14.110 --> 01:56:18.320
if he gets somehow find the thing that ended up in the ocean,

1812
01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:19.960
that a fucking,
uh,

1813
01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:24.310
a p a tuna inhaled and then go to the restaurant

1814
01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:29.200
and just blow sad.
If we wouldn't fucking work,
would it,

1815
01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:32.710
you know what this podcast is like?

1816
01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:37.150
There's a bad thing that comedians do when they're not getting laughs and they

1817
01:56:37.151 --> 01:56:40.420
just think the next joke's going to get him a fucking laugh.
And they,

1818
01:56:40.421 --> 01:56:43.200
and they just stay on stage and they stand.

1819
01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:47.510
I should have tapped out at 50 minutes and just,
and just been like,

1820
01:56:47.511 --> 01:56:52.511
I've proven my point that when I do podcast on Sunday night is nice as it is,

1821
01:56:52.781 --> 01:56:54.880
that when you come in on a fucking Monday,

1822
01:56:56.350 --> 01:56:59.020
that there's already a podcast waiting for you at work.

1823
01:56:59.670 --> 01:57:01.950
The little fucking nice little ribbon tied around it.

1824
01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:05.650
It's just not as good is when I do them after I have a good night's sleep,

1825
01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:09.640
you know?
So,
uh,
there you go.

1826
01:57:09.850 --> 01:57:13.240
Overrated bill doing podcasts.

1827
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:15.880
The Monday morning podcast on a fucking Sunday night.

1828
01:57:16.090 --> 01:57:20.110
I'm not doing this shit anymore.
All right.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1829
01:57:20.410 --> 01:57:22.720
If you want me to do it,
I don't give a shit.
All right.
That's it.

1830
01:57:22.721 --> 01:57:26.920
I gave you an hour and five minutes.
None of a hundred percent mediocrity.

1831
01:57:26.921 --> 01:57:30.770
I started off.
All right.
But I think in general,

1832
01:57:30.771 --> 01:57:35.660
this one sucked a big bag of elk dick,
as they say in comedy business.

1833
01:57:35.690 --> 01:57:40.150
All right.
That's it.
That's the part.
That's the podcast for this week.
And,
uh,

1834
01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:44.060
I'll talk to you next week on Monday morning and you can fucking wait for their

1835
01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:45.350
can face.
Okay.

1836
01:58:00.630 --> 01:58:00.630
