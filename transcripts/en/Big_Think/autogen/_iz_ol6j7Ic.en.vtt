they wouldn't even know I mean it just
so I think the vast majority of people

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449
so I think the vast majority of people
 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.170
so I think the vast majority of people
even educated people don't have a sense

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180
even educated people don't have a sense
 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.530

them used to target at them in positive
 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.910
them used to target at them in positive
and negative ways I think there's an

and negative ways I think there's an
 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.560
and negative ways I think there's an
awareness of spyware and you know

want it people have no awareness of and
 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.280
want it people have no awareness of and
it's going to I think it's going to take

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290
it's going to I think it's going to take
 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.480
it's going to I think it's going to take
a 911 type of event for privacy to

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490
a 911 type of event for privacy to
 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.010
a 911 type of event for privacy to
really shake people that you know that

they gotta pay attention to this and
then and only then I think will they

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510
then and only then I think will they
 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.420
then and only then I think will they
take responsibility that the terrorism

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430
take responsibility that the terrorism
 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.430
