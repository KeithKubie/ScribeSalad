&gt;&gt; Hi my name is Manoj Agarwal with the Royal
Bank of Scotland.

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.690
The question that's been asked is can India
be a global superpower?

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.049
My answer to that is India is already a global
superpower.

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.320
We are a nuclear superpower, and that program
has been cemented with

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.820
other superpowers like the United States and
is going ahead.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.640
We are an economic superpower.
We are talking about [INAUDIBLE] which are

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.470
potentially in excess of
China in the foreseeable future.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.540
We talking about a human capital race, which
India is currently

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.410
leading.
I think it is the largest democracy in the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.750
world today.
So there are, of course, a few aspects in

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.020
terms of infrastructure, in
terms of health care, in terms of education

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.460
that we need to sort out.
But I'm absolutely confident that if you were

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.230
to sort of be this
question in ten years' time it would be absolutely

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.149
nobody who would
actually be even asking this question, really.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.460
Thanks.
