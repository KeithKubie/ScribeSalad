NICK PELLY: Hi, I'm Nick Pelly.

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.070
I'm a Software
Engineer and Technical

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.275
Lead working in Android
Auto and Google Maps.

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:12.900
GABRIEL PEAL: I'm
Gabriel Peal, and I'm

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.985
a Software Engineer on
the Android Auto team.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:16.110
ANDY BRENNER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.818
I'm Andy Brenner.

00:00:16.818 --> 00:00:18.926
I'm the Product Manager
of Android Auto.

00:00:18.926 --> 00:00:20.800
And we're really happy
to have you here today

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.210
to talk a lot about
the technical details

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.410
and how you, as
developers, can start

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.260
to program your app
for Android Auto.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.460
I've always been
completely passionate

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.340
about cars and gadgets.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.990
And so much so about
a year and a half

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.140
ago, I ripped my
stereo out of my car

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.200
and I put a Nexus
7 tablet in it.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.190
And this was before
I got to Google.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.895
I put a video of
it on the internet

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:47.520
and it somehow wound
its way to Google.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.480
And about two months later,
I found myself at Google

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.510
in Android as a
product manager working

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.540
on this super-secret
awesome product

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.420
that we came out with today.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.330
Or yesterday.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.440
So just want to go through
some of the challenges

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.180
we had when we looked
at the problem space.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.705
Both cars and phones are
these essential devices

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:09.685
to everyone's lives.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.290
So when we look at
phones, smartphones,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.550
they really contain everything
about our lives today.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.430
They contain our contacts.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.930
They contain where we're going.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.850
They contain our
next appointments.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.210
They have our music.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.740
They know our preferences.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.710
And because they're
connected to the cloud,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.160
these preferences follow
us around even if we're

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.480
on different devices or if we're
on the web using a computer.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.470
So we love the connectedness
of these devices.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.940
Similarly, cars are essential
for our daily lives.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.880
They take us to our errands.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.330
They take our families on trips.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.000
We go on road trips
and new adventures

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.602
to find new places with them.

00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:52.810
And most importantly, they
take us to work every day.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.600
So many people spend a lot of
time each day in their car.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.900
Latest study was
over 90 minutes a day

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.940
the average American
spends in their car.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.780
Although they're
essential, they're

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.060
fundamentally disconnected right
now from our mobile phones.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.150
So drivers want to have
those connected, compelling

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.570
experiences in their car that
they have with their phones

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.710
and so they take matters
into their own hands.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.120
What do they do?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.340
They bring their
phone into the car.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.200
And they look down
at the phone when

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.300
they should be looking
at the road ahead of them

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.620
while they're driving.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.860
And even though we all know it's
relatively unsafe to be doing

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.670
this, and we know in
many states in the US

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.410
and in many countries around
the world it's illegal,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.520
people still continue
to do it because phones

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.050
and this connected experience
is so compelling and essential.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.425
So those are some
of the problems

00:02:44.425 --> 00:02:46.690
that so we saw that drivers had.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.930
But we also saw that there were
problems that developers had in

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.407
trying to develop for the car.

00:02:52.407 --> 00:02:54.990
And I want to talk a little bit
about some of those challenges

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.230
that developers have if you want
to actually develop for the car

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.980
today.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.190
So first, there are many
auto platforms out there.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.650
Usually, each manufacturer,
each brand, each model, and even

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.139
model years have different
software platforms.

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:12.180
They have different APIs.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.840
They have different
capabilities,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.670
which makes it literally moving
target for you as a developer.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.900
Secondly, there's also
distribution difficulties.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.180
So if you're a developer,
it's very difficult

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.560
to get your app distributed
to a car itself.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.400
And once it is on the car,
it's actually very difficult

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.580
to make sure your app is updated
in the same way that you can

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.490
on a mobile phone today.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.037
Moreover, there's
safety regulations.

00:03:36.037 --> 00:03:38.620
And we're going to go into that
in a couple minutes about what

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.690
it actually means to
do some of this testing

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.230
you need to do in order to
make sure things are meeting

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.660
distraction guidelines,
which are around the world

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.440
and which many
manufacturers also

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.880
have their own guidelines of.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.420
If you're a developer,
you actually

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.510
have to spend a lot
of time making sure

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.160
that you need all
these regulations.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.700
And I bet you guys want
to be coding software

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.530
instead of learning about
the guidelines for driver

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.800
distraction.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.866
And then finally, the
compelling experience

00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:08.490
that people have on
their mobile phones

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.260
is that they're connected
and they're personalized.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.230
And those are actually very
difficult to do in the car

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.730
right now.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.480
You have a key you
put in the ignition,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.769
and sometimes that key
knows like, oh, it's

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.180
driver one or driver two.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.110
And it moves the seat
forward and backwards.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.110
But that's kind of the
extent of personalization

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.340
that's in the car right now.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.640
And so being able to have that
connected experience where

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.450
it knows everything about
you and it's able to help you

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.730
as you're driving is
actually very, very difficult

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.260
for apps to be able
to harness right now.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.950
So what if it would be
as easy as a developer

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.190
to develop for the car as it
is to develop for an Android

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.372
smartphone today?

00:04:45.372 --> 00:04:47.580
Well, that's actually the
solution that we worked on,

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.680
and that's Android Auto.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.390
NICK PELLY: So what
is the solution?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.990
Well, Google has
actually been working

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.480
in the automotive space
for quite a while now.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.270
We first started partnering
with auto manufacturers in 2005.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.070
And we've actually released
Send 2 Car in 2007,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.770
Audi Earth in 2009,
and Places API in 2010.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.410
These are all
cloud-connected solutions.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.660
We're delivering geodata
direct from the cloud

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.310
to internet-connected cars.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.350
These solutions are
already on the road today,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.880
but we wanted more.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.780
So from about 2010, we started
thinking very seriously

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.940
about how to solve the
problems that Andy mentioned.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.090
And the solution wasn't
actually all that difficult.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.630
We knew the key ingredient
was your smartphone.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.720
This was the piece
that was missing.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.630
Android is a proven
developer platform.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.410
As you saw in Sundar's
keynote address yesterday,

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.780
there are 1 billion active
Android users at the moment.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.096
It's a pretty insane number.

00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:03.470
And I think most
developers would

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.960
agree this has been a
successful development platform.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.840
Why does the smartphone work?

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.830
Well, your smartphone is yours.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.890
It's got your apps,
your services.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.010
It's personalized.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.660
If you look at Google
Now on your smartphone,

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.024
it knows what your
destination is likely to be.

00:06:23.024 --> 00:06:25.440
These are the kinds of solutions
that we want in your car.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.160
We want your car to know you and
know where you want to go to.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.430
Your phone also has a data plan.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.060
It has connectivity.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.480
So we want to bring the success
of the smartphone to your car.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.075
The key here is we want to
bring success of the smartphone

00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:46.660
to the car in a way that
gets around the life cycle

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.620
challenge of the car.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.910
You keep your phone
for 2 years, but people

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.410
expect to keep their
car for around 10 years.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.000
You don't want your apps to
not work on a 10-year-old car.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.410
But as an application
developer, it

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.170
would be extremely challenging
to try and compile, maintain,

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.544
distribute your app to
every single car that

00:07:07.544 --> 00:07:08.960
had been released
in the 10 years.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.630
So if the smartphone's so clever
and the car's so challenging,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.730
then why connect
to the car at all?

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.270
Well, it's because your car
has some awesome hardware.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.980
It's got high-fidelity audio.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.960
You've got surround sound
speakers throughout the cabin.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.270
There's directional speakers
that can deliver notifications

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.690
straight to the driver.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.750
You've got directional
array microphones

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.550
to pick up your voice
even amongst road noise.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.970
You've got GPS and
high-quality GPS antennas.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.220
You can't fit the
sort of GPS antenna

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.720
you have in a car in a
five-inch smarthphone.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.970
[INAUDIBLE] wheel speed that
was measured directly off

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.940
of the actual rotation
of the drive shaft.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.110
And compass, so you
can actually navigate

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.790
inside tunnels, which you can't
do as accurately on a phone.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.226
On a phone, sure you
have an accelerometer,

00:08:01.226 --> 00:08:03.350
but you have to integrate
the acceleration in order

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.891
to get speed.

00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:04.951
And it's very noisy.

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:07.200
You're much better off taking
the wheel speed directly

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.450
from the car.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.150
Cars these days have a six-inch
display in most new cars

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.390
coming out today.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.420
And the display is
intelligently positioned

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.890
so that you can keep your eyes
on the road at the same time

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.610
as glancing at the display.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.160
Cars are also
designed specifically

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.190
for being able to
interact with them.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.277
Being able to use input.

00:08:30.277 --> 00:08:31.610
Some of them have touch screens.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.860
Some of them have controllers.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.520
The controllers are placed
in just the right location

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.130
so that you can just quickly
toggle the rotary while still

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.320
looking at the road and
keeping a hand on the wheel.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.115
Cars also have a
giant battery that

00:08:47.115 --> 00:08:48.905
will make any smartphone
pretty jealous.

00:08:51.534 --> 00:08:53.200
So wouldn't it be a
shame if we couldn't

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.350
bring all of this great hardware
from the car to your phone?

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.540
So we knew the solution was to
combine the best of your phone

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.740
with the best of your car.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.010
What we didn't know is
what the right architecture

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:07.950
is to support this.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.491
There's actually a
few different ways

00:09:09.491 --> 00:09:11.730
you can combine the
phone and the car.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.060
So we started prototyping.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.560
And I'm going to
introduce to you

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.790
a little bit of our
development process here.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.760
We started with an internal
prototype called Navstep.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.434
On the left is a phone.

00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:24.350
The phone that you have
in your pocket and you

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.110
bring into your car.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.820
On the right is the
tablet that, in this case,

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.970
is emulating a head unit.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.641
We're just prototyping here, so
we didn't have a real head unit

00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:34.640
during these prototypes.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.600
We just used a tablet
to pretend to be one.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.150
In the Navstep
demo, we're running

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.230
Google Maps on the phone and
just sending navigation data

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.490
across to the car.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.550
It was just turn-by-turn
instructions.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.782
We were using Bluetooth.

00:09:46.782 --> 00:09:48.240
I come from a
Bluetooth background,

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.820
so that was really
easy to bring up.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.000
And we're actually taking
those turn-by-turn instructions

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.360
and then rendering
them on the tablet.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.990
Pretty crudely in
this case, I've

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.650
just got a text dumped
onto the screen.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.400
We were just developing
at this stage.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.710
The key here is you have a
mix of the application stack.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.480
You have Google Maps running on
the phone connected to Google

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.491
in the cloud sending low-level
data to the car that is then--

00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:21.740
has some of the application
stack during the rendering

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.820
and the compositing
and everything else.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.870
So this solved some
of the challenges

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.120
that Andy was talking
about because we could now

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.590
take advantage of Google
Services really easily.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.410
Google Now destination
suggestions

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.600
can be sent from the phone
to the car very easily

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.930
with this type of architecture.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.300
But we weren't solving
all of the challenges

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.340
because some of the
application stack

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.190
is still on the car, which
means that as an application

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.990
developer, you still
need to consider how

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.634
to get half of your
application to cars that

00:10:51.634 --> 00:10:53.175
have been on the
road for many years.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.550
The next step in our
prototyping was Navcast.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.100
This is quite different.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.960
We're now sending
compressed display and audio

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.340
data from the phone to the car.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.010
Again, the car is the
tablet in this prototype.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.892
So we're running
Google Maps again.

00:11:12.892 --> 00:11:14.850
And you can see in the
top right of the tablet,

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.420
just faintly there, there's a
Google Maps image that we're

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.180
actually sending across that
was rendered by the phone.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.500
Now, the key challenge
here is low latency.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.630
It has to feel like
you're interacting

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.100
with a local system, even
though the application stack

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.915
rendering, compositing is
happening on the phone.

00:11:33.915 --> 00:11:37.039
All those touch events are
getting sent from the tablet

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:37.580
to the phone.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.620
And we have to do that round
trip as fast as possible

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.009
to make latency work.

00:11:42.009 --> 00:11:43.300
So we worked very hard at this.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.500
It wasn't easy.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.370
We had to make changes to
the Android operating system

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.520
in order to do fast, off-screen
rendering-- fast rendering

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.610
to an off-screen buffer
that we could then

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.960
hardware compress
and put over USB.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.745
We're using USB in this demo
because we needed the higher

00:12:00.745 --> 00:12:01.245
throughput.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.980
So we got to a point
through this prototyping

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.955
where I was convinced
that actually we

00:12:10.955 --> 00:12:12.580
could produce a
workable solution here.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.750
The latency, I really love it.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.370
And I think if you go and
look at the sandbox cars

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:22.850
and watch our demos, this is a
very, very workable solution.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.650
Now, the cast architecture,
it's a real turning point

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.760
because now we can move
all of the application

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.780
stack onto the phone so you
have that Android platform

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.530
that you're using.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.720
You don't have to think
so much about trying

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.710
to get your application
code onto the car.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.920
So [INAUDIBLE] able to scale
this and put dialer, music,

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.276
and more applications
onto the phone.

00:12:47.276 --> 00:12:49.900
And we hope to have more of your
applications on the phone now,

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.770
too.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.370
So this was the beginning,
really, of Android Auto

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.690
as we know it today.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.210
If you're a podcast app, you
can now write for Android,

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.510
distribute in the same Android
APK that you're using today,

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.320
and see it appear on the phone.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.910
And you can upgrade
via Google Play.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.285
You don't have to
worry about how

00:13:08.285 --> 00:13:10.684
to distribute your
application to cars that

00:13:10.684 --> 00:13:12.100
have been on the
road for a while.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.205
You can just distribute
them to the mobile device.

00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:19.190
The last stage of
our development

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.890
was, of course, to partner
with car manufacturers

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.610
and to actually
get real head unit

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.215
integrations of Android Auto.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.577
So that was the
high-level architecture.

00:13:33.577 --> 00:13:35.160
Let's go into a
little bit more detail

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.300
about what this
means for developers.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.720
Now as I mentioned, the
connection is via USB.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.680
I actually come from
a wireless background.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.965
I've worked many years
in Bluetooth and NFC,

00:13:44.965 --> 00:13:48.470
but USB is the right
choice for our version

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.921
1 integrations because
you charge the phone

00:13:50.921 --> 00:13:52.920
at the same time as you're
running Android Auto.

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:56.842
If you look at the
protocol, now the protocol

00:13:56.842 --> 00:13:59.275
is transport agnostic.

00:13:59.275 --> 00:14:00.900
It's designed
specifically [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.260
What we do is we map the
low-level hardware in the car

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.520
onto the protocol.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.490
We enumerate all the
wide variety of hardware

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.625
that you have in the
car onto the protocol.

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:16.375
I'm just shown the
general categories here

00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:19.620
of audio, display,
sensors, and input.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.950
But within each of
these categories,

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.720
there's so many-- audio,
you have media audio.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.050
You have cabin audio,
audio for the driver.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.320
With sensors, you have
wheel speed, GPS, compass.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.480
With input, you have all sorts
of different controller types.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.970
The Android Auto
protocol knows about all

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.330
of this diverse hardware
and maps it directly

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.340
onto the protocol.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.910
We also have display and
audio focus concepts.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.090
So look, this is
really important

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.420
because we can support
use cases such as using

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.250
the native interface in the car
to select an FM radio station,

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.640
play FM radio.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.720
You can then switch to Android
Auto, go to Google Maps,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.930
pick a destination
suggested by Google Now.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.940
All the while, you're
still hearing FM radio

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.830
in the background,
but you'll then

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.330
get turn-by-turn instructions
from Google Maps that

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.380
will come over the car speakers
and it will duck the FM radio

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.410
as the turn-by-turn
instructions come through.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.810
Even better, of you then go
to a podcast app on the phone,

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.340
you'll then hear
the FM radio will

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.120
stop playing because
we're negotiating

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.370
audio focus over the protocol.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:37.750
So if I go forwards now to
what's happening on the car.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.800
You'll notice that there was
not any application state

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.810
on the protocol.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.950
We're focusing on
hardware in the protocol,

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.400
so we have a small library in
the car called the Android Auto

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.520
Receiver Library.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.560
It's a protocol stack.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.660
It's a set of interfaces
to the hardware.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.250
It allows automakers to
consistently integrate

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.800
car hardware with Android Auto.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.320
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.780
We have Honda, Hyundai,
GM, and Audi all here

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:06.132
today with integrations
of Android Auto.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:08.090
And we're working with
many other manufacturers

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:12.300
in the background to [INAUDIBLE]
new cars on the road.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:22.450
So looking at the phone, the
other end of the protocol stack

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.540
is in a component
called Car Service.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.840
Car Service is distributed
in Google Play Services.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.410
It also uses some of
the platform [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.710
we put into the L
developer preview

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.470
to support fast
off-screen rendering.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.040
Now, for developers what
you're going to notice

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.490
is that we don't directly map
the hardware in the protocol

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.160
into APIs on the phone.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.480
There's a really
good reason for this.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.040
It's driver distraction.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.430
It just doesn't make
sense to support some use

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:00.720
cases such as YouTube videos
or gaming on the car head unit.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.180
Now, you guys are
all great developers.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.880
And I'm sure you
think you can come up

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.530
with UI that is super-slick
and safe in the car.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.589
But trust me, you don't
want to have to prove it.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.510
We've got a User
Experience Research

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.630
team that works in
this topic, and they

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:19.599
deal with pages and pages--
thousands of regulations

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.650
from across the world that
define things like minimum font

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:28.006
size, contrast ratio,
maximum task completion time.

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:30.380
You don't want to become legal
experts in all this stuff.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.500
You also don't
want to have to buy

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.370
a pair of occlusion glasses.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.950
We've got a pair
here today as well

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.450
that Gabriel's going
to demonstrate.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.497
As cool as they
look, you don't want

00:17:44.497 --> 00:17:46.080
to have to buy one
of these every time

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.180
you release your app.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.840
Now, what the
occlusion classes do

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.030
is they actually
block your vision

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.660
and then open it up for one
and a half second increments

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.650
to test that you
can operate the user

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:01.310
interface with quick glances.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.270
So look, we deal with
the pixel pushing

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.350
and we deal with the
occlusion classes for you.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.440
The diversity of
car hardware is also

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.800
challenging for developers,
especially with car input.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.040
Some cars have touch screens.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.810
Some have controllers.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.030
When they're controllers,
sometimes it's a four-way.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.196
Sometimes it's an eight-way.

00:18:23.196 --> 00:18:25.970
Sometimes it's an eight-way
rotary controller.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.510
Some cars have eight-way
rotary with a touch pad

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.310
on top that's separate from
the touchscreen in the car.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.390
And some cars have
that same controller

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.930
repeated in the backseat,
where the backseat

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.050
controller sometimes
controls the primary display

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.320
and sometimes controls
the backseat display.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.810
We handle all of this
in Car Service for you.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.780
So what do we provide?

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.510
Well, we provide templates
and a common UX framework.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:55.550
And we provide semantic APIs so
that you can work within the UX

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.420
framework that we've provided.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.295
So really briefly,
here's an overview.

00:19:03.295 --> 00:19:04.920
I'm going to actually
go to a live demo

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.495
with Gabriel to walk you through
the UX in a bit more detail.

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:18.095
So we're running on the tablet
at the moment, the same tablet

00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:20.460
that I showed in prototyping.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.250
It's an easy development tool.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:26.080
It operates the same way that
your head unit would operate.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.430
So at the top
right, you'll see we

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.800
have common visual
affordances that

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.690
are in predictable locations.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.160
There will always be a
microphone at the top right.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.030
If you press the microphone,
you bring up the Google panel

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.990
where you can have
voice interactions.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.400
If we close this,
on the top left

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.690
you'll see that there's
an App Menu drawer.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.180
This is always in the
top left and it opens up

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.670
the App Menu where we have
a list-based navigation.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.880
Lists make sense in
the car because you

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.180
can operate them with touch.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.910
They have large touch targets.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.730
And you can easily operate
them with controllers.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.110
Closing that.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.440
So we also have Heads
Up notifications.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.999
You heard about those yesterday
in the L developer preview.

00:20:10.999 --> 00:20:12.290
Gabriel's going to trigger one.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.100
There it is.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.320
So Google Music
just changed songs

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.470
and showed a Heads
Up notification.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.915
Applications can customize
content in the Heads

00:20:19.915 --> 00:20:22.760
Up notifications.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.900
There's also the Overview page.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.900
This is your landing page when
you first connect Android Auto.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.506
You can populate content
into the Overview page

00:20:32.506 --> 00:20:33.255
as an application.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:40.220
So we have a solution and
we have an architecture.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.950
And we have a UX
framework that we

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.032
think is much safer
to use than trying

00:20:44.032 --> 00:20:45.240
to use your phone in the car.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.770
With that, I'd like
to take it to Gabriel

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.680
to tell you more about the APIs.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.520
GABRIEL PEAL: Cool.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.549
Thanks, Nick.

00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:57.340
So now that you've seen
an overview of what

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.672
Android Auto looks
like and how it works,

00:20:59.672 --> 00:21:02.130
I'm going to give you guys a
sneak peek of the Android Auto

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.560
SDK.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.056
But actually, I can do
one better than that.

00:21:07.056 --> 00:21:08.972
I'm going to give you
guys a sneak peak of how

00:21:08.972 --> 00:21:10.920
you can extend
media and messaging

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.780
APIs to work not only
with Android Auto,

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.620
but also with Android Wear.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.030
A big theme of Android
at Google I/O this year

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.550
is that we're expanding Android
to a lot of new platforms

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:22.530
and form factors.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.330
It's coming to TVs and
watches in addition

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.700
to phones, tablets, and cars.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.830
So while expanding Android to
all of these new platforms,

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.610
we gave ourselves
a real opportunity

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.735
to make developing for
Android a real nightmare.

00:21:35.735 --> 00:21:37.610
This is a real thing
that we could have done,

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.290
but we worked together closely
with all the different teams

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.110
to unify these APIs.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.340
So with both the media
and messaging APIs

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.070
I'm going to talk
about today, you'll

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:51.030
get native support for Android
Auto and Android Wear for free.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.260
So the first thing I want
to talk about is media apps.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.170
And media apps, we
found this to be

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.800
a particularly interesting
space for the car.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.800
It's a crucial part of
the in-car experience

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.461
and we knew that we
had to get it right.

00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:05.460
Users listen to lots of
different kinds of media

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.170
both on their phone
and in their car.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.670
And we wanted to
make sure that they

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.240
had a seamless transition
between the two.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.770
We think we found a balance
that both minimizes driver

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.270
distraction and enables
a wide variety of media

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.830
apps to feel right at
home in Android Auto.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.560
At the same time,
media apps can still

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.150
maintain their brand identity
and bring the custom features

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.190
that makes their app
special into the car.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:35.830
So what we've created
is a semantic media API.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.750
By implementing that API, you
can future-proof your apps

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.120
and make sure that they
support all Android devices

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.800
across platforms as
soon as they come out.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.640
One thing I want to note though,
is that in Google Play Music,

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.150
we're using the exact same
APIs that we're opening up

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.510
to the public, so that
your third-party media

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.810
applications are actually
first-party citizens on Android

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.090
Auto.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:58.760
Let me just say
that one more time.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.060
Third-party media apps
are first-party citizens

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.060
on Android Auto.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.814
And we're using the exact
same APIs you guys will.

00:23:05.814 --> 00:23:08.230
So let me just give you a demo
and see what it looks like,

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.646
and then we'll
dive into some code

00:23:09.646 --> 00:23:12.020
and take a look at how you
can implement and wire up

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:12.900
your apps today.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.710
So if I open up Media,
the first screen

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:25.139
that you're presented with
is the Media Playback screen.

00:23:25.139 --> 00:23:26.680
And the Media Playback
screen, you'll

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.720
see familiar user interface
elements from other media apps

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.170
like album art, song
titles, subtitles.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.200
That could be album art
or anything like that.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.690
As well as some
familiar controls,

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.121
like, Play, Pause,
Forward, and Next.

00:23:39.121 --> 00:23:41.120
I'll talk about how you
can choose and customize

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.830
those in your app later.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.790
But we know that the
standard media controls

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.045
are enough to handle the
wide variety of media apps.

00:23:47.045 --> 00:23:49.170
We want it to feel right
at home with Android Auto.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.990
So you can even add
your own custom actions

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.790
with custom icons that bring
the special functionality

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:57.456
of your app insert Android Auto.

00:23:57.456 --> 00:23:59.330
Right here, we're looking
at the Joyride app.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.510
In Joyride, on
the primary screen

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.390
here, you can see that they've
replaced the Previous button

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.540
with one that skips
ahead by 30 seconds

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.547
because that makes more
sense for their app.

00:24:09.547 --> 00:24:11.880
They have more actions than
can fit on the first screen.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.710
And if we open the
overflow panel,

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.600
you'll see they have
some additional actions.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.010
And there they have the
previous action as well.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.380
If you want to switch
between different media apps,

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.475
tap the Media icon in
the Activity Bar again,

00:24:24.475 --> 00:24:26.850
and you're presented with a
list of all of the media apps

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.970
that have implemented
this semantic API that I'm

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.910
going to talk about today.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.140
If we switch to
Spotify, you'll see

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.720
that the UI is
familiar and consistent

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.040
across the different apps.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.105
But at the same time, they can
customize their own branding.

00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:42.950
So that the blue
branding in Joyride

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.190
has been replaced with
a green one in Spotify.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.960
They also have
custom actions now.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.170
So here they have actions
to shuffle and add things

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.470
to a play queue, as
well as start a radio

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.700
station and other
things like that.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.200
If I open up the
app drawer, you can

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.119
see that again their
branding continues here.

00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:01.160
And the scrim on the right
side of the app drawer

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.800
is green, so that no matter
where you are in the app,

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.390
the user will instantly look
over and they can just glance

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.556
and they'll know exactly
which media app they're in.

00:25:08.556 --> 00:25:11.320
And they won't mistake
yours for anyone else's.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.330
All the app menus live
here in the drawer.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.940
It's fully customizable
by the app.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.050
And you can see here, Spotify
has Your Music, Radio,

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.260
and Browse.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.950
They've even chosen to include
a few custom icons so that you

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:27.866
can quickly glance over and look
and find exactly what you want.

00:25:27.866 --> 00:25:29.490
If we go into the
Playlist menu, you'll

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.610
see that Menu items
even expand to fit

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.287
two lines of test if necessary.

00:25:34.287 --> 00:25:36.120
So you really get a lot
of flexibility here.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.470
So that's what media apps
look like on Android Auto.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.770
Actually though, I can
only show you so much

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.530
on this Nexus 7 tablet today.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.270
If you actually
use this in a car,

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.320
we integrate your
media apps into the car

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.390
beyond what I can show
you on this tablet.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.155
In-dash and steering
wheel media controls

00:25:59.155 --> 00:26:00.920
will control your media.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.490
Your media metadata will
also be shown directly

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.450
on the instrument
cluster display.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:09.780
And if the user temporarily
switches out of Android Auto

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.120
and into the native
head unit software,

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.290
your apps will still continue
to play and be controlled

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:19.080
by the same in-dash and
steering wheel controls.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.060
So let's take a look
at the architecture

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.360
and what this thing looks
like under the hood.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.485
I do want to note though,
that these APIs are still

00:26:25.485 --> 00:26:27.442
being finalized, and
we're still making sure

00:26:27.442 --> 00:26:28.400
that we get this right.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.730
So some of the details of
the actual code snippets

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.414
might change a little bit
between now and release.

00:26:34.414 --> 00:26:36.580
But we don't think the
high-level architecture will,

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.204
so you can start thinking about
how you can prepare and get you

00:26:39.204 --> 00:26:43.159
media apps ready to
support Android Auto today.

00:26:43.159 --> 00:26:44.950
The center of communication
in Android Auto

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.230
is in media service.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.070
Note though that I'm
using the word "service."

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.370
When Android Auto is
running, we put your phone

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.700
in a special car dock mode.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.230
When your phone is
in car dock mode,

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.760
we won't launch any new
activities on your phone.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.520
What that means is that
all of the communication

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.540
between Android
and your app must

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.540
occur through
background services.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.160
You can indicate which
service in your app

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.190
implements this
media service API

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:20.650
by adding the imediaservice.bind
category to your manifest.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.640
As you saw in the demo,
when the user switches

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.221
between media apps
in Android Auto,

00:27:24.221 --> 00:27:25.720
they're presented
with a list of all

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.220
of the apps that have
implemented this API.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.430
We'll take the app label
from the application element

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.570
of your manifest, and
we'll also take the icon

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.650
by default from there as well.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.110
But if you want to
show a custom car icon,

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.430
you can add metadata
to your service

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.000
with the name icon
and a resource

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.667
and we'll show
that icon instead.

00:27:45.667 --> 00:27:47.250
The initial handshake
is pretty simple

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.846
once the user lunches
your app in Android Auto.

00:27:49.846 --> 00:27:51.220
Android will bind
to your service

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.720
and you return
your implementation

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.710
of media service.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:58.980
Soon after that, Android
will call load app theme

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.440
and you can have the opportunity
to get that customized branding

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.140
and look and feel so that the
user instantly recognizes it

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.790
as your app.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.635
As you saw in Joyride with
their blue theme and Spotify

00:28:09.635 --> 00:28:11.510
with their green, you'll
have the opportunity

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.020
to do the same and more as well.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.280
There are four primary
things that you

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.590
can customize in the
theme in Android Auto.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.720
You can set a custom
default background.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.280
So if there's no active album
art, we'll show that instead.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.580
You can also set a
primary action color.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.690
Part of the material
design across all

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.380
these new Android platforms
is a primary action

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.700
that hovers above the
main card on the screen.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.510
In our Media app,
that primary action

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.755
is the Play and Pause button.

00:28:40.755 --> 00:28:43.130
And so the user can instantly
glance over and immediately

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:48.130
know how to touch and action
on the primary action.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.650
If you set a primary
action color,

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.720
we'll tint the Play
and Pause button

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.380
with your app's primary
color so that it's

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.820
instantly recognizable.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.620
You can also set
a panel color so

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.930
that when the user goes
to the Overflow menu

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.865
or opens the app drawer, we'll
tint that menu or the app

00:29:03.865 --> 00:29:06.710
drawer scrim with
that color as well.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.957
You can even set a custom
color for the progress bar,

00:29:08.957 --> 00:29:10.790
so you really get a lot
of flexibility here.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.900
Soon after requesting
your apps theme,

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.020
Android will request for a set
of default transport controls.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.930
Transport controls are
the default media actions

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.110
that we found to be
common across a variety

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.750
of different kinds
of media apps.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:30.445
It includes things like Play
and Pause, Next, and Previous.

00:29:30.445 --> 00:29:32.931
You can set some default
transport controls

00:29:32.931 --> 00:29:34.680
at the beginning when
your app is launched

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.790
and they'll persist across
different media items

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.570
as the track
changes and the user

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.507
moves around within your app.

00:29:40.507 --> 00:29:42.090
You can change these
at a later point,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.360
but if you want to set a
default set of controls,

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.830
this is how you do that.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.740
We do know that this isn't
enough for a lot of the apps,

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.240
though.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.660
As you saw in Joyride,
they add a special skip

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.730
ahead by 30 seconds action.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.630
Every time the
media items changes,

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.490
we'll call get app
actions where you

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.490
can return a list
of custom actions

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.910
that are specific to your app.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.270
And app action contains a
description string, an icon,

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.332
and a bundle.

00:30:08.332 --> 00:30:10.540
We'll take the description
of the string and use that

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.110
to populate the
UI, and then we'll

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.960
send the bundle back to
you when it's actioned on.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.170
That bundle is completely
transparent to Android.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.670
You simply send it to us and
we'll send it right back to you

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.086
so you know exactly what the
user did when they tap on it.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.910
When tracks change,
we'll call play entry

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:30.600
in your implementation
of media service.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.480
We'll pass in the URI of the
new track, and it's up to you

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.242
guys to take action on it.

00:30:36.242 --> 00:30:38.075
A lot of the time, these
actions and playing

00:30:38.075 --> 00:30:40.830
a new piece of media in a media
app is done asynchronously.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.740
It might take network requests
or various other things

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.219
that take time.

00:30:45.219 --> 00:30:47.010
But we're not going to
make any assumptions

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:48.370
as to how your app works.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.250
And it's up to you
to make sure that you

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.241
update the UI appropriately.

00:30:53.241 --> 00:30:55.490
There are two parts to the
UI that you have to update,

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.820
the play state and
the metadata as you

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.760
can see in the slide behind me.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.030
If you don't immediately
know what the next track is,

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:07.050
the UI won't change unless
you actually do something.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.120
So if you're loading
something from the network,

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.440
for example, you can
actually change the metadata

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.830
to say loading and the play
state to say buffering.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.609
But you want to act
on this immediately so

00:31:15.609 --> 00:31:17.900
that the user has some sort
of feedback for the actions

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.260
that they take.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.660
So that's an overview
of the high-level APIs

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.840
of how you control
the Media Playback

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.310
screen in Android Auto.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.330
Let's talk about menus.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.830
So as we saw in Android
Auto, all of the menus

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.390
live inside of an app drawer.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:36.410
And they're completely
customizable by the app.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:39.170
These menus consists
of two main data types,

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:42.260
they're media containers
and media items.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.332
Media items are individual
entities that can be played.

00:31:45.332 --> 00:31:47.040
It's actually the same
data type that you

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:52.370
use to update the metadata
when we call play entry.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:56.060
Media containers are lists
that can contain other media

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.220
containers or media items.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.520
And what you wind up with is a
virtual file system of sorts.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.270
Media containers are
like directories.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.350
Media items are like
individual files.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.180
And it gives you
a lot of control

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.120
over how you want the user to be
able to browse through content

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:11.680
in the car.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.810
Menus are a great
way to browse content

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.730
when the user can
afford to take the time

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.370
to look for what they want.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.340
Sometimes the user
doesn't have that time

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.690
or it's dangerous
to do in a car.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.380
So that's why we provided
an alternative that's

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:32.410
even faster and easier to
use than any menu hierarchy,

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:34.580
and that's voice.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.760
Voice is integrated into
every aspect of Android Auto.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.900
It's integrated
into the platform.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.470
It's tied to your
Google account,

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.700
and it's tied to the
Google Knowledge Graph.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.320
You can ask it almost anything.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.930
You can ask it to
navigate somewhere,

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.771
call somebody, text a friend.

00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:51.270
You can ask it questions that
are connected to the Knowledge

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.090
Graph, like what the weather
is going to be like tomorrow.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.180
You can even ask it
to set reminders,

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.550
like remind me to buy
milk when I get home.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.230
And it'll actually set a
geofence around your home

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:03.810
and remind you on
your phone, car,

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.370
and watch when you get there.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.820
It's pretty amazing.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.840
You can ask it to
play media, too.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.010
If you say, play something
with Google Play Music,

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.400
it'll come right up.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.090
But we want to
make sure that this

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:18.850
is enabled for third-party
media apps as well.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.390
In fact, there's actually
been an Android action

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.370
in the platform for
quite some time.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.470
It's called media
play from search.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.186
If you implement this
action in activity today,

00:33:28.186 --> 00:33:30.310
and the user makes a voice
search to play something

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:33.355
with your app, Google Voice
Search will launch your app

00:33:33.355 --> 00:33:35.605
and send it an intent where
you can pull out the query

00:33:35.605 --> 00:33:38.190
and start playing
that media item.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:43.130
But like I said, we won't
launch any new activities

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:44.560
when Android Auto is running.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.040
And so all this
communication has

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.920
to happen in
background services.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.320
That's why we've integrated
this functionality directly

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.410
into media service.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:56.340
When the user makes a
voice query in Android Auto

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.130
to play something
with your media app,

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.230
we'll call media play
from search inside

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.770
of your implementation
of media service

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:04.920
where you can then
respond to that query,

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.960
and then it's almost like
any other play entry.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:13.920
That's an overview of
all of the Media APIs

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.130
that we'll be releasing
for Android Auto.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:20.007
When we began showing this
to our pre-release partners,

00:34:20.007 --> 00:34:22.090
they were able to get it
running in their existing

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:24.610
apps in a matter of days.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.740
And it felt right at
home in Android Auto.

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.489
We're still working
with them to make sure

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:31.601
that we get you all the
best possible tools so

00:34:31.601 --> 00:34:33.350
you can bring the best
experience that you

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.179
can to the car.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:36.679
We do know that you
guys are working

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.739
on apps beyond what
we've imagined though,

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.419
so please come talk to us.

00:34:40.419 --> 00:34:41.960
We want to hear what
you have to say.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:47.909
Next up is messaging.

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:49.969
Messaging is one of the
most dangerous things

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:51.620
that people do in a car.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.510
It leads to countless
accidents every year.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.130
Part of the problem
is that drivers

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:58.100
have to take their
eyes off the road

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.600
in order to send a message.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.147
That's why we've created a
100% voice-driven interface

00:35:04.147 --> 00:35:06.480
so the user doesn't have to
take their eyes off the road

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.570
in order to send a message.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.340
When a new message
comes in, we'll

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.090
display a Heads Up notification
and Google Voice Search

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:15.210
will read back the
message to you.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:18.920
You can then reply to the
message with voice as well.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.400
When we ship Android Auto,
we'll have full support

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.105
for SMS and Hangouts built-in.

00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:26.574
But we know that people
use other messaging apps

00:35:26.574 --> 00:35:28.740
and we want to make sure
they have the same seamless

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:32.720
experience with those
apps in Android Auto.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.700
Once again, we've worked closely
with the Android Wear team

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.470
to make sure that you can build
your apps once and have them

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.320
just work across all of
these different platforms.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.080
So by building support
for messaging apps

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.150
into Android Auto,
you'll also get support

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.920
for Android Wear for free.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.180
At the core of this new
API is remote input.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:54.840
Remote input is a
new class that's

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.784
part of the Android L developer
preview we released today.

00:35:57.784 --> 00:36:00.200
It's also going to be in the
latest version of the Android

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.260
Support Library.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.600
You attach the remote input
to a standard Android system

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.090
notification action.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:11.240
In Android Auto when we detect
a messaging notification

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.470
with a remote input, we'll use
that to open up Google Voice

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:17.810
Search to let you reply
to a message with voice,

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.194
and then we'll send the results
of that back to your app

00:36:20.194 --> 00:36:21.110
with a pending intent.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.780
So there you have it.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.410
What we're offering with the
first version of Android Auto

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:31.090
is a rich set of media
APIs that provides

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.890
a consistent UI for the
user, yet gives you guys

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.480
the flexibility to
maintain your apps branding

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.560
and keep your custom
features and make

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.860
them accessible in the car.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.850
And a voice-driven messaging
API that minimizes driver

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.050
distraction and lets
drivers send message

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:49.979
without ever taking
their eyes off the road.

00:36:49.979 --> 00:36:51.520
Because both these
APIs will give you

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.520
support for both Android
Auto and Android Wear,

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.210
there's never been a better
time to develop for Android

00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.610
to allow your user experiences
to travel with the user

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.910
throughout their daily life
across different devices

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.850
and platforms.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.440
We're really excited
to show you guys

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.565
what we've been working on.

00:37:07.565 --> 00:37:09.898
We're going to have a lot
more information in the coming

00:37:09.898 --> 00:37:11.990
months about the product
and about the SDK

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.136
and about opening up
this for all of you guys

00:37:14.136 --> 00:37:16.330
to start working.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:20.400
To say up to date, check out
developer.android.com/auto,

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.400
or leave some comments
on g.co/androidautodev,

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.990
our Google+ community.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.490
We'll be monitoring
that and keeping

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.890
track of what people are
looking for in these APIs

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.470
because we're really dedicated
to make sure that you have

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:38.580
the tools that you need to make
a strong app for Android Auto.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.500
So I think we just have
a few minutes left here.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.250
We'll answer a few
questions you have now,

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:45.297
but we're doing live
demos in the third floor.

00:37:45.297 --> 00:37:47.130
And the three of us and
the rest of the team

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.630
will be up there
all day if you want

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.360
to come ask anymore questions.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.264
So thanks.

00:37:51.264 --> 00:37:58.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:06.486 --> 00:38:07.610
ANDY BRENNER: No questions?

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:08.110
OK.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.630
AUDIENCE: So my
question is, how's

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.980
the integration
with built-in stuff?

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.740
For instance, I
have a Leaf, which

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:26.020
has a lot of electrical--
all of that integration,

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.880
energy-consumption
type of stuff.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.550
Does Android Auto
integrate with that

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:32.930
or do we bump out of
Android Auto to go to stock?

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:34.680
ANDY BRENNER: That's
actually interesting.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.800
I actually have a
Leaf myself, so I'd

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.110
love to see more integration
with EV vehicles.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.870
We've actually been working
with automakers and still

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.940
under discussions with
them as well as with you

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:50.130
guys on how to bring what we
call car data, which is things

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:53.330
in terms of an EV such as
range, battery life, things

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.620
of that nature, to the platform.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.500
It's actually a
very complex issue

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.990
because you have
user privacy issues.

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.680
You have manufacturer questions.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.440
We need to make a
platform so that it's

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.177
common across all the vehicles.

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:08.260
So those are questions
we're still working through

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.770
right now, but we
definitely want

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:13.800
to open that up to
you guys when we can.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.097
But it's going to require
a lot of discussion that's

00:39:16.097 --> 00:39:16.680
still ongoing.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:23.795
NICK PELLY: We do integrate
GPS and wheel speed already.

00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:25.950
ANDY BRENNER: Yeah.

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:29.910
AUDIENCE: Hi, I had a
question about the media APIs,

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:32.250
about audio.

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:35.520
Does this use a
specific media player,

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.500
or can it just forward
any audio using--

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.820
for example, [INAUDIBLE]
to the car audio?

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.800
GABRIEL PEAL: So right
now, just playing back

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.490
over the system media
stream would be sufficient.

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:51.920
And it will play through
the car audio system.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.390
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.120
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.230
I was curious, just
to be clear, is there

00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:59.190
anything we can do right now?

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:00.820
Are we able to get
that experience

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.640
you had on the tablet on our own
tablet so we can play around?

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.515
Is there any APIs open
right now or anything?

00:40:05.515 --> 00:40:07.598
GABRIEL PEAL: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:40:07.598 --> 00:40:08.670
It's a combination.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:11.860
So with the remote input
stuff, with Android

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.270
Wear because it's part of the
Android L platform release,

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:16.480
you can check that out.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.710
You can look at the
Android Wear documentation

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.390
for more information on that.

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:22.890
But we're going to have a lot
more information in the coming

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:24.541
months about
getting an emulator.

00:40:24.541 --> 00:40:26.540
You're not actually going
to need a car in order

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:28.740
to develop apps for the car.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.900
We'll definitely be providing
some sort of emulator

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.524
or something, so you can
develop apps for the car right

00:40:34.524 --> 00:40:35.410
on your computer.

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.939
But we're not actually
releasing any of the SDKs today.

00:40:38.939 --> 00:40:40.480
But definitely stay
tuned, we'll have

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.535
a lot more
information coming up.

00:40:41.535 --> 00:40:42.368
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:45.099 --> 00:40:46.640
AUDIENCE: You guys
referenced briefly

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.000
that users would be
switching between the Google

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.950
Auto and their native
head unit software.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.360
What's that transfer
going to be like from kind

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.175
of a user experience
perspective?

00:40:57.175 --> 00:40:58.550
ANDY BRENNER:
Yeah, that actually

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:00.900
varies based on the
manufacturer's implementation.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.950
It's up to manufacturer
to work on that transition

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.120
because, as Nick
mentioned, many cars

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.020
have very different
controls from each other.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.040
In some it's a touch
control, in others

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.960
it's button presses
on the head unit.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.150
So it depends on the automaker.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:17.670
We have best practices that
we work on the automaker with,

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.730
but we want it to be as
seamless as possible.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:23.010
And as Gabriel mentioned, if
you start media, for example,

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:24.660
in Android Auto
and then switch out

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.380
of Android Auto back
to the native system,

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.280
your audio will
continue to play.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.480
We still have audio focus, it's
called, even though the video

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.214
might be on the native system.

00:41:35.214 --> 00:41:37.005
AUDIENCE: So depending
on the manufacturer,

00:41:37.005 --> 00:41:40.376
it could be either a touch
button to switch or a hard key?

00:41:40.376 --> 00:41:41.500
ANDY BRENNER: That's right.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:42.042
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:42.042 --> 00:41:43.624
NICK PELLY: It may
also depend on what

00:41:43.624 --> 00:41:45.750
you were doing on the phone
before you plugged in,

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.776
for example.

00:41:47.776 --> 00:41:48.900
There's some context there.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.635
If you were navigating on Google
Maps before you plugged in,

00:41:51.635 --> 00:41:53.510
it would make more sense
to transfer straight

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:54.720
into Android Auto.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.934
But if you had your
phone screen off, maybe

00:41:56.934 --> 00:41:59.350
you just want to charge and
that's why you're plugging in.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:02.076
So there's some context there
to help us decide as well.

00:42:02.076 --> 00:42:04.120
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.470
AUDIENCE: So about the
audio service type thing.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:10.530
Obviously, most players
that want to play things

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:14.450
might not already have a service
that's running that does that.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.945
And almost all of them use
the remote control client

00:42:16.945 --> 00:42:19.365
to provide playback
controls on lock screen.

00:42:19.365 --> 00:42:23.510
So why the decision to make
a totally separate service

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.522
instead of reusing some
of those components?

00:42:25.522 --> 00:42:27.480
GABRIEL PEAL: So we
actually go far beyond what

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.240
you can do with the
remote control client

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.560
today in Android.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.820
We want to bring as much
of the app experience

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:35.010
as we can in a safe
way to the car.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.720
And it simply wasn't
a large enough API.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.280
But we include things like
menus, and custom app actions,

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.680
and stuff like that that
you wouldn't get support

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.120
for if we just used
remote control client.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.800
AUDIENCE: So the expectation is
that we have one service that

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.580
implements both the
remote control client

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.032
callbacks and these
callbacks as well?

00:42:55.032 --> 00:42:56.490
GABRIEL PEAL:
However you architect

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:59.127
the app is up to
each individual app.

00:42:59.127 --> 00:43:01.460
And it could depend, depending
on various implementation

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.140
details.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.140
But the overall
architecture, it will

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:10.130
live in some sort of
service inside of your app.

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.220
AUDIENCE: Hi, you guys kind of
mentioned that the connectivity

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.560
through the USB docking, right?

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:20.570
So when the phone connects,
it transfer to the auto mode.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.650
Will there be any
features in the phone

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:24.130
that get disabled at that time?

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:24.880
ANDY BRENNER: Yes.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.010
So as you can see if you come
for a demo on the third floor,

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.140
we lock out the phone.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.970
The phone screen is blank.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.250
We put up a-- I don't
know if we can right now.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.500
But you see a logo
on the screen,

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.700
we lock out the controls.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.400
The system bar at the bottom
and the status bar at the top

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.730
are both locked out.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.440
We want you to look
at the car screen.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.816
And we think we have a
great experience for you

00:43:46.816 --> 00:43:49.316
when you do that's more safe
than looking down at your phone

00:43:49.316 --> 00:43:50.796
when you should be driving.

00:43:50.796 --> 00:43:52.400
So yes, that's what we have.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.900
AUDIENCE: And then, what happens
to the Bluetooth interface?

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.834
Today, all car
manufacturers support

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.250
the Bluetooth
connectivity, right?

00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:59.041
ANDY BRENNER: Yeah.

00:43:59.041 --> 00:44:01.510
So as part of plugging
in your phone to the car,

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.350
it varies on the
manufacturer but we generally

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.190
will auto pair with the
manufacturer's Bluetooth.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.690
We use Bluetooth
for phone calls,

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:12.500
so that you can use your
car's Hangup and Answer

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.820
buttons on the
steering wheel as well.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:18.430
So you'll actually have an
enhanced Bluetooth experience

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:22.310
with Android Auto compared
without Android Auto.

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:23.400
So Bluetooth is used.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.260
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:29.640
AUDIENCE: So with the
fixed UI, how will it

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.390
impact the traditional
ways of the freemium

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:33.600
apps, which are ad-supported?

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.602
There's no place to
put on ad anymore.

00:44:36.602 --> 00:44:38.060
ANDY BRENNER: So
we don't think you

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.125
should be looking at
an ad on the screen.

00:44:41.125 --> 00:44:43.600
Kind of defeats the purpose
of what we're trying to do.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.830
So we'd not really support
putting an ad on the screen

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:49.000
while you're driving.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.445
But you can maybe
do an audio ad.

00:44:50.445 --> 00:44:52.350
And we have some
partners, like Pandora,

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:53.990
that do have a freemium model
that we'll show you that.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:55.531
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any information

00:44:55.531 --> 00:44:57.310
on whether your
current partners are

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:58.945
going to charge for
the car feature?

00:44:58.945 --> 00:45:01.070
ANDY BRENNER: That's up to
the individual partners.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.800
You'd have to talk with them.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.719
But they're using
their same APKs

00:45:05.719 --> 00:45:08.260
that you would find in the Play
Store with the same packages,

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.190
and they're just enhancing
them with this additional API

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:12.960
set and service that
we're talking about.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.150
So it's really up
to the developer

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:17.922
to decide how to
distribute their app

00:45:17.922 --> 00:45:19.630
and what business
model they want to use.

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:20.463
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:26.364 --> 00:45:28.530
AUDIENCE: So my question
is you guys mentioned a lot

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:32.380
about auto manufacturers
implementing this Android Auto

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.090
into their head units.

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.970
What about custom head units?
'm talking like big name--

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:38.255
Pioneer, things like that.

00:45:38.255 --> 00:45:40.520
Would we possibly
see those sooner?

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:44.210
ANDY BRENNER: So we have
nothing to announce right now.

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:47.600
Some of the companies you
mentioned, like Pioneer,

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.050
have joined the OAA, but we
have no product announcements

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:50.795
on that today.

00:45:50.795 --> 00:45:52.920
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.820
AUDIENCE: Any plans
for introducing

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:59.160
an SDK for
location-based services,

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.999
like navigation for example?

00:46:00.999 --> 00:46:01.790
ANDY BRENNER: Yeah.

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:04.510
So that's something that
we're not announcing today.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:08.350
We're focusing on media API and
messaging because we see those

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:11.730
as the first primary
actions that drivers

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.765
want to do while driving
that right now they

00:46:14.765 --> 00:46:17.590
use third-party apps for a ton.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.740
But we're looking at new
use cases for the future

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.640
and that's why we'd love to have
you join the Google+ community

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.906
that we had up on the screen.

00:46:25.906 --> 00:46:27.865
Might be still up
on the screen there.

00:46:27.865 --> 00:46:32.150
So if you go to that G+
community or scan the QR code,

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:35.180
we'd love to get your feedback
as a developer on what new use

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.080
cases we should support next.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.080
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:40.704
NICK PELLY: Or just come chat to
us, actually, the third floor.

00:46:40.704 --> 00:46:42.510
We'd love to just hear
the exact use cases.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.780
ANDY BRENNER: Totally.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:44.654
NICK PELLY: It will help
us really figure out

00:46:44.654 --> 00:46:47.550
what the right APIs
to open up next are.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:48.560
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.080
My question to that
is basically focused

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:55.060
in on navigation application
outside North America

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.270
and Europe.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:58.735
For example, in China
we don't have Google.

00:46:58.735 --> 00:47:00.360
ANDY BRENNER: Yeah,
those are certainly

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.580
questions we're working through.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:04.220
But we'd love as a
developer to hear

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.995
your feedback on
those type of things.

00:47:05.995 --> 00:47:06.493
AUDIENCE: OK, good.

00:47:06.493 --> 00:47:06.560
Thank you.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.451
ANDY BRENNER: Please
come talk to us.

00:47:08.451 --> 00:47:09.420
AUDIENCE: Hey, hello.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:14.090
You guys mentioned car data,
like compass, GPS, speed.

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:16.030
Will that be available
to other applications

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:19.752
via like a broadcast receiver
or an antenna, or something?

00:47:19.752 --> 00:47:20.460
NICK PELLY: Yeah.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.100
So GPS actually, we integrate
with the fuse location provider

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.720
if you know about
that on Android.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.460
So when we get GPS coming
in, that goes into the FLP

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.313
and is available to
all apps using the FLP.

00:47:32.313 --> 00:47:33.440
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.860
ANDY BRENNER: One thing that's
important though to note.

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.204
With FLP and with any other car
data that we were to open up,

00:47:39.204 --> 00:47:41.120
it would have to follow
the permissions model.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.150
So we're going to
have new permissions

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:45.560
if we have other
types of car data.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.120
For location, you obviously
have to have the location

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:48.920
permission.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.690
That's very important
for users because we

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:52.910
want to make sure that
if a user's downloading

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:55.120
and installing your
app, they opt-in

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.630
to allowing you to
use their car data.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:59.570
So that's a fundamental
part of Android

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:00.590
that we're not changing.

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:00.930
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:02.310
And one other thing to that.

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:04.690
If the phone is
plugged into the--

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:06.240
and you become in auto mode.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.610
What happens to non-auto
applications that

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.970
maybe are running in
the background services?

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:11.990
Are they killed?

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:14.509
Are they allowed to let run?

00:48:14.509 --> 00:48:16.550
NICK PELLY: It's still
running in the background,

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.830
but you can't launch activities
as Gabriel was saying.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.330
But they could still
run background services.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.450
AUDIENCE: Great,
thank you, guys.

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:26.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.570
So we're actually
actively working

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:30.430
on the Wear notifications.

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:33.230
And what I don't understand
is, if you've got that going,

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:34.960
will it translate
over to Auto, or do

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.086
you just have to do Auto
to then translate to Wear?

00:48:37.086 --> 00:48:39.335
ANDY BRENNER: That's actually
an interesting question.

00:48:39.335 --> 00:48:40.940
It's not only a
technical question,

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:45.200
it's also a user experience
and product question.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.480
When you're walking around
with your Wear device,

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.370
we actually want you to get
pretty much any notification

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:53.190
that's appropriate for the user.

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:57.636
But with Wear, a
lot of notifications

00:48:57.636 --> 00:48:58.510
are not filtered out.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:01.560
But in Auto, we do think it's
very important that you only

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.350
get notifications that are
appropriate for the context

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:05.920
of driving.

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.720
So there's definitely going to
have to be a curation process.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.720
AUDIENCE: It's a subset.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.520
ANDY BRENNER: It's
a subset, exactly.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.311
AUDIENCE: For sure.

00:49:11.311 --> 00:49:12.690
But the thing I'm wondering--

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:14.710
ANDY BRENNER: From a
technical perspective?

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:17.380
AUDIENCE: If we're
developing right now for Wear

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:20.340
and this Auto stuff makes sense
for a couple of the things

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.540
we're already developing,
like how quickly can we

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.870
translate between the two?

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:25.560
Or can I combine that effort?

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:29.190
ANDY BRENNER: It
should be trivial.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:32.340
With the latest version of the
Android Wear documentation,

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.570
there's a new extension
for notifications

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:38.510
where you can extend
them with Wear extenders.

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:41.330
We may have a similar
thing for car extenders.

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:44.110
So you can add additional
options to an existing

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:46.400
notification, but it would
be as simple as adding

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.264
a few lines of code
to some existing code

00:49:48.264 --> 00:49:49.180
that you already have.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.471
AUDIENCE: And then timing-wise.

00:49:50.471 --> 00:49:53.110
So Wear stuff is available now.

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:56.810
We're hoping to have that
released, say in August.

00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:59.159
And then Auto stuff would come--

00:49:59.159 --> 00:50:00.200
ANDY BRENNER: Stay tuned.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:00.908
NICK PELLY: Soon.

00:50:00.908 --> 00:50:03.390
AUDIENCE: And we just flip
it with a few lines of code

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:03.870
is what you're saying?

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:04.335
GABRIEL PEAL: Pretty much.

00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:04.680
ANDY BRENNER: Correct.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.914
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:50:05.914 --> 00:50:07.830
ANDY BRENNER: I think
we're about out of time.

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.360
But if you have
additional questions,

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.818
please visit us on
the third floor.

00:50:10.818 --> 00:50:14.060
We'd be more than happy to
talk with you individually.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:16.070
Thanks a lot.
