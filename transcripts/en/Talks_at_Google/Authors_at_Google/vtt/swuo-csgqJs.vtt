MICHAEL BROOKS:
So again, welcome.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.770
I'm glad to see you guys here.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.661
I appreciate you taking
time out to be here today.

00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:08.160
I'm really excited
to be here today.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.950
And this is my excited
face, by the way.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.956
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:12.080
It's close to my calm face.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.610
But it's amazing to
see a corporation that

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.440
promotes wellness so
much in an organization.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.920
I've worked in technology.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.950
I work right now in
technology and in corporations

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.330
for the last 20 years.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
So to see the establishment
like this, or what they promote

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.940
or what they provide for
you guys is quite inspiring.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.180
And I do hope that this catches
on to more organizations

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.790
and that they promote wellness.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.410
It's such an integral part.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.700
I think-- I was
reflecting on it earlier--

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.460
that it's acknowledging
the entire person.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.960
Right?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.870
You're not just a
being here doing work.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.890
There's a spiritual side to
you, a wellness side to you,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.190
a human side to you.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.630
So it's nice to see
that in an organization.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.300
So I'm going to talk today
for about 30 or 45 minutes.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.200
I'd really prefer this
be a conversation.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.390
I've been told sometimes
people don't ask questions,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.420
but I hope people
will ask questions.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.880
Some of this information
around mindful and meditation,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.560
it's kind of esoteric.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.860
It's kind of a loaded term,
both of them-- meditation,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.100
mindfulness, yoga, happiness.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.010
All of these things
are loaded these days.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.190
So clarification to me is key.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.470
Definitions are key.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.230
So if something is
not clear, or if you

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.390
want to talk a little
bit more about something,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.070
please raise your hand.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.950
We do have a microphone.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.700
And one of my
friends in the back

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.770
will pass that around to you.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.400
Please do ask questions
as we go through.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.540
All right.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.530
So I wrote this little
pamphlet last year,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.442
had it published,
about mindfulness.

00:01:41.442 --> 00:01:43.400
And I'm going to speak
to the concepts in this.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.650
I'm not going to be reading
from the book or anything.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.760
But I'll be speaking
to this quite a bit.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.510
The focus on the book is
really around meditation

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.610
and mindfulness, my
experience with it.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.690
I've been practicing meditation
for about 20 years, mindfulness

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.450
for probably about 12 years.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.300
And I also teach weekly classes.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.840
So what I say from this
work is that I did the work.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.990
I've done the work with
meditation and mindfulness.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.140
And I've helped a lot
of people along the way.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.681
And I've learned a
tremendous amount.

00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:14.360
And I'm still
continuing to learn.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.280
There's no into your learning
with meditation or mindfulness.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.690
So it's just based on my
experience and my practice

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.600
and with helping out others.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.970
So it's evolving process.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.680
Meditation practice,
mindless-- it's a journey.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.855
There's no end to it.

00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:32.230
We have these ideas, I think,
that we'll reach happiness,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.390
or we'll reach a point and it'll
all be good or will be done.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.710
But what I've found,
in my experience,

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.845
is that it just continues.

00:02:38.845 --> 00:02:40.190
It just deepens.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.720
And that's very exciting
to me-- that there's

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.790
no endpoint to any of it.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.800
You can just continue to
grow and evolve and learn.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.060
And with peace or
whatever you find

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.230
for meditation, that could
just deepen over time.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.370
So I just have a few
notes to get started.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.410
I don't really prepare
for these talks.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.940
I just like to let it flow
however people want to talk

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.620
or whatever we
want to talk about.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.858
But there's just a few things
I wanted to start with.

00:03:08.858 --> 00:03:12.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
mindfulness

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.784
for 12 years and meditation for
15, or the other way around?

00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:18.700
MICHAEL BROOKS: Yeah,
about 20 for meditation,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.710
12 for mindfulness.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.370
AUDIENCE: I'm just wondering,
because the two things are

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.350
really connected, right?

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.974
You could probably
say that mindfulness

00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:27.200
is a consequence of
meditation or a form of it?

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.777
Just curious to see how
you distinguish the two?

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:30.610
MICHAEL BROOKS: Yes.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.040
And I will get to
that in just a moment.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.160
It's a great question.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.150
So definitions are
incredibly important to me.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.772
And so I will get
to that exactly--

00:03:37.772 --> 00:03:39.480
to define the difference
between the two,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.070
or how they're actually very
similar, but good observation.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.170
So I want to talk really quickly
about just my background.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.300
As I said, I've been practicing
meditation for about 20 years.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.760
I was initially interested,
mainly for spiritual reasons.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.980
I don't teach for
spiritual anything.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.380
I teach for whatever
people want to learn

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.759
or how meditation and
mindfulness help them with.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.300
So a lot of people
come to my classes

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.470
with anxiety, with
stress, what have you.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.170
That's all fine.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.750
Meditation, mindfulness,
can help with all of that.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.430
If you use it for a spiritual
practice, that's fantastic.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.180
For me, it's a cornerstone
of my practice.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.700
So I leave it open for anyone.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.730
But my interest in it initially
came from a spiritual seeking.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.350
When I started with
meditation-- again,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.500
20 odd years ago--
what I initially found

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.280
was that it was really hard.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.980
Meditation's tough.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.910
And I like to say that up
front, because a lot of people

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.910
sit down with this idea.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.730
They'll sit down and they're
supposed to meditate.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.340
You see a picture of someone
meditating on a beach,

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.715
and you're like,
oh, I want that.

00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:38.630
I want to be there.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.240
And what they don't show
you is the photographer

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.120
on the other side, and the
model is sitting there hungry,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.953
wanting a sandwich,
wishing the person would

00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:46.450
take a picture so they
could get up and stretch.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.980
So there's perceptions, right?

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.070
So I wanted that.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.020
But I was just drawn to it.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.410
And I continued to work
with it, with meditation.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.600
Now, here's where I do get
into definitions around this.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.780
So I have a very
conservative view

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.730
on what meditation
and mindfulness are.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.150
For me, as I said
earlier, meditation

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.850
is a bit of a loaded term.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.400
It's used a lot.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.650
To me, there's
meditation and there's

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.250
more like relaxation techniques.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.450
To me, meditation
is sitting down

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.190
with a formal practice,
whatever works for you,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.082
working to try and
get the mind quiet,

00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:25.790
to where you're not
indulging in thought,

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.550
to where you're not
honoring thought.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.930
And that's why
this is a practice.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.220
This takes time.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.590
And to sit down, find
a technique that works,

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.920
whatever works for you--
there are people that chant.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.350
There are people that repeat
mantras over and over.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.100
There's all types of
techniques out there.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.474
So look at different ones and
try one that works for you.

00:05:45.474 --> 00:05:48.090
But the intent of meditation
is to get to a point

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.950
where your mind is quiet--
as I mentioned earlier,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.510
not indulging in thought,
not honoring thought.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.211
So getting to a point
where, when you first

00:05:56.211 --> 00:05:58.460
start meditating, you start
to understand that there's

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.900
this constant churn
going on in your head,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.710
this constant commentary driving
you forward through life,

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.330
just always evaluating,
experiencing the world,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.837
talking, always going on.

00:06:08.837 --> 00:06:10.670
And what you're trying
to do with meditation

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.620
is kind of carve
through that just

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.190
to stop, get out of all that
for a brief period of time,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.377
to cut through it.

00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:19.960
And meditation
technique is giving you

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.530
something to focus
and concentrate on

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.729
so that you're not caught up
in the churn all the time.

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:25.520
So you're focusing.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.330
You have a focal point to try
and quiet all that churn down

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.520
and get to a point
where you're quiet.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.700
When you first get
started, more than likely,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.100
you're just going to have a
moment or two of stillness.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.967
And in those moments, hopefully
what you'll experience,

00:06:37.967 --> 00:06:39.550
what I experienced--
what kept driving

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.580
me forward was in that
moment, everything was OK.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.780
The world was OK.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.960
I was not against the world.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.168
The world was not against me.

00:06:48.168 --> 00:06:49.464
I was not against myself.

00:06:49.464 --> 00:06:50.380
It was just stillness.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.254
And in that stillness
was a tremendous amount

00:06:52.254 --> 00:06:54.090
of peace and contentment.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.860
That only lasted
a second or two.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.750
But it was enough.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.360
Like, oh shit, this rocks.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.240
I'm doing this.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.600
And meditation is a practice.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.480
So like with anything,
the more you practice,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.040
the better you'll become.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.950
Now, what I started to
internalize and understand,

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.460
and what really
screwed me, I think,

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.510
was that I rationalized, if I
can have a moment of stillness

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.920
and peace, why can't I have
a minute, five minutes, 10

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.750
minutes, or an entire day when
my mind was quiet all day long?

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.600
Why couldn't I do that?

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.320
So I intuitively knew I could.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.610
So I worked on meditation
for a number of years.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.068
I really didn't know much about
my mindfulness at the time.

00:07:34.068 --> 00:07:36.599
I was more focused just
on formal meditation.

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:38.890
I think it was around the
time that "The Power of Now."

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.690
came out-- Jon Kabat-Zinn
had written a few books,

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.020
"Full Catastrophe Living"-- and
I started reading those that it

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.260
started to resonate, this
idea of mindfulness--

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.930
throughout the day, trying
to get your mind quiet,

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.280
to try and be in
the present moment.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.020
Present moment
awareness was amazing.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.940
I loved it.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.130
It was fantastic.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.890
It really shifted me
and changed me a lot.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.890
But it still didn't
take care of that churn.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.030
I was still having that churn.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.390
This idea of being present,
being in the moment,

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.950
not living in the future
or the past was great,

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.900
and it allowed me to be more
focused and more centered,

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.900
but I still had
that churn going on.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.960
There was still
judgments, evaluations,

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.870
conversations going on.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.945
And so what I wanted to do
was get rid of all that,

00:08:21.945 --> 00:08:23.320
because that's
really what you're

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.890
doing in meditation-- trying
to carve away at all of that

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.700
to get to a point of quiet.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.289
What I went to and learned
from after the mindfulness

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.044
with "The Power of Now"
and things like that was I

00:08:36.044 --> 00:08:39.330
looked at [INAUDIBLE] yoga,
which is just a spiritual path.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.400
It's a lot of self inquiry
is what it's doing,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.240
it's focused on.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.310
It's jut a lot of looking
inward, asking yourself, who

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.310
are you, this type of thing.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.690
What I did at that
time is one thing

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.280
that I advocate everyone do.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.880
And I continually do it.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.680
Start becoming aware of
what you're thinking.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.900
Just what are you thinking
throughout the day?

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.060
Where is your mind hanging out?

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.800
So this churn that
was going on, when

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.160
I stepped back and started to
become aware of it-- what was I

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:09.770
thinking?

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:10.950
When was I thinking it?

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.140
What was going on?

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.150
What was the result
of thinking this?

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.670
So much of what we think
is tied to our emotions.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.260
So if we're thinking about
something absent mindedly

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.534
that upsets us or is
depressing or something,

00:09:23.534 --> 00:09:25.200
that's going to go
on for a few minutes.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.580
And before you know it,
you're kind of depressed.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.937
But you may not realize why.

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:32.520
You may just come
up with some reason.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.640
Oh, it's just a bad day.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.350
But if you can
reflect back on it,

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.400
oh, for the last
10 minutes, I was

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.800
thinking about this
horrible break up and all

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.425
these bad relationships,
and I'll never

00:09:40.425 --> 00:09:42.960
have a happy relationship,
and I should just give up now.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.140
It's like, whoa, I
don't need to do that.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.260
There's just an awareness
of that going on.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.790
So the fascinating
thing, and what

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.540
I write about in the
book-- it's basically

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.760
what my book is
about, 80% of this--

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.980
is starting to become aware of
what's going on, that churn.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.750
What's happening?

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.620
And when you're able
to do that, when you're

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.300
able to figure out
what's happening,

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.060
you can start to deconstruct it.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.040
And then you can stop doing it.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.800
You can stop indulging in it.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.280
The fascinating thing
I realized probably

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.750
three or four years ago,
after all this time-- so much

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.630
of thought is a habit.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.680
Many of our thought patterns
or things that we focus on,

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.570
the way our mind hangs
out, it's a habit.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.940
Habits can be broken.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.540
They can be stopped.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.790
So in using this over
the years-- and this

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.300
took years and years
of work-- I was

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.190
able to start
deconstructing these things.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.080
What was nice was that each
one of these things that

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.160
would come up in my
mind throughout the day

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.550
would throw me off a little bit.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.720
So I wanted to stay on a
continuum more of peace.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.680
But if my mind is
busy making judgments,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.720
evaluating, doing
all these things,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.410
that pulls me away, either
into lower states of mind

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.200
or maybe higher states of mind.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.340
But I had no control over it.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.760
So I became obsessive.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.960
And I was constantly monitoring
my thoughts all day long,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.760
wanting to see,
where did my mind go?

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.000
What did it do?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.540
What were its habits,
and how I could stop

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.440
doing some of these things.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.870
So back to your question about
meditation and mindfulness,

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.390
to me, formal meditation
is sitting down to stop

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.350
and trying to get
mind quiet, trying

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.890
not to indulge in
all that chatter,

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.790
trying to cut through
it to get quiet.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.980
Mindfulness-- opposite side
of the same coin-- all day

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.220
long, trying to
keep the mind quiet

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.155
and still, with an
awareness of what's

00:11:32.155 --> 00:11:34.530
going on so you can start to
deconstruct that so that you

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.390
don't indulge in those
thought patterns anymore

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.340
and you can sustain
a more peaceful state

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.850
of mind all day long.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.010
So you just have a
continuum is really

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.412
what I'm trying to get
to and what I focus on.

00:11:47.412 --> 00:11:49.960
Of course, life is difficult.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.640
There are ups and downs.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.722
You have to ride the
waves of the world.

00:11:53.722 --> 00:11:54.930
I live and work in the world.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.480
I don't hide in a
monastery somewhere.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.337
And that's a wonderful training
ground, being in the world--

00:12:00.337 --> 00:12:01.670
especially in corporate America.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.972
Oh my god-- politics, work,
challenges, 100 hour weeks.

00:12:06.972 --> 00:12:08.930
I know you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.429
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:11.281
But I've been there.

00:12:11.281 --> 00:12:11.780
Yeah.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.000
I know how that works.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.410
So this-- focusing on the
mindfulness over the years

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.960
and starting to deconstruct
these things-- freed me up

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.264
from so much of
those states of mind,

00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:25.180
those negative things
that would draw me down,

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.550
that would connect me with the
world, that get me frustrated,

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.310
keep me in a difficult state.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:35.140
So I want to talk about
some of these today.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.500
But are there any other
questions before I get started?

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.680
That's just kind of
the basics of where

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.530
I start with meditation
and mindfulness.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.662
And I was warned people
won't ask questions.

00:12:46.662 --> 00:12:47.620
But I do encourage you.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.828
If you have a question, more
than likely someone else

00:12:49.828 --> 00:12:52.070
has a similar question
or the same question.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.670
So if you do have a
question, just let me know.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.215
But does that seem pretty
clear, just about mindfulness

00:12:57.215 --> 00:12:59.479
and meditation?

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:01.270
It is a little bit of
a different approach.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.228
I know there's a lot out
there with mindfulness

00:13:03.228 --> 00:13:05.010
just about present
moment awareness.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.150
But to me, there's so much more.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.260
There's a lot more
to deconstruct.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.900
But the beautiful thing is the
more you take and deconstruct

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.320
those things, the
more present you are.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.420
And there's a deepening with it.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.730
And it's not to say that
your life's circumstances are

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:22.930
going to get better.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.042
But you can weather it
a lot more peacefully.

00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:29.250
There is still going to be
up and downs in your life.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.520
But if you're able to contain
a more content, peaceful state

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.530
of mind, you're not going
to be driven by it so much,

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.800
driven down, or driven
all over the place.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.190
You can stay at a bit
of an equilibrium.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:41.760
Yes.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.379
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:44.670
MICHAEL BROOKS: Oh, real quick.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.365
Sorry.

00:13:45.365 --> 00:13:46.870
Microphone-- thank you.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.620
AUDIENCE: Sorry if I
missed this because I

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.470
was late, but in
deconstructing things,

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.840
is there ever a
danger of bringing up

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.439
negative emotions that you might
not have the capacity to deal

00:13:57.439 --> 00:13:58.480
with at any certain time?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.813
Do you have to be careful
about when you go and approach

00:14:00.813 --> 00:14:01.740
those things?

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.990
MICHAEL BROOKS: Good question.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.550
To do this work,
you have to have

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.440
a tremendous amount of patience
and compassion with yourself.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.460
We have this idea that
we need to be perfect.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.520
And we're not.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.440
And we beat ourselves up a
lot around that, most people.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.690
Life is a process.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:22.880
Meditation is a process.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.770
Mindfulness is a process.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.890
You will find, when you
start paying attention

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.560
to these different
trends and patterns--

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.935
there are some that I want to
talk about in a minute that

00:14:30.935 --> 00:14:31.840
are kind of general.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.881
But what you'll find is
some of the bigger things

00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:36.080
do start to come up.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.210
Sometimes, they're hidden.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.460
You didn't just pay attention
to them for a long time.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.876
Or you kind of
know they're there,

00:14:40.876 --> 00:14:43.760
but you don't want
to look at it.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.600
There comes a time,
when you start

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.520
deconstructing these, where
you can no longer ignore it.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.370
It gets too loud.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.070
So for me, my big thing--
and I had a very big issue.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:57.510
I had a tremendous amount
of anger in my consciousness

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.700
all the time.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.010
And it took me a while to be
able to see it, to accept it,

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.500
to start to deal with it.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.400
These smaller things that I
want to talk about in a moment--

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.230
some of these initial things
you can do-- are pretty easy,

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.110
and they're kind of fun, in
a weird way, to deconstruct.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.800
But when it gets to
the bigger things,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.780
yeah, that can take a while.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.250
And there were times that
I was ready to walk away.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.110
I couldn't handle it.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.340
What I learned to do was, from
a very scientific-- all of you

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.920
guys are smart, analytical.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.940
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't I

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.660
started to turn it into a game.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.750
Let me figure out
what's going on here.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.680
So with the anger,
when would it come up?

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.360
What were the different flavors?

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.900
What were the triggers?

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.620
In what circumstances?

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.200
Was it more jealousy focused?

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.440
Was it more control focused?

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.930
Was it a fear thing?

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.100
What was going on there?

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.350
And some of these things,
what I started to recognize

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.880
was I could deconstruct those
pretty fast, some of them.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.180
I could spot what it was--
and, OK, let's not do that.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.430
Let's break that habit.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.810
You have to go down to
a level of something

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.370
to understand why
you're doing it.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.370
And it's usually never
as bad as we think it is.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.040
But understand why it's there.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.210
Once you are really able to
face it, it loses it's power.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.890
You don't have to
indulge in it anymore.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.390
But there was a time, yeah, I
didn't know which way to go.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.629
I had this whole world
of anger in my head.

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:18.670
And it was never outward.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.496
It was always inward-- angry at
myself and angry at the world.

00:16:22.496 --> 00:16:25.250
It really pissed me off,
having all that anger.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.950
It shouldn't be this hard.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.130
And this is why I'm
such an advocate for it.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.220
It changed my life tremendously.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.380
There were many-- I don't
want to say dark days.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.800
There were dark years.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.250
It was difficult.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.750
I did go to a
counselor for a while.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.460
I found a therapist,
because none of my friends

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.400
are going to tel me the truth.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.225
My family's not going
to tell me the truth.

00:16:45.225 --> 00:16:48.180
And I wouldn't want to put
them through that, either.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.370
I care for them too much.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.590
It would get personal.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.610
So I found a therapist.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.380
The guy was great.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:55.990
He had a mohawk.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.573
And I'm like, oh, I
can deal with you.

00:16:57.573 --> 00:16:59.330
You're great.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.840
You would be a great therapist.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.300
I saw him for a
while, and he was

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.010
willing to point out
those things to me.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.869
Just in conversation, he was
able to-- why do you do this?

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:07.660
Why do you do that?

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.020
Where's this?

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.561
Where's that?

00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:12.130
And it totally opened my
eyes up to certain things.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.800
I became very
strategic about it.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.990
I hiked every weekend.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:19.089
Nature is amazing to help clear
you out and calm you down.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:21.504
I was out in nature every
weekend, just religiously.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.760
But there comes a
point where you're just

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.550
willing to look at it.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.010
To me, I had no alternative.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.170
I knew too much, if you would.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.410
There was only getting through
it that would take care of it,

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.270
being willing to look at it.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.592
So yeah, it can be difficult.

00:17:38.592 --> 00:17:40.050
You're going to
have stuff come up.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.660
And I know people have different
difficult childhoods-- abusive,

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.380
all kinds of stuff, issues,
and things of that nature.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.490
If it gets to be too much,
then I would say seek out help.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.760
Find someone-- a
therapist, a counselor--

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.365
someone that you can work
with or talk to about it.

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:56.906
But the beautiful
thing-- and while I

00:17:56.906 --> 00:17:58.770
was going through this,
while it was so difficult,

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.370
at least I knew I
was working on it.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.110
At least I was trying.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.640
And there would be gaps in
time where I'd walk away.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.205
I just couldn't deal
with it anymore.

00:18:07.205 --> 00:18:08.830
I would try and keep
myself distracted.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:12.340
But it was always at the
back of my attention there.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.400
But because I was able to A,
get quiet through meditation,

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.240
and B, take care of some
of these smaller things

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.370
that I'll talk about in a
moment, I knew it was possible.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.630
I knew I could do it.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.000
And it was hard to
deny that truth.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.170
But everyone's different.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.590
For me, I knew I
needed to do it,

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.050
because I knew it
could get better.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.800
And I was just willing
to do what it took.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.280
But it wasn't pretty.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.240
But that's my thing.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.050
And that also taught me, though,
everyone's got their thing.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.260
Everyone's got their thing.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.426
And it teaches you a
tremendous amount of compassion

00:18:46.426 --> 00:18:47.470
for people in the world.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.887
Everyone's got their thing
that they're trying to work on.

00:18:49.887 --> 00:18:51.761
And everyone's trying
to do the best they can

00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:53.280
with what they
have, in my opinion.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.790
So how can I even
judge another person?

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.440
I don't live in that world.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.180
If I can help in some
way, that's great.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.140
But good question.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.080
Any other questions?

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.130
OK.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.860
So some of these
things that I initially

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:15.120
saw when I was paying attention,
monitoring my thoughts-- there

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.570
are certain patterns that
pretty much everyone indulges

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:22.070
in-- judgments, expectations,
focusing on the future

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.960
and on the past.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.567
That's typical with mindfulness.

00:19:24.567 --> 00:19:26.150
But judgments were
really interesting.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.100
When I started to
notice judgments,

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.059
just being aware
of what judgments

00:19:30.059 --> 00:19:31.600
I was making, when
I was making them,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.080
how often they would come up,
it was freaking incessant.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.510
They were happening all
the time-- good, bad, ugly.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.150
What's interesting
that you'll notice

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.280
when you engage in a judgment
against something in the world,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.960
it either kind of boosts
your ego up a little bit

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.490
or it pushes you
down a little bit.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.100
So if I'm trying to keep a
constant of just peace-- again,

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.600
I don't like to say "happy"--
just kind of peace and content

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.870
all day long, each time I would
engage in these judgments would

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.370
cause a ripple in that.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.380
And a lot of times, they
would feed on each other.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.950
So if I noticed with a
judgment against something,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.390
I started to see that this
was a bit of an equation.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:14.180
And a lot of these things are
these interesting paradigms.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.730
If I make a judgment
against something

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.400
in the world-- a person--
it's basically boosting my ego

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.160
up a little bit.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.940
I'm better than that.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.570
I have the right to judge that.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.190
It's good or it's bad.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:33.030
My attitude, my ego
is superior enough

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.470
to be able to judge
something else

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.490
as a good thing or a bad thing.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.670
And I'm not talking about
ethics or morals here.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:42.450
This is just ugly, not
ugly, lazy, whatever.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.560
And it boosted my
ego up a little bit--

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.090
that I am entitled be
able to judge that person.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.790
Conversely, if I had a
judgment against me--

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:55.690
I'm not worthy enough of that or
I'm a bad person-- it pushed me

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.220
down.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.670
So when it pushed my ego up,
it gave me a very false sense

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.960
of security and control.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.190
We don't have any control.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.648
We have a nice
illusion of control,

00:21:04.648 --> 00:21:06.210
but we have no control, really.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.660
We can control our states
of mind and our actions,

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.900
and that's about it.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.910
So it boost my ego up
and make my perception

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.770
of the world a
little bit stronger,

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.440
made me a little
bit more combative.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.800
I know better.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.090
I have the right to judge
that thing, that person, that

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.730
experience.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:24.750
It is what it is.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.460
It doesn't need my judgment.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.370
It exists as it is.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.080
And it's perfect as it is.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.620
I don't need to indulge in that.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.050
So that was one
small thing that I

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.070
did that I was able to
just drop from doing.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.590
And when you start seeing
how many judgments you make

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.560
in a day, it's fascinating.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.470
They're happening all the time.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.570
And if you can let go of
that, it frees up that space.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.320
You don't have to
indulge in that.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.909
Or you don't have to
push yourself down.

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:51.950
You don't have to compare
yourself to anyone else

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.990
or to the world.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.240
So that's just
one example of how

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.420
you would indulge in
thoughts that drive you

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.210
off course, if you will.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:03.800
Any questions?

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.630
Yeah.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.529
Let me-- oh.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.810
AUDIENCE: Why does the mind
beat me up about mistakes?

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:23.130
It's like there's probably a
mistake I made some time ago,

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.720
and there are things I've
done to fix it and all that.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.960
But it's like I keep
going back and revisiting.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.610
Is it trying to
teach me a lesson?

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:38.674
Why does it make me go
back and relive the moment?

00:22:38.674 --> 00:22:40.340
MICHAEL BROOKS: Is
it a specific mistake

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.780
that you're going back to?

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.546
Or is it a recurring one?

00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:44.920
AUDIENCE: No, like
three or four.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.450
It doesn't matter.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.804
I feel like I'm always
drawn to previous events.

00:22:49.804 --> 00:22:51.845
And maybe I'm trying to
learn from them so that I

00:22:51.845 --> 00:22:53.053
don't make the mistake again.

00:22:53.053 --> 00:22:57.230
But it's always pulling me back.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:00.889
And these thoughts come up at
random times, and I don't why.

00:23:00.889 --> 00:23:01.930
MICHAEL BROOKS: Well, OK.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:06.710
So pay attention
when it does come up.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:07.210
Pardon me.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.380
What you may find are there
are certain triggers that

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.200
cause those things to happen.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.390
It could be the environment.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:17.730
It could be people
who you're around.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.280
It could be people
you're talking to.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.405
You just want to start to
understand the landscape.

00:23:21.405 --> 00:23:23.790
When these things come up,
what's going on in my life?

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:27.250
And am I under a
lot of pressure?

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.700
Do I have a fear
of failure, which

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.270
is what this maybe sounds like.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.814
What's the fear of failure?

00:23:31.814 --> 00:23:32.605
Why are you afraid?

00:23:32.605 --> 00:23:34.570
And who's going to
judge that failure?

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.860
What are you comparing
yourself against

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.530
to think that it's a failure?

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.569
Now, with mistakes and
looking back in the past,

00:23:40.569 --> 00:23:42.110
there's nothing we
can do about that.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:46.180
However, what you can do is
make peace with what you did.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.600
At that point in time, in the
past, you made a judgment.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.940
You did something.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.470
And at that point
in time, you thought

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.580
it was the right thing to do.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.154
So how can you blame yourself?

00:23:58.154 --> 00:23:59.820
It turned out not to
be the right thing,

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.174
but you learned from it.

00:24:01.174 --> 00:24:03.590
So you can forgive yourself
and say, at that point in time

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.342
in the past, I thought I
was doing the right thing.

00:24:06.342 --> 00:24:08.300
It turned out not to be,
but I learned a lesson

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.190
and I'm not going
to do that again.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:14.710
So there's a point where you can
just forgive yourself for it,

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.332
if you're willing to do it.

00:24:16.332 --> 00:24:18.040
I'm not going to make
that mistake again.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.490
I'm sad that it happened,
but at that point in time,

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.270
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.430
I learned from it.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.390
So just a letting go--
again, it comes back

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.490
to this compassion
and this patience.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.240
Now, looking back at some of
these things can be hard to do,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.140
sometimes.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.730
But if you start
to see that there's

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.570
a connection between these
different mistakes-- they have

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.840
a similar flavor to them--
you can start to examine,

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.870
is it really a fear of failure?

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.650
Is it a fear of
letting somebody down?

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:50.619
And why is that?

00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:51.660
Who are you letting down?

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.989
What are you afraid of?

00:24:52.989 --> 00:24:54.530
And that's where
you have to just dig

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.600
in and start looking at it.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.680
You'll feel it emotionally.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.940
But again, I can't
stress this enough.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.270
You have to be very
compassionate when you do it.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.770
You're trying to let
got of that, in a way.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:12.380
So take the time to realize
when is it coming up?

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.200
Try and understand
what the pattern is.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.630
When do these thoughts come up?

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.360
What specific situation?

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.829
And so more than likely, it's
tied to some kind of situation

00:25:21.829 --> 00:25:22.370
in your life.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.610
At the time it's coming
up, it's probably

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.930
tied to something that's
going on that same time.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.680
And there may just
be a carryover fear

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.730
of making a mistake
for this mistake.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.849
But I would just say understand
that when you did what you did,

00:25:35.849 --> 00:25:37.640
you thought you were
doing the right thing,

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.639
and you learned from it?

00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:42.020
So what else can you do?

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.670
It's where you keep making the
same mistake over and over,

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.419
daily, then that's
something you want

00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:47.710
to really spend some time with.

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.960
But if it's just
something in the past--

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.642
I understand regrets,
but there comes

00:25:53.642 --> 00:25:55.350
a time where you just
have to make amends

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.010
with it, with yourself.

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:58.480
And that's really
all that matters.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.896
You just have to
forgive yourself,

00:25:59.896 --> 00:26:02.300
if that's the right word to use.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.672
Does that help?

00:26:03.672 --> 00:26:04.920
All right.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.260
Good question, though.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:13.550
Any other questions
along this line?

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.410
OK.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.440
So another thing that
I found fascinating

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.830
when I was starting to pay
attention to the chatter that

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:23.420
was going on was expectations.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.095
This one was hysterical
to me, because I daydream.

00:26:27.095 --> 00:26:31.800
I come up all kinds of
stuff, or I used to.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.760
Expectations-- similar
kind of paradigm.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.464
In this moment
right now, I'm going

00:26:37.464 --> 00:26:39.755
to project into the future--
over which I have control,

00:26:39.755 --> 00:26:43.100
but I like to think I do--
some future situation that's

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:47.690
going to happen, a date,
maybe Friday night.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.200
It's going to go great.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.980
It's going to be really good.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.200
And in my mind, I'm
going to play out

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.447
that entire date in my head.

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.905
And I'm going to experience
all the wonderful emotions that

00:26:57.905 --> 00:27:02.220
are going to go on at
that time in the future.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.520
And it's not just
a one time thing.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.710
Between now and Friday,
which is only a day,

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.820
I'm going to start coming
up with other scenarios

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.717
over and over again.

00:27:11.717 --> 00:27:13.550
It's going to take up
a lot of my attention.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:15.370
I'm going to come up with all
these different avenues, how

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.330
everything's going to go,
what they're going to say,

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:18.490
what I'm going to respond to.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:19.580
Ill be so witty and charming.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.280
They'll look this way.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.071
I'll look that way.

00:27:21.071 --> 00:27:23.680
Of course, it's
going to be great.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.900
How often does that work out?

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.490
So that moment
arrives in the future.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.676
How often does it play out to
one of those scripts exactly?

00:27:33.676 --> 00:27:35.170
Ever?

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.820
Anyone?

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:41.226
And what's funny is that at
that time in the future, when

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:43.350
you were planning all this
stuff out in the future,

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.810
you weren't thinking
at that time

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.810
that as that was going
on that you would

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:48.630
be going through head, trying
to figure out all these scripts

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.020
and trying to match and figure
out what the next thing to do

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.520
is.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.830
You were just having a great
time in the future there.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.680
So it doesn't even match up
to what you were planning.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.190
So expectations can be
really interesting as well.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.670
How often do you do
this as opposed to just

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.750
letting an experience
happen organically?

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.031
Now, you can prepare for it.

00:28:09.031 --> 00:28:09.530
Great.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:10.650
Get dressed, look nice.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.340
Yeah.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.440
But just let it play out.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.750
Organic experiences are
so much more interesting

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.890
than trying to force something
to happen over which you really

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:20.530
have no control.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:25.080
So it can become a bit of
a game when that happens.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.834
So I did this all the time.

00:28:26.834 --> 00:28:28.250
And it took up a
tremendous amount

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:31.482
of time and my consciousness.

00:28:31.482 --> 00:28:33.440
And it would go down all
these different routes

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.161
whenever I would plan
one of these things out.

00:28:37.161 --> 00:28:37.910
It would go great.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.460
It would go down.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.770
But I would experience all
these emotions in this moment.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:46.210
But that date's not
happening in this moment.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.720
This is what's
happening, only this,

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.050
hence the title of my book.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.336
There's only ever this moment.

00:28:53.336 --> 00:28:55.210
So there was a willingness
to let go of that.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:59.330
To see the results of doing
that over and over again just

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.690
didn't help.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.510
So I let go of it.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.510
And now, I catch myself.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.050
I was about to
engage in it again.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:07.680
Just don't do it.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.600
It's a habit.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.830
Just refrain from doing it.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:13.410
And see what it's like.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.735
So when I was able to let
go of these smaller things,

00:29:15.735 --> 00:29:19.370
the world got a lot more easier.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.970
My mind was pretty much
calm most of the day.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.990
But going back to your point,
when I started taking apart

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.680
these smaller things,
little habits,

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.050
the bigger things
started to show up.

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:35.420
And I recommend just
slowly, gradually

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.400
starting to look at those.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.278
They take however long they
need to take to unravel.

00:29:41.278 --> 00:29:42.608
Yeah?

00:29:42.608 --> 00:29:43.358
You wanna get to--

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.850
AUDIENCE: I'm curious, and if
you are comfortable sharing--

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:53.695
if not, fine.

00:29:53.695 --> 00:29:55.320
But when you're
talking about that kind

00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:00.020
of global reservoir of anger,
did you find a source for it?

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.030
MICHAEL BROOKS: Yeah.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.000
There were a number
of sources for it.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:10.130
Mainly, it had to do with
fear and control and issues

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.337
around that.

00:30:11.337 --> 00:30:12.920
There were different
flavors in there.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.600
But when I would take
everything down to the core,

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.558
I could see there was
just a fear of something.

00:30:16.558 --> 00:30:19.200
And I would use anger as
a way to compensate for it

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.670
or to feel like I had control.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:25.220
The anger gave me control
over the situation.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.026
If I could be pissed off
at it, then it was OK.

00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:29.400
I didn't have to
be afraid of it.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.980
But then I had to
look at the fear.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.930
What does this fear
have to do with?

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.490
And that got to be very subtle
in different situations.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:39.790
Why did I care?

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.610
What was I afraid of?

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.540
We push away fear so much.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:49.742
And you have to take
it at your own time

00:30:49.742 --> 00:30:51.200
to be able to look
at these things.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.050
But that was the
core of really what

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.570
was going on with mine--
different variations

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:59.520
[INAUDIBLE] of fear, different
manifestations of it.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.340
But it was fascinating
when I would see it.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.870
And it had different
flavors to it,

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.660
but I was able to figure
out what the triggers were.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.130
Sometimes, it would
last for weeks on end,

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.640
because I was just
holding onto it.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.640
I couldn't let go of it.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.230
And part of it' like
the electric fence.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.720
You hold on and
you can't let go.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.160
So I had to ride it out.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.400
But it was very
difficult at first

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.340
trying to understand
it or figure it out,

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.815
but I kept continuing to
look, kept continuing to look.

00:31:27.815 --> 00:31:29.690
There are things that
you'll learn how to do.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.700
When you're in a
certain state of mind,

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.990
we often think that we're
stuck in that state of mind.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:35.955
So when I was stuck
in anger, I thought

00:31:35.955 --> 00:31:37.080
there was no way out of it.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.140
But there were tips and
tricks that I learned

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.360
to help break me out of anger.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.040
For me, movies are therapy.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.050
I go to a movie, and I go away.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.790
I get so involved in the movie
that I forget about my life.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:50.720
And you can try this.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.000
Everyone's got their thing.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.810
But before I went
into a movie, I'd

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:56.480
be in a certain state of mind,
certain state of attention.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.730
Usually, when I came out, I
was in a much better state

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:02.430
of attention, because I was
able to let go for a while.

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.510
There was a week straight
I want to move every night.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.940
It was just so bad.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.520
What time does the
next movie start?

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.490
And coming out of it,
I would be so clear.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.040
And I'd be like,
OK, now, I'm clear.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.117
Let me try and figure it out
one why I'm in a clear state.

00:32:16.117 --> 00:32:18.200
But then the next day, I
would indulge in it again

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.811
and bring it all back up.

00:32:20.811 --> 00:32:21.310
So yeah.

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.800
You figure out what
the triggers are,

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.940
what are the things that
help pull you out of it.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.882
I became very
strategic around it.

00:32:27.882 --> 00:32:29.590
Like I said, I went
hiking every weekend.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.620
That always cleared me out.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.540
That was always beautiful.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.664
And my god, here, please,
if you're not getting out

00:32:33.664 --> 00:32:37.910
every weekend to this
beautiful area that we live in,

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.650
please take time
to go into nature.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.630
It clears you out
so beautifully.

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:50.400
So you'll figure out your
things, your triggers, and then

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.797
what helps pull you out.

00:32:53.797 --> 00:32:56.130
It's fascinating, because
you'll feel the triggers start

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.630
to get pulled again, and once
you've kind of figured it out,

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.500
you don't have to pull it.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.280
But there's this
habit of just, oh, OK.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.630
Same thing happens
in meditation.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:12.080
And again, meditation
is a practice.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.300
I've been doing it 20 years.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.620
I'm no master by any means.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.450
But I'm light years
from where I started.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:17.710
You can get to a
point in meditation

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.020
where you're actually
able to get quiet.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.770
Again, you want a focal
point try and keep

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.750
your mind focused so it's not
indulging in all this chatter.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.105
And you can get to a point
where you're just still.

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:29.730
And again, it kind of goes back
to that everything's OK in that

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:30.792
moment.

00:33:30.792 --> 00:33:33.250
And you'll feel the urge to
start thinking about something,

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.755
and you just don't do it.

00:33:34.755 --> 00:33:36.320
You say, I don't have to do it.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.800
And you're able to just
stay there and hold onto it.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.109
And that's the most
beautiful feeling.

00:33:43.109 --> 00:33:43.650
So thank you.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:44.378
Good question.

00:33:44.378 --> 00:33:44.878
Yeah.

00:33:52.639 --> 00:33:53.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.480
So what's the difference
between clearing out,

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.000
like a hike or a movie,
versus distracting yourself

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.170
from actually acknowledging
what's going on in your head

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:04.070
and trying to pick it apart?

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:07.490
So instead of watching
TV on end and I

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.679
don't want to deal with
the right now versus,

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.159
OK, I just need
some time to relax

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.545
and then I go back to
not being a distraction?

00:34:15.545 --> 00:34:16.420
MICHAEL BROOKS: Yeah.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.947
We go through many
states of mind in a day.

00:34:24.947 --> 00:34:27.030
But sometimes, when we're
going through something,

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.250
there's just this
thread that stays there.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:33.010
So with me, that thread
of anger was always there.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:34.610
Yes, you need to take breaks.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.480
But even when I take a break,
that thread was still there.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.980
I could still feel
it panging at me.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.699
When I would go
to a movie, I was

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:46.460
able to stop it because
I was distracted.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.960
The movie distracted me.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.889
And I could just give my
attention to that fully,

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:54.860
be fully present, fully focus
on that, and I forgot about it.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.170
The thread went away.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:57.130
And so when I came
out, I'm like, oh,

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:58.180
the thread's not there.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.134
I'm clear.

00:34:59.134 --> 00:35:01.050
I'm in a clearer state
of attention right now.

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:04.770
Let's maybe spend
some time and maybe

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:06.809
examine it without
getting pulled back

00:35:06.809 --> 00:35:09.100
into it, which got to be
tricky, because once I started

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.270
to examine it, it would
come up-- process.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:16.930
So to me, taking a
break and clearing out

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:20.630
is to break that thread for
a little period of time.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:24.382
But yes, of course, take
care of yourself as well.

00:35:24.382 --> 00:35:26.090
It goes back to what
I mentioned earlier.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.590
You've got to have
the compassionate

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:31.180
with yourself and the
patience to just ride it out.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.746
But if you can figure out the
triggers that help pull you out

00:35:33.746 --> 00:35:38.110
of a state of mind-- and I
had a whole arsenal of things

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:43.140
after a while-- you
start to figure out

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.165
when you can use them and
when it's OK to kind of let

00:35:46.165 --> 00:35:47.520
that thread be there.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.516
Does that help?

00:35:48.516 --> 00:35:49.141
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:50.016
MICHAEL BROOKS: Yeah.

00:35:50.016 --> 00:35:51.400
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.440
MICHAEL BROOKS: Would
you mind passing it back?

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:52.940
Thanks.

00:35:55.335 --> 00:35:56.710
AUDIENCE: So when
you're thinking

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:59.770
about all these judgments and
expectations and things like

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:03.230
that, your mind's just
going kind of crazy,

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.154
what do you give
it to do instead?

00:36:05.154 --> 00:36:06.820
Because it's so used
to doing something,

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.200
you can say stop doing that,
but then it sits there,

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.070
and a second later, it comes up.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.670
And in meditation,
I know there's

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.750
so many things, but in
real life, what do you do?

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.220
You're in the shower, you know?

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:16.600
MICHAEL BROOKS: Yeah.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.525
Your mind has a mind
of its own, right?

00:36:18.525 --> 00:36:21.540
God bless it.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:30.850
Again, just to
clarify, this awareness

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:35.210
of what the chatter is-- again,
as I said, some of this stuff

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:39.910
is esoteric-- there's a
part of you that's just

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.410
aware of what the thoughts are.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:44.190
You can think of it like just
clouds passing over the sky.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.390
You're just watching it.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:47.234
Try not to evaluate
what you're thinking,

00:36:47.234 --> 00:36:48.150
which is tricky to do.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.440
But you just want to
be aware of what's

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.619
going on so you can figure
out the trends and patterns.

00:36:53.619 --> 00:36:55.160
So going back to
what you are, what's

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.380
going on when this
worry comes up?

00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.670
Am I around certain people?

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.169
Am I indulged in a
certain activity?

00:37:01.169 --> 00:37:01.976
What's happening?

00:37:01.976 --> 00:37:02.850
So that's part of it.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.360
The other part is
just trying to see,

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.818
wow, I'm making a
lot of judgments,

00:37:05.818 --> 00:37:08.490
or I'm doing a lot of
things with my mind.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:11.760
Some of the tips
that you can do,

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.380
some of the classical
mindfulness tricks

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:20.480
that you can use--
chanting is wonderful.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.749
And it doesn't need to be
some kind of spiritual chant.

00:37:23.749 --> 00:37:25.540
This was something else
that helped me when

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.330
I was in really dark states.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.860
I would just chant over and
over, I'm at peace I'm in love,

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.390
I'm at peace, I'm in love,
I'm at peace, I'm in love.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:33.140
I would do this for
like an hour and half.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.692
And I would try and put all
of my focus on chanting that.

00:37:35.692 --> 00:37:37.900
And the miraculous thing
was about an hour and a half

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.060
later, I felt such peace
and I felt such love.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.580
And I was able to
pop out of the anger.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.720
So that was one
thing that helped me.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.680
In the shower, you want
to-- classical mindfulness--

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.556
bring your awareness
to what you're doing.

00:37:50.556 --> 00:37:51.930
Feel the water
hitting your body.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:54.380
Try and take your attention,
what you're focusing on,

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.220
off of all the
chatter, if you can,

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.620
and focus on the water
hitting your body, your feet

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:05.900
on the cold tile, the color
of the tiles in the shower,

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:10.190
the speed of the water coming
out, the temperature of it.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:13.620
Trying to put your focus on
the external really helps.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:22.010
When you're trying to
be mindful all day,

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.771
you're not a zombie
in any way or state.

00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:28.020
Someone asked me at one
class, well, what did you did,

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.061
just stand there all day?

00:38:29.061 --> 00:38:30.355
I'm like, that would be great.

00:38:30.355 --> 00:38:31.410
Yeah, I love that.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:32.370
I've got a busy life.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.642
I can't do that.

00:38:33.642 --> 00:38:35.100
You're focused on
what you're doing

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.820
to the exclusion
of everything else.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.976
So if I'm writing an email, let
me focus on writing an email.

00:38:39.976 --> 00:38:41.850
Typically, when we sit
down to write an email

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:44.266
and we're just going to check
a web page three hours later

00:38:44.266 --> 00:38:46.110
and 200 websites
later, you're like,

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.734
oh, I was just going
to write an email.

00:38:47.734 --> 00:38:48.380
Crap.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.713
So it's this kind of discipline.

00:38:49.713 --> 00:38:51.190
Sit down and do
what I need to do.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.440
Focus on doing this one thing
to the exclusion of everything

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.090
else.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.010
It's trying to train
yourself away from scattered

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.770
and going all over the
place to just focus

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.230
on what you're doing.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.254
It's focus and concentration
not taught the world today, not

00:39:04.254 --> 00:39:05.420
fostered in the world today.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.160
We're distracted a
bazillion times a day

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.052
with our cellphones.

00:39:08.052 --> 00:39:09.510
I think they're
saying now, studies

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:13.660
are saying 50 to 100 times we
check our cellphones a day,

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.040
if not more.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.180
So we're distracted, right?

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.596
That's this world
that we live in.

00:39:17.596 --> 00:39:19.930
So to focus and
concentrate on something

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.930
can just be a little
weird sometimes.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:25.000
So it's just building
up the discipline

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.120
to stay focused on
what you're doing.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.362
Now, this was a
number of years ago

00:39:29.362 --> 00:39:31.900
that I was at a medical
device company down the road,

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.010
working with them.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.790
And I was doing that same thing.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:36.620
It was just loud.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.755
It was a loud day.

00:39:37.755 --> 00:39:39.469
And I'm like, OK,
chanting is not

00:39:39.469 --> 00:39:42.010
working, because after a while,
you chant the same thing over

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:43.700
and over, it kind
of loses its power

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.320
and you think you're chanting
but you're actually thinking

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.680
and it becomes this whole mess.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.850
So I'm like, OK, I need
to figure out something

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.910
else just to keep me
focused, to keep me

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:55.340
in this present awareness.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.570
So I don't know why
this came to me,

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.132
but I was walking
down this ugly hall

00:40:00.132 --> 00:40:02.590
and I just started chanting,
I'm walking down an ugly hall.

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:03.780
I'm walking down an ugly hall.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.030
I'm walking down an ugly hall.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.540
I am walking down an ugly hall.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.810
That's all I'm doing.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:11.270
Honestly, in that moment, I'm
just walking down an ugly hall.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:15.970
So chanting that made me
be present in that moment.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:18.620
I am just walking
down an ugly hall.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.420
That's all I'm doing.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.460
And chanting that just
drove me into that moment.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.922
I'm looking at an ugly plant.

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:26.130
I'm looking at an ugly plant.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.870
I don't need to judge, even
though I'm calling it ugly.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:30.360
It was a pretty ugly plant.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.125
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:33.125 --> 00:40:36.180
I was like, this
is what I'm doing.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.550
I'm just doing this.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:40.240
And that shifted
me in such a way.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.050
I couldn't deny it.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:43.742
And it really showed
me, wow, your mind

00:40:43.742 --> 00:40:44.950
is really all over the place.

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:45.970
Just do this.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.134
Just chant this,
what you're doing.

00:40:48.134 --> 00:40:49.300
I'm walking down the street.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.150
I'm washing the dishes.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.685
Washing the dishes, I think, is
classical mindfulness exercise.

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:57.060
But here, this is one of those
things where you're really

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.950
focused on the senses.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:01.100
You put away all the
judgments about washing dishes

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.630
and how much you'd rather just
put them in the dishwasher.

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.092
But you put the dishes up.

00:41:04.092 --> 00:41:05.550
And you look at
the pretty patterns

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.910
that the plates make with
all the food on them.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.270
And then you just focus.

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.056
You bring your focus
into this moment.

00:41:11.056 --> 00:41:12.680
All I'm going to do
is wash the dishes.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.240
And you focus on what you feel.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.310
You reach out.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:20.750
You feel the knob
on the sink faucet.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:21.250
You turn it.

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.166
You feel the pressure.

00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:25.410
You feel the muscles that
have to engage to do that.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:26.630
You watch the water come out.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:27.610
You feel the water get warmer.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:28.440
You put the soap in.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.610
You watch the bubbles come up.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:30.300
You smell the soap.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.150
You pick up the dishes.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.840
You put them in.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.840
You feel the suction as
they go under the water,

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.010
the movement of them, right?

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.610
You're forcing yourself
into that moment.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.130
And you can actually
say all this to yourself

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.713
while you're doing
it, because it just

00:41:39.713 --> 00:41:41.840
helps you get right there.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.424
And if you try this
exercise-- I don't

00:41:43.424 --> 00:41:45.048
know if you guys have
ever tried this--

00:41:45.048 --> 00:41:46.220
but it's very entertaining.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.540
It turns dish washing into a
totally different experience.

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.170
But that's always going on.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.250
Amazing experiences are
going on in every moment.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.291
We're just so caught up
in our head all the time,

00:41:56.291 --> 00:41:56.890
we miss them.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:58.140
It's just the smallest things.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.540
I remember walking out
after a rough day at work.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.360
And I would stop sometimes,
because the sunset

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.194
in front of me and the
trees, with the wind blowing

00:42:07.194 --> 00:42:08.610
through it and the
birds flying by

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:10.580
would just stop me in my tracks,
the most beautiful thing.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.038
And I'm like, I
see this every day,

00:42:12.038 --> 00:42:13.710
but oh my god,
this is beautiful.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:15.530
And so just giving
myself permission

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:20.730
to acknowledge that and
see that-- so it's a shift.

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:22.760
And it takes time.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.430
So you can come up
with different games.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.430
I have a number of things
in the book that help.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:28.013
But that was just
one of them, and one

00:42:28.013 --> 00:42:29.490
that was really
effective, which is

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:31.300
say what you're
doing to yourself.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.800
And you can't deny it
as you're chanting it.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.171
And it makes it OK, in a way.

00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:38.420
I don't need to be thinking
about these others things,

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:40.360
because really, I'm
giving my attention

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.586
to what I'm doing right now.

00:42:42.586 --> 00:42:43.210
Does that help?

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:43.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:44.090
Thank you.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.020
MICHAEL BROOKS:
Yeah, you're welcome.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:46.530
OK.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:47.415
Any other questions?

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.060
Oh, good.

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:06.720
AUDIENCE: So tax
season's coming up.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.540
So April 15th comes by.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:14.720
If I wasn't thinking about
the future to a certain extent

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.120
leading up to then, I'm going
to have kind of a difficult day.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:23.130
So do you have any advice for
arriving at a day like that

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:26.730
and having everything done while
staying present the whole time,

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.095
while planning for the future?

00:43:29.095 --> 00:43:29.970
MICHAEL BROOKS: Sure.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:30.470
Yeah.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:31.690
We've got to live our lives.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:33.420
There are things
that need to be done.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.890
The car needs to be gassed up.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:39.800
We need to go travel
to visit family.

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.430
We need to do these things.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:44.320
So again, it's not that you're
a zombie in any way, shape,

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.640
or form.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.300
On the weekend, I
sit down, and I've

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.840
got my desk full
of stuff that needs

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.480
to be done that I had put off.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.090
I said, OK, I'll focus
on it this weekend.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:55.770
Or I know, yeah, I'm starting
to get the W-2s in the mail,

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.440
so I need to start
looking at the tax

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.860
stuff, that time of year.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.990
So it's an awareness,
like a deadline.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:04.980
Of course, at work,
I've got this deadline.

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.380
So at this moment, let me plan
out when I'm going to do that.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.480
So planning is part
of being present,

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.160
to say, OK, I need to plan out--
I've got a deliverable here

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.360
and a deliverable there.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.160
Then I've got to rebuild it over
here or whatever. [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.290
tax season, or taxes
are due this day.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.990
When would be the just
right time to do that?

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.000
Let me schedule that
into my calendar.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.080
And then when that time
comes, OK, now, it's

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.910
time to work on the tax stuff.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:30.310
And it may get trumped.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:33.680
Project management--
things change every day.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.140
I have to reschedule,
gotta replan.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:35.640
OK.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.590
Let me replan.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:37.860
I'll do it at another time.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.700
So yeah, you've got to take time
to live your life and structure

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.890
things out, for sure.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.180
Again, you're not a zombie.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.990
There are things that you
have to get done in the world

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:50.410
and being and living in the
world to take care of them.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:55.930
So it's just planning how you
need to take care of things

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.240
in your life, really.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.160
Did that help?

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.341
OK.

00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:02.840
Yeah?

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.089
AUDIENCE: How do you
help other people?

00:45:08.089 --> 00:45:09.380
MICHAEL BROOKS: Oh, in general?

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.860
When you think about, I want
to be helpful to someone else,

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.284
how do you think about that?

00:45:15.284 --> 00:45:16.450
MICHAEL BROOKS: It's tricky.

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.699
Sometimes what we think is
helpful may not be helpful.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:25.820
You'll learn, especially
with mindfulness,

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:27.716
a tremendous amount of
gratitude and humility

00:45:27.716 --> 00:45:28.590
towards other people.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.840
You understand everyone's
fighting their own battle.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.910
You can think
about what can I do

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:36.740
that might help them, in a way?

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.930
And who am I to say that
I can help somebody?

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:40.700
Maybe I can, maybe I can't.

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.700
Maybe I'll say something
that helps them in a way.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:47.090
I think it's compassionate to be
there for them if they want you

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:49.720
to-- if they don't want you
to, being compassionate enough

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.640
to walk away from it.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.680
But I think honoring
people is the biggest

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.096
thing you can do
for other people,

00:45:56.096 --> 00:45:59.800
and understand that they're
fighting their own battle,

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:03.680
and if they want
help, helping them.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.017
It's nice to show gratitude
always for everything,

00:46:07.017 --> 00:46:07.725
whenever you can.

00:46:07.725 --> 00:46:12.090
And gratitude is one of the
best tools that we have.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.240
You can be helping somebody
just by thanking them

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.611
for doing something for you
or going out of your way

00:46:16.611 --> 00:46:19.110
to do something for them because
they did something for you,

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:22.360
or just going out of your way.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.250
You can help the guy at
the grocery checkout.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:27.530
He's standing there
for eight hours a day.

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:28.970
I would not want that job.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:32.660
So I can maybe help him
in a way by just cracking

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.800
a joke when I'm
with him or making

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.740
him smile for a moment
of that eight hours.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.009
But not doing it for me-- maybe
I can do something for them.

00:46:41.009 --> 00:46:43.050
And that's part of what
you have to look at, too,

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.160
part of this examination.

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:47.200
Is the motive to make me
feel better for myself

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.700
by helping them?

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.390
Or am I truly being
of service to them?

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:55.360
So there's the
egotistical I'm helping

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.950
or there's just the being
of service to somebody

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.010
without expecting
anything in return.

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.910
So again, how do we
really help anyone?

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:10.426
I think just being compassionate
as best we can is important.

00:47:10.426 --> 00:47:11.873
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:11.873 --> 00:47:13.414
I would just add
one comment to that.

00:47:13.414 --> 00:47:15.904
I try to do that kind
of thing every day

00:47:15.904 --> 00:47:21.876
here at Google, with all of
the people who serve us and do

00:47:21.876 --> 00:47:26.261
all the dirty work that makes
our life a lot easier day

00:47:26.261 --> 00:47:29.427
to day at Google-- driving
the bus, serving the food--

00:47:29.427 --> 00:47:33.810
all these roles that
you see around campus.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:37.219
Just saying a simple thank you,
or the meal was really tasty

00:47:37.219 --> 00:47:41.140
or whatever-- it does make a
difference in those people's

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:41.640
day.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.619
You can tell that
it matters to them.

00:47:45.619 --> 00:47:48.775
I find personal satisfaction
in helping them.

00:47:48.775 --> 00:47:49.816
MICHAEL BROOKS: Yeah, no.

00:47:49.816 --> 00:47:52.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it makes
me feel better about myself.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:52.530
MICHAEL BROOKS: Yeah.

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:54.363
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
somewhat self-serving.

00:47:54.363 --> 00:47:56.110
But I know that it's
helping them too.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:56.820
MICHAEL BROOKS: No,
there's definitely

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.570
a symbiosis that happens
there when you're doing.

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:00.260
It's selfless
giving, if you will.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.590
But being helping others,
just by saying that,

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.220
helps them and helps you.

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.820
It lightens you up, in a way.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:06.780
So yeah, no.

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:07.740
Good point.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.240
Yeah.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.490
AUDIENCE: So I actually don't
have a question for you.

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:13.430
But I just wanted-- I'm the
gPause program manager here

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.930
at Google.

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:15.780
It's our program for
building communities

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.510
of mindfulness practices here.

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:22.590
Is there anyone here who doesn't
know about the gPause program?

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:25.780
OK, well then-- oh.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.450
Well, since you're
the only one, you

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.616
could just talk to me later.

00:48:28.616 --> 00:48:31.860
But I just wanted to
say, in the vein of your

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.590
being mindful
throughout the day,

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:36.970
we had a mindfulness
week last month.

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:40.340
And we were giving out these
bands, which you can wear.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.860
They're Google-y color
bands that say gPause on it.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.360
If anyone would like one that
wasn't part of that week,

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.450
just see me afterwards.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:50.050
But that's something you
can use to remind yourself

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:52.450
throughout the day to do
things you were talking about.

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:54.464
MICHAEL BROOKS: Yeah,
those reminders are great.

00:48:54.464 --> 00:48:56.380
Yeah, and I don't know
if you caught at first.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.160
I really am amazed at what
this organization does

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.450
in terms of mindfulness and
meditation for the staff.

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:02.288
It's fantastic.

00:49:02.288 --> 00:49:03.954
AUDIENCE: We have
three meditation rooms

00:49:03.954 --> 00:49:05.662
at the back of this
building, by the way.

00:49:05.662 --> 00:49:08.932
And there's a guided, there's
a led sit at 11:30 every day

00:49:08.932 --> 00:49:10.950
[INAUDIBLE], just
in this building,

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:12.076
but also all across campus.

00:49:12.076 --> 00:49:12.950
MICHAEL BROOKS: Yeah.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:15.240
And I hope that catches
on at more organizations.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:19.450
I hope to see more
of it in the world.

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:21.530
AUDIENCE: Just a
quick question--

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:26.070
I'm sure you have lots of
tricks and tips in your books.

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:29.220
But I think one of the
questions or one of the things

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:33.450
which is bugging me is
if you have this churn

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:38.780
and you are thinking, you have
easy things you can probably

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:39.930
pull yourself out.

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:45.380
But what happens when you
are in a spur of the moment--

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:49.550
your experience, you get angry
easily, so when you get angry,

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:50.450
you get angry.

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:53.110
So do you have any
tip for that, things

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.610
which happen in
spur of the moment,

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.820
where you really don't have
time to do this observation

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.425
or pull yourself out?

00:49:59.425 --> 00:50:01.550
MICHAEL BROOKS: Too busy
being angry to do anything

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:06.025
about my angry-- I don't know
if there's anything specifically

00:50:06.025 --> 00:50:07.510
that you can do.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:09.700
You can recognize
what's happening.

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.510
That's important.

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:14.090
Most of the time, I didn't
realize what was going on.

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:17.450
It was, again, back of my mind.

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.110
The recognition that
it's happening--

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:22.160
and if there's something you
can do to try and calm yourself

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.260
down, or if there are any other
tips that you come up to help

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.590
temper it, or get out
of that situation.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:32.180
If it's getting to
a detrimental point,

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:37.435
exit the situation as best you
can, and as cleanly as you can.

00:50:37.435 --> 00:50:39.949
If you can see-- and I would
see this with the anger--

00:50:39.949 --> 00:50:41.490
that it would go
down a certain road.

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:42.740
Once you notice that
there's a pattern,

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.073
it's going to go down this road.

00:50:44.073 --> 00:50:46.030
OK, let's change the course.

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:47.930
Let's just not do it.

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:51.740
So if it's an encounter
or maybe a relationship

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.720
with a certain person that
always gets very tense,

00:50:54.720 --> 00:51:00.010
then just try not to
get into that situation.

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:05.220
A, avoid the situation until
you get a better handle over it

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:07.364
and what's going on.

00:51:07.364 --> 00:51:09.780
But two, if you see that it's
kind of going down that path

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.790
and you have an exit,
then try and exit,

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:16.030
get away from it, until
you're able to look at more

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:18.467
and maybe defuse it somewhat.

00:51:18.467 --> 00:51:20.800
But it's also good to see,
once you've recognize a habit

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.990
and you're trying things, to
go into that situation and see,

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:23.740
is working or not?

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.036
OK, that didn't help.

00:51:25.036 --> 00:51:26.160
I went down the path again.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.110
Let's come back and try again.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:30.340
Let's figure out something else.

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.300
I think it is really trial
and error for whatever

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:36.180
your unique circumstance is.

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.680
But awareness is
the biggest key.

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.140
The fact that you're aware of
what's going on-- same thing

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:41.880
with meditation.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.160
You've got to be aware.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.610
Most of the time, we're unaware.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:46.180
We're on auto pilot.

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.930
It's just going its
own course But the fact

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:51.180
that you're aware of it is
a tremendously wonderful

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:52.590
good first step.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.010
At least you're aware.

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.110
And that awareness
will deepen over time.

00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:59.606
You'll become more and
more aware over time.

00:51:59.606 --> 00:52:01.110
So thank you.

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:09.030
AUDIENCE: So for someone who
wants to get into meditation,

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:11.882
what do you think about
camps like the vipassana camp

00:52:11.882 --> 00:52:14.090
or something, where you go
away for a week or 10 days

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:16.660
and you just focus on
that versus just getting

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:19.135
into it slowly and slowly?

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:21.010
MICHAEL BROOKS: I haven't
tried one of those.

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:27.160
If it resonates with
you, give it a shot.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:29.410
I know there are people that
go away on trips to India

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:33.360
or something for meditation,
and it really helps them.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:39.340
And I hear it's also very
painful to go through it.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.280
Sometimes, for me, silent
meditation technique

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.820
is the most difficult
one out there.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:46.140
I don't recommend
it to start with.

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:52.300
But only you know your own pace
and what you're willing to do.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.260
If you're OK being
somewhere for a week

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.175
and really just gutting
through it, that's great.

00:52:57.175 --> 00:52:59.550
But if you have a pattern of
trying to gut through things

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:01.360
and giving up and
walking away, then I

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.450
don't recommend doing it.

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:05.430
Again, understand what
your patterns are.

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:07.590
I think it's good, first,
before just jumping

00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:11.590
in somewhere for a week, go to
a couple of meditation classes.

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:14.824
In fact, try a couple out.

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:16.490
Try a couple of
techniques out, a couple

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:17.800
of locations, because
you want to find

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.010
one that resonates with you.

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:20.509
If you're stuck
somewhere for a week

00:53:20.509 --> 00:53:22.160
and it doesn't
resonate with you,

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.610
that's just going to be torture.

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:25.552
But if you can find
vipassana or something

00:53:25.552 --> 00:53:28.010
along those lines where it's
kind of speaking to you, like,

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.910
OK, this is working for me,
try that a number of times.

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:33.346
And then maybe go for a week.

00:53:33.346 --> 00:53:34.970
But a full immersion
for week somewhere

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:37.260
where you don't know-- that
could be really tricky.

00:53:41.842 --> 00:53:42.675
Any other questions?

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:45.990
OK.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.820
So the one thing that I
say take away from this

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.380
is as I was just saying,
just start becoming

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:54.800
aware of what you're thinking.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.970
Just start paying attention
to what's going on.

00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:01.030
And have the belief that you
can get to more quiet, more

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:02.280
peaceful states of mind.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.390
But it is a process.

00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:05.430
You don't need to be
perfect now or tomorrow.

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:06.930
What is perfect?

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:09.450
It's a journey
with no end to it.

00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:11.050
But there's a deepening
with all of it

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.010
as well, a beauty in that.

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:15.590
So moments of quiet
and meditation,

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:17.731
they just deepen over
time-- the beauty and peace

00:54:17.731 --> 00:54:21.110
that you can experience in
meditation and in mindfulness.

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:23.340
In the most weird situation,
walking in the mall,

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.360
you can be like, wow,
this is beautiful.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.620
This mall is amazing.

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.700
The colors, the lights, the
sounds, the people, big circus,

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:35.320
but-- the world can become
very magical for you.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:38.180
But just start paying
attention to what's going on.

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.220
And then start to navigate that.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:43.930
And slowly start
to deconstruct it.

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:46.507
The book that I wrote,
it is available.

00:54:46.507 --> 00:54:48.090
Allen's got some at
the back if you're

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:49.640
interested in buying one.

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.640
But they're on Amazon.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.110
It's on Kindle, all of
the electronic versions.

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:56.530
I do have a website,
thisonlythis.com.

00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:59.450
I do post memes and
sections from the book.

00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:02.430
I've done a couple of radio
interviews, podcast interviews.

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:04.140
So those are all
up on the website

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:06.390
if you want more information.

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:09.530
And you can also email
me through that, as well,

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:10.890
if you have interest.

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:12.157
So thank you for your time.

00:55:12.157 --> 00:55:13.990
I greatly appreciate
it, you coming out here

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:15.410
and spending your
time with me, not

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:17.450
really knowing what I was
going to talk about except

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:18.116
for mindfulness.

00:55:18.116 --> 00:55:21.069
So I appreciate that time, and
the questions very much so.

00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:22.610
And if you have
additional questions,

00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:23.930
feel free to stay after.

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:25.490
I'd love to talk to you more.

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.990
All right.

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.780
Thank you.

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:29.830
